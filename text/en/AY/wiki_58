<text>Quintana Roo, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Quintana Roo, is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, constitute the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It is divided into 11 municipalities, and its capital city is Chetumal.

Quintana Roo is located on the eastern part of the Yucatán Peninsula and is bordered by the states of Campeche to the west and Yucatán to the northwest, and by the Orange Walk and Corozal districts of Belize, along with an offshore borderline with Belize District to the south. As Mexico&#x27;s easternmost state, Quintana Roo has a coastline to the east with the Caribbean Sea and to the north with the Gulf of Mexico. The state previously covered and shared a small border with Guatemala in the southwest of the state. However, in 2013, Mexico&#x27;s Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation resolved the boundary dispute between Quintana Roo, Campeche, and Yucatán stemming from the creation of the Calakmul municipality by Campeche in 1997, siding with Campeche and thereby benefiting Yucatán.

Quintana Roo is the home of the city of Cancún, the islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres, and the towns of Bacalar, Playa del Carmen and Akumal, as well as the ancient Maya ruins of Chacchoben, Cobá, Kohunlich, Muyil, Tulum, Xel-Há, San Gervasio and Xcaret. The Sian Ka&#x27;an biosphere reserve is also located in the state. The statewide population is expanding at a rapid rate due to the construction of hotels and the demand for workers. Many migrants come from Yucatán, Campeche, Tabasco, and Veracruz. The state is frequently hit by severe hurricanes due to its exposed location, the most recent and severe being Hurricane Dean in 2007, which made landfall with sustained winds of , with gusts up to .

==History==

The area that makes up modern Quintana Roo was long part of Yucatán, sharing its history. With the Caste War of Yucatán, which started in the 1840s, all non-natives were driven from the region. The independent Maya nation of Chan Santa Cruz was based on what is now the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. For decades, it maintained considerable independence, having separate trade and treaty relationships with British Honduras, now Belize.

The Territory of Quintana Roo was created by decree of President Porfirio Díaz on November 24, 1902. It was named after an early patriot of the Mexican Republic, Andrés Quintana Roo. The Mexican Federal Army succeeded in subjugating most of the indigenous Maya population of the region during the 1910s. In 1913, the area was again declared to be legally part of the state of Yucatán, but was again declared a separate territory in 1915. The territory of Quintana Roo was granted statehood within the United Mexican States on October 8, 1974.

In the last quarter of the 20th century and continuing into the 21st, Quintana Roo developed rapidly, with tourism being a driving force, notably with the development of Cancún. As result of this development te northern part of Quintana Roo has been increasingly touristified. By contrast the south has continued with a traditional economy of forestry and wood extraction.

=== Archaeological findings ===
Ancient human remains have been discovered in a system of submerged caves and sinkholes in the Tulum area of Quintana Roo. To date, a total of nine skeletons have been found in these caves, including one of the oldest human skeletons found on the American continent. In 2016, underwater archaeological exploration of a cave known as Chan Hol found a skeleton of a female who lived in the region at least 9,900 years ago, during the Paleo-Indian period. Dating revealed that the skeleton was probably about 30 years old at the time of death. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken. Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of syphilis.

According to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, &quot;It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life. Obviously, this is speculative, but given the traumas and the pathological deformations on her skull, it appears a likely scenario that she may have been expelled from her group and was killed in the cave, or was left in the cave to die there”.

The skeleton found by the 2016 exploration was away from a site where a previous expedition found human remains known as Chan Hol 2. Although archaeologists assumed the 2016 expedition had rediscovered Chan Hol 2, Stinnesbeck concluded that the two skeletons represent different individuals.

Due to their distinctive features, study co-researcher Samuel Rennie suggest the existence of at least two morphologically diverse groups of people living separately in Mexico during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene.

==Geography==

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, much of the state has a tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) while the island of Cozumel has a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). The mean annual temperature is . The hottest months are April and August, in which the average high is , while January is the coldest month with an average low of . Extreme temperatures can range from a low of in the coldest months to in the hottest months. Quintana Roo averages of precipitation per year, which falls throughout the year, though June to October are the wetter months. Hurricanes can occasionally hit the coastal areas during the hurricane season, particularly from September to November. 2020 was a historic year for hurricanes in Quintana Roo, with a record-breaking 31 tropical systems formed, of which four affected the state.

===Wildlife===


===Biotic situation of the Yucatán Peninsula===
The Yucatán Peninsula is one of the most forested areas of the world in terms of biotic mass per hectare. However, anthropological, biological and governmental experts have determined that Quintana Roo is &#x27;facing a faunal crisis&#x27;. Many medium to large game animals are disappearing due to hunting and habitat loss. While its population is relatively small, Quintana Roo is experiencing both a population influx and an increase in tourism. This only increases the pressure on the plants and animals native to the area.

===Ecosystems and animals===
There are four generalized ecosystems in Quintana Roo—tropical forests, or jungle; savanna, mangrove forests, and coral reefs. One of the byproducts of traditional and large-scale agriculture is the creation of additional habitats, such as second growth forests and fields/pastures. Tourism has caused Quintana Roo to become famous around the world in the last thirty or so years for its beaches, coastline, and cenote sinkholes. Biological experts consider the coastline of Quintana Roo one of the best manatee habitats worldwide. Queen conchs are also noted for their inhabitation of coastal territory. The wide variety of biotic organisms such as these has decreased drastically in the last fifteen years.

===Birds===
Also affected by the loss of habitat due to both agriculture and development, birds are one of the region&#x27;s most varied animal assets. Hundreds of species reside in Quintana Roo permanently, with hundreds of others either wintering there or using it as a stopover on the long journey into South America. As a result, many birders come to the area annually in search of the rare and unexpected.

==Demographics==

==Municipalities==

The State of Quintana Roo is divided into 11 municipalities (), each headed by a municipal president:

*Bacalar
*Benito Juárez
*Othón P. Blanco
*Puerto Morelos
*Cozumel
*Felipe Carrillo Puerto
*Isla Mujeres
*Solidaridad
*Tulum
*José María Morelos
*Lázaro Cárdenas
==Tourism==


Quintana Roo&#x27;s tourist boom began in the 1970s. Tourism resulted in the development of coastal hotels and resorts, in addition to ecotourism inland and in coastal regions, which have increased the development of the region as well as the gross domestic product. Quintana Roo ranks sixth among Mexican states according to the United Nations Human Development index (HDI).

The Riviera Maya is located along the Caribbean coastline, including Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Morelos, Akumal and Cozumel.

There are a number of Mayan archeological sites in Quintana Roo, including Chacchoben, Coba, Kohunlich, Muyil, San Gervasio, Tulum, Xcaret, Xelha, and Yo&#x27;okop.

Projections for the tourism economy of Quintana Roo have been optimistic, based on multiple attractions, from the Maya ruins to the lush forests and beautiful beaches. However, long-term problems include the effect on the local environment, economic stresses of development and population, and &quot;economic marginalization&quot; of the Maya natives.

==Education==
===Universities===
*Instituto Tecnológico de Cancún, Cancún
*Instituto Tecnológico de Chetumal, Chetumal
*University of Quintana Roo, Chetumal
*Intercultural Maya University of Quintana Roo, José María Morelos
*Universidad Anáhuac Cancún, Cancún
*Universidad del Caribe, Cancún
*Universidad Tecnológica de la Riviera Maya, Playa del Carmen
*Universidad La Salle Cancún, Cancún
*Universidad TecMilenio, Cancún

==Media==
Newspapers of Quintana Roo include: &quot;Diario de Quintana Roo&quot;, &quot;Diario Respuesta&quot;, &quot;El Periódico de Quintana Roo&quot;, &quot;El Quintanarroense&quot;, &quot;Novedades de Quintana Roo&quot;, and &quot;Por Esto!&quot; 

==Sports==
Soccer club Atlante F.C. was founded in 1916 in Mexico City and moved to Cancun in 2007 due to poor attendance. The club announced a return to Mexico City in 2020, concurrently with the relocation of Cafetaleros de Chiapas to Cancún and its rebranding as Cancún F.C. They play in the Mexican second division Liga de Expansión MX at Estadio Andrés Quintana Roo.

In addition to soccer, the city has a professional baseball team, the Quintana Roo Tigers, which began playing at the Estadio de Béisbol Beto Ávila in Cancún in the 2006 season. The Tigers made it to the Mexican League series (analogous to MLB&#x27;s World Series) in 2009, but lost to the Saraperos de Saltillo 4 games to 2.

==Time zone==
On February 1, 2015, Quintana Roo officially adopted a new time zone, Southeastern, which is five hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−05:00). Quintana Roo does not observe daylight saving time, so Southeastern Time is constant throughout the year. Southeastern Time (ST) is the same as Eastern Standard Time (EST) and Central Daylight Time (CDT). This means that in the winter, Quintana Roo has the same time as regions observing EST, such as the eastern U.S., eastern Canada, Cuba, and Jamaica; and in the summer, Quintana Roo has the same time as regions observing CDT, such as central Mexico.

Quintana Roo changed to Southeastern Time for economic reasons, including:

* Allowing tourists in areas such as Cancún, Cozumel, and Playa del Carmen to spend more time (and money) at beaches, restaurants, historic sites, and other venues.
* Reducing electricity usage by hotels, restaurants, and other facilities.

Before Quintana Roo adopted the Southeastern time zone (officially referred to as &quot;zona sureste&quot; in Mexico), it had been part of the Central time zone (&quot;zona centro&quot;).

<text>The Vaal River ( ; Khoemana: ) is the largest tributary of the Orange River in South Africa. The river has its source near Breyten in Mpumalanga province, east of Johannesburg and about north of Ermelo and only about from the Indian Ocean. It then flows westwards to its confluence with the Orange River southwest of Kimberley in the Northern Cape. It is long, and forms the border between Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Province on its north bank, and the Free State on its south.

It is the third largest river in South Africa after the Orange River (2200 km long) and the Limpopo River (1750 km long) and was established as the main source of water for the great Witswatersrand area after the 19th century gold rush. The Vaal Dam lies on the Vaal River in Deneysville just south of the border between Gauteng and the Free State. The Vaal River is the longest river wholly within the borders of South Africa.

&quot;Vaal&quot; is a Dutch name (later Afrikaans), translated by the Griquas or Boers from an earlier Kora Khoekhoe or !Orakobab name, sometimes spelled as &quot;Tky-Gariep&quot; (in Khoekhoegowab orthography it is &quot;ǀHai!garib&quot;, drab river).
Both Vaal and &quot;Tky&quot; (in modern orthography ǀHai) mean &quot;drab&quot; or &quot;dull&quot;, which alludes to the colour of the waters, especially noticeable during flood season when the river is laden with silt. In the upper reaches the river was named &quot;iLigwa&quot; (Sindebele), &quot;Ikwa or Igwa&quot; (isiZulu), &quot;ilikwa&quot; (siSwati), &quot;lekwa&quot; (Sesotho), or &quot;cuoa&quot; by the Khoikhoi, all referring to the plain it traverses.

==History==
Historically, the river formed the northern border of Moshoeshoe I&#x27;s Basotho kingdom at its height in the mid-19th century, then became the boundary between two Boer republics: The South African Republic (later the Transvaal province) and the Orange Free State. The geographic name &quot;Transvaal&quot; comes from the name of this river, meaning &quot;beyond the Vaal river&quot;. This was in respect to the Cape Colony and Natal, which were the main areas of European settlement at the time, and which lay south of the Vaal.

During the late 19th century, there was an influx of people migrating to the Witwatersrand in search of gold. The Vaal River would eventually become the main water source for the Witwatersrand. The growing population initially used water from the groundwater of the Zuurbekom Wells in Gauteng&#x27;s West Rand. Eventually these would dry up and people would need a new source that could provide for their domestic, agricultural and industrial activities.

Water schemes were initially established by the private sector to deal with the growing demand. These included the Braamfontein Water Company&#x27;s Vierfontein Syndicate of 1893 and the Sivewright Concession of 1887 by the Johannesburg Waterworks and Exploration Company. Water was expensive and largely inaccessible for most inhabitants.

===Rand Water Board===

The Rand Water Board was established in 1903 to take over the operations of the private sector with a mandate to investigate sustainable water supply and sanitation services. The organisation would become fully operational in 1905, supplying water in bulk to the Witwatersrand. The organisation&#x27;s members included officials from the Johannesburg Town Council, The Chamber of Mines and other local authorities within the Witwatersrand.

Rand Water responded to water scarcity by imposing restrictions on Witwatersrand inhabitants in 1913. It also developed major water schemes that would respond to the growing demand. Between 1914 and 1998, the organisation partnered with various government and private entities to drive the Vaal River scheme and the barrage (1914–1924). The Vaal River scheme was an initiative established to manage water distribution. The Rand Water board also established the Vereeniging Pumping Station (1924), the Zwartkopjes Pumping Station, the Vaal Dam (1938), the Zuikerbosch Pumping Station (1949) and the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (1998).

==River Basin==
Rain and underground water collects in pans, vleis and streams and where these connect, the westward flowing Vaal River is born. The river flows west into the Grootdraai Dam near Standerton, Mpumalanga. On its course to the Vaal Dam in Vereeniging, the river is joined by a number of tributaries. The Little Vaal River starts in an escarpment near Ermelo. Near Memel in the Free State is where the Klip River begins. The Watervals River begins in Secunda, Mpumalanga. The Wilge River used to meet the Vaal River before the Vaal Dam was built in 1938; now the water flows straight into the dam. Kromelmboogspruit joins the Vaal near the Vaal Barrage.

===Vaal Dam===


Since the Vaal River&#x27;s surface runoff is erratic, large dams have been built along its course to collect the water. In the past, before the river was established as the official source of water for part of the Gauteng, several small dams were built by farmers for irrigation.

When the construction of the Vaal Dam was completed in 1938, the dam ensured the supply of water throughout each year even when the river was not full. The dam would receive water from different catchment areas through various projects.

===Tugela-Vaal Transfer Scheme===

Two water transfer schemes were developed to supply the economic heartland
of the country (then recognised as the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging
complex) by channelling water into the Vaal River from other catchment areas between the 1970s and 1990s. These include the Lesotho Highlands Water Project and KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s Tugela-Vaal Water Transfer Scheme. The Tugela-Vaal Transfer Scheme was completed in 1974 to transfer from the Tugela River in KwaZulu Natal via canals, pipelines and dams into the Vaal River system 

===Lesotho Highlands Water Project===

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project was finally launched in 1997 and would entail a three-phase construction that would augment water from Lesotho into the Vaal River, including four major dams. From 1954, the Natural Resources Development Council proposed that South Africa receive some water from neighbouring Lesotho. Negotiations between the two countries started in the late 1970s. A treaty for the development of the scheme was signed on 24 October 1987 by representatives of Lesotho, South Africa, the European Union, United Nations and the World Bank. It was then estimated to cost R9.1 billion for the first phase of the project alone.

South Africa pays R150 million to Lesotho each year whether they use all of the water that is supplied or not.

===Basin ecology===
According to Hogan the headwaters portion of the basin supports high endemism in reptiles, and lower in the watershed are elevated levels of endemism for small mammals.

==Industry and agriculture==
Water is drawn from the Vaal to meet the industrial needs of the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area and a large part of the Free State. In 1881 the Kimberley Waterworks Company, provided water from the Vaal to the Cape Diamond Fields at a cost of one shilling per .

As a part of the Vaal-Hartz Scheme it is a major source of water for irrigation. Water drawn from the Vaal supports 12 million consumers in Gauteng and surrounding areas.

==Current uses== 
The majority of the Vaal River water upstream of the Vaal Dam is used for mining and industrial use such as coal mines and Sasol&#x27;s energy and chemical-related activities, as well as urban use and power generation. Further downstream of the dam, water is mostly dedicated to urban requirements and, although proportionally less, a considerable amount of this section is also used for mining and industries, irrigation and power generation. The river regularly experiences pollution of its upper reaches, and this affects users downstream. During 2019 the Lekwa Local Municipality&#x27;s main water treatment plant in Standerton was in disrepair and was causing chronic pollution problems. To assist users downstream, clean water had to be pumped into the river to dilute its high salt levels, thereby wasting a large quantity of this scarce resource. In 2021, a report released by the South African Human Rights Commission found the river to be polluted beyond acceptable levels, including the flow of raw sewerage into the River. 

==Tourism==
The Vaal River is made up of 50 km of navigable water. The river basin thus offers a range of leisurely water activities that attract local and international tourists throughout the year. Activities include boating, yachting and water skiing.

Deneysville is a town on the Free State side of the Vaal River and is a popular water-centre where visitors can enjoy swimming, kiteboarding, yachting, boating, catamaran cruising, jet skiing, windsurfing, snorkelling and fishing.

<text>A ballot is a device used to cast votes in an election and may be found as a piece of paper or a small ball used in voting. It was originally a small ball (see blackballing) used to record decisions made by voters in Italy around the 16th century.

Each voter uses one ballot, and ballots are not shared. In the simplest elections, a ballot may be a simple scrap of paper on which each voter writes in the name of a candidate, but governmental elections use pre-printed ballots to protect the secrecy of the votes. The voter casts their ballot in a box at a polling station.

In British English, this is usually called a &quot;ballot paper&quot;. The word &quot;ballot&quot; is used for an election process within an organization (such as a trade union &quot;holding a ballot&quot; of its members).

==Etymology==
The word ballot comes from Italian &quot;ballotta&quot;, meaning a &quot;small ball used in voting&quot; or a &quot;secret vote taken by ballots&quot; in Venice, Italy.

==History==
In ancient Greece, citizens used pieces of broken pottery to scratch in the name of the target of the ostracism.

The first use of paper ballots to conduct an election appears to have been in Rome in 139 BC, following the introduction of the lex Gabinia tabellaria.

In ancient India, around 920 AD, in Tamil Nadu, palm leaves were used for village assembly elections. The palm leaves with candidate names were put inside a mud pot for counting. This was called &quot;Kudavolai&quot; system.

The first use of paper ballots in America was in 1629 within the Massachusetts Bay Colony to select a pastor for the Salem Church. Paper ballots were pieces of paper marked and supplied by voters.

Before the introduction of the secret ballot, American political parties distributed ballots listing their own candidates for party supporters to deposit in ballot boxes.

==Types of voting systems==
Depending on the type of voting system used in the election, different ballots may be used. Ranked ballots allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference, while ballots for first-past-the-post systems only allow voters to select one candidate for each position. In party-list systems, lists may be open or closed.

==Design==
Ballot design can aid or inhibit clarity in an election. Poor designs lead to confusion and potentially chaos if large numbers of voters spoil or mismark a ballot. The &quot;butterfly ballot&quot; used in the Palm Beach County, Florida 2000 U.S. presidential election (a ballot paper that has names down both sides, with a single column of punch holes in the center, which has been likened to a maze) led to widespread allegations of mismarked ballots. The ballot was designed to have a larger print, making it easier for the elderly voters of Palm Beach to read, but instead, it led to the names of candidates being alternately offset, with lines on both sides of each punch hole, creating confusion. The butterfly ballot is credited with tipping the 2000 U.S. presidential election to George W. Bush. 

==Methods==
In a jurisdiction using an all-paper system, voters choose by marking a ballot or, as in the case of Israel and France, picking one premarked ballot among many. In most jurisdictions the ballots are preprinted with names of candidates and the text of the referendums. Japan is an exception, requiring voters to write candidate names on the ballot. Election officials manually count the ballots after the polls close and may recount them in the event of a dispute.

In a jurisdiction using an optical scan voting system, voters choose by filling an oval, by completing an arrow, or (as in South Korea) by stamping a box, on the printed ballot next to their chosen option, similar to many standardized tests. Voters with disabilities may be provided with electronic ballot marking devices. 

Alternatively, voters could pick from one pre-marked ballot among many (similar to the paper ballot systems in Israel and France), which would then be scanned by an optical scanner. Tabulating machines count the ballots either after the polls close or as the voters feed the ballots into the machine, in which case the results are not known until after the polls close. Officials will often manually count any ballots that cannot be read or with a write-in candidate and may recount all ballots in the event of a dispute.

In a jurisdiction using a punched card system, voters choose by removing or &quot;punching out&quot; a perforated chad from the ballot next to each choice, sometimes with tools as simple as a pin, but usually with a ballot marking device such as the Votomatic. The ballot may be preprinted with candidates and referendums, or may be a generic ballot placed under a printed list of candidates and referendums. Tabulating machines count ballots after the polls close. Officials may manually count the ballots in the event of a dispute. Punched card voting systems are being replaced by other voting systems because of a high rate of inaccuracy related to the incomplete removal of the perforated chad and the inaccessibility to voters with disabilities.

In a jurisdiction using a mechanical voting system, often called a &quot;voting machine&quot;, voters choose by pulling a lever next to their choice. There is a printed list of candidates, parties and referendums next to the levers indicating which lever is assigned to which choice. When the voter pulls a lever, it turns a connected gear in the machine, which turns a counter wheel. Each counter wheel shows a number, which is the number of votes cast using that lever. After the polls close, election officials check the wheels&#x27; positions and record the totals. No physical ballot is used in this system, except when the voter chooses to write-in a candidate. Other systems are replacing mechanical voting systems because they are inaccessible to disabled voters, do not have a physical ballot, or are getting old.

In a jurisdiction using an electronic direct record voting system (DRE), voters choose by pushing a button next to a printed list of candidates and referendums, or by touching the candidate or referendums box on a touchscreen interface, or (as in Brazil) by inputting alphanumeric codes that correspond to candidates or positions. As the voter makes a selection, the DRE creates an electronic ballot stored in the memory components of the system. After the polls close, the system counts the votes and reports the totals to the election officials. Many DREs include a communication device to transmit vote totals to a central tabulator. The touchscreen systems are similar to an automated teller machine (ATM).

Most DRE voting machines in the U.S. now include an auditable paper ballot, a widely accepted best practice for election administration. After voters register their choices on the touchscreen, a paper ballot is created with the choices printed on it. The voter visually verifies that the choices are correct, then inserts the paper ballot into a secure box where ballots are accumulated for use in audits or recounts. 

As of the 2024 US general election, only 1.4 percent of voters use DRE machines without a paper record, including the entire state of Louisiana.

<doc id="193557" wikidata="Q76743491" url="?curid=193557" title="Seasons in the Sun">
<text>Seasons in the Sun is an English-language adaptation of the 1961 Belgian song  (&quot;The Dying Man&quot;) by singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, with lyrics rewritten in 1963 by singer-poet Rod McKuen, depicting a dying man&#x27;s farewell to his loved ones. It became a worldwide hit in 1974 for singer Terry Jacks and reached Christmas number one in the UK in 1999 for Westlife.

==Background and lyrics== 
The first version of the song was recorded by Brel. Set to a marching rhythm, it tells the story of a man dying of a broken heart, as he bids farewell first to his close friend Emile, then to a priest, followed by an acquaintance named Antoine, and finally to his wife, who has cheated on him numerous times with Antoine. Despite being aware of Antoine&#x27;s role as his wife&#x27;s lover, he wishes him no ill and instead asks him to take care of her. American Rod McKuen translated the lyrics into English. In 1964, the Kingston Trio became the first to record an English version of &quot;Seasons in the Sun,&quot; which was later heard by Terry Jacks and served as the foundation for his rendition.

Jacks altered nearly one-sixth of McKuen&#x27;s lyrics, later claiming that all of the words were his own. He considered the original version and its translations to be &quot;too macabre.&quot; The inspiration for the rewritten lyrics came from his close friend Roger, who was suffering from acute leukemia and passed away four months later. Jacks&#x27;s rendition, later dedicated to his friend, features the dying man (in the spring season) delivering his last words to his loved ones with whom he shared his life, echoing the themes of the original. However, unlike Brel&#x27;s version, the man does not die heartbroken; instead, he reflects on the rights and wrongs of his actions in life as he passes away peacefully.

In the rewritten version, the man first addresses a close friend he has known since childhood, reminiscing about the happy times they shared, such as playing and studying together (&quot;climbed hills and trees,&quot; &quot;learned of love and ABC&#x27;s&quot;) and their friendships with others (&quot;skinned our hearts and skinned our knees&quot;). He then turns to his father, who endeavored to provide him with a good upbringing and exert a positive influence on his undisciplined life (&quot;I was the black sheep of the family,&quot; &quot;You tried to teach me right from wrong,&quot; &quot;wonder how I got along&quot;), which included overindulgence, vices, and revelry (&quot;too much wine and too much song&quot;). Finally, the man addresses a &quot;little one&quot; named &quot;Michelle,&quot; recounting how she had lifted his spirits during times of despair. At the end of each verse, he reassures all three that he is always present in spirit when they visit familiar places or encounter certain people.

== Recording == 
According to Jacks, the Beach Boys asked him to be their producer during the sessions for the band&#x27;s album &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. On 31 July 1970, they attempted a rendition of &quot;Seasons in the Sun,&quot; but the session did not go well, and the track was never completed. Later, Mike Love told an interviewer: &quot;We did record a version [of &#x27;Seasons&#x27;] but it was so wimpy we had to throw it out. ... It was just the wrong song for us.&quot; The recording remained unreleased until the 2021 compilation &quot;Feel Flows&quot;.

Jacks recorded his rendition in Vancouver in 1973. The piano arpeggio parts and double bass parts in the third verse were performed by a young David Foster.

==Release==
Jacks released his version as a single in 1973 under his own label, Goldfish Records. The B-side featured &quot;Put the Bone In,&quot; an original composition about burying a deceased pet dog. The single quickly topped the record charts in the US (where it was released on Bell Records), Canada, and the UK, selling over 14 million copies worldwide.

Jacks&#x27;s version was released in the United States in December 1973 and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 a month later. On 2 March 1974, the song began a three-week run at number one atop the Hot 100 and remained in the top 40 until nearly Memorial Day weekend. Jacks&#x27;s version also spent one week on the Easy Listening charts. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the number two song for 1974. Although he released several other singles that were moderately successful in Canada, &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; would become Jacks&#x27;s only major solo hit in the United States. In Canada, the single (Gold Fish GF 100) reached number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; magazine charts on 26 January 1974, where it remained for four weeks.

Though the song enjoyed contemporary success, some modern critics take a dimmer view, considering it overly sentimental. Jacks&#x27;s version has been cited as an example of bad music, having been listed as one of the worst pop songs ever recorded and ranking number five in a similar CNN poll in 2006.

Jacks also released a German-language version in Germany with lyrics by Gerd Müller-Schwanke, titled &quot;&quot;.

It continued to maintain its position into January 2000, spending a total of 17 weeks on the UK chart. The song was the 26th best-selling single of 1999 in the UK and also became the final number-one single of the 1990s.

<text>Bacalar () is the municipal seat and largest city in Bacalar Municipality (until 2011 a part of Othón P. Blanco Municipality) in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, about north of Chetumal. In the 2010 census the city had a population of 11,084. At that time it was still part of Othón P. Blanco, and was its second-largest city (locality), after Chetumal.

== Etymology ==

The name most likely derives from , (Sian Ka&#x27;an Bakhalal) meaning &quot;surrounded by reeds&quot;, the name of the locality attested at the time of the 16th century arrival of the Spanish.

Lake Bacalar, a lagoon, is on the east side of the town.

== History ==

Bacalar was a city of the Maya civilization in Pre-Columbian times, and was founded in 415 A.D. with the name of &quot;Sian Ka&#x27;an Bakhalal&quot;. It was the first city in the region that the Spanish Conquistadores succeeded in taking and holding, in 1543 (during the 1543–1544 Pachecos entrada). In 1545 Gaspar Pacheco established the Spanish town here with the name Salamanca de Bacalar with the help of Juan de la Cámara. The southern half of what is now Quintana Roo was governed from Bacalar, answerable to the Captain General of Yucatán in Mérida.

After pirates sacked the town in the 17th century, the Fortress de San Felipe Bacalar was completed in 1729, and may be visited today.

In 1848 Bacalar had a population of about 5,000. In 1848, during the Caste War of Yucatán, rebellious Chan Santa Cruz Maya conquered the town. It was retaken by the Mexicans in 1902.

Bacalar was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; in 2006.

Between 2005 and 2010 so-called Russian Mennonites who speak German established a colony in Salamanca that had 967 inhabitants in 2010 and 1.175 in 2020. All inhabitants were Protestants and only one of those aged 15 and over was illiterate.

==Transportation==

Bacalar is also served by a station of the Tren Maya, which opened on October 6, 2024, alongside the Chetumal Airport railway station.

Additionally, the nearby and Chacchoben archeological sites are served by a separate Tren Maya station, called the ().

<doc id="193569" wikidata="Q953718" url="?curid=193569" title="Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington">
<text>Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington (1618 – 28 July 1685) was an English statesman.

A supporter of the Royalists during the English Civil War, he joined the royal family in exile before returning to England at the Restoration in 1660. He gained political influence over the following decade and became one of Charles II&#x27;s key advisors as a member of the Cabal ministry from 1668. He was impeached in 1674. He was a leading figure in the Court faction in the Parliament of England, a grouping which would evolve into the Tories.

== Background and early life ==

He was the son of Sir John Bennet of Dawley, Middlesex, by Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Crofts of Little Saxham, Suffolk. He was the younger brother of John Bennet, 1st Baron Ossulston; his sister was Elizabeth Bennet who married Sir Robert Carr (or Kerr). He was baptized at Little Saxham, Suffolk, in 1618, and was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained some distinction as a scholar and a poet, and was originally destined for holy orders. In 1643, he was secretary to Lord Digby at Oxford, and was employed as a messenger between the queen and Ormonde in Ireland.

Subsequently, he took up arms for the king, and received a wound on the bridge of his nose in the skirmish at Andover in 1644. The scar resulting from this wound must have been prominent because Arlington took to covering it with black plaster. After the defeat of the royal cause he travelled in France and Italy, joined the exiled royal family in 1650, and in 1654 became official secretary to James, Duke of York on the recommendation of Charles, who had already been attracted by his &quot;pleasant and agreeable humour&quot;. He was said by some to have been the father of an illegitimate child by Lucy Walter.

== Knighthood ==
In March 1657, he was knighted, and the same year was sent as Charles&#x27;s agent to Madrid, where he remained, endeavouring to obtain assistance for the royal cause, until after the Restoration. On his return to England in 1661 he was made keeper of the privy purse, and became the prime favourite. One of his duties was the procuring and management of the royal mistresses, in which his success gained him great credit. Allying himself with Lady Castlemaine, he encouraged Charles&#x27;s increasing dislike of Clarendon; and he was made secretary of state in October 1662 in spite of the opposition of Clarendon, who had to find him a seat in parliament. He represented Callington from 1661 until 1665, but appears never to have taken part in debate.

== Biography ==
He served subsequently on the committees for explaining the Irish Act of Settlement 1662 and for Tangier. In 1665 he obtained a peerage as Baron Arlington, (properly Harlington, in Middlesex) and in 1667 was appointed one of the postmasters-general. The control of foreign affairs was entrusted to him, and he was chiefly responsible for the attack on the Smyrna fleet and for the Second Anglo-Dutch War, during which he married the beautiful (and Dutch) Isabella van Nassau-Beverweert (28 December 1633 – 18 January 1718) in March 1665. Isabella was the daughter of Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd, the natural son of stadtholder Maurice of Orange. They had one daughter, Isabella FitzRoy, Duchess of Grafton (c.1668-1723). Lady Arlington&#x27;s sister Emilia, another noted beauty, married Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory.

In 1665 he advised Charles to grant liberty of conscience, but this was merely a concession to gain money during the war; and he showed great activity later in oppressing the nonconformists.

== Death of Thomas Wriothesley ==
On the death of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, whose administration he had attacked, his great ambition, the treasurership, was not satisfied; and on the fall of Clarendon, against whom he had intrigued, he did not, though becoming a member of the Cabal Ministry, obtain the supreme influence which he had expected; for Buckingham first equalled, and soon surpassed him, in the royal favour. With Buckingham a sharp rivalry sprang up, and they only combined forces when endeavouring to bring about some evil measure, such as the ruin of the great Ormonde, who was an opponent of their policy and their schemes. Another object of jealousy to Arlington was Sir William Temple, who achieved great popular success in 1668 by the conclusion of the Triple Alliance; Arlington endeavoured to procure his removal to Madrid, and entered with alacrity into Charles&#x27;s plans for destroying the whole policy embodied in the treaty, and for making terms with France. He refused a bribe from Louis XIV, but allowed his wife to accept a gift of 10,000 crowns; in 1670 he was the only minister besides the Roman Catholic Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford to whom the first secret treaty of Dover (May 1670), one clause of which provided for Charles&#x27;s declaration of his conversion to Catholicism, was confided; and he was the chief actor in the deception practised upon the rest of the council.

== Personal views ==
He supported several other measures—the scheme for rendering the king&#x27;s power absolute by force of arms; the &quot;stop of the exchequer&quot;, involving a repudiation of the state debt in 1672; and the Royal Declaration of Indulgence the same year, &quot;that we might keep all quiet at home whilst we are busy abroad.&quot; On 22 April 1672 he was created an earl, with a special remainder that the title would pass to his daughter, and on 15 June obtained the Order of the Garter; the same month he proceeded with Buckingham on a mission, first to William at The Hague, and afterwards to Louis at Utrecht, endeavouring to force upon the Dutch terms of peace which were indignantly refused, failing to end the Third Anglo-Dutch War. But Arlington&#x27;s support of the court policy was entirely subordinate to personal interests; and after the appointment of Clifford in November 1672 to the treasurership, his jealousy and mortification, together with his alarm at the violent opposition aroused in parliament, caused him to veer over to the other side.

=== Declaration of indulgence ===
He advised Charles in March 1673 to submit the legality of the declaration of indulgence to the House of Lords, and supported the Test Act of the same year, which compelled Clifford to resign. He joined the pro-Dutch party, and in order to make his peace with his new allies, disclosed the secret treaty of Dover to the staunch Protestants Ormonde and Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Arlington had, however, lost the confidence of all parties, and these efforts to procure support met with little success. On 15 January 1674 he was impeached by the Commons, the specific charges being &quot;popery&quot;, corruption, and the betrayal of his trust – Buckingham in his own defence having accused him the day before of being the chief instigator of the French and anti-Protestant policy, of the scheme of governing by consent. But the motion for his removal, owing chiefly to the influence of his brother-in-law, the popular Lord Ossory, was rejected by 166 votes to 127. His escape could not, however, prevent his fall, and he resigned the secretaryship on 11 September 1674, being appointed Lord Chamberlain instead. In 1675 he made another attempt to gain favour with the parliament by supporting measures against France and against the Roman Catholics, and by joining in the pressure put upon Charles to remove James from the court. In November he went on a Mission to The Hague, with the popular objects of effecting peace and of concluding an alliance with William and James&#x27;s daughter Mary. In this, he entirely failed, and he returned home completely discredited.

=== Treasurership ===
He had again been disappointed with the treasurership when Danby succeeded Clifford; Charles having declared &quot;that he had too much kindness for him to let him have it for he was not fit for the office&quot;. His intrigues with discontented persons in parliament to stir up opposition to his successful rival came to nothing. From this time, though lingering on at court, he possessed no influence, and was treated with scanty respect. It was safe to ridicule his person and behaviour, and it became a common jest for &quot;some courtier to put black patch upon his nose and strut about with a white staff in a hand in order to make the king merry at his expense&quot;. He was appointed a commissioner of the treasury in March 1679, was included in Sir William Temple&#x27;s new modelled council the same year, and was a member of the inner cabinet which was most immediately formed. In 1681 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk.

==Death and inheritance ==
He died on 28 July 1685 and was buried at Euston, where he had bought a large estate and had carried out extensive building operations. His residence in London was Arlington House, which he constructed when his previous residence Goring House burned down in 1674, this residence would be succeeded by Buckingham House which became Buckingham Palace.

His title passed, by special remainder, to his only daughter Isabella. In 1672, when she was four or five years old she married the nine-year-old Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, natural son of King Charles II by Lady Castlemaine. The ceremony was repeated in 1679, presumably to allow the couple to cohabit. They had one son Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton. Grafton was killed at the Siege of Cork in 1690. Isabella in 1698 remarried Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet. She died in 1723.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1996 was the 41st edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 18 May 1996 at the in Oslo, Norway. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (NRK) and presented by Ingvild Bryn and Morten Harket, the contest was held in Norway following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot; by Secret Garden.

Thirty countries submitted entries to the contest, with a non-public, audio-only qualifying round held two months before the final to reduce the number of participants from 30 to 23. The entries from , , , , , , and were subsequently eliminated, which resulted in Germany being absent from the contest for the first – and as of 2024 only – time.

The winner was with the song &quot;The Voice&quot;, written by Brendan Graham and performed by Eimear Quinn. This gave the nation a record-extending seventh contest win, their fourth win in five years, with Graham also recording his second win as a songwriter in three years after having written the winning song at the . Norway, , , and took the remaining places in the top five, with Croatia, Estonia, and , which placed sixth, achieving their best results to date. This was the final contest where the results were determined solely by jury voting, with a trial use of televoting in the leading to widespread adoption from onwards.

==Location==

The 1996 contest took place in Oslo, Norway, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot;, performed by Secret Garden. It was the second time that Norway had hosted the contest, following the staged in Bergen. The chosen venue was the , an indoor arena opened in 1990 and located in the district of the city, which has hosted music concerts, ice hockey matches, and the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert. Around 6,000 spectators were present in the venue during the contest.

==Participating countries==
A total of thirty countries submitted entries for the 1996 contest, however per the rules of the event only twenty-three countries would be allowed to participate. Norway, by virtue of being the host country, was guaranteed a place, with all remaining countries competing in the qualifying round in order to gain a spot in the event. Initially broadcasters from thirty-three countries expressed an interest in participating, however planned entries from , , and failed to materialise; these nations would eventually make their contest debuts in the 2000s.

Three representatives who had performed as lead artists in previous contests featured among the performers at this event. Marianna Efstratiou represented for the second time, having previously competed in the , while Elisabeth Andreassen made her fourth contest appearance, having competed for in as a member of the band Chips, as well as representing Norway twice, winning the contest in as a member of Bobbysocks! and performing with Jan Werner Danielsen in . Additionally, Georgina Abela, who had represented at the with Paul Giordimaina, returned as a backing singer for the Maltese entrant Miriam Christine.


==Production==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1996 was produced by the Norwegian public broadcaster (NRK). Odd Arvid Strømstad served as executive producer, Pål Veiglum served as director, Bjarte Ulfstein served as designer, and Frode Thingnæs served as musical director, leading the Norwegian Radio Orchestra. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christine Marchal-Ortiz as scrutineer.

The show was presented by the Norwegian journalist and television presenter Ingvild Bryn and the Norwegian singer Morten Harket, lead vocalist of the Norwegian band a-ha. The contest underwent a re-brand for this edition, as NRK set out to improve the image of the competition and broaden its audience appeal. The event was referred to by the hosts and through on-screen captions as &quot;Eurosong &#x27;96&quot;, the only occasion in which this contraction was officially used to refer to the event.

Rehearsals in the contest venue for the competing acts began on 13 May 1996. Each country had two technical rehearsals in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals took place on 13 and 14 May, with each country allowed 40 minutes total on stage, followed by 20 minutes to review recordings with producers and to consult on suggested changes, and then a 20-minute press conference. Each country&#x27;s second rehearsals took place on 15 and 16 May, with 30 minutes total on stage followed by another 20 minute press conference. A full technical rehearsal with all artists took place on the afternoon of 17 May, followed by two dress rehearsals with an audience on the evening of 17 May and the following afternoon. The competing delegations were invited to a welcome reception during the week in the build-up to the event, hosted by the Mayor of Oslo at Oslo City Hall on the evening of 13 May, as well as to events during the rehearsal week including a sailing trip on the Oslofjord and a trip to the in Bygdøy where a special Eurovision-themed exhibition had been installed.

NRK introduced visual effects to the contest for the first time. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was featured as overlays during the broadcast of the competing entries, and the voting segment was conducted via chroma key technology built by Silicon Graphics; during this segment host Ingvild Bryn was situated in the &quot;blue room&quot;, a special area to the side of the stage with a blue-coloured background, which allowed the contest scoreboard to be rendered virtually using CGI. The chroma key virtual display also included live footage of the artists in the green room backstage, as well as the video feeds of each country&#x27;s spokespersons as they delivered their country&#x27;s points.

==Format==
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

=== New qualification system ===
In 1996, a trial qualification process replaced the relegation system used from 1993 to 1995, whereby the lowest-ranked countries in each final were eliminated from the following year&#x27;s contest. Under the new procedure, an audio preselection was organised for all participating countries, apart from the host country Norway, which received an automatic right to compete in the final, to be joined by an additional 22 countries. National juries in all competing countries, including Norway, listened to the submitted entries on audio tape, with juries required to listen to all songs three times before voting. Each of the eight members on each country&#x27;s jury awarded their favourite song twelve points, their second-favourite ten points, their third-favourite eight points, with subsequent points being awarded consecutively down to each juror&#x27;s tenth-favourite song being awarded one point, with the points awarded by all jurors being totalled to determine each country&#x27;s top ten songs which were awarded points in the same manner. Jury members who voted in the qualifying round were not allowed to sit on the jury for the final.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) required all entries to be submitted by 20March 1996. Jury voting was held on 20 and 21 March, with the qualifying countries publicly revealed on 22 March, at the same time as the running order draw for the final was conducted. The full results of how individual juries had voted was not intended to be revealed publicly, but the full breakdown has since become available.

=== Voting procedure ===

The results of the 1996 contest were determined using the scoring system introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, between men and women, and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing. This was the last occasion that juries alone decided the result of the contest, as five nations introduced public televoting as a trial in , and almost all other countries followed suit the .

=== Postcards ===
The &quot;postcards&quot; were 70-second video introductions shown on television whilst the stage is being prepared for the next contestant to perform their entry; the postcards for each country at the 1996 contest was made up of three segments. In the first segment the participating country was highlighted geographically on a map of Europe, followed by video footage of that country&#x27;s competing artist or artists in their home country during their day-to-day lives, which also featured each artist packing a branded backpack with important items which they would take with them to Oslo. The second segment featured footage of nature scenes in Norway as well as Norwegian people in everyday life, often accompanied by music from Norwegian electronic group Subgud. The final segment consisted of a pre-recorded good luck message from a representative of each respective country in the language of that country. The seniority of these figures varied between the different countries; among the contributors were then-President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel, who survived an assassination attempt on the day of the contest, and then-Prime Minister of Portugal António Guterres, who would later become the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 2017.

Hungary and tied on the same score for the final qualification place, however Finland qualified for the contest due to them having received the highest individual score (8 points) compared to Hungary (7 points).

=== Final ===
The contest took place on 18 May 1996 at 21:00 (CEST) and lasted 3 hours and 7 minutes. In addition to his role as host, Harket also performed the song &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Not for Saints&quot; as the show&#x27;s opening act. The interval act, entitled &quot;&quot; or &quot;Beacon Burning&quot;, was created by Petter Skavlan.

Graham recorded his second contest win in three years as a songwriter, having written the winning song of the 1994 contest &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot;, and thus became one of five individuals to have won the contest more than once as an artist or songwriter up to that point in time, alongside Willy van Hemert, Yves Dessca, Johnny Logan and Rolf Løvland. , and achieved their highest placings to date by finishing fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, while finished in last place for the eighth time.

During the announcement of the Spanish votes, the Spanish spokesperson Belén Fernández de Henestrosa referred to the Netherlands as &quot;Holland&quot;, which was misheard by Ingvild Bryn as &quot;Poland&quot; and which resulted in the Spanish six points being incorrectly attributed to the latter country. The results of the contest were amended after the event to correct this error, and the tables in this article present the corrected results as published by the EBU.

<doc id="193576" wikidata="Q1142179" url="?curid=193576" title="Orange River Colony">
<text>The Orange River Colony was the British colony created after Britain first occupied (1900) and then annexed (1902) the independent Orange Free State in the Second Boer War. The colony ceased to exist in 1910, when it was absorbed into the Union of South Africa as the Orange Free State Province.

==Constitutional history==
During the Second Boer War, British forces invaded the Orange Free State, occupying the capital, Bloemfontein by 13 March 1900. Five months later, on 6 October 1900, the British government declared an official annexation of the full territory of the Orange Free State, this in-spite of the fact they had not yet occupied the full territory, nor defeated the Free State forces.

The Free State government moved to Kroonstad during the early months of the war and its armies remained active in the field until the war&#x27;s end. From the perspective of the Orange Free State, independence wasn&#x27;t lost until they ratified the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902.

On the Boer side, the government was led by state president Martinus Theunis Steyn (1857–1916) until 30 May 1902, when he went on sick-leave and was replaced by General Christiaan de Wet as acting state president. On the British side, Sir Alfred Milner was appointed Administrator of the Orange River Colony on 4 January 1901, with Hamilton John Goold-Adams as lieutenant-governor.

Following the end of hostilities, Lord Milner visited Bloemfontein on 23 June 1902 and promulgated the new constitution, in the presence of military officials, heads of civil department and representatives of the late Boer government, including General De Wet. Milner was sworn in as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Orange River Colony on the same day.

From 1902 to 1910, the colony was governed by a single governor:
* Alfred Milner, Viscount Milner, in office 23 June 1902 – 1 April 1905;
* William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne, in office 2 April 1905 – 7 June 1907;
* Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, in office 7 June 1907 – 31 May 1910

==Self-government==

By 1904 sentiment was growing for some form of self-government. The Orangia Unie (&quot;Orange Union Party&quot;) was formally constituted in May 1906, after several months of preparation. A similar organisation, called Het Volk, had been formed by the Transvaal Boers in January 1905. Both unions had constitutions almost identical with that of the Afrikaner Bond, a former pan-Afrikaner political movement, and their aims were also similar – to secure the position of the Afrikaners in state and society. The chairman of the &quot;Orangia Unie&quot; was Abraham Fischer, leading politician of the pre-Boer War period and top diplomat of the Boer republics during the Second Boer War. Among the other prominent members were J. B. M. Hertzog, Christiaan de Wet and Martinus Theunis Steyn.

A second political party, the Constitutional Party was formed by a group of burghers content with British rule. Chairman of the party was Sir John G. Fraser, before the Second Boer War a prominent (pro-British) member of the Volksraad of the Orange Free State. The Constitutional Party had a strong following in Bloemfontein, but not outside the capital. The political programmes of the two parties were very similar, the real difference between them being the attitude towards British annexation and Afrikaner influence.

In 1905 Lord Selborne, formerly First Lord of the Admiralty, replaced Viscount Milner as high commissioner for South Africa and governor of the Transvaal and Orange River colonies. Selborne had come to South Africa with a brief to guide the former Boer republics from Crown colony government towards self-government. When Liberal Party came into office in Britain in December 1905 the process was speeded up, with the decision to give both the Transvaal and Orange River colonies self-government without delay. Selborne accepted the changed situation, and the experiment proved successful. He ceased to be governor of the Orange River Colony on its assumption of self-government in June 1907, but retained his other posts until May 1910, retiring on the eve of the establishment of the Union of South Africa.

On 7 January 1907 Selborne released a despatch, known as the Selborne Memorandum. It reviewed the situation in South Africa in all its economic and political aspects and was a masterly and comprehensive statement of the dangers inherent in the existing political system and of the advantages a political union offered. The document had a marked influence on the course of events and together with Selborne&#x27;s conciliatory approach assisted in reconciling the Dutch and British communities of South Africa.

After the elections of 1907, the colony received self-government on 27 November 1907. Abraham Fischer became the first (and only) prime minister of the colony (in office 27 November 1907 – 31 May 1910). The first Legislative Assembly consisted of twenty-nine members of the &quot;Orangia Unie&quot;, five Constitutionalists and four independents. Fischer&#x27;s cabinet consisted of:

* J.B.M. Hertzog, attorney-general and director of education;
* A. E. W. Ramsbottom, treasurer;
* Christiaan de Wet, minister of agriculture;
* Cornelius Hermanus Wessels, minister of public works

Fischer, besides the premiership, held the portfolio of colonial secretary. The first Legislative Council counted five members from the &quot;Orangia Unie&quot;, five Constitutionalists, and one independent member, in effect holding the balance.

==Policies==
In May 1908, the Orange River Colony took part in an inter-state conference which met at Pretoria and Cape Town, and determined to renew the existing customs convention and to make no alteration in railway rates. These decisions were the result of an agreement to bring before the parliaments of the various colonies a resolution advocating the closer union of the South African states and the appointment of delegates to a national convention to frame a draft constitution.

At the eventual National Convention, former State President M. T. Steyn took a leading and conciliatory part, and subsequently the Orange River legislature agreed to the terms drawn up by the convention for the unification of the four self-governing colonies in the Union of South Africa. Under the imperial act by which unification was established (31 May 1910) the colony entered the Union under the style of the Orange Free State Province. Fischer and Hertzog became members of the first Union government, while A. E. W. Ramsbottom became the first administrator of the Orange Free State as a province of the Union.

<doc id="193577" wikidata="Q10443" url="?curid=193577" title="Lynx (constellation)">
<text>Lynx is a constellation named after the animal, usually observed in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere. The constellation was introduced in the late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line. The orange giant Alpha Lyncis is the brightest star in the constellation, and the semiregular variable star Y Lyncis is a target for amateur astronomers. Six star systems have been found to contain planets. Those of 6 Lyncis and HD 75898 were discovered by the Doppler method; those of XO-2, XO-4, XO-5 and WASP-13 were observed as they passed in front of the host star.

Within the constellation&#x27;s borders lie NGC 2419, an unusually remote globular cluster; the galaxy NGC 2770, which has hosted three recent Type Ib supernovae; the distant quasar APM 08279+5255, whose light is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy; and the Lynx Supercluster, which was the most distant supercluster known at the time of its discovery in 1999.

==History==
Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius formed the constellation in 1687 from 19 faint stars between the constellations Ursa Major and Auriga that earlier had been part of the obsolete constellation Jordanus Fluvius. Naming it Lynx because of its faintness, he challenged future stargazers to see it, declaring that only the lynx-eyed (those with good sight) would have been able to recognize it. Hevelius also used the name Tigris (Tiger) in his catalog but kept the former name only in his atlas. English astronomer John Flamsteed adopted the constellation in his catalog, published in 1712, and his subsequent atlas. According to 19th-century amateur astronomer Richard Hinckley Allen, the chief stars in Lynx &quot;might well have been utilized by the modern constructor, whoever he was, of our Ursa Major to complete the quartette of feet.&quot;

==Characteristics==

Lynx is bordered by Camelopardalis to the north, Auriga to the west, Gemini to the southwest, Cancer to the south, Leo to the east and Ursa Major to the northeast. Covering 545.4 square degrees and 1.322% of the night sky, it ranks 28th of the 88 constellations in size, surpassing better known constellations such as Gemini. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Lyn&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 20 segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , and the declination coordinates are between +32.97° and +61.96°. On dark nights, the brighter stars can be seen as a crooked line extending roughly between Camelopardalis and Leo, and north of the bright star Castor. Lynx is most readily observed from the late winter to late summer to northern hemisphere observers, with midnight culmination occurring on 20 January. The whole constellation is visible to observers north of latitude 28°S.

==Notable features==

===Stars===

English astronomer Francis Baily gave a single star a Bayer designation—Alpha Lyncis—while Flamsteed numbered 44 stars, though several lie across the boundary in Ursa Major. Overall, there are 97 stars within the constellation&#x27;s borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.

The brightest star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an apparent (visual) magnitude of 3.14. It is an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has evolved away from the main sequence. The star has swollen to about 55 times the Sun&#x27;s radius and is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The stellar atmosphere has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880 K. The only star with a proper name is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun&#x27;s mass that has swollen and cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times as wide as the Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.

Lynx is rich in double stars. The second brightest star in the constellation is 38 Lyncis at magnitude 3.8. When viewed through a moderate telescope, the two components—a brighter blue-white star of magnitude 3.9 and a fainter star of magnitude 6.1 that has been described as lilac as well as blue-white—can be seen. 15 Lyncis is another star that is found to be a double system when viewed through a telescope, separating into two yellowish stars of magnitudes 4.7 and 5.8 that are 0.9 arcseconds apart. The components are a yellow giant of spectral type G8III that is around 4.01 times as massive as the Sun, and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8V that is around 3.73 times as massive as the Sun. Orbiting each other every 262 years, the stars are 178 ± 2 light years distant from Earth. 12 Lyncis has a combined apparent magnitude of 4.87. When seen through a telescope, it can be separated into three stars: two components with magnitudes 5.4 and 6.0 that lie at an angular separation by 1.8″ () and a yellow-hued star of magnitude 7.2 at a separation of 8.6″ (as of 1990). The two brighter stars are estimated to orbit each other with a period that is poorly known but estimated to be roughly 700 to 900 years. The 12 Lyncis system is 210 ± 10 light years distant from Earth.

10 Ursae Majoris is the third-brightest star in Lynx. Originally in the neighbouring constellation Ursa Major, it became part of Lynx with the official establishment of the constellation&#x27;s borders. Appearing to be of magnitude 3.97, a telescope reveals a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F4V of magnitude 4.11 and a star very similar to the Sun of spectral type G5V and magnitude 6.18. The two are 10.6 astronomical units (au) apart and orbit each other every 21.78 years. The system is 52.4 ± 0.6 light-years distant from Earth. Likewise 16 Lyncis was originally known as Psi10 Aurigae and conversely, 37, 39, 41 and 44 Lyncis became part of Ursa Major.

Y Lyncis is a popular target among amateur astronomers, as it is a semiregular variable ranging in brightness from magnitude 6.2 to 8.9. These shifts in brightness are complex, with a shorter period of 110 days due to the star&#x27;s pulsations, and a longer period of 1400 days possibly due to the star&#x27;s rotation or regular cycles in its convection. A red supergiant, it has an estimated diameter around 580 times that of the Sun, is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive, and has a luminosity around 25,000 times that of the Sun. 1 Lyncis and UX Lyncis are red giants that are also semiregular variables with complex fluctuations in brightness.
=== Exoplanets ===
Six star systems have been found to contain exoplanets, of which two were discovered by the Doppler method and four by the transit method. 6 Lyncis, an orange subgiant that spent much of its life as an A-type or F-type main sequence star, is orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 2.4 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 899 days. HD 75898 is a 3.8 ± 0.8 billion-year-old yellow star of spectral type G0V that has just begun expanding and cooling off the main sequence. It has a planet at least 2.51 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 418 days. The centre of mass of the system is accelerating, indicating there is a third, more distant, component at least the size of Jupiter. Three star systems were found to have planets that were observed by the XO Telescope in Hawaii as they passed in front of them. XO-2 is a binary star system, both the stars of which are slightly less massive and cooler than the Sun and have planetary companions: XO-2S has a Saturn-mass planet at 0.13 au distance with a period of around 18 days, and one a little more massive than Jupiter at a distance of 0.48 au and with a period of around 120 days, and XO-2N has a hot Jupiter with around half Jupiter&#x27;s mass that has an orbit of only 2.6 days. XO-4 is an F-type main sequence star that is a little hotter and more massive than the Sun that has a hot Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 4.1 days. XO-5 is a Sun-like star with a hot Jupiter about as massive as Jupiter that takes around 4.2 days to complete an orbit. WASP-13, a Sun-like star that has begun to swell and cool off the main sequence, had a transiting planet discovered by the SuperWASP program in 2009. The planet is around half as massive as Jupiter and takes 4.35 days to complete a revolution.

===Deep-sky objects===

Lynx&#x27;s most notable deep sky object is NGC 2419, also called the &quot;Intergalactic Wanderer&quot; as it was assumed to lie outside the Milky Way. At a distance of between 275,000 and 300,000 light-years from Earth, it is one of the most distant known globular clusters within our galaxy. NGC 2419 is likely in a highly elliptical orbit around the Milky Way. It has a magnitude of +9.06 and is a Shapley class VII cluster. Originally thought to be a star, NGC 2419 was discovered to be a globular cluster by American astronomer Carl Lampland.

NGC 2537, known as the Bear&#x27;s Paw Galaxy, lies about 3 degrees north-northwest of 31 Lyncis. It is a blue compact dwarf galaxy that is somewhere between 17 and 30 million light-years away from Earth. Close by is IC 2233, a very flat and thin spiral galaxy that is between 26 and 40 million light-years away from Earth. A comparatively quiet galaxy with a low rate of star formation (less than one solar mass every twenty years), it was long suspected to be interacting with the Bear&#x27;s Paw galaxy. This is now considered highly unlikely as observations with the Very Large Array showed the two galaxies lie at different distances.

The NGC 2841 group is a group of galaxies that lie both in Lynx and neighbouring Ursa Major. It includes the loose triplet NGC 2541, NGC 2500, and NGC 2552 within Lynx. Using cepheids of NGC 2541 as standard candles, the distance to that galaxy (and the group) has been estimated at around 40 million light–years. NGC 2841 itself lies in Ursa Major.

NGC 2770 is a type SASc spiral galaxy located about 88 million light–years away that has hosted Type Ib supernovae: SN 1999eh, SN 2007uy, and SN 2008D. The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the X-rays released very early on in its formation, rather than by the optical light emitted during later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770&#x27;s interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity. UGC 4904 is a galaxy located about 77 million light-years from Earth. On 20 October 2004, a supernova impostor was observed by Japanese amateur astronomer Kōichi Itagaki within the galaxy. Observations of its spectrum suggest that it shed massive amounts of material in a two-year period, transforming from a LBV star to a Wolf–Rayet star, before it was observed erupting as hypernova SN 2006jc on October 11, 2006.
APM 08279+5255 is a very distant, broad absorption line quasar discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It appears to be a giant elliptical galaxy with a supermassive black hole around 23 billion times as massive as the Sun and an associated accretion disk that has a diameter of 3600 light years. The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911. While observing the quasar in 2008, astronomers using ESA&#x27;s XMM Newton and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133.

The Lynx Supercluster is a remote supercluster with a redshift of 1.26–1.27. It was the most distant supercluster known at the time of its discovery in 1999. It is made up of two main clusters of galaxies—RX J0849+4452 or Lynx E and RX J0848+4453 or Lynx W—and several smaller clumps. Further still lies the Lynx Arc, located around 12 billion light years away (a redshift of 3.357). It is a distant region containing a million extremely hot, young blue stars with surface temperatures of 80,000–100,000 K that are twice as hot as similar stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Only visible through gravitational lensing produced by a closer cluster of galaxies, the Arc is a feature of the early days of the universe, when &quot;furious firestorms of star birth&quot; were more common.

===Meteor showers===
The September Lyncids are a minor meteor shower that appears around 6 September. They were historically more prominent, described as such by Chinese observers in 1037 and 1063, and Korean astronomers in 1560. The Alpha Lyncids were discovered in 1971 by Malcolm Currie, and appear between 10 December and 3 January.

<doc id="193579" wikidata="Q1020769" url="?curid=193579" title="Isla Mujeres">
<text>Isla Mujeres (, Spanish for &quot;Women Island&quot;, formally “&quot;Isla de Mujeres&quot;”) is an island where the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea meet, about off the Yucatán Peninsula coast in the State of Quintana Roo, Mexico. It is approximately long and wide. To the east is the Caribbean Sea with a strong surf and rocky coast, and to the west the skyline of Cancún can be seen across the waters. In the 2010 census, the namesake town on the island had a population of 12,642 inhabitants. The town is the seat of Isla Mujeres Municipality.

Very little violent crime has been reported on the island over its history, leading the island gaining a reputation for its relaxed nature, as the safety of both residents and tourists being unusually high. The biggest danger to the residents of the island has historically been the threat of tropical storms and hurricanes, some of which have caused devastating damage, such as Hurricane Carmen and Hurricane Wilma.

==History==


In Pre-Columbian times, the island was sacred to the Maya goddess of childbirth and medicine, Ixchel. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century they named it &quot;Isla Mujeres&quot; after the many images of goddesses. The first information available about Isla Mujeres is from between 564–1516 AD, when it was part of the Maya province called Ekab. There were four Maya provinces in the area of the modern state of Quintana Roo. The Maya exploited the salt the island produced in the &quot;salinas&quot; (small, interior lagoons), using it in food preservation, medicine, and a generally accepted currency in the whole Maya world.

A temple to Ixchel stood in what is now &quot;Hacienda&quot; Mundaca (Mundaca Plantation). The island was also a favorite stopping place for pirates in the early 1800s. The shallow lagoon on the mainland side was a good place for sailors to sit out major storms, careen their hulls and trade for salt. Pirates Henry Morgan, Jean Lafitte and Hernán Mundaca spent time there. Mundaca lived on the island for quite some time, building a large &quot;hacienda&quot; with which he hoped to entice a local beauty, Martiniana (Prisca) Gómez Pantoja, into marriage. She married someone else to his regret. A bit of the Hacienda remains, and once served as a zoo.

A small Maya temple was once located on the southern tip of the island. However, in 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused extensive damage, leaving most of its foundations but only a very small portion of the structure.

Since the 1970s, along with nearby Cancún, there has been substantial tourist development in Isla Mujeres. Like much of the rest of the tourism industry, Isla Mujeres was economically devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic, although case numbers remained relatively low on the island itself.

==Transportation==

Transportation on the island of Isla Mujeres consists primarily of taxis or golf carts and moped scooters. there were 121 taxis, 500 golf carts, and 1500 moped scooters. There is also a bus service that runs from the downtown to the different neighborhoods, called &quot;colonias&quot; in Spanish (where most locals live). The island was formerly served by Isla Mujeres National Airport, but the airport and landing strip have since closed. Nowadays, locals, military personnel, and tourists can be seen jogging up and down the runway at various times throughout the day.

===Ferry service to the mainland===
There are three main ferry boat and Catamaran companies (UltraMar, Cancun Sailing, and Jetway) that run to the island from Puerto Juárez, Cancun, or Gran Puerto on the mainland. There are also many party boats that make day trips to Isla Mujeres. The island is popular with day trippers, but activity quiets down in the evening after the tour groups leave.

==Tourism==

Isla Mujeres has fostered a strong restaurant industry and culture, with many restaurants located throughout the island. There are numerous places to eat fresh seafood cooked with local and traditional recipes, and other restaurants offer Mexican, Yucatecan, Italian, Caribbean, Mediterranean, Israeli, French, Thai, Cuban, and Maya cuisine, among others. Hotel prices vary from cheap to very expensive at the resorts on the southwest end such as Hotel Villa Rolandi, and Playa Norte. In the north is El Centro (downtown), whose central axis, Hidalgo Street, is the main dining and entertainment area. Also located on the north end is a famous beach called Playa Norte, which has recovered quickly since Hurricane Wilma hit the area in 2005. Besides these attractions, swimming with dolphins can also be experienced at the Island. Isla Mujeres has been a popular location for destination weddings for several decades, with larger hotels on the island sometimes being used to house wedding parties. These weddings are performed throughout the island, primarily at beachside venues on the west or north side of the island, with ceremonies generally taking place on the beach.

The island of Isla Mujeres is located close to one of many coral reefs such as the one located in Garrafon Park, which is an attraction popular for its snorkeling and scuba diving. The Cancún Underwater Museum, created by English sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor, is located off the western coast of Isla Mujeres. Isla Mujeres is also home to a population of sea turtles. Because of the recent endangerment of sea turtles in the area, a facility named Tortugranja was set up on the southern end of the island for their rehabilitation and breeding. This facility is open to the public.

The island&#x27;s relative proximity to Cuba has made it a popular stepping stone for Cubans trying to reach the United States in recent years.

Isla Mujeres is considered to be one of the best places in the world to catch sailfish.
==Life on the island==
In addition to the Isla Mujeres&#x27; use as a popular day trip spot, many homes have been built on the island, including the homes of those who have lived on the island for generations, affluent condos or houses for seasonal use, snowbirds, fishermen, and those working in the island&#x27;s tourism and restaurant industry. The island has also enjoyed a dedicated yacht and boating presence through the years, with many docks on the west coast, including some designated for seasonal use. In general, the island&#x27;s population declines in the winter due to the decline of tourism during that season. Some of the residents on the island ferry to and from Cancún daily in order to attend school or work.

Shopping on the island for residents was limited for many decades, leading day trips to Cancún (sometimes on a specialized ferry for automobiles and shipping trucks) to be a common necessity to purchase items such as a television or foods not stocked at one of the many minisupers (locally run convenience stores) or the downtown supermercado (supermarket) located in the city square. As the tourism industry increased in the later part of the 2000s, businesses such as Chedraui began to establish a presence, providing residents with less need for repeated trips to Cancún.

There are a multitude of stadiums throughout the island, including a full scale baseball park and organized football venue along with makeshift dirt or sand fields which can commonly be seen played on by local children or organized teams. Technology on the island (particularly in the &quot;colonias&quot;) was humble for many years, with the island slow to widely adopt innovations in entertainment beyond the standard television. By the early &#x27;00s, technologies such as cable television, the arcade cabinet (most commonly an original or repurposed Neo Geo) and cellular phones were beginning to become commonplace with local households.
Isla Mujeres is the home of Mexican naval base, Quinta Región Naval.

<doc id="193580" wikidata="Q43459" url="?curid=193580" title="Ferdowsi">
<text>Abu&#x27;l-Qâsem Ferdowsi Tusi (also Firdawsi, ; 940 – 1019/1025) was a Persian poet and the author of &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;), which is one of the world&#x27;s longest epic poems created by a single poet, and the greatest epic of Persian-speaking countries. Ferdowsi is celebrated as one of the most influential figures of Persian literature and one of the greatest in the history of literature.

== Name ==
Except for his &quot;kunya&quot; ( – , meaning &#x27;father of Qasem&#x27;) and his pen name ( – &quot;Ferdowsī&quot;, meaning &#x27;paradisic&#x27;), nothing is known with any certainty about his full name. According to Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh, the information given by the 13th-century author Bundari about Ferdowsi&#x27;s name should be taken as the most reliable. Bundari calls the poet al-Amir al-Hakim Abu&#x27;l-Qasem Mansur ibn al-Hasan al-Ferdowsi al-Tusi. From an early period on, he has been referred to by different additional names and titles, the most common one being / (&quot;philosopher&quot;). Based on this, his full name is given in Persian sources as / . Due to the non-standardised transliteration from Persian into English, different spellings of his name are used in English works, including &quot;Firdawsi&quot;, &quot;Firdusi&quot;, &quot;Firdosi&quot;, &quot;Firdausi&quot;, etc. The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; uses the spelling &quot;Firdawsī&quot;, based on the standardised transliteration method of the German Oriental Society. The &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, which uses a modified version of the same method (with a stronger emphasis on modern Persian intonations), gives the spelling &quot;Ferdowsī&quot;. The modern Tajik transliteration of his name in Tajik Cyrillic is (&quot;Hakim Abdulqosim Firdavsí Tŭsí&quot;).

== Life ==

=== Family ===

Ferdowsi was born into a family of Iranian landowners (&quot;dehqans&quot;) in 940 in the village of Paj, near the city of Tus, in the Khorasan region of the Samanid Empire, which is located in the present-day Razavi Khorasan province of northeastern Iran. Little is known about Ferdowsi&#x27;s early life. The poet had a wife, who was probably literate and came from the same &quot;dehqan&quot; class. The &quot;dehqans&quot; were landowning Iranian aristocrats who had flourished under the Sasanian dynasty (the last pre-Islamic dynasty to rule Iran) and whose power, though diminished, had survived into the Islamic era which followed the Islamic conquests of the 7thcentury. The &quot;dehqans&quot; were attached to the pre-Islamic literary heritage, as their status was associated with it (so much so that &quot;dehqan&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;Iranian&quot; in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;). Thus they saw it as their task to preserve the pre-Islamic cultural traditions, including tales of legendary kings.

He had a son, who died at the age of 37, and was mourned by the poet in an elegy which he inserted into the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.

=== Background ===
The Islamic conquests of the 7th century brought gradual linguistic and cultural changes to the Iranian Plateau. By the late 9th century, as the power of the caliphate had weakened, several local dynasties emerged in Greater Iran. Ferdowsi grew up in Tus, a city under the control of one of these dynasties, the Samanids, who claimed descent from the Sassanid general Bahram Chobin (whose story Ferdowsi recounts in one of the later sections of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;). The Samanid bureaucracy used the New Persian language, which had been used to bring Islam to the Eastern regions of the Iranian world and supplanted local languages, and commissioned translations of Pahlavi texts into New Persian. Abu Mansur Muhammad, a &quot;dehqan&quot; and governor of Tus, had ordered his minister Abu Mansur Mamari to invite several local scholars to compile a prose &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;), which was completed in 1010. Although it no longer survives, Ferdowsi used it as one of the sources of his epic. Samanid rulers were patrons of such important Persian poets as Rudaki and Daqiqi, and Ferdowsi followed in the footsteps of these writers.

Details about Ferdowsi&#x27;s education are lacking. While it is likely that he learned Arabic in school, there is no evidence in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; that he knew either Arabic or Pahlavi.

Ferdowsi was a Shiite Muslim, although varying views exist on what Shiite sect he belonged to. Khaleghi-Motlagh, following Theodor Nöldeke, notes that Ferdowsi displays a contradictory attitude towards religion in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;: on the one hand, he shows a &quot;lenient&quot; attitude towards religion, but on the other hand, he believed that his sect was the &quot;only true Islamic one.&quot; Khaleghi-Motlagh concurs with Nöldeke that Ferdowsi was &quot;above all a deist and monotheist who at the same time kept faith with his forbears.&quot; Ferdowsi criticized philosophers and those who tried to prove the existence of God. He saw God&#x27;s creation as the only evidence of His existence and believed everything in life to be the product of God&#x27;s will. Khaleghi-Motlagh and others have suggested that a certain fatalism in Ferdowsi&#x27;s work contradicts his &quot;absolute faith in the unicity and might of God,&quot; and that this may have been the legacy of the Zurvanism of the Sasanian period.

=== Life as a poet ===
It is possible that Ferdowsi wrote some early poems which have not survived. He began work on the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; around 977, intending it as a continuation of the work of his fellow poet Daqiqi, who had been assassinated by his slave. Like Daqiqi, Ferdowsi employed the prose &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Abd-al-Razzaq as a source. He received generous patronage from the Samanid prince Mansur and completed the first version of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; in 994. When the Turkic Ghaznavids overthrew the Samanids in the late 990s, Ferdowsi continued to work on the poem, rewriting sections to praise the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. Mahmud&#x27;s attitude to Ferdowsi and how well he rewarded the poet are matters which have long been subject to dispute and have formed the basis of legends about the poet and his patron (see below). The Turkic Mahmud may have been less interested in tales from Iranian history than the Samanids. The later sections of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; have passages which reveal Ferdowsi&#x27;s fluctuating moods: in some he complains about old age, poverty, illness and the death of his son; in others, he appears happier. Ferdowsi finally completed his epic on 8 March 1010. Virtually nothing is known with any certainty about the last decade of his life.

=== Tomb ===

Ferdowsi was buried in his own garden, burial in the cemetery of Tus having been forbidden by a local cleric who considered him a heretic. A Ghaznavid governor of Khorasan constructed a mausoleum over the grave and it became a revered site. The tomb, which had fallen into decay, was rebuilt between 1928 and 1934 by the Society for the National Heritage of Iran on the orders of Reza Shah, and has now become the equivalent of a national shrine.

== Legend ==
According to legend, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni offered Ferdowsi a gold piece for every couplet of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; he wrote. The poet agreed to receive the money as a lump sum when he had completed the epic. He planned to use it to rebuild the dykes in his native Tus. After thirty years of work, Ferdowsi finished his masterpiece. The sultan prepared to give him 60,000 gold pieces, one for every couplet, as agreed. However, the courtier whom Mahmud had entrusted with the money despised Ferdowsi, regarding him as a heretic, and he replaced the gold coins with silver. Ferdowsi was in the bath house when he received the reward. Finding it was silver and not gold, he gave the money away to the bath-keeper, a refreshment seller, and the slave who had carried the coins. When the courtier told the sultan about Ferdowsi&#x27;s behaviour, he was furious and threatened to execute him. Ferdowsi fled to Khorasan, having first written a satire on Mahmud, and spent most of the remainder of his life in exile. Mahmud eventually learned the truth about the courtier&#x27;s deception and had him either banished or executed. By this time, the aged Ferdowsi had returned to Tus. The sultan sent him a new gift of 60,000 gold pieces, but just as the caravan bearing the money entered the gates of Tus, a funeral procession exited the gates on the opposite side: the poet had died from a heart attack.

== Works ==

Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is the most popular and influential national epic in Iran and other Persian-speaking countries. The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is the only surviving work by Ferdowsi regarded as indisputably genuine.

He may have written poems earlier in his life but they no longer exist. A narrative poem, &quot;Yūsof o Zolaykā&quot; (Joseph and Zuleika), was once attributed to him, but scholarly consensus now rejects the idea it is his. 

There has also been speculation about the satire Ferdowsi allegedly wrote about Mahmud of Ghazni after the sultan failed to reward him sufficiently. Nezami Aruzi, Ferdowsi&#x27;s early biographer, claimed that all but six lines had been destroyed by a well-wisher who had paid Ferdowsi a thousand dirhams for the poem. Introductions to some manuscripts of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; include verses purporting to be the satire.

Ferdowsi is one of the undisputed giants of Persian literature. After Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, a number of other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere of the Persian language. Without exception, all such works were based in style and method on Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, but none of them could quite achieve the same degree of fame and popularity as Ferdowsi&#x27;s masterpiece.

Ferdowsi has a unique place in Persian history because of the strides he made in reviving and regenerating the Persian language and cultural traditions. His works are cited as a crucial component in the persistence of the Persian language, as those works allowed much of the tongue to remain codified and intact. In this respect, Ferdowsi surpasses Nizami, Khayyam, Asadi Tusi and other seminal Persian literary figures in his impact on Persian culture and language. Many modern Iranians see him as the father of the modern Persian language.

Ferdowsi in fact was a motivation behind many future Persian figures. One such notable figure was Reza Shah Pahlavi, who established an Academy of Persian Language and Literature, in order to attempt to remove Arabic and French words from the Persian language, replacing them with suitable Persian alternatives. In 1934, Reza Shah set up a ceremony in Mashhad, Khorasan, celebrating a thousand years of Persian literature since the time of Ferdowsi, titled &quot;Ferdowsi Millennial Celebration&quot;, inviting notable European as well as Iranian scholars. Ferdowsi University of Mashhad is a university established in 1949 that also takes its name from Ferdowsi.

Ferdowsi&#x27;s influence in the Persian culture is explained by John Andrew Boyle:

:The Persians regard Ferdowsi as the greatest of their poets. For nearly a thousand years they have continued to read and to listen to recitations from his master work, the &quot;Shah-nameh&quot;, in which the Persian national epic found its final and enduring form. Though written about 1,000 years ago, this work is as intelligible to the average, modern Iranian as the King James Version of the Bible is to a modern English-speaker. The language, based as the poem is on a Dari original, is pure Persian with only the slightest admixture of Arabic.

The library at Wadham College, Oxford University was named the Ferdowsi Library, and contains a specialised Persian section for scholars.

<text>Puerto Juárez is a district in the Benito Juárez municipality, in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. It is in the north-east of the Yucatán Peninsula, on the shore of the Caribbean Sea, 2 km (1.25 mi) north from the center of Cancún. Puerto Juárez was the primary location of the original population of the area before the founding of the city of Cancún, and was a separate location from 1960 until 1990 when it was abolished as such and incorporated as one of Cancún&#x27;s districts.

==Ferry==
Gran Puerto is the ferry port located in Puerto Juárez. It serves as a primary way to access Isla Mujeres, an island around 10 km (6 mi) from Puerto Juárez, from Cancún. The regular ferry service runs twice an hour on the high-speed ferry Ultramar. The ferry terminal has two lines for Ultramar passengers, restrooms, a parking garage, convenience store, and ticketing area.

In the 1950s, there was a proposal from Cuba to run a ferry from Puerto Juárez to Pinar del Río Province, Cuba, as part of the Pan-American Highway. The distance would only be a little more than that of the Havana–Key West ferry, with which it would have been linked by highway. The Cuban Revolution of 1959 ended the project.

<doc id="193583" wikidata="Q182490" url="?curid=193583" title="Law of the instrument">
<text>The law of the instrument, law of the hammer, Maslow&#x27;s hammer, or golden hammer is a cognitive bias that involves an over-reliance on a familiar tool. Abraham Maslow wrote in 1966, &quot;it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.&quot;

The concept is attributed both to Maslow and to Abraham Kaplan, although the hammer and nail line may not be original to either of them.

==History==
The English expression &quot;a Birmingham screwdriver&quot;, meaning a hammer, refers to the practice of using the one tool for all purposes, and predates both Kaplan and Maslow by at least a century.

In 1868, a London periodical, &quot;Once a Week&quot;, contained this observation: &quot;Give a boy a hammer and chisel; show him how to use them; at once he begins to hack the doorposts, to take off the corners of shutter and window frames, until you teach him a better use for them, and how to keep his activity within bounds.&quot;

=== Kaplan ===

The first recorded statement of the concept was Abraham Kaplan&#x27;s, in 1964: &quot;I call it &quot;the law of the instrument,&quot; and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding.&quot;

In February 1962 Kaplan, then a professor of philosophy, gave a banquet speech at a conference of the American Educational Research Association that was being held at UCLA. An article in the June 1962 issue of the &quot;Journal of Medical Education&quot; stated that &quot;the highlight of the 3-day meeting ... was to be found in Kaplan&#x27;s comment on the choice of methods for research. He urged that scientists exercise good judgment in the selection of appropriate methods for their research. Because certain methods happen to be handy, or a given individual has been trained to use a specific method, is no assurance that the method is appropriate for all problems. He cited Kaplan&#x27;s Law of the Instrument: &#x27;Give a boy a hammer and everything he meets has to be pounded.

In &quot;The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science&quot; (1964), Kaplan again mentioned the law of the instrument saying, &quot;It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled.&quot; And in a 1964 article for &quot;The Library Quarterly&quot;, he again cited the law and commented: &quot;We tend to formulate our problems in such a way as to make it seem that the solutions to those problems demand precisely what we already happen to have at hand.&quot;

=== Tomkins and Colby ===

In a 1963 essay collection, &quot;Computer Simulation of Personality: Frontier of Psychological Theory&quot;, Silvan Tomkins wrote about &quot;the tendency of jobs to be adapted to tools, rather than adapting tools to jobs&quot;. He wrote: &quot;If one has a hammer one tends to look for nails, and if one has a computer with a storage capacity, but no feelings, one is more likely to concern oneself with remembering and with problem solving than with loving and hating.&quot; In the same book, Kenneth Mark Colby explicitly cited the law, writing: &quot;The First Law of the Instrument states that if you give a boy a hammer, he suddenly finds that everything needs pounding. The computer program may be our current hammer, but it must be tried. One cannot decide from purely armchair considerations whether or not it will be of any value.&quot;

=== Abraham Maslow ===

&quot;Maslow&#x27;s hammer,&quot; popularly phrased as &quot;&quot; and variants thereof, is from Abraham Maslow&#x27;s &quot;The Psychology of Science&quot;, published in 1966. Maslow wrote: &quot;I remember seeing an elaborate and complicated automatic washing machine for automobiles that did a beautiful job of washing them. But it could do only that, and everything else that got into its clutches was treated as if it were an automobile to be washed. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.&quot;

=== Lee Loevinger ===

In 1967, Lee Loevinger of the Federal Communications Commission dubbed the law &quot;Loevinger&#x27;s law of irresistible use&quot;, and applied it to government: &quot;The political science analogue is that if there is a government agency, this proves something needs regulating.&quot;

=== Warren Buffett ===

In 1984, investor Warren Buffett criticized academic studies of financial markets that made use of inappropriate mathematical approaches: 

=== Robert Kagan ===
In his 2003 book, &quot;Of Paradise and Power&quot;, historian Robert Kagan suggested a corollary to the law: &quot;When you don&#x27;t have a hammer, you don&#x27;t want anything to look like a nail.&quot; According to Kagan, the corollary explains the difference in views on the use of military force the United States and Europe have held since the end of World War II.

==Manifestations==
===Psychiatry===
Some critics of psychiatry claim that the law of the instrument leads to the over-prescription of psychiatric drugs.

===Computer programming===
The notion of a &quot;golden hammer,&quot; &quot;a familiar technology or concept applied obsessively to many software problems&quot;, was introduced into information technology literature in 1998 as an anti-pattern: a programming practice to be avoided.

Software developer José M. Gilgado has written that the law is still relevant in the 21st century and is highly applicable to software development. Many times software developers, he observed, &quot;tend to use the same known tools to do a completely new different project with new constraints&quot;. He blamed this on &quot;the comfort zone state where you don&#x27;t change anything to avoid risk. The problem with using the same tools every time you can is that you don&#x27;t have enough arguments to make a choice because you have nothing to compare to and is limiting your knowledge.&quot; The solution is &quot;to keep looking for the best possible choice, even if we aren&#x27;t very familiar with it&quot;. This includes using a computer language with which one is unfamiliar. He noted that the product RubyMotion enables developers to &quot;wrap&quot; unknown computer languages in a familiar computer language and thus avoid having to learn them. But Gilgado found this approach inadvisable, because it reinforces the habit of avoiding new tools.

==Related concepts==
Other forms of narrow-minded instrumentalism include: déformation professionnelle, a French term for &quot;looking at things from the point of view of one&#x27;s profession&quot;, and regulatory capture, the tendency for regulators to look at things from the point of view of the profession they are regulating.

<text>Abraham Fischer (9 April 1850 – 16 November 1913) was a South African statesman. He was the sole Prime Minister of the Orange River Colony in South Africa, and when that ceased to exist joined the cabinet of the newly formed Union of South Africa.

==Early life==
Fischer was born on 9 April 1850 in Green Point, Cape Town in to Johannes Jacobus George Fischer, formerly of the Dutch East India Company, and Catherina Anna Margertha Brink.

==Biography==
He was educated at the South African College, and became a lawyer in Cape Colony, joining the bar in 1875. In 1873 he married Ana Robertson (1851-1927), the daughter of Scottish immigrants to the Free State. He became interested in the politics of the Orange Free State, and in 1878 became a member of the Orange Free State&#x27;s Volksraad. He became vice-president of the Volksraad in 1893, a member of the executive council in 1896, and took part in many colonial and interstate conferences. He headed a joint deputation from Transvaal and Orange Free State to Europe and America during the Boer War to solicit support for the Boers, returning in 1903 to practice law in the newly formed Orange River Colony.

Continuing to promote the Boer cause, he helped form the Orangia Unie party in May 1906 and became its chairman; the party won the majority of seats in the colony&#x27;s first elections that were held in November 1907. On 27 November, he was chosen as Prime Minister, and stayed in that position until it ceased to exist with the union of 31 May 1910. He then joined the cabinet of the Union of South Africa as Minister of Lands. He was made Privy Councillor in 1911 and became Minister of the Interior and Lands in 1912.

He was the father of Percy Fischer, a Judge President of the Orange Free State. He was the grandfather of Bram Fischer, a noted anti-apartheid activist.

<text>The Yoshizawa–Randlett system is a diagramming system used to describe the folds of origami models. Many origami books begin with a description of basic origami techniques which are used to construct the models. There are also a number of standard bases which are commonly used as a first step in construction. Models are typically classified as requiring low, intermediate or high skill depending on the complexity of the techniques involved in the construction.

==History==
The concept of diagramming originated in the 1797 book “Senbazuru Orikata”, the first origami book ever published. The diagrams in this book were very unclear, and often only showed the result of the folding process, leaving the folder unsure how the model was created.

Later books began to devise a system of showing precisely how a model was folded. These ranged from an unwieldy set of symbols to a photograph or sketch of each step attempting to show the motion of a fold. None of these systems were sufficient to diagram all models, and so none were widely adopted.

In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, Akira Yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming. He introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph, &quot;Atarashi Origami Geijutsu&quot; (New Origami Art) in 1954. He employed dotted and dashed lines to represent mountain and valley folds, and a few other symbols such as the “inflate” and “round” symbols. This system caught the attention of Samuel Randlett and Robert Harbin, who added a few symbols such as “rotate” and “zoom in”, and then adopted it as the standard. The Yoshizawa–Randlett system was first described in Samuel Randlett&#x27;s &quot;Art of Origami&quot; in 1961. It was then accepted as the default throughout the international origami community, and is still in general use today.

==Origami symbols==

===Basic folds===
The two main types of origami symbol are lines and arrows show how origami paper is bent or moved, while lines show various types of edges:
* A thick line shows the edge of the paper
* A dashed line shows a valley fold. The paper is folded in front of itself.
* A dashed and dotted line shows a mountain fold (there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author). The paper is folded behind itself, this is normally done by turning the paper over, folding a valley fold and then turning the paper back over again.
* A thin line shows where a previous fold has creased the paper.
* A dotted line shows a previous fold that&#x27;s hidden behind other paper, or sometimes shows a fold that&#x27;s not yet made.

===Common operations===
The operations shown here are all fairly common. The pleat folds and reverse folds are often done with the two creases at an angle. Reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads.

The sink fold is considered an intermediary to high skill. The version shown here is called an open sink and there is another version called a closed sink which generates a triangular pocket with no flaps showing. In simple cases the model can be partly unfolded and then folded with the sink in place.

==Compound folds==
* A squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers (for example, one flap of a waterbomb base). Make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap. Open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps.
* A rabbit ear fold starts with a reference crease down a diagonal. Fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned.
* A petal fold starts with two connected flaps, each of which has at least two layers. (For example, two flaps of a preliminary base). The two flaps are attached to each other along a reference crease. Make two radial folds from the open point, so that the open edges lie along the reference crease. Unfold these two radial folds. Make another fold across the top connecting the ends of the creases to create a triangle of creases. Unfold this fold as well. Fold one layer of the open point upward and flatten it using the existing creases. A petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears, which are connected along the reference crease.

==Origami bases==
In origami, there is a series of several bases that many models are created with. In general, &quot;base&quot; refers to any folded paper that immediately precedes final folding and shaping of the model-to-be. The ones listed below are generally accepted as the traditional origami bases.
* A blintz base is made by folding the corners of a square into the center, similar to the blintz pancake. The resulting square can then be used as the starting point for any base or blintzed again. The resulting base will then have more points available for folding.
* The kite base is merely two valley folds that bring two adjacent edges of the square together to lie on the square&#x27;s diagonal.
* The fish base consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners. The flaps that result on the other two corners are carefully folded downwards in the same direction. In other words, it consists of two side-by-side rabbit ears.
* The waterbomb base consists of two perpendicular valley folds down the diagonals of the square and two perpendicular mountain folds down the center of the square. This crease pattern is then compressed to form the waterbomb base, which is an isosceles-right triangle with four isosceles-right triangular flaps. The waterbomb base is an inside-out preliminary fold.
* The preliminary fold consists of two perpendicular diagonal mountain folds that bisect the corners of the square and two perpendicular valley folds that bisect the edges of the square. The paper is then collapsed to form a square shape with four isosceles-right triangular flaps. It is sometimes called the Square Base
* The bird base, or crane base, consists of a preliminary fold with both the front and the back sides petal folded upward.
* The frog base starts with a waterbomb base or preliminary fold. All four flaps are squash-folded (the result is the same in either case), and then the corners are petal folded upward.

==More advanced skills==
* The Swivel fold is difficult to describe as the term is loosely defined and there are so many different versions that could be called &quot;swivel folds&quot;. However, generally swivel folds involve a flap of paper &quot;swivelling&quot; at a certain point or vertex and another flap or edge of paper, connected to the first, dragged around that point or vertex.
* Most of the creases in a stretched bird base are present in the regular bird base. When forming this bird base, make sure to crease the triangle at the center corner through all layers. (If you unfold completely, you will see a small square at the center of the paper.) After forming the bird base, either partially unfold the paper, and/or &quot;stretch&quot; two opposite corners of the bird base. These two corners, their associated flaps, and the central square will all lie flat. The other two flaps will form a pyramid. Rabbit ear each flap that is in the pyramid, so that the model lies flat. All of the raw edges will lie along the centerline of the model. The stretched bird base is used in Lang&#x27;s &quot;Bald Eagle&quot;, Greenberg&#x27;s &quot;Eeyore&quot;, and some other high-intermediate and complex models.
* The open sink usually involves opening out the paper, and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model.
* The open double sink is equivalent to making an open sink, and then open-sinking the point in the opposite direction. It is a sinked analog of the crimp fold. When made in a single step (after pre-creasing), it can be easier to make than a single open sink, because it does not require neatly reversing the point. The open double sink is used in many box-pleated models.
* The spread squash can similarly be considered the sinked analog of the squash fold. It is used to flatten a closed flap or twist fold (see below). Instead of creating a long point to one side of the flap&#x27;s base, the spread squash creates a wide splat around the flap&#x27;s base. The spread squash is used in the eyes of Engel&#x27;s &quot;Octopus&quot;, in &quot;Marie&#x27;s Rose&quot;, and in some other intermediate and complex models.
* The closed sink simultaneously makes a locking flap inside of a sink. It is difficult because the paper cannot be opened out further than a triangle. This technique is illustrated in the Origami Forum&#x27;s thread #462. The closed sink appears in some high-intermediate and complex models.
* The twist fold involves, as the name implies, twisting a section of the paper with respect to its original position. The section twisted will be a polygon; the numerous required support creases include pleat folds radiating from its corners. &quot;Marie&#x27;s Rose&quot; demonstrates this on a pentagon.
** It is also possible to twist a single conical point indefinitely, collapsing the sides in a waterbomb-base-like fashion as one goes. (If this is tried with a non-conical point, such as the waterbomb base itself, eventually the fold will terminate in a spread squash.) This variant is used in many of Tomoko Fuse&#x27;s modular boxes.
* Unsink, or sometimes &quot;open unsink&quot;, makes a concave pocket convex without fully unfolding the paper, or the opposite of an open sink. It is more difficult than the closed unsink below because there is no internal flap to grab onto to help unsink the paper, so the paper must be opened out and the area to be unsunk is pushed out (to be convex) from inside the model and from behind. It is a common fold in Lang&#x27;s insects.
* The closed unsink inverts a closed sink without completely opening out the affected paper. In theory, it is &quot;just&quot; the opposite of a closed sink. In practice, it is very difficult, because the paper being &quot;popped&quot; into place usually must be pulled (not pushed), and because it involves simultaneously folding over a locking flap that is hidden inside the sink. However, it is easier to manipulate than an open unsink as there is an internal flap to pull to pop the unsink in place; in an open unsink there is nothing to hold. The closed unsink appears in some complex models, such as a few of Lang&#x27;s insects.

<text>A level crossing is an intersection where a railway line crosses a road, path, or (in rare situations) airport runway, at the same level, as opposed to the railway line or the road etc. crossing over or under using an overpass or tunnel. The term also applies when a light rail line with separate right-of-way or reserved track crosses a road in the same fashion. Other names include railway level crossing, railway crossing (chiefly international), grade crossing or railroad crossing (chiefly American), road through railroad, criss-cross, train crossing, and RXR (abbreviated).

There are more than 100,000 level crossings in Europe and more than 200,000 in North America.

Road-grade crossings are considered incompatible with high-speed rail and are virtually non-existent in European high-speed train operations.

== History ==

The types of early level crossings varied by location, but often they had a flagman in a nearby booth who, on the approach of a train, would wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks. This was a dangerous job that cost the lives of gatekeepers or their family members, as the train was not given enough time to stop. Gated crossings became commonplace in many areas, as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock, and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman. In the second quarter of the 20th century, manual or electrical closable gates that barricaded the roadway started to be introduced, intended to be a complete barrier against intrusion of any road traffic onto the railway. Automatic crossings are now commonplace in some countries as motor vehicles replaced horse-drawn vehicles and the need for animal protection diminished with time. Full-, half- or no-barrier crossings superseded gated crossings, although crossings of older types can still be found in places. 
In rural regions with sparse traffic, the least expensive type of level crossing to operate is one without flagmen or gates, with only a warning sign posted. This type has been common across North America and in many developing countries.

Some international rules have helped to harmonise level crossing. For instance, the 1968 Vienna Convention states (chapter 3, article 23b) that:
* &quot;one or two blinking red light indicates a car should stop; if they are yellow the car can pass with caution&quot;.
* Article 27 suggests stop lines at level crossings.
* Article 33, 34, 35 and 36 are specific to level crossings, because level crossings are recognized as dangerous.
* Article 35 indicates a cross should exist when there is no barrier or lights.
This has been implemented in many countries, including countries which are not part of the Vienna Convention.
==Safety==

Trains have a much larger mass relative to their braking capability, and thus a far longer braking distance than road vehicles. With rare exceptions, trains do not stop at level crossings but rely on road vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance. There have been several accidents in which a heavy load on a slow road transporter has not cleared the line in time, eg Dalfsen train crash and Hixon rail crash. At Hixon the police escort had received no training in their responsiblities. 

Level crossings constitute a significant safety concern internationally. On average, each year around 400 people in the European Union and over 300 in the United States are killed in level crossing accidents. Collisions can occur with vehicles as well as pedestrians; pedestrian collisions are more likely to result in a fatality. Among pedestrians, young people (5–19 years), older people (60 years and over), and males are considered to be higher risk users. On some commuter lines most trains may slow to stop at a station, but express or freight trains will pass through stations at high speed without slowing. 

As far as warning systems for road users are concerned, level crossings either have &quot;passive&quot; protection, in the form of various types of warning signs, or &quot;active&quot; protection, using automatic warning devices such as flashing lights, warning sounds, and barriers or gates. In the 19th century and for much of the 20th, a sign warning &quot;Stop, look, and listen&quot; (or similar wording) was the sole protection at most level crossings. Fewer collisions take place at level crossings with active warning systems, and today active protection is widely available. Modern radar sensor systems can detect if level crossings are free of obstructions as trains approach. These improve safety by not lowering crossing barriers that may trap vehicles or pedestrians on the tracks, while signalling trains to brake until the obstruction clears. However, they cannot prevent a vehicle from moving out onto the track once it is far too late for the locomotive to slow even slightly.

Due to the increase in road and rail traffic as well as for safety reasons, level crossings are increasingly being removed. As an example, Melbourne is planning to close 110 level crossings by 2030 and (due to the proximity of some stations) rebuild 51 stations.

At railway stations, a pedestrian level crossing is sometimes provided to allow passengers to reach other platforms in the absence of an underpass or bridge, or for disabled access. Where third rail systems have level crossings, there is a gap in the third rail over the level crossing, but this does not necessarily interrupt the power supply to trains since they may have current collectors on multiple cars.

==Traffic signal preemption==

Traffic signal-controlled intersections next to level crossings on at least one of the roads in the intersection usually feature traffic signal preemption. In the US, approaching trains activate a routine where, before the road lights and barriers are activated, all traffic signal phases go to red, except for the signal immediately after the crossing, which turns green (or flashing yellow) to allow traffic on the tracks to clear (in some cases, there are auxiliary traffic signals prior to the railroad crossing which will turn red, keeping new traffic from crossing the tracks. This is in addition to the flashing lights on the crossing barriers). After enough time to clear the crossing, the signal will turn. The crossing lights may begin flashing and the barriers lower immediately, or this might be delayed until after the traffic light turns red.

The operation of a traffic signal, while a train is present, may differ from municipality to municipality. There are a number of possible arrangements:
#All directions will flash red, turning the intersection into an all-way stop.
#While the train is passing, the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a flashing yellow, while the other directions face a flashing red light.
#While the train is passing, the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a green light, while the other directions face a red light.
#Traffic lights can operate relatively normally, with only the blocked direction turning red while the train is passing.

== Crossing cameras ==

In France, cameras have been installed on some level crossings to obtain images to improve understanding of an incident when a technical investigation occurs.

In England, cameras have been installed at some level crossings.

In South Australia, cameras have been installed at some level crossings to deter non-compliance with signals.

==By country==

Designs of level crossings vary between countries.

==Major accidents==
Level crossings present a significant risk of collisions between trains and road vehicles. This list is not a definitive list of the world&#x27;s worst accidents and the events listed are limited to those where a separate article describes the event in question.

==Runway crossings==
Aircraft runways sometimes cross roads or rail lines, and require signaling to avoid collisions.

===Australia===
*Sydney Airport had a runway crossing, when that runway was extended. The Port Botany railway line was later deviated in March 1960 to release land for new Qantas hangars with sharp curves that avoided the runway. On 18 June 1950, a Douglas DC-3 operating for Ansett Australia was involved in a ground collision with a freight train at the crossing. The accident derailed several train cars, severely damaged the aircraft, and resulted in one minor injury to the aircraft crew. 
*Burnie Airport had a runway crossing over the 05/23 Runway. This crossing was built over the railway line when the airfield was constructed, and has since been decommissioned with the closing of both the railway line and the 05/23 runway.

===Gibraltar===
Winston Churchill Avenue intersects the runway of Gibraltar International Airport at surface level; movable barricades close when aircraft land or take off.

As of March 2023, a tunnel under the runway opened to regular traffic, and the level crossing will only be available to pedestrians, cyclists and e-scooters.
===Hong Kong===
After the runway of Kai Tak Airport was extended in 1943, it intersected with the easternmost section of Prince Edward Road, so all road traffic had to be stopped during takeoffs and landings. The issue was relieved when the authorities constructed a new runway for replacement in September 1958.

===Madagascar===
The Fianarantsoa-Côte Est railway crosses the runway at Manakara Airport. It is one of the few airports in the world that crosses an active railway line.

===New Zealand===
A level crossing near Gisborne, sees the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line cross one of Gisborne Airport&#x27;s runways. Aircraft landing on sealed 1310-metre runway 14L/32R are signalled with two red flashing lights on either side of the runway and a horizontal bar of flashing red lights to indicate the runway south of the railway line is closed, and may only land on the section of the runway north of the railway line. When the full length of the runway is open, a vertical bar of green lights signal to the aircraft, with regular rail signals on either side of the runway indicating trains to stop.

===Nicaragua===
The runway of Ometepe Airport crosses the highway NIC-64.

===Philippines===
As of February 2023, there exists one road-runway crossing at Catarman Airport in Northern Samar.

===Sweden===
The Visby Lärbro Line between Visby and Lärbro crossed the runway of Visby Airport between 1956 and 1960.

===Switzerland===
Two public roads cross the runway at Meiringen Air Base. Electrically operated gates close when aircraft land or take off.

===United Kingdom===
* Northern Ireland: There was a runway crossing on the Belfast–Derry railway line. The runway was interlocked with conventional railway block instruments to the control tower.
* Scotland: Crossing of the A970 road over Sumburgh Airport&#x27;s runway in Shetland.

<text>KwaZulu-Natal (, also referred to as KZN; nicknamed &quot;the garden province&quot;) is a province of South Africa that was created in 1994 when the government merged the Zulu bantustan of KwaZulu (&quot;Place of the Zulu&quot; in Zulu) and Natal Province.

It is located in the southeast of the country, with a long shoreline on the Indian Ocean. It shares borders with three other provinces and the countries of Mozambique, Eswatini and Lesotho. Its capital is Pietermaritzburg, and its largest city is Durban, which is also the city with the largest port in sub-saharan Africa. It is the second-most populous province in South Africa, after Gauteng.

Two areas in KwaZulu-Natal have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park. These areas are extremely scenic as well as important to the surrounding ecosystems.

During the 1830s and early 1840s, the northern part of what is now KwaZulu-Natal was established as the Zulu Kingdom. The southern part was, briefly, the Boer Natalia Republic before the British took over control in 1843, renaming it as the Colony of Natal in 1843. The Zulu Kingdom remained independent until 1879.

KwaZulu-Natal is the birthplace of many notable figures in South Africa&#x27;s history, such as Albert Luthuli, the first non-white and the first person from outside Europe and the Americas to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (1960); Pixley ka Isaka Seme, the founder of the African National Congress (ANC) and South Africa&#x27;s first black lawyer; John Langalibalele Dube, the ANC&#x27;s founding president; Harry Gwala, ANC member and anti-apartheid activist; Mac Maharaj, Grammy award-winning group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Grammy award-winning DJ Black Coffee, ANC member, anti-apartheid activist and Little Rivonia Trial defendant; Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the founder of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP); Anton Lembede, the founding president of the ANC Youth League; Jacob Zuma, the former President of South Africa; Bhambatha, a 19th-century Zulu chief who became an anti-apartheid icon; and Shaka Zulu.

== Geography ==
At around in area, KwaZulu-Natal is roughly the size of Portugal. It has three different geographic areas and is the eastern most province in the country. The lowland region along the Indian Ocean coast is extremely narrow in the south, widening in the northern part of the province, while the central Natal Midlands consists of an undulating hilly plateau rising toward the west. Two mountainous areas, the western Drakensberg Mountains and northern Lebombo Mountains form, respectively, a solid basalt wall rising over beside Lesotho border and low parallel ranges of ancient granite running southward from Eswatini. The area&#x27;s largest river, the Tugela, flows west to east across the center of the province.

The coastal regions typically have subtropical thickets and deeper ravines; steep slopes host some Afromontane Forest. The midlands have moist grasslands and isolated pockets of Afromontane Forest. The north has a primarily moist savanna habitat, whilst the Drakensberg region hosts mostly alpine grassland.

The province contains rich areas of biodiversity of a range of flora and fauna. The iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The iSimangaliso Wetland Park, along with uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park and Ndumo, are wetlands of international importance for migratory species and are designated as Ramsar sites. South Africa signed the 1971 Ramsar Convention to try to conserve and protect important wetlands because of their importance to habitats and numerous species.

The former Eastern Cape enclave of the town of Umzimkulu and its hinterland have been incorporated into KwaZulu-Natal following the 12th amendment of the Constitution of South Africa. The amendment also made other changes to the southern border of the province.

The northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude traverses the province from the coast at Hibberdene () to northeast Lesotho.

The province became the first to include a portion of road that is made of partial plastic, the equivalent of nearly 40,000 recycled milk cartons.

===Climate===
KwaZulu-Natal has a varied yet verdant climate thanks to diverse, complex topography. Generally, the coast is subtropical with inland regions becoming progressively colder. Durban on the south coast has an annual rainfall of 1009 mm, with daytime maxima peaking from January to March at with a minimum of , dropping to daytime highs from June to August of with a minimum of .

The temperature drops towards the hinterland, with Pietermaritzburg being similar in the summer, but much cooler in the winter. Ladysmith in the Tugela River Valley reaches in the summer but may drop below freezing point on winter evenings. The Drakensberg can experience heavy winter snow, with light snow occasionally experienced on the highest peaks in summer. The Zululand north coast has the warmest climate and highest humidity, supporting many sugar cane farms around Pongola.

===Borders===
KwaZulu-Natal borders the following areas of Mozambique, Eswatini and Lesotho:
*Maputo Province, Mozambique (far northeast)
*Lubombo District, Eswatini (northeast, east of Shiselweni)
*Shiselweni District, Eswatini (northeast, west of Lubombo)
*Mokhotlong District, Lesotho (southwest, north of Thaba-Tseka)
*Thaba-Tseka District, Lesotho (southwest, between Mokhotlong and Qacha&#x27;s Nek)
*Qacha&#x27;s Nek District, Lesotho (southwest, south of Thaba-Tseka)

Domestically, it borders the following provinces:
*Mpumalanga (north)
*Free State (west)
*Eastern Cape (southwest)

===Administrative divisions===



The KwaZulu-Natal Province is divided into one metropolitan municipality and ten district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 44 local municipalities. The local seat of each district municipality is given in parentheses:

In 2012, the Ingonyama Trust owns 32% of the land in KwaZulu-Natal, in many municipalities. This amounts to about three million hectares, occupied by over 4 million people. The Zulu king is the chairman of the Trust.

===Coastline===

The coastline is dotted with small towns, many of which serve as seasonal recreational hubs. The climate of the coastal areas is humid and subtropical, comparable to southern Florida in the United States, but not quite as hot and rainy in the summer. As one moves further north up the coast towards the border of Mozambique, the climate becomes almost purely tropical. North of Durban is locally referred to as &quot;The North Coast&quot;, while south is &quot;The South Coast&quot;. The Kwazulu-Natal Tourist board includes towns such as Margate, Port Shepstone, Scottburgh and Port Edward in its definition of the South Coast, while Ballito, uMhlanga, Zimbali and Salt Rock are North Coast resort towns.

Beaches of world-class quality are to be found along virtually every part of South Africa&#x27;s eastern seaboard, with some of the least-developed gems found in the far southern and far northern ends of the province. Marina Beach (and its adjoining resort San Lameer) was recognised in 2002 as a Blue Flag beach.

Some visitors come for the annual late autumn or early winter phenomenon on the KwaZulu-Natal coast of the &quot;sardine run&quot;. Referred to as &quot;the greatest shoal on earth&quot;, the sardine run occurs when millions of sardines migrate from their spawning grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the Eastern Cape coastline toward KwaZulu-Natal. They follow a route close inshore, often resulting in many fish washing up on beaches. The huge shoal of tiny fish can stretch for many kilometres; it is preyed upon by thousands of predators, including game fish, sharks, dolphins and seabirds. Usually, the shoals break up and the fish disappear into deeper water around Durban. Scientists have been unable to answer many questions surrounding this exceptional seasonal event.

===Interior===
The interior of the province consists largely of rolling hills from the Valley of a Thousand Hills to the Midlands. Their beauty has inspired literature. Alan Paton, in the novel &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;, wrote:
== History ==
On Christmas Day 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama saw the coast of Natal and named the site after the Portuguese word for Christmas, &quot;Natal&quot;. The Nguni branch of the Bantu occupied this area from the early 1300s

The first European settlers, mostly British, established Port Natal, a trading post. They made almost no attempt to develop the interior, whose inhabitants had been decimated by the Zulu king, Shaka. The Afrikaner Voortrekkers entered the area via the Drakensberg passes in 1837. These Afrikaners defeated the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River in 1838 and thereafter established the Republic of Natal. Thus, the territory was once part of a short-lived Boer republic between 1839 and 1843 until its annexation by Britain. Many Afrikaner inhabitants left for the interior after the annexation and were replaced by immigrants, mainly from Britain.

From 1860 onwards, increasing numbers of Indians, mainly Tamils, were brought in by the British mainly to work in the sugar plantations on the coast. The colony acquired Zululand (the area north of the Tugela River) after the Zulu War of 1879. The lands north of the Buffalo River were added in 1902. Boer forces entered the area during the South African War (1899 to 1902)also known as the second Boer Warand laid siege to Ladysmith. They failed to build on their initial advantage and for three months the line between the opposing forces followed the course of the Tugela River. In 1910, the colony became a province of the Union of South Africa and in 1961 of the Republic of South Africa.

When the homeland of KwaZulu, which means &quot;Place of the Zulu&quot; was re-incorporated into the Natal province after the end of apartheid in 1994, the province of Natal, which had existed between 1910 and 1994, was renamed KwaZulu-Natal. The province is home to the Zulu monarchy; the majority population speak Zulu. It is the only province in South Africa that has the name of its dominant ethnic group as part of its name. As with Eastern Cape, most White South Africans in KwaZulu-Natal are of British descent and less than a quarter of whites in the province are of Boer/Afrikaner descent.

== Provincial coat of arms ==

The lion and wildebeest supporters are symbols of, respectively, KwaZulu and Natal, the regions joined to create KwaZulu-Natal. Besides its importance as a symbol of the Zulu monarchy, the lion is also featured in the state emblems of the India and the United Kingdom which together represent the three largest people groups in KwaZulu-Natal and also represents the unity between them. The zig-zag stripe represents the Drakensberg, which is green in summer, but snowcapped in winter.

The star represents the Star of Bethlehem, due to Vasco da Gama naming the region &quot;Natalia&quot;, a reference to the birth of Christ, on Christmas Day in 1497. The strelitzia flower on the shield symbolizes the province&#x27;s beauty. The assegai and knobkierrie behind the shield represent protection and peace. The base of the crown element is a type of headdress traditionally worn by Zulu elders, that represents wisdom and maturity. The element itself is a Zulu-style grass hut. The motto is &quot;Masisukume Sakhe&quot;, Zulu for &quot;Let us stand up and build&quot;.

== Law and government ==

===Provincial government===
KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s provincial government sits in Pietermaritzburg. The foundation stone of the new legislative building was laid on 21 June 1887, to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. The building was completed two years later. On 25 April 1889, the Governor of Natal, Sir Arthur Havelock, opened the first Legislative Council session in the new building.

This was the former site of St Mary&#x27;s Church, built in the 1860s. The congregation built a new church in 1884 at the corner of Burger Street and Commercial Road. The old building was demolished in 1887 to provide space for the legislative complex.

When governance was granted to Natal in 1893, the new Legislative Assembly took over the chamber used by the Legislative Council since 1889. Further extensions to the parliamentary building were made. The building was unoccupied until 1902, when it was used without being officially opened, due to the country&#x27;s being engulfed in the Anglo-Boer war. The war forced the Legislative Assembly to move the venue of its sittings, as its chamber was used as a military hospital.

The Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council buildings have both been protected as provincial landmarks. They formed a colonial Parliament of two houses: a Council of 11 nominated members and an Assembly of 37 elected members. The Natal Parliament was disbanded in 1910 when the Union of South Africa was formed, and the Assembly became the meeting place of the Natal Provincial Council. The council was disbanded in 1986.

The Provincial Legislature consists of 80 members.

===Current composition===

The 2024 election saw a major upheaval in KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s political landscape. The African National Congress (ANC), which had won a majority in the province in every election since 2004, saw its vote collapse by nearly two-thirds, down to 17% and in third place. In contrast, uMkhonto we Sizwe, a new party led by former President Jacob Zuma, became the province&#x27;s largest party, winning 45% of the vote, primarily among the province&#x27;s ethnic Zulu majority. After the election, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which previously had been the province&#x27;s official opposition party, formed a coalition government with the ANC, the Democratic Alliance (DA), and the National Freedom Party. As part of the coalition agreement, the IFP&#x27;s Thami Ntuli became premier, making him the first IFP member to hold the position in twenty years.

Inkatha Freedom Party&#x27;s Thami Ntuli was officially inaugurated as the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal on 18 June 2024. 

===Zulu monarchy===
KwaZulu-Natal is the home to the Zulu monarch, currently King Misuzulu Zulu kaZwelithini. , the King of the Zulu Nation is provided a stipend of 54 million South African rands by the provincial government. He is also the chairman of the Ingonyama Trust, which controls 32% of the area of the province. Under provincial legislation the Zulu monarch is considered the monarch of the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The King&#x27;s constitutional powers are limited. This makes KwaZulu-Natal, uniquely among South African provinces, a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2022 census, KwaZulu-Natal had a population of 12,423,907, an increase of 21.0% from the prior census in 2011. It is the second-most populous of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces. The median age is 28, an increase of 6 years from 2011.

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
In the 2022 census, 84.8% of the population described themselves as Black African, 9.3% as Indian/Asian, 4.1% as White, and 1.5% as Coloured. A large majority of Black African people in the province are Zulu. KwaZulu-Natal has the largest Indian population in South Africa, with a majority of all Indian South Africans living in the province. A majority of the White population is of British descent, making it one of only two provinces (along with the Eastern Cape) where Whites of British descent outnumber Afrikaners.
=== Languages ===
In the 2022 census, 81.8% of the population reported their first language as Zulu, 14.4% as English, 3.1% as Xhosa, and 1.0% as Afrikaans. KwaZulu-Natal is the only province in which native Zulu-speakers form a majority of the population. The province also has the second-highest proportion of English speakers of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces (after the Western Cape).

=== Religion ===
According to the 2022 census, 74.9% of the population described themselves as Christians, the lowest proportion among South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces. Substantial minorities of the population practice Traditional African religions, Hinduism, and Islam. 
== Economy ==

KwaZulu-Natal has the second largest regional economy in the country after Gauteng. Durban is a rapidly growing urban area and is by most measures the busiest port in Africa. A good railway network links the city to other areas of Southern Africa.

Sugar refining is Durban&#x27;s main industry. Sheep, cattle, dairy, citrus fruits, corn, sorghum, cotton, bananas, and pineapples are also raised. There is an embryonic KwaZulu-Natal wine industry. Other industries, located mainly in and around Durban, include textile, clothing, chemicals, rubber, fertiliser, paper, vehicle assembly and food-processing plants, tanneries, and oil refineries.

To the north, Newcastle is the province&#x27;s industrial powerhouse, with Mittal Steel South Africa (previously ISPAT/ISCOR) and the Karbochem synthetic rubber plant dominating the economy. In 2002, Newcastle became the largest producer of chrome chemicals in Africa with the completion of a chrome-chemical plant, a joint-venture project between Karbochem and German manufacturing giant Bayer.

Other large operations include a diamond-cutting works, various heavy engineering concerns, the Natal Portland Cement (NPC) slagment cement factory, and the Newcastle Cogeneration Plant (old Ingagane Power Station). This was recommissioned as Africa&#x27;s first gas-fired power station by Independent Power Southern Africa (IPSA), and it supplies the Karbochem Plant with electricity. The textile industry is a major employer in the Newcastle area, with over 100 factories belonging to ethnic Taiwanese and Chinese industrialists. Maize, livestock and dairy farmers operate on the outskirts of the city. Coal is mined in the Newcastle area.

Offshore mining of heavy mineral sands including minerals with a concentration of significant economic importance at several locations, such as rutile, ilmenite and zircon are threatening the marine ecology of KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s coast, including the Tugela Banks. The fishing economy of the prawn and nurse fisheries are also threatened.

Ecology tourism is increasingly important to the economy of KwaZulu-Natal. The area&#x27;s rich biodiversity and efforts at conservation have been recognised. Tourists have come to see the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park, declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These two major parks and that of Ndumo have wetlands of international importance listed as Ramsar sites for conservation.

== Civil society ==

Prominent civil society organisations based in the province of KwaZulu-Natal include: Abahlali baseMjondolo (shackdwellers&#x27;) movement, the Diakonia Council of Churches, the Right2Know campaign, and the Unemployed People&#x27;s Movement.

== Ecology ==
There are various game reserves found in the province; one notable example is Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park, where the southern white rhinoceros was saved from extinction.

In many of these larger reserves, large animals ranging from several antelope species to elephant, Cape buffalo and hippopotamus can be found. Predators include lions, leopards, and Cape wild dogs.

The scaly yellowfish (&quot;Labeobarbus natalensis&quot;) is a fish found in the Tugela River system as well as in the Umzimkulu, Umfolozi and the Mgeni. It is a common endemic species in KwaZulu-Natal Province and it lives in different habitats between the Drakensberg foothills and the coastal lowlands.

&quot;Carissa macrocarpa&quot; (Natal plum) is a shrub native to South Africa, where it is commonly called the &quot;large num-num&quot;. In the Zulu language or isiZulu, as well as in the Bantu tribes of Uganda, it is known as the &quot;Amathungulu or umThungulu oBomvu&quot;. In Afrikaans, the fruit is called &quot;noem-noem&quot;.

<doc id="193597" wikidata="Q2788282" url="?curid=193597" title="Treaty of Alliance (1778)">
<text>The Treaty of Alliance (), also known as the Franco-American Treaty, was a defensive alliance between the Kingdom of France and the United States formed amid the American Revolutionary War with Great Britain. It was signed by delegates of King Louis XVI and the Second Continental Congress in Paris on February 6, 1778, along with the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and a secret clause providing for the entry of other European allies; together these instruments are sometimes known as the [[Franco-American alliance|Franco-American Alliance]] or the Treaties of Alliance. The agreements marked the official entry of the United States on the world stage, and formalized French recognition and support of U.S. independence that was to be decisive in America&#x27;s victory.

The Treaty of Alliance was signed immediately after the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, in which France was the first nation to formally recognize the U.S. as a sovereign nation; this treaty had also established mutual commercial and navigation rights between the two nations, in direct defiance of the British Navigation Acts, which restricted American access to foreign markets. In contemplation that these commercial and diplomatic ties would result in hostilities between France and Britain, the Treaty of Alliance guaranteed French military support in just such an event. It also forbade either nation from making a separate peace with Britain, and was contemplated as a permanent defensive pact.

The successful negotiation of the Treaty of Alliance and its sister agreements is considered the &quot;single most important diplomatic success of the colonists&quot;, since it helped secure vital aid in the war with Britain; the treaties were immediately followed by substantial material, military, and financial support to the American cause. Some historians consider the signing of the Treaty of Alliance as marking America&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; recognition as an independent nation. Notwithstanding its significance, subsequent complications with the Treaty of Alliance led to its annulment by the turn of the 19th century, with the United States eschewing formal military alliances until the Second World War.

== Background ==
When the thirteen British colonies in America declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776, their most obvious potential ally was France, a long-time enemy of Britain and a colonial rival who had lost much of their lands in the Americas after the French and Indian War. France&#x27;s leadership had been alarmed by Britain&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War which had shifted the European balance of power and had been planning for a war of revenge since the Treaty of Paris that had ended the conflict in 1763. The French foreign minister Choiseul had envisaged this taking place in alliance with Spain and involving a Franco-Spanish invasion of Britain. Choiseul had been ready go to war in 1770 during the Falklands Crisis, but Louis XV had been alarmed by the British naval mobilization and instead dismissed Choiseul and backed down.

As a result, Jefferson began drafting conditions for a possible commercial treaty between France and the future independent colonies of the United States, which declined the presence of French troops and any aspect of French authority in colonial affairs. On September 25 the Continental Congress ordered commissioners, led by Benjamin Franklin, to seek a treaty with France based upon Adams draft treaty that had later been formalized into a Model Treaty which sought the establishment of reciprocal trade relations with France but declined to mention any possible military assistance from the French government. Despite orders to seek no direct military assistance from France, the American commissioners were instructed to work to acquire most favored nation trading relations with France, along with additional military aid, and were encouraged to reassure any Spanish delegates that the United States had no desire to acquire Spanish lands in the Americas, in hopes that Spain would in turn enter a possible Franco-American alliance.

Despite an original openness to the alliance, after word of the Declaration of Independence and a British evacuation of Boston reached France, the French Foreign Minister, Comte de Vergennes, put off signing a formal alliance with the United States after receiving news of British victories over General George Washington in the New York and New Jersey campaign. With the help of the Committee of Secret Correspondence, established by the U.S. Continental Congress to promote the American cause in France, and his standing as a model of republican simplicity within French society, Benjamin Franklin was able to gain a secret loan and clandestine military assistance from the Foreign Minister but was forced to put off negotiations on a formal alliance while the French government negotiated a possible alliance with Spain.

With the defeat of Britain at the Battle of Saratoga and growing rumors of secret British peace offers to Franklin, France sought to seize an opportunity to take advantage of the rebellion and abandoned negotiations with the Dutch Republic to begin discussions with the United States on a formal alliance. With official approval to begin negotiations on a formal alliance given by King Louis XVI, the colonies turned down a British proposal for reconciliation in January 1778 and began negotiations that would result in the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and The Treaty of Alliance.

== Terms and provisions ==

The Treaty of Alliance was in effect an insurance policy for France, which guaranteed the support of the United States if Britain broke the peace that it had with the French &quot;either by direct hostilities, or by (hindering) her commerce and navigation,&quot; as a result of the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce. The treaty noted the terms and conditions of the military alliance, established requirements for the signing of future peace treaties to end hostilities with the British, and provided for other nations, namely Spain, to join as allies.

===Articles 1–4: Terms of the alliance===
The first articles of the treaty establish a general alliance between the two nations. Articles 1-3 stipulate that in the case that war broke out between France and Britain during the continuing hostilities of the American Revolutionary War, a military alliance would be formed between France and the United States, which would combine each respective military force and efforts for the direct purpose of maintaining the &quot;liberty, Sovereignty, and independence absolute and unlimited of the said united States, as well in Matters of Gouvernment as of commerce.&quot; Article 4 further stipulates that the alliance would continue for &quot;any particular enterprise&quot; indefinitely into the future.

===Articles 5–9: Terms and conditions of peace treaties with England===
This portion of the treaty pre-emptively divides any lands obtained from Great Britain by successful military campaigns or concessions made by Britain in peace treaties to end hostilities with the signing nations. The United States was effectively guaranteed control of any land that it could gain possession of in North America, besides the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which France had retained possession of after the Seven Years&#x27; War, and Bermuda since King Louis XVI of France renounced &quot;for ever the possession of the Islands of Bermudas as well as of any part of the continent of North America which before the treaty of Paris in 1763, or in virtue of that Treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the Crown of Great Britain, or to the United States heretofore called British Colonies, or which are at this Time or have lately been under the Power of The King and Crown of Great Britain.&quot; In return, the King was guaranteed &quot;any of the Islands situated in the Gulph of Mexico, or near that Gulph&quot; of which France could gain possession.
Additional clauses insured that neither France nor the United States would seek to make any additional claims of compensation for their services during the conflict and that neither side would cease fighting or sign a peace treaty with Britain without the consent of the other nation and insurances that the independence of the United States would be recognized by Britain.

===Article 10: Open invitation to other nations===
Article 10 of the treaty, although largely directed to Spain, invited any other nations &quot;who may have received injuries from England&quot; to negotiate terms and conditions for joining the alliance.

===Article 11: Pledge to honor land claims===
Article 11 pledged to honor the lands claims of both nations forever into the future, with the United States guaranteeing full support of France&#x27;s current land claims and any lands it acquired during the war against all other nations and France, in turn, pledged support for the American land claims and guaranteed to help preserve the country&#x27;s &quot;liberty, Sovereignty, and Independence absolute, and unlimited, as well in Matters of Government as commerce.&quot;

===Article 12–13: Effective dates of the treaty, ratification, and signing delegates===
Article 12 establishes the agreement as a conditional treaty that would take effect only upon a declaration of war between France and Britain, and it made the land, and diplomatic guarantees laid out in the treaty dependent upon the completion of the American Revolutionary War and a peace treaty that formally establishes each nation&#x27;s land possessions.

== Signing and aftermath ==
On February 6, 1778, Benjamin Franklin and the two other commissioners, Arthur Lee and Silas Deane, signed the treaty on behalf of the United States, and Conrad Alexandre Gérard signed on behalf of France.

On March 13, 1778, France informed Britain of its signing of the treaties and subsequent recognition of the United States as an independent nation; four days later, Britain declared war on France, thereby bringing the French into the American Revolutionary War. Their entry led to a significant escalation, as what would otherwise have been a &quot;lopsided colonial rebellion&quot; became a much larger and more complex geopolitical conflict with one of the world&#x27;s premier superpowers.

As contemplated by the Treaty of Alliance, Spain allied with France against Britain through the Treaty of Aranjuez on April 12, 1779. The Franco-Spanish siege on Gibraltar, though ultimately unsuccessful, served to sap British manpower and war material from North America. The Dutch Republic joined the conflict the following year, when Britain declared war after seizing a Dutch merchant ship alleged to be carrying contraband to France. Although the Dutch did not formally ally with the United States, their role as co-belligerents with France further occupied British forces, particularly in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean. The Dutch Republic also became the second nation to officially recognize U.S. independence, in 1782, and concluded its own commercial and navigation treaty with America.

After the signing of the treaty, an influx of French arms, ammunition, and uniforms proved vital for the Continental Army, while their military actions in the West Indies and elsewhere forced Britain to redeploy troops and naval units away from the North American colonies to secure their holdings. French involvement in the war would prove to be exceedingly important during the Siege of Yorktown, when 10,800 French regulars and 29 French warships, under the command of the Comte de Rochambeau and Comte de Grasse respectively, joined forces with General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette to obtain the surrender of Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s Southern army, and effectively bringing an end to the fighting on the North American mainland for the remainder of the war. Despite British efforts to negotiate separate treaties with their opponents, Spain, France, and the United States held together during their negotiations with Britain, and concluded hostilities by signing the 1783 Treaty of Paris.

===Deteriorating relations===
Almost immediately after the signing of the 1783 Treaty of Paris, Americans began to question whether the lack of an end date for the military alliance had essentially created a perpetual alliance between the United States and France. Those Americans who disliked the proposition of being eternally tied to France—most notably the Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and his supporters in the Federalist Party—seized on the French Revolution as a chance to officially the treaty. Despite a consensus of European monarchs who considered the treaty nullified by the execution of Louis XVI during the French Revolution, President George Washington sided with his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and declared that the treaty was still in effect, notwithstanding the regime change in France.

Although the Washington Administration had declared that the treaty remained valid, President Washington&#x27;s formal Proclamation of Neutrality, and the subsequent Neutrality Act of 1794, effectively invalidated the military provisions of the treaty and touched off a period of increasingly deteriorated relations between the two nations. The efforts of the new French Minister Edmond-Charles Genêt to raise militias and privateers to attack Spanish lands and British warships, during the Citizen Genet Affair and despite Washington&#x27;s pledge of neutrality, turned public opinion against the French and led to the resignation of Thomas Jefferson, a longtime supporter of the French cause, as Secretary of State. In turn, the signing of Treaty of London of 1794, or Jay&#x27;s Treaty, convinced many in France that the Americans were treacherous, having surrendered to British demands and abandoned their French allies, despite the assistance they had provided the United States in their own fight for independence during the American Revolutionary War. 

The alliance was further attacked in President Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address, in which he declared that the United States was not obligated to honor the military provisions of the treaty, and furthermore warned Americans of the dangers of the same kind of permanent alliances that the United States was currently engaged in with France, as a result of the Treaty of Alliance. The growing public sentiment against the treaty peaked during the presidency of John Adams, when revolutionary France refused to receive American envoys, and normalize relations, during the XYZ Affair; this resulted in the treaty being annulled by Congress on July 7, 1798. French seizures of American naval vessels during the French Revolutionary Wars led to the Quasi-War and further tensions between the erstwhile allies; the Treaty of Mortefontaine of 1800, which brought an end to the conflict, also formally abrogated the Treaty of Alliance.

<text>The Jay–Gardoqui Treaty (also known as the Liberty Treaty with Spain) of 1786 between the United States and Spain was not ratified. It would have guaranteed Spanish exclusive right to navigate the Mississippi River for 25 years. It also opened Spain&#x27;s European and West Indian ports to American shipping. However, the Treaty was opposed by Virginia leaders James Madison and James Monroe who secured its rejection by the Continental Congress.

With a weak central government that delegated most decisions to individual states, American foreign policy was disjointed. European powers looked at the new nation as a weakling, and tried to run roughshod over it. American nationalists realized the problem, and used the weakness in dealing with foreign powers as one of the reasons for installing a new constitution in 1789. Spain had numerous schemes to keep the new nation weak, including closing the Mississippi River to its traffic, and forming alliances with Indian tribes along its southern border.

On the other hand, Spanish merchants welcomed trade with the new nation, which had been impossible when it was a British colony. Madrid therefore encouraged the United States to set up consulates in Spain&#x27;s New World colonies. American merchants and Eastern cities likewise wanted to open trade with the Spanish colonies which had been forbidden before 1775. A new line of commerce involved American merchants importing goods from Britain, and then reselling them to the Spanish colonies.

When Spain closed the port of New Orleans to American commerce in 1784, Congress sent John Jay to Madrid to achieve terms to open the Mississippi to Americans. Gardoqui, however, arrived in New York in June 1785 and Spanish-American treaty negotiations began soon after. A year&#x27;s worth of diplomacy resulted in the ambassadors signing an agreement that ignored the problem of the Mississippi in exchange for commercial advantages benefiting the Northeast (the Jay–Gardoqui Treaty). Congress rejected the treaty, and the issue smoldered for ten more years. Congress also claimed lands in the west still occupied by the British and Spaniards, but could not forcefully challenge those nations for control of the land.

<text>The Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, Between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, commonly known as the Jay Treaty, and also as Jay&#x27;s Treaty, was a 1794 treaty between the United States and Great Britain that averted war, resolved issues remaining since the 1783 Treaty of Paris (which ended the American Revolutionary War), and facilitated ten years of peaceful trade between Americans and the British in the midst of the French Revolutionary Wars, which had begun in 1792. For the Americans, the treaty&#x27;s policy was designed by Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, supported by President George Washington. It angered France and bitterly divided American public opinion, encouraging the growth of two opposing American political parties, the pro-Treaty Federalists and the anti-Treaty Democratic-Republicans.

The treaty was negotiated by John Jay (also a negotiator of the earlier Paris treaty) and gained several of the primary American goals. This included a British withdrawal from forts in the Northwest Territory that Britain had refused to relinquish under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. The British had refused to do so as the United States had reneged on Articles 4 and 6 of the Treaty of Paris; American state courts impeded the collection of debts owed to British creditors and upheld the continued confiscation of Loyalist-owned property in spite of an explicit understanding that such prosecutions would be immediately discontinued. Both parties agreed that disputes over wartime debts and the boundaries of the Canada–United States border were to be sent to arbitration (one of the first major uses of arbitration in modern diplomatic history), which set a precedent used by other nations. American merchants were granted limited rights to trade with the British West Indies in exchange for limits on export of cotton from the U.S.

Signed on November 19, 1794 during the Thermidorian Reaction in France, the treaty was submitted to the United States Senate for its advice and consent the following June. It was ratified by the Senate on June 24, 1795, by a two-thirds majority vote of 20–10 (exactly the minimum number necessary for concurrence). It was also ratified by the First Pitt ministry, and took effect February 29, 1796, the day when ratifications were officially exchanged.

The treaty was hotly contested by Democratic-Republicans in each state. An effort was made to block it in the House of Representatives, which ultimately failed. Democratic-Republican politicians feared that closer American economic and political ties with Britain would strengthen Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist Party, promote aristocracy and undercut republicanism. This debate crystallized the emerging partisan divisions and shaped the new &quot;First Party System&quot;, with Federalists favoring the British and Democratic-Republicans favoring France. The treaty was to last for ten years, and efforts failed to agree on a replacement treaty in 1806 when Jefferson rejected the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty in the lead-up to the War of 1812.

==Issues==
The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in Europe in 1792 ended the long peace that had enabled the new United States to flourish in terms of trade and finance. The Americans emerged as an important neutral country with a large shipping trade. From the British perspective, improving their relations with the United States was a high priority lest it move into the French sphere of influence. British negotiators ignored elements in Britain that wanted harsher terms in order to get a suitable treaty. From the American viewpoint, the most pressing foreign policy issues were normalizing the trade relations with Britain, the United States&#x27; leading trading partner, and resolving issues left over from the Treaty of Paris. As one observer explained, the British government was &quot;well disposed to America... They have made their arrangements upon a plan that comprehends the neutrality of the United States, and are anxious that it should be preserved.&quot;

After Britain became involved in the conflict against France in 1793, the Royal Navy seized nearly 300 American merchant ships trading with the French West Indies. The American public was outraged and Republicans in Jefferson&#x27;s coalition demanded a declaration of war on Britain, but James Madison instead called for an embargo on British trade instead. 

At the same time, the British continued to supply weapons to Native Americans resisting U.S. expansion in the Ohio Country, further worsening Anglo-American relations. Congress voted on a trade embargo against Britain in March 1794. It was approved in the House of Representatives but defeated in the Senate when Vice-President John Adams cast a tie-breaking vote against it. At the national level American politics was divided between the factions of Jefferson and Madison, which favored the French, and the Federalists led by Hamilton, who saw Britain as a natural ally and thus sought to normalize relations with the British, especially in the area of trade. President George Washington sided with Hamilton. Hamilton devised a framework for negotiations, and Washington sent Chief Justice of the United States John Jay to London to negotiate a comprehensive treaty.

The U.S. government had several outstanding issues to resolve with Britain: 
* The British were continuing to occupy forts on U.S. territory in the Great Lakes region, specifically the forts of Detroit and Mackinac in modern-day Michigan, Niagara and Oswego in New York, and Miami in modern-day Ohio. Britain refused to withdraw from the forts in response to American refusals to pay debts that had been agreed upon or halt the confiscation of Loyalist properties.
* The Royal Navy was impressing U.S. citizens who were allegedly British deserters from the Navy.
* U.S. merchants wanted compensation for the almost 300 American merchantmen which the Royal Navy had seized between 1793 and 1794.
* Southern interests wanted financial compensation for the U.S. enslavers whose slaves had escaped to British lines and been evacuated at the end of the Revolutionary War.
* U.S. merchants wanted the British West Indies to be reopened to American trade.
* The boundary with Canada was vague in many places, and needed to be more sharply delineated.
* The British were providing weapons and ammunition to Native Americans in the Northwest Territory who were resisting U.S. expansion.

==Treaty terms==
Both sides achieved many objectives. Several issues were sent to arbitration, which (after years of discussion) were resolved amicably mostly in favor of the U.S. Britain paid $11,650,000 for damages to American shipping and received £600,000 for unpaid pre-1775 debts. While international arbitration was not entirely unknown, the Jay Treaty gave it a strong impetus and is generally taken as the start of modern international arbitration.

The British agreed to vacate its forts in United States territory—six in the Great Lakes region and two at the north end of Lake Champlain—by June 1796; which was done. They were:
The treaty was &quot;surprisingly generous&quot; in allowing Americans to trade with Great Britain on a most-favored-nation basis. In return, the United States gave most favored nation trading status to Britain, and acquiesced in British anti-French maritime policies. American merchants obtained limited rights to trade in the British West Indies. Two joint boundary commissions were set up to establish the boundary line in the Northeast (it agreed on one) and in the Northwest (this commission never met and the boundary was settled after the War of 1812).

Jay, a strong opponent of slavery despite being a slaveholder, dropped the issue of compensation to U.S. enslavers, which angered Southern slaveholders and was used as a target for attacks by Jeffersonians. Jay was unsuccessful in negotiating a temporary end to the impressment of American citizens into the Royal Navy, which later became a key issue leading to the War of 1812.

===Native American rights===
Article III states, &quot;It is agreed, that it shall at all times be free to His Majesty&#x27;s subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass, by land or inland navigation into the respective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America, (the country within the limits of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company only excepted) ... and freely carry on trade and commerce with each other.&quot; Article III of the Jay Treaty declared the right of Native Americans, American citizens, and Canadian subjects to trade and travel between the United States and Canada, which was then a territory of Great Britain. Some legal experts dispute whether the treaty rights were abrogated by the War of 1812. Nevertheless, the United States has codified this right in the provisions of Section 289 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and as amended in 1965. As a result of the Jay Treaty, &quot;Native Indians born in Canada are therefore entitled to enter the United States for the purpose of employment, study, retirement, investing, and/or immigration&quot; if they can prove that they have at least 50% blood quantum, and cannot be deported for any reason. Article III of the Jay Treaty is the basis of most Native American claims. Unlike other legal immigrants, Canadian-born Native Americans residing in the US are entitled to public benefits and domestic tuition fees on the same basis as citizens.

==Approval and dissent==

Washington submitted the treaty to the United States Senate for its consent in June 1795; a two-thirds vote was needed. The treaty was unpopular at first and gave the Jeffersonians a platform to rally new supporters. As historian Paul Varg explains,

The Jay Treaty was a reasonable give-and-take compromise of the issues between the two countries. What rendered it so assailable was not the compromise spelled out between the two nations but the fact that it was not a compromise between the two political parties at home. Embodying the views of the Federalists, the treaty repudiated the foreign policy of the opposing party.

The Jeffersonians were opposed to Britain, preferring support for France in the wars raging in Europe, and they argued that the treaty with France from 1778 was still in effect. They considered Britain as the center of aristocracy and the chief threat to the United States&#x27; republican values. They denounced Hamilton and Jay (and even Washington) as monarchists who betrayed American values. They organized public protests against Jay and his treaty; one of their rallying cries said: &quot;Damn John Jay! Damn everyone that won&#x27;t damn John Jay! Damn every one that won&#x27;t put lights in his window and sit up all night damning John Jay!&quot; Town hall meetings in Philadelphia turned from debate to disorder in the summer of 1795 as rocks were thrown, British officials harassed, and a copy of the treaty burnt at the door of one of America&#x27;s wealthiest merchants and U.S. Senator, William Bingham.

The treaty was one of the major catalysts for the advent of the First Party System in the United States by further dividing the two major political factions within the country. The Federalist Party, led by Hamilton, supported the treaty. On the contrary, the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Jefferson and Madison, opposed it. Jefferson and his supporters had a counter-proposal to establish &quot;a direct system of commercial hostility with Great Britain&quot;, even at the risk of war. The Jeffersonians raised public opinion to fever pitch by accusing the British of supporting Native American attacks on U.S. colonizers on the frontier. The fierce debates over the treaty in 1794–95, according to one historian, &quot;transformed the Republican movement into a Republican party&quot;. To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians &quot;established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns&quot;. Jay&#x27;s failure to obtain compensation for &quot;lost&quot; slaves galvanized the South into opposition.

Washington supported the Jay Treaty because he did not want American merchant ships to be at risk of being seized by the powerful Royal Navy, and he decided to take his chances with a hostile French Navy that would mostly be bottled up in Europe by the British blockade. By backing the treaty, he sacrificed the unanimous respect and goodwill that the whole country had given across his service as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, president of the Constitutional Convention, and President of the United States to that point. He was heavily criticized in Democratic-Republican areas of the country like his home state of Virginia. Numerous protestors would picket Mount Vernon and show their anger towards him. Newspapers and cartoons showed Washington being sent to the guillotine. A common protest rally cry was, &quot;A speedy death to General Washington.&quot; Some protestors even wanted Washington to be impeached. It was only after Washington&#x27;s death in 1799 when the whole country reunited and wholeheartedly respected him again.

The Federalists fought back and Congress rejected the Jefferson–Madison counter-proposals. Washington threw his great prestige behind the treaty, and Federalists rallied public opinion more effectively than did their opponents. Hamilton convinced President Washington that it was the best treaty that could be expected. Washington insisted that the U.S. must remain neutral in the European wars; he signed it, and his prestige carried the day in Congress. The Federalists made a strong, systematic appeal to public opinion, which rallied their own supporters and shifted the debate. Washington and Hamilton outmaneuvered Madison, who was opposition leader. Hamilton by then was out of the government, and he was the dominant figure who helped secure the treaty&#x27;s approval by the needed vote in the Senate. The Senate passed a resolution in June, advising the President to amend the treaty by suspending the 12th article, which concerned trade between the U.S. and the West Indies. In mid-August, the Senate ratified the treaty 20–10, with the condition that the treaty contain specific language regarding the June 24 resolution. President Washington signed it in late August. The treaty was proclaimed in effect on February 29, 1796, but there remained one final, bitter legislative battle. The House of Representatives, which had a Democratic-Republican majority, had to agree to appropriate the funds needed to fulfill the Jay Treaty&#x27;s terms. In April 1796, after two months of bitter fighting that could have doomed the treaty if the House refused to pass the funding related to the Jay Treaty, Federalist Representative Fisher Ames limped to the podium despite being gravely sick and gave an impassioned speech that was later described as one of the greatest speeches in American history in defense of the Jay Treaty. After the 90-minute speech he fell exhausted in his chair and there was an emotional silence in a sign of bipartisan respect for his speech. In the final vote on April 29, 1796, the impasse was stuck in a 49 to 49 tie. The first Speaker of the House (no longer in that office by 1796), Democratic-Republican Representative Frederick Muhlenberg, was chairman of the Committee of the Whole that was responsible for this funding bill. The year before he had led protests that included burning copies of the Jay Treaty in front of the home of the British ambassador to the United States, George Hammond. Everyone in the House chamber believed Muhlenberg was going to kill the Jay Treaty. He shockingly voted yes to fund the treaty. The final vote after one representative flipped his vote to support Muhlenberg after Muhlenberg&#x27;s tiebreaking decision was 51 to 48. As a symbol of how chaotic and violent the anti-Jay Treaty protests were from 1794 to 1796 Muhlenberg not only killed his political career with his decision but he was stabbed by his brother-in-law who believed he had committed treason when he voted in support of the funding of the Jay Treaty. Muhlenberg survived the attack but faded into obscurity for the rest of his life, never winning another election.

James Madison, then a member of the House of Representatives, argued that the treaty could not, under Constitutional law, take effect without approval of the House, since it regulated commerce and exercised legislative powers granted to Congress. The debate which followed was an early example of originalism, in which Madison, the &quot;Father of the Constitution&quot;, lost. One feature of this nationwide constitutional debate was an advisory opinion on the subject written by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth, in which he rejected any alleged right of the House of Representatives to decide upon the merits of the treaty. After defeat on the treaty in Congress, the Jeffersonian Republicans lost the 1796 presidential election on the issue.

When Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, he did not repudiate the treaty. He kept the Federalist minister, Rufus King, in London to negotiate a successful resolution to outstanding issues regarding cash payments and boundaries. The amity broke down when the treaty expired in 1805. Jefferson rejected a renewal of the Jay Treaty in the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty of 1806 as negotiated by his diplomats and agreed to by London. Relations turned increasingly hostile as a prelude to the War of 1812. In 1815, the Treaty of Ghent superseded the Jay Treaty.

The treaty led to the permanent rupture of decades of close friendship and camaraderie between President Washington and the anti-Jay Treaty Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Jefferson wrote a scathing private letter that secretly called Washington senile and an “apostate” who subverted American liberty to “the harlot England”. He also secretly financed and ordered newspapers to personally attack Washington with accusations of mental illness and treason. Madison, even though he wrote the Constitution, claimed as a partisan Democratic-Republican member of the House of Representatives that the House also has an equal role in the treaty-making process. Washington had to personally find the secret minutes of the 1787 Constitutional Convention where Madison himself said treaties are conducted by only the Senate and President, and he had to argue against Madison with Madison&#x27;s own words from the Constitutional Convention. Madison forced Washington to invoke executive privilege over this issue. Washington never saw or spoke to Jefferson and Madison ever again after the ratification of the Jay Treaty. Martha Washington said that the election of Jefferson as president in 1800 was the second worst day of her life after the death of her husband, and she believed the shocking words and actions by them towards Washington hastened his death only 2 years after leaving office.

==Evaluations==
Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick note that, in conventional diplomatic terms and as a &quot;piece of adversary bargaining&quot;, Jay &quot;got much the worst of the &#x27;bargain&#x27;. Such a view has to a great degree persisted ever since.&quot; They conclude that Jay did not succeed in asserting neutral rights, but he did obtain &quot;his other &quot;sine qua nons&quot;&quot;; he got none of things that were &quot;desirable, but not indispensable&quot;. They add that Jay&#x27;s record on the symbolic side was open to many objections. However, on the &quot;hard&quot; (or realistic) side, &quot;it was a substantial success, which included the prevention of war with Great Britain&quot;.

Historian Marshall Smelser argues that the treaty effectively postponed war with Britain, or at least postponed it until the United States was strong enough to handle it. Bradford Perkins argued in 1955 that the treaty was the first to establish a special relationship between Britain and the United States, with a second installment under Lord Salisbury. In his view, the treaty worked for ten years to secure peace between Britain and America: &quot;The decade may be characterized as the period of &#x27;The First Rapprochement&#x27;.&quot; As Perkins concludes,

For about ten years there was peace on the frontier, joint recognition of the value of commercial intercourse, and even, by comparison with both preceding and succeeding epochs, a muting of strife over ship seizures and impressment. Two controversies with France ... pushed the English-speaking powers even more closely together.

Starting at swords&#x27; point in 1794, the Jay Treaty reversed the tensions; Perkins concludes: &quot;Through a decade of world war and peace, successive governments on both sides of the Atlantic were able to bring about and preserve a cordiality which often approached genuine friendship.&quot; Perkins suggests that, except perhaps the opening of trade with British India, &quot;Jay did fail to win anything the Americans were not obviously entitled to, liberation of territory recognized as theirs since 1782, and compensation for seizures that even Britain admitted were illegal&quot;. He also speculates that a &quot;more astute negotiator than the Chief Justice&quot; would have gotten better terms than he did. He quoted the opinion of &quot;great historian&quot; Henry Adams that the treaty was a &quot;bad one&quot;:

No one would venture on its merits to defend it now. There has been no time since 1810 when the United States would not prefer war to peace on such terms.

Perkins gave more weight than other historians to valuable concessions regarding trade with British India and the concession on the West Indies trade. In addition, Perkins noted that the Royal Navy treated American commerce with &quot;relative leniency&quot; during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and many impressed seamen were returned to America. As Spain assessed the informal Anglo-American alliance, it softened its previous opposition to the United States&#x27; use of the Mississippi River and signed Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty, which the Americans wanted. When Jefferson took office, he gained renewal of the commercial articles that had greatly benefited American shipping.

Elkins and McKitrick find this more positive view open to &quot;one big difficulty&quot;: it requires that the British negotiated in the same spirit. Unlike Perkins, they find &quot;little indication of this&quot;. George Herring&#x27;s 2008 history of US foreign policy says that, in 1794, &quot;the United States and Britain edged toward war&quot; and concludes, &quot;The Jay Treaty brought the United States important concessions and served its interests well.&quot; Joseph Ellis finds the terms of the treaty &quot;one-sided in Britain&#x27;s favor&quot;, but asserts with a consensus of historians that it was

a shrewd bargain for the United States. It bet, in effect, on England rather than France as the hegemonic European power of the future, which proved prophetic. It recognized the massive dependence of the American economy on trade with England. In a sense it was a precocious preview of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), for it linked American security and economic development to the British fleet, which provided a protective shield of incalculable value throughout the nineteenth century. Mostly, it postponed war with England until America was economically and politically more capable of fighting one.
==In popular culture==

In the HBO miniseries &quot;John Adams&quot;, Vice President John Adams is shown casting the tiebreaker vote in favor of ratifying the Jay Treaty. In reality, his vote was never required as the Senate passed the resolution by 20–10. Furthermore, the Vice President would never be required to cast a vote in a treaty ratification, because the Vice President votes only in case of a tie, and Article II of the Constitution requires that treaties receive a two-thirds vote for approval. Vice President Adams had however earlier cast a tie-breaking vote in opposition to a trade embargo on the British in 1794.

<text>Igor Sergeyevich Ivanov (; born 23 September 1945) is a Russian politician and diplomat who was Foreign Minister of Russia from 1998 to 2004 under both the Yeltsin and the Putin administrations.

== Early life ==
Ivanov was born in 1945 in Moscow to a Russian father and a Georgian mother (Elena Sagirashvili). In 1969 he graduated at the Maurice Thorez Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages (Moscow State Linguistic University). He joined the Soviet Foreign Ministry in 1973 and spent a decade in Spain. He returned to the Soviet Union in 1983. In 1991 he became the ambassador in Madrid.

==Minister of Foreign Affairs==
He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on September 11, 1998. As Russian foreign minister, Ivanov was an opponent of NATO&#x27;s action in Yugoslavia. He was also an opponent of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Ivanov played a key role in mediating a deal between Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and opposition parties during Georgia&#x27;s &quot;Rose Revolution&quot; in 2003.

==Later career==
Ivanov was succeeded by Sergey Lavrov as foreign minister in 2004, and appointed by President Vladimir Putin to the post of Secretary of the Russian Security Council. On 9 July 2007, he submitted his resignation, which was accepted by President Putin on 18 July.

Ivanov is the president of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), and is a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO-University), a member of the Supervisory Council of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, and a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation.

In 2011, Ivanov became a member of the Advisory Council of The Hague Institute for Global Justice, and in 2014 worked for &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;. In recent years, he appears to be staying out of the limelight and not getting involved in politics and public activities proactively.

<text>The Drakensberg (Zulu: uKhahlamba, Sotho: Maloti, Afrikaans: Drakensberge) is the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment, which encloses the central Southern African plateau. The Great Escarpment reaches its greatest elevation – within the border region of South Africa and Lesotho.

The Drakensberg escarpment stretches for more than from the Eastern Cape Province in the South, then successively forms, in order from south to north, the border between Lesotho and the Eastern Cape and the border between Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal Province. Thereafter it forms the border between KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State, and next as the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga Province. The escarpment winds north from there, through Mpumalanga, where it includes features such as the Blyde River Canyon, Three Rondavels, and God&#x27;s Window. It then extends farther north to Hoedspruit in southeastern Limpopo where it is known as &#x27;Klein Drakensberg&#x27; by the Afrikaner. From Hoedspruit it extends west to Tzaneen, also in Limpopo Province, where it is known as the Wolkberg Mountains and Iron Crown Mountain. At above sea level, the Wolkberg is the highest elevation in Limpopo. The escarpment extends west again and at Mokopane it is known as the Strydpoort Mountains.

== Etymology ==

The Afrikaans name &quot;Drakensberge&quot; comes from the name the earliest Dutch settlers gave to the escarpment, namely &quot;Drakensbergen&quot;, or &quot;Dragons&#x27; Mountains&quot;. The highest portion of the Great Escarpment is known in Zulu as &quot;uKhahlamba&quot; and as &quot;Maloti&quot; in Sotho (&quot;Barrier of up-pointed spears&quot;).

== Geology==
===Origins===

The Great Escarpment is composed of steep rift valley walls formed around a bulging of continental crust during the breakup of southern Gondwana that have since eroded inland from their original positions near the southern African coast, and its entire eastern portion (see the accompanying map) constitutes the Drakensberg. The Drakensberg terminate in the north near Tzaneen at about the 22° S parallel. The absence of the Great Escarpment for approximately to the north of Tzaneen (to reappear on the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the Chimanimani Mountains) is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused Antarctica to start drifting away from southern Africa during the breakup of Gondwana about 150 million years ago. The lower Limpopo River and Save River drain into the Indian Ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley, which now forms part of the South African Lowveld.

During the past 20 million years, southern Africa has experienced massive uplifting, especially in the east, with the result that most of the plateau lies above despite extensive erosion. The plateau is tilted such that it is highest in the east and slopes gently downward toward the west and south. Typically, the elevation of the edge of the eastern escarpments is in excess of . It reaches its highest point of over where the escarpment forms part of the international border between Lesotho and the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.

=== Appearance ===
The escarpment seen from below resembles a range of mountains. The Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and Lesotho Drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very rugged appearance, combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles (giving rise to the Zulu name &quot;Barrier of up-pointed spears&quot;). Who first gave these mountains their Afrikaans or Dutch name &quot;Drakensberg&quot;, and why, is unknown. The KwaZulu-Natal – Free State Drakensberg are composed of softer rocks and therefore have a more rounded, softer appearance from below. Generally, the top of the escarpment is almost table-top flat and smooth, even in Lesotho. The &quot;Lesotho Mountains&quot; are formed away from the Drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys which turn into deep valleys containing tributaries of the Orange River. The large number of such tributaries give the Lesotho Highlands a very rugged mountainous appearance, both from the ground and from the air.

The higher parts of Drakensberg have a mildly periglacial environment. It is possible that recent climate change has diminished the intensity of periglaciation.

Knight and Grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the Drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas – the highest areas – with this blasting effect. Previously, angular debris was presumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, periglacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost.

=== Composition ===

The geological composition of Drakensberg (escarpment wall) varies considerably along its more than 1000 km length. The Limpopo and Mpumalanga Drakensberg are capped by an erosion resistant quartzite layer that is part of the Transvaal Supergroup, which also forms the Magaliesberg to the north and northwest of Pretoria. These rocks are more than 2000 million years old. South of the 26°S parallel the Drakensberg escarpment is composed of Ecca shales, which belong to the Karoo Supergroup, and they are 300 million years old. The portion of the Drakensberg that forms the KwaZulu-Natal – Free State border is formed by slightly younger Beaufort rocks (250 million years old) that also are part of the Karoo Supergroup.

The Ecca and Beaufort groups are composed of sedimentary rocks that are less erosion resistant than the other rocks that make up the Drakensberg escarpment. Therefore, this portion of escarpment is not so impressive as the Mpumalanga and Lesotho stretches of the Drakensberg. The Drakensberg that form the northeastern and eastern borders of Lesotho, as well as the Eastern Cape Drakensberg, are composed of a thick layer of basalt (lava) that erupted 180 million years ago. That layer rests on the youngest of the Karoo Supergroup sediments, the Clarens sandstone, which was laid down under desert conditions, about 200 million years ago.

==Geography==
=== Peaks ===

The highest peak is Thabana Ntlenyana, at . Other notable peaks include Mafadi (), Makoaneng at , Njesuthi at , Champagne Castle at , Giant&#x27;s Castle at , Ben Macdhui at , and Popple Peak at , all of these are in the area bordering on Lesotho, which contains an area popular for hikers, Cathedral Peak. North of Lesotho the range becomes lower and less rugged until entering Mpumalanga where the quartzite mountains of the Transvaal Drakensberg are loftier and more broken and they form the eastern rim of the Transvaal Basin, the Blyde River Canyon lying within this stretch. The geology of this section is the same as, and continuous with, that of the Magaliesberg.

=== Mountain passes ===
== Ecology ==

The high treeless peaks of the Drakensberg (from upward) have been described by the World Wide Fund for Nature as the &quot;Drakensberg alti-montane grasslands and woodlands&quot; ecoregion. These steep slopes are the most southerly high mountains in Africa, and being farther from the equator provide cooler habitats at lower elevations than most mountain ranges on the continent. High rainfall generates many mountain streams and rivers, including the sources of the Orange River, southern Africa&#x27;s longest, and the Tugela River.

These mountains also have the world&#x27;s highest waterfall, the Tugela Falls (Thukela Falls), which has a total drop of (Venezuela&#x27;s Angel Falls is also a candidate for highest waterfall). The rivers that run from the Drakensberg are an essential resource for South Africa&#x27;s economy, providing water for the industrial provinces of Mpumalanga and Gauteng, which contains the city of Johannesburg. The climate is wet and cool at the high elevations, which experience snowfall in winter.

The grassy lower slopes (from ) of the Drakensberg in Eswatini, South Africa and Lesotho constitute the &quot;Drakensberg montane grasslands, woodlands, and forests&quot; ecoregion.

=== Flora ===
The mountains are rich in plant life, including a large number of species listed in the Red Data Book of threatened plants, with 119 species listed as globally endangered and &quot;of the 2 153 plant species in the park, a remarkable 98 are endemic or near-endemic&quot;.

The &quot;flora of the high alti-montane grasslands&quot; is mainly tussock grass, creeping plants, and small shrubs such as ericas. These include the rare Spiral Aloe &quot;(Aloe polyphylla)&quot;, which as its name suggests, has leaves with a spiral shape.

Meanwhile, the &quot;lower slopes&quot; are mainly grassland, but are also home to conifers, which are rare in Africa, the species of conifer found in the Drakensberg belong to the genus Podocarpus. The grassland is of interest as it contains a great number of endemic plants. Grasses found here include oat grass &quot;Monocymbium ceresiiforme&quot;, &quot;Diheteropogon filifolius&quot;, &quot;Sporobolus centrifugus&quot;, caterpillar grass &quot;(Harpochloa falx)&quot;, &quot;Cymbopogon dieterlenii&quot;, and Eulalia villosa.

In the highest part of Drakensberg the composition of the flora is independent on slope aspect (direction) and varies, depending on the hardness of the rock clasts. This hardness is related to weathering and is variable even within a single landform.

=== Fauna ===

The Drakensberg area is &quot;home to 299 recorded bird species&quot;&#x27; making up &quot;37% of all non-marine avian species in southern Africa&quot;. There are 24 species of snakes in the Drakensberg, two of which are highly venomous.

One bird is endemic to the high peaks, the mountain pipit &quot;(Anthus hoeschi)&quot;, and another six species are found mainly here: Bush blackcap &quot;(Lioptilus nigricapillus)&quot;, buff-streaked chat &quot;(Oenanthe bifasciata)&quot;, Rudd&#x27;s lark &quot;(Heteromirafra ruddi)&quot;, Drakensberg rockjumper &quot;(Chaetops aurantius)&quot;, yellow-breasted pipit &quot;(Anthus chloris)&quot;, and Drakensberg siskin &quot;(Serinus symonsi)&quot;. The endangered Cape vulture and lesser kestrel are two of the birds of prey that hunt in the mountains. Mammals include klipspringer &quot;(Oreotragus oreotragus)&quot;, eland &quot;(Taurotragus oryx)&quot;, and mountain reedbuck &quot;(Redunca fulvorufula)&quot;. Other endemic species include three frogs found in the mountain streams, Drakensberg river frog &quot;(Amietia dracomontana)&quot;, Phofung river frog &quot;(Amietia vertebralis)&quot;, and Maluti river frog &quot;(Amietia umbraculata)&quot;. Fish are found in the many rivers and streams, including the Maluti redfin (&quot;Pseudobarbus quathlambae&quot;) that was thought to be extinct before being found in the Senqunyane River in Lesotho.
The lower slopes of the Drakensberg support much wildlife, perhaps most importantly the rare southern white rhinoceros (which was nurtured here when facing extinction) and the black wildebeest (&quot;Connochaetes gnou&quot;, which only thrives in protected areas and game reserves). The area is home to large herds of grazing fauna and antelopes such as eland &quot;(Taurotragus oryx)&quot;, reedbuck &quot;(Redunca arundinum)&quot;, mountain reedbuck &quot;(Redunca fulvorufula)&quot;, grey rhebok &quot;(Pelea capreolus)&quot;, and even some oribi &quot;(Ourebia ourebi)&quot;. Chacma baboons also are present. Endemic species include a large number of chameleons and other reptiles. There is one endemic frog, the forest rain frog &quot;(Breviceps sylvestris)&quot;, and four more species that are found mainly in these mountains; long-toed tree frog &quot;(Leptopelis xenodactylus)&quot;, plaintive rain frog &quot;(Breviceps maculatus)&quot;, rough rain frog &quot;(Breviceps verrucosus)&quot;, and Poynton&#x27;s caco &quot;(Cacosternum poyntoni)&quot;.

=== Conservation ===
The &quot;high slopes&quot; are hard to reach so the environment is fairly undamaged. However, tourism in the Drakensberg is developing, with a variety of hiking trails, hotels, and resorts appearing on the slopes. Much of the higher South African parts of the range have been designated as game reserves or wilderness areas. 7% of the Drakensberg alti-montane grasslands and woodlands ecoregion is in protected areas. These include Golden Gate Highlands National Park, Sehlabathebe National Park, Tsehlanyane National Park, Malekgalonyane Nature Reserve, Giant&#x27;s Castle Game Reserve, Loteni Nature Reserve, Natal National Park, Vergelegen Nature Reserve, Beaumont Nature Reserve, and Lammergeier Highlands Nature Reserve.

Of these the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park was listed by UNESCO in 2000 as a World Heritage site. The park also is in the List of Wetlands of International Importance (under the Ramsar Convention). The Royal Natal National Park, which contains some of the higher peaks, is part of this large park complex. Adjacent to the Ukhahlamba Drakensberg World Heritage Site is the 1900 ha Allendale Mountain Reserve, which is the largest private reserve adjoining the World Heritage Site and is found in the accessible Kamberg area, the heart of the historic San (Bushman) painting region of the Ukhahlamba.

The grassland of the &quot;lower slopes&quot; has been greatly affected by agriculture, however, especially by overgrazing. Nearly all of the original grassland and forest has disappeared and more protection is needed, although the Giant&#x27;s Castle reserve is a haven for the eland and also is a breeding ground for the bearded vulture. 5.81% of the Drakensberg montane grasslands, woodlands and forests ecoregion is in protected areas. These include Kruger National Park, Mountain Zebra National Park, Golden Gate Highlands National Park, Camdeboo National Park, Sehlabathebe National Park, and Tsehlanyane National Park.
The Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area was established to preserve some of the high mountain areas of the range.

== Human habitation ==

Towns and cities in the Drakensberg area include, from south to north, Matatiele and Barkly East in the Eastern Cape Province; Ladysmith, Newcastle, Ulundi – the former Zulu capital, Dundee, and Ixopo in KwaZulu-Natal; all of Lesotho, whose capital is Maseru; and Tzaneen in Limpopo Province.

=== San cave paintings ===
There are numerous caves in the easily eroded sandstone of Clarens Formation, the layer below the thick, hard basalt layer on the KwaZulu Natal-Lesotho border. Many of these caves have paintings by the San (Bushmen). This portion of the Drakensberg has between 35,000 and 40,000 works of San rock art, and is the largest collection of such parietal work in the world.

Some 20,000 individual rock paintings have been recorded at 500 different caves and overhanging sites between the Drakensberg Royal Natal National Park and Bushman&#x27;s Nek. Due to the materials used in their production, these paintings are difficult to date, but there is anthropological evidence, including many hunting implements, that the San people existed in the Drakensberg at least 40,000 years ago, and possibly more than 100,000 years ago. According to mountainsides.co.za, &quot;[i]n Nd edema Gorge in the Central Ginsberg 3,900 paintings have been recorded at 17 sites. One of them, Sebaayeni Cave, contains 1,146 individual paintings.&quot; The website, south Africa.info, indicates that although &quot;the oldest painting on a rock shelter wall in the Ginsberg dates back about 2400 years... paint chips at least a thousand years older have also been found.&quot; The site also indicates that &quot;[t]he rock art of the Drakensberg is the largest and most concentrated group of rock paintings in Africa south of the Sahara, and is outstanding both in quality and diversity of subject.&quot;

<text>The Shahnameh (, ), also transliterated Shahnama, is a long epic poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between and 1010 CE and is the national epic of Greater Iran. Consisting of some 50,000 distichs or couplets (two-line verses), the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s longest epic poems, and the longest epic poem created by a single author. It tells mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the seventh century. Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the greater region influenced by Persian culture such as Armenia, Dagestan, Georgia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan celebrate this national epic.

The work is of central importance in Persian culture and Persian language. It is regarded as a literary masterpiece, and definitive of the ethno-national cultural identity of Iran.

== Composition ==

Ferdowsi started writing the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; in 977 and completed it on 8 March 1010. The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is a monument of poetry and historiography, being mainly the poetical recast of what Ferdowsi, his contemporaries, and his predecessors regarded as the account of Iran&#x27;s ancient history. Many such accounts already existed in prose, an example being the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Abu-Mansur. A small portion of Ferdowsi&#x27;s work, in passages scattered throughout the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, is entirely of his own conception.

The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is an epic poem of over 50,000 couplets written in Early New Persian. It is based mainly on a prose work of the same name compiled in Ferdowsi&#x27;s earlier life in his native Tus. This prose &quot;Shahnameh&quot; was in turn and for the most part the translation of a Pahlavi (Middle Persian) work, known as the &quot;Khwadāy-Nāmag&quot; &quot;Book of Kings&quot;, a late Sasanian compilation of the history of the kings and heroes of Persia from mythical times down to the reign of Khosrow II (590–628). The &quot;Khwadāy-Nāmag&quot; contained historical information on the later Sasanian period, but it does not appear to have drawn on any historical sources for the earlier Sasanian period (3rd to 4th centuries). Ferdowsi added material continuing the story to the overthrow of the Sasanians by the Muslim armies in the middle of the seventh century.

The first to undertake the versification of the Pahlavi chronicle was Daqiqi, a contemporary of Ferdowsi, poet at the court of the Samanid Empire, who came to a violent end after completing only 1,000 verses. These verses, which deal with the rise of the prophet Zoroaster, were afterward incorporated by Ferdowsi, with acknowledgment, in his own poem. The style of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; shows characteristics of both written and oral literature. Some claim that Ferdowsi also used Zoroastrian &quot;nasks&quot;, such as the now-lost &quot;Chihrdad,&quot; as sources as well.

Many other Pahlavi sources were used in composing the epic, prominent being the &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot;, which was originally written during the late Sassanid era and gave accounts of how Ardashir I came to power which, because of its historical proximity, is thought to be highly accurate. The text is written in the late Middle Persian, which was the immediate ancestor of Modern Persian. A great portion of the historical chronicles given in &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is based on this epic and there are in fact various phrases and words which can be matched between Ferdowsi&#x27;s poem and this source, according to Zabihollah Safa.

== Content ==
Traditional historiography in Iran holds that Ferdowsi was grieved by the fall of the Sasanian Empire and its subsequent rule by Arabs and Turks. The &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the argument goes, is largely his effort to preserve the memory of Persia&#x27;s golden days and transmit it to a new generation, so that, by learning from it, they could acquire the knowledge needed to build a better world. Although most scholars have contended that Ferdowsi&#x27;s main concern was the preservation of the pre-Islamic legacy of myth and history, a number of authors have formally challenged this view.

=== Mythical age ===

This portion of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is relatively short, amounting to some 2100 verses or four percent of the entire book, and it narrates events with the simplicity, predictability, and swiftness of a historical work.

After an opening in praise of God and Wisdom, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; gives an account of the creation of the world and of man as believed by the Sasanians. This introduction is followed by the story of the first man, Keyumars, who also became the first king after a period of mountain-dwelling. His grandson Hushang, son of Siamak, accidentally discovered fire and established the Sadeh Feast in its honor. Stories of Tahmuras, Jamshid, Zahhak, Kawa or Kaveh, Fereydun and his three sons Salm, Tur, and Iraj, and his grandson Manuchehr are related in this section.

=== Heroic age ===
Almost two-thirds of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; are devoted to the age of heroes, extending from Manuchehr&#x27;s reign until the conquest of Alexander the Great. This age is also identified as the kingdom of the Kayanians, which established a long history of heroic age in which myth and legend are combined. The main feature of this period is the major role played by the Saka or Sistani heroes who appear as the backbone of the Empire. Garshasp is briefly mentioned with his son Nariman, whose own son Sam acted as the leading paladin of Manuchehr while reigning in Sistan in his own right. His successors were his son Zal and Zal&#x27;s son Rostam, the bravest of the brave, and then Faramarz.

Among the stories described in this section are the romance of Zal and Rudaba, the Seven Stages (or Labors) of Rostam, Rostam and Sohrab, Siyavash and Sudaba, Rostam and Akvan Div, the romance of Bijan and Manijeh, the wars with Afrasiab, Daqiqi&#x27;s account of the story of Goshtasp and Arjasp, and Rostam and Esfandyar.

=== Historical age ===
A brief mention of the Arsacid dynasty follows the history of Alexander and precedes that of Ardashir I, founder of the Sasanian Empire. After this, Sasanian history is related with a good deal of accuracy. The fall of the Sassanids and the Arab conquest of Persia are narrated romantically.

=== Message ===
According to Jalal Khaleghi Mutlaq, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; teaches a wide variety of moral virtues, like worship of one God; religious uprightness; patriotism; love of wife, family and children; and helping the poor.

There are themes in the Shahnameh that were viewed with suspicion by the succession of Iranian regimes. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah, the epic was largely ignored in favor of the more abstruse, esoteric and dryly intellectual Persian literature. Historians note that the theme of regicide and the incompetence of kings embedded in the epic did not sit well with the Iranian monarchy. Later, there were Muslim figures such as Ali Shariati, the hero of Islamic reformist youth of the 1970s, who were also antagonistic towards the contents of the Shahnameh since it included verses critical of Islam. These include the line: &quot;tofu bar to, ey charkh-i gardun, tofu!&quot; (spit on your face, oh heavens spit!), which Ferdowsi used as a reference to the Muslim invaders who despoiled Zoroastrianism.

== Influence on Persian language ==


After the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, a number of other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere of the Persian language. Without exception, all such works were based in style and method on the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, but none of them could quite achieve the same degree of fame and popularity.

Some experts believe the main reason the Modern Persian language today is more or less the same language as that of Ferdowsi&#x27;s time over 1000 years ago is due to the very existence of works like the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; itself has become one of the main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi&#x27;s masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; in their works.

Although 19th-century British Iranologist E. G. Browne has claimed that Ferdowsi purposefully avoided Arabic vocabulary, this claim has been challenged by modern scholarship, specifically Mohammed Moinfar, who has noted that there are numerous examples of Arabic words in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; which are effectively synonyms for Persian words previously used in the text. This calls into question the idea of Ferdowsi&#x27;s deliberate eschewing of Arabic words.

The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; has 62 stories, 990 chapters, and some 50,000 rhyming couplets, making it more than three times the length of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and more than twelve times the length of the German &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. According to Ferdowsi himself, the final edition of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; contained some sixty thousand distichs. But this is a round figure; most of the relatively reliable manuscripts have preserved a little over fifty thousand distichs. Nizami Aruzi reports that the final edition of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; sent to the court of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni was prepared in seven volumes.

== Cultural influence ==

The Shirvanshah dynasty adopted many of their names from the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. The relationship between Shirvanshah and his son, Manuchihr, is mentioned in chapter eight of Nizami&#x27;s &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot;. Nizami advises the king&#x27;s son to read the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.

According to the Turkish historian Mehmet Fuat Köprülü:

Shah Ismail I (d.1524), the founder of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, was also deeply influenced by the Persian literary tradition, particularly by the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, which probably explains the fact that he named all of his sons after &quot;Shahnameh&quot; characters. Dickson and Welch suggest that Ismail&#x27;s &quot;Shāhnāma-i Shāhī&quot; was intended as a present to the young Tahmasp. After defeating Muhammad Shaybani&#x27;s Uzbeks, Ismail asked Hatefi, a famous poet from Jam (Khorasan), to write a &quot;Shahnameh&quot;-like epic about his victories and his newly established dynasty. Although the epic was left unfinished, it was an example of &quot;mathnawis&quot; in the heroic style of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; written later on for the Safavid kings.

The &quot;Shahnameh&quot;&#x27;s influence has extended beyond the Persian sphere. Professor Victoria Arakelova of Yerevan University states:

=== On Georgian identity ===

Jamshid Giunashvili remarks on the connection of Georgian culture with that of &quot;Shahnameh&quot;:

Farmanfarmaian in the &quot;Journal of Persianate Studies&quot;:

=== On Turkic identity ===
Despite a belief held by some, the Turanian of &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (whose sources are based on Avesta and Pahlavi texts) have no relationship with Turks. The Turanians of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; are an Iranian people representing Iranian nomads of the Eurasian Steppes and have no relationship to the culture of the Turks. Turan, which is the Persian name for the areas of Central Asia beyond the Oxus up to the 7th century (where the story of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; ends), was generally an Iranian-speaking land.

According to Richard Frye, &quot;The extent of influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own ancient history as well as that of Iran... The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the &#x27;family of Afrasiyab&#x27; and so it is known in the Islamic history.&quot;

Turks, as an ethno-linguistic group, have been influenced by the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; since the advent of Seljuks. The Seljuk sultan Toghrul III is said to have recited the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; while swinging his mace in battle. According to Ibn Bibi, 1221 the Seljuk sultan of Rum Ala&#x27; al-Din Kay-kubad decorated the walls of Konya and Sivas with verses from the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. The Turks themselves connected their origin not with Turkish tribal history but with the Turanians of &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. Specifically in India, through the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, they felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to the civilized world by the thread of Iranianism.

== Legacy ==
Ferdowsi concludes the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; by writing:

Another translation of by Reza Jamshidi Safa:
Many Persian literary figures, historians and biographers have praised Ferdowsi and the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is considered by many to be the most important piece of work in Persian literature.

Western writers have also praised the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and Persian literature in general. Persian literature has been considered by such thinkers as Goethe as one of the four main bodies of world literature. Goethe was inspired by Persian literature, which moved him to write his &quot;West-Eastern Divan&quot;. Goethe wrote:

=== Biographies ===
&quot;Sargozasht-Nameh&quot; or biography of important poets and writers has long been a Persian tradition. Some of the biographies of Ferdowsi are now considered apocryphal, nevertheless, this shows the important impact he had in the Persian world. Among the famous biographies are:

# &quot;Chahar Maqaleh&quot; (&quot;Four Articles&quot;) by Nezami &#x27;Arudi-i Samarqandi
# &quot;Tazkeret Al-Shu&#x27;ara&quot; (&quot;The Biography of poets&quot;) by Dowlat Shah-i Samarqandi
# &quot;Baharestan&quot; (&quot;Abode of Spring&quot;) by Jami
# &quot;Lubab ul-Albab&quot; by Mohammad &#x27;Awfi
# &quot;Natayej al-Afkar&quot; by Mowlana Muhammad Qudrat Allah
# &quot;Arafat Al-&#x27;Ashighin&quot; by Ohadi Balyani

=== Poets ===

Famous poets of Persia and the Persian tradition have praised and eulogized Ferdowsi. Many of them were heavily influenced by his writing and used his genre and stories to develop their own Persian epics, stories and poems:

* Anvari remarked about the eloquence of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, &quot;He was not just a Teacher and we his students. He was like a God and we are his slaves&quot;.
* Asadi Tusi was born in the same city as Ferdowsi. His &quot;Garshaspnama&quot; was inspired by the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; as he attests in the introduction. He praises Ferdowsi in the introduction and considers Ferdowsi the greatest poet of his time.
* Masud Sa&#x27;ad Salman showed the influence of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; only 80 years after its composition by reciting its poems in the Ghaznavid court of India.
* Othman Mokhtari, another poet at the Ghaznavid court of India, remarked, &quot;Alive is Rustam through the epic of Ferdowsi, else there would not be a trace of him in this World&quot;.
* Sanai believed that the foundation of poetry was really established by Ferdowsi.
* Nizami Ganjavi was influenced greatly by Ferdowsi and three of his five &quot;treasures&quot; had to do with pre-Islamic Persia. His &quot;Khosro-o-Shirin&quot;, &quot;Haft Peykar&quot; and &quot;Eskandar-nameh&quot; used the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; as a major source. Nizami remarks that Ferdowsi is &quot;the wise sage of Tus&quot; who beautified and decorated words like a new bride.
* Khaqani, the court poet of the Shirvanshah, wrote of Ferdowsi: 
* Attar wrote about the poetry of Ferdowsi: &quot;Open eyes and through the sweet poetry see the heavenly eden of Ferdowsi.&quot;
* In a famous poem, Sa&#x27;adi wrote: 
* In the &quot;Baharestan&quot;, Jami wrote, &quot;He came from Tus and his excellence, renown and perfection are well known. Yes, what need is there of the panegyrics of others to that man who has composed verses as those of the Shah-nameh?&quot;

Many other poets, e.g., Hafez, Rumi and other mystical poets, have used the imagery of &quot;Shahnameh&quot; heroes in their poetry.

=== Persian historiography ===
The &quot;Shahnameh&quot;&#x27;s impact on Persian historiography was immediate, and some historians decorated their books with the verses of Shahnameh. Below is sample of ten important historians who have praised the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and Ferdowsi:

# The unknown writer of the &quot;Tarikh Sistan&quot; (&quot;History of Sistan&quot;) written around 1053
# The unknown writer of &quot;Majmal al-Tawarikh wa Al-Qasas&quot; ()
# Mohammad Ali Ravandi, the writer of the &quot;Rahat al-Sodur wa Ayat al-Sorur&quot; ()
# Ibn Bibi, the writer of the history book, &quot;Al-Awamir al-&#x27;Alaiyah&quot;, written during the era of &#x27;Ala ad-din KayGhobad
# Ibn Esfandyar, the writer of the &quot;Tarikh-e Tabarestan&quot;
# Muhammad Juwayni, the early historian of the Mongol era in the &quot;Tarikh-e Jahan Gushay&quot; (Ilkhanid era)
# Hamdollah Mostowfi Qazwini also paid much attention to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and wrote the &quot;Zafarnamah&quot; based on the same style in the Ilkhanid era
# Hafez-e Abru (1430) in the &quot;Majma&#x27; al-Tawarikh&quot;
# Khwand Mir in the &quot;Habab al-Siyar&quot; () praised Ferdowsi and gave an extensive biography on Ferdowsi
# The Arab historian Ibn Athir remarks in his book, &quot;Al-Kamil&quot;, that, &quot;If we name it the Quran of &quot;&#x27;Ajam&quot; [i.e., Persians], we have not said something in vain. If a poet writes poetry and the poems have many verses, or if someone writes many compositions, it will always be the case that some of their writings might not be excellent. But in the case of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, despite having more than 40 thousand couplets, all its verses are excellent.&quot;

=== Alexander legends ===
The &quot;Shahnameh&quot; contains the first Persian legend of Alexander the Great in the tradition of the Alexander Romance. Three sections of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; are dedicated to Alexander, running over 2,500 verses in total, and Alexander&#x27;s life is the work&#x27;s turning point between mythic and historical rulers of Persia. It also represents a turning point of Persian-language representations of Alexander, from negative in pre-Islamic Zoroastrian writings to positive. After the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; introduced the Alexander Romance tradition into Persian, the genre would become popular and numerous Alexander legends would be composed in the language, with the most significant works owing much to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. These include the anonymous &quot;Iskandarnameh&quot;, the &quot;Iskandarnameh&quot; of Nizami, the &quot;Ayina-i Iskandari&quot; of Amir Khusrau, and others.

== Illustrated copies ==
Illustrated copies of the work are among the most sumptuous examples of Persian miniature painting. Several copies remain intact, although two of the most famous, the Houghton &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and the Great Mongol &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, were broken up for sheets to be sold separately in the 20th century. A single sheet from the former was sold for £904,000 in 2006. The Baysonghori &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, an illuminated manuscript of the work made in 1430 for Prince Baysunghur, is preserved intact at Golestan Palace in Iran. In 2007 it was inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World International Register which lists documentary heritage of global importance.

The Mongol rulers in Iran revived and spurred the patronage of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; in its manuscript form. The &quot;Great Mongol&quot; or Demotte &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, produced during the reign of the Ilkhanid sultan Abu Sa&#x27;id, is one of the most illustrative and important copies of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.

The Timurids continued the tradition of manuscript production. For them, it was considered proper for the members of the family to have personal copies of the epic poem. Consequently, three of Timur&#x27;s grandsons—Baysunghur, Ibrahim Sultan, and Moḥammad Juki—each commissioned such a volume. Among these, the Baysunghur &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is one of the most voluminous and artistic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; manuscripts.

The production of illustrated &quot;Shahnameh&quot; manuscripts in the 15th century remained vigorous under the Qara Qoyunlu (1380–1468) and Aq Qoyunlu (1378–1508) Turkman dynasties. Many of the extant illustrated copies, with more than seventy or more paintings, are attributable to Tabriz, Shiraz, and Baghdad beginning in about the 1450s–60s and continuing to the end of the century.

A resurgence of &quot;Shahnameh&quot; manuscript production occurred in the Safavid era. Shah Ismail I used the epic for propaganda purposes: as a gesture of Persian patriotism, as a celebration of renewed Persian rule, and as a reassertion of Persian royal authority. The Safavids commissioned elaborate copies of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; to support their legitimacy. Among the high points of &quot;Shahnameh&quot; illustrations was the series of 250 miniatures commissioned by Shah Ismail for his son&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Shah Tahmasp. Two similar cycles of illustration of the mid-17th century, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Rashida and the Windsor &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, come from the last great period of the Persian miniature.

In honour of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;&#x27;s millennial anniversary, in 2010 the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge hosted a major exhibition, called &quot;Epic of the Persian Kings: The Art of Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;&quot;, which ran from September 2010 to January 2011. The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC also hosted an exhibition of folios from the 14th through the 16th centuries, called &quot;Shahnama: 1000 Years of the Persian Book of Kings&quot;, from October 2010 to April 2011.

In 2013 Hamid Rahmanian illustrated a new English translation of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (translated by Ahmad Sadri) creating new imagery from old manuscripts.

== Modern editions ==


=== Scholarly editions ===
Scholarly editions have been prepared of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.
In 1808 Mathew Lumsden (1777–1835) undertook the work of an edition of the poem. The first of eight planned volumes was published in Kolkata in 1811. But Lumsden didn&#x27;t finish any further volumes.
In 1829 Turner Macan published the first complete edition of the poem. It was based on a comparison of 17 manuscript copies.

Between 1838 and 1878, an edition appeared by French scholar Julius von Mohl, which was based on a comparison of 30 manuscripts. After Mohl&#x27;s death in 1876, the last of its seven volumes was completed by Charles Barbier de Meynard, Mohl&#x27;s successor to the chair of Persian of the College de France.

Both editions lacked critical apparatuses and were based on secondary manuscripts dated after the 15th century, much later than the original work. Between 1877 and 1884, the German scholar Johann August Vullers prepared a synthesized text of the Macan and Mohl editions under the title &quot;Firdusii liber regum&quot;, but only three of its expected nine volumes were published. The Vullers edition was later completed in Tehran by the Iranian scholars S. Nafisi, Iqbal, and M. Minowi for the millennial jubilee of Ferdowsi, held between 1934 and 1936.

The first modern critical edition of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; was prepared by a Russian team led by E. E. Bertels, using the oldest known manuscripts at the time, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, with heavy reliance on the 1276 manuscript from the British Museum and the 1333 Leningrad manuscript, the latter of which has now been considered a secondary manuscript. In addition, two other manuscripts used in this edition have been so demoted. It was published in Moscow by the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in nine volumes between 1960 and 1971.

For many years, the Moscow edition was the standard text. In 1977, an early 1217 manuscript was rediscovered in Florence. The 1217 Florence manuscript is one of the earliest known copies of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, predating the Mongol invasion and the following destruction of important libraries and manuscript collections. Using it as the chief text, Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh began the preparation of a new critical edition in 1990. The number of manuscripts that were consulted during the preparation of the Khaleghi-Motlagh edition goes beyond anything attempted by the Moscow team. The critical apparatus is the extensive number of variants for many parts of the poem that were recorded. The last volume was published in 2008, bringing the eight-volume enterprise to completion. According to Dick Davis, professor of Persian at Ohio State University, it is &quot;by far the best edition of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; available, and it is surely likely to remain such for a very long time&quot;.

=== Arabic translation ===
The only known Arabic translation of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; was done in by al-Fath bin Ali al-Bundari, a Persian scholar from Isfahan and at the request of the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa. The translation is unrhyming (&quot;nathr&quot;) and was largely forgotten until it was republished in full in 1932 in Egypt, by historian Abdelwahhab Azzam. This modern edition was based on incomplete and largely imprecise fragmented copies found in Cambridge, Paris, Astana, Cairo and Berlin. The latter had the most complete, least inaccurate and well-preserved Arabic version of the original translation by al-Bondari.

=== English translations ===
There have been several English translations, almost all abridged. James Atkinson of the East India Company&#x27;s medical service undertook a translation into English in his 1832 publication for the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland, now part of the Royal Asiatic Society. Between 1905 and 1925, the brothers Arthur and Edmond Warner published a translation of the complete work in nine volumes, now out of print. There are also modern abridged translations of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;: Reuben Levy&#x27;s 1967 prose version (later revised by Amin Banani), and another by Dick Davis in a mixture of poetry and prose which appeared in 2006. Also, a new English translation of the book in prose by Ahmad Sadri was published in 2013.

=== Other languages ===
There are various translations of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; into French and German. An Italian translation was published in eight volumes by Italo Pizzi with the title &quot;Il libro dei re&quot; in 1886–1888 (later reissued in two volumes with a compendium in 1915).

Dastur Faramroz Kutar and his brother Ervad Mahiyar Kutar translated the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; into Gujarati verse and prose and published 10 volumes between 1914 and 1918.

A Spanish translation was published in two volumes by the Islamic Research Institute of the Tehran Branch of McGill University.

The Soviet Armenian composer Sergey Balasanian and Tajik composer Sharif Bobokalonov wrote the opera &quot;Kova the Blacksmith&quot; () based on the story of Zahhak and Kaveh from the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.

<text>Jean Merilyn Simmons (31 January 1929 – 22 January 2010) was a British actress and singer. One of J. Arthur Rank&#x27;s &quot;well-spoken young starlets,&quot; she appeared predominantly in films, beginning with those made in Britain during and after the Second World War, followed mainly by Hollywood films from 1950 onwards.

Simmons was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955). Her other film appearances include &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (1949), &quot;So Long at the Fair&quot; (1950), &quot;Angel Face&quot; (1953), &quot;Young Bess&quot; (1953), &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958), &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960), &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), and the 1969 film &quot;The Happy Ending&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She also won an Emmy Award for the miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simmons was born on 31 January 1929, in Islington, London, to Charles Simmons, a bronze medalist in gymnastics at the 1912 Summer Olympics, and his wife, Winifred Ada (née Loveland). Jean was the youngest of four children, with siblings Lorna, Harold, and Edna. She began acting at the age of 14.

During the Second World War, the Simmons family was evacuated to Winscombe, Somerset. Her father, a physical education teacher, taught briefly at Sidcot School, and sometime during this period, Simmons followed her eldest sister onto the village stage and sang popular songs such as &quot;Daddy Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot;. At this point, her ambition was to be an acrobatic dancer.

===Early films===
On her return to London, Simmons enrolled at the Aida Foster School of Dance. She was spotted by director Val Guest, who cast her in the Margaret Lockwood-starring vehicle &quot;Give Us the Moon&quot; (1944) in a large role as Lockwood&#x27;s sister.
Small roles in several other films followed, including &quot;Mr. Emmanuel&quot; (1944), &quot;Kiss the Bride Goodbye&quot; (1945), &quot;Meet Sexton Blake&quot; (1945), and the popular &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (1945), as well as the short &quot;Sports Day&quot; (1945).

Simmons had a small part as a harpist in the high-profile &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945), produced by Gabriel Pascal, starring Vivien Leigh, and co-starring Simmons&#x27;s future husband Stewart Granger. Pascal saw potential in Simmons, and in 1945 he signed her to a seven-year contract with the J. Arthur Rank Organisation.

===&quot;Great Expectations&quot; and stardom===

Simmons became a star in Britain when she was cast as the young Estella in David Lean&#x27;s version of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946). The movie was the third-most-popular film at the British box office in 1947, and Simmons received excellent reviews.

The experience of working on &quot;Great Expectations&quot; caused her to pursue an acting career more seriously:

Simmons had support roles in &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; (1947) with Margaret Lockwood and the Powell-Pressburger film &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), playing an Indian woman in the latter alongside Sabu.

Simmons was top-billed for the first time in the drama &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; (1947). She followed it with &quot;The Woman in the Hall&quot; (1947). Neither was particularly successful, but Simmons was then in a huge international hit, playing Ophelia in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), for which she received her first Oscar nomination. Olivier offered her the chance to work and study at the Old Vic, advising her to play anything they offered her to get experience, but she was under contract to the J. Arthur Rank Organisation, which vetoed the idea.

Simmons had the lead in Frank Launder&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (1949), based on the 1908 novel by Henry De Vere Stacpoole and co-produced with Launder&#x27;s partner Sidney Gilliat, a project originally announced for Lockwood a decade earlier. It was a considerable financial success.

===Stewart Granger===
Simmons starred with Stewart Granger in the comedy &quot;Adam and Evelyne&quot; (1949). It was her first adult role, and Granger and she became romantically involved; they soon married.

Simmons made two films that were popular at the local box office: &quot;So Long at the Fair&quot; (1950) with Dirk Bogarde and &quot;Trio&quot; (1950), where she was one of several stars. She was then in &quot;Cage of Gold&quot; (1950) with David Farrar and Ralph Thomas&#x27; &quot;The Clouded Yellow&quot; (1950) with Trevor Howard. In 1950, Simmons was voted the fourth-most popular star in Britain.

===Howard Hughes and Victor Mature===

Granger became a Hollywood star in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1950) and was signed to a contract by MGM, so Simmons moved to Los Angeles with him. In 1951, Rank sold her contract to Howard Hughes, who then owned RKO Pictures.

Hughes was eager to start a sexual relationship with Simmons, but Granger put a stop to his advances by angrily telling Hughes over the phone: &quot;Mr. Howard bloody Hughes, you&#x27;ll be sorry if you don&#x27;t leave my wife alone.&quot; To punish Simmons and Granger, Hughes refused to lend her to Paramount where director William Wyler wanted to cast her in the female lead for his film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;; the role made a star of Audrey Hepburn. 

Her first Hollywood film was &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1952), produced by Pascal and co-starring Victor Mature. It was followed by &quot;Angel Face&quot; (1953), directed by Otto Preminger with Robert Mitchum. David Thomson wrote that &quot;she might now be spoken of with the awe given to Louise Brooks&quot; if Simmons only starred in that film. Smarting over his rebuff from Granger, Hughes instructed Preminger to treat Simmons as roughly as possible, leading the director to demand that costar Mitchum repeatedly slap the actress harder and harder, until Mitchum turned and punched Preminger, asking if that was how he wanted it. He also made her appear in &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot; (1954), a comedy with Mitchum.

A court case freed Simmons from the contract with Hughes in 1952. They settled out of court; part of the arrangement was that Simmons would do one more film for no additional money. Simmons also agreed to make three more movies under the auspices of RKO, but not actually at that studio—she would be lent out. She would make an additional picture for 20th Century Fox while RKO got the services of Victor Mature for one film.

MGM cast her in the lead of &quot;Young Bess&quot; (1953) playing a young Queen Elizabeth I with Granger. She went back to RKO to do the extra film under the settlement with Hughes, titled &quot;Affair with a Stranger&quot; (1953) with Mature; it flopped.

===20th Century Fox===
Fox asked Simmons back for &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1954), another epic, but it was not especially popular. She had the lead in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;A Bullet Is Waiting&quot; (1954). More widely seen was &quot;Désirée&quot; (1954), where Simmons played Désirée Clary opposite Marlon Brando&#x27;s Napoleon Bonaparte.

Simmons and Granger returned to England to make the thriller &quot;Footsteps in the Fog&quot; (1955). Then, Joseph Mankiewicz cast her opposite Brando in the screen adaptation of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955), where she did her own singing in a role turned down by Grace Kelly; it was a big hit. 

Simmons played the title role in &quot;Hilda Crane&quot; (1956) at Fox, a box-office disappointment. So, too, were &quot;This Could Be the Night&quot; (1957) and &quot;Until They Sail&quot; (1957), both at MGM.
Simmons had a big success, though, in &quot;The Big Country &quot;(1958), directed by William Wyler. She starred in &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; (1958) at Warner Bros. and &quot;This Earth Is Mine&quot; (1959) with Rock Hudson at Universal. In the opinion of film critic Philip French, &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; was &quot;perhaps her finest performance as a housewife driven into a breakdown in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s psychodrama.&quot;

===&quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; and Richard Brooks===
Simmons went into &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960), directed by Richard Brooks, who became her second husband. It was successful, as was &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), where she played Kirk Douglas&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest. Simmons then did &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot; (1960) with Mitchum, Cary Grant, and Deborah Kerr.

She took some years off screen, then returned in &quot;All the Way Home&quot; (1963) with Robert Preston. She did &quot;Life at the Top&quot; (1965) with Laurence Harvey, &quot;Mister Buddwing&quot; (1966) with James Garner, &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; (1967) with Dick Van Dyke, and &quot;Rough Night in Jericho&quot; (1967) with George Peppard and Dean Martin.

Simmons did &quot;Heidi&quot; (1968) for TV, then Brooks wrote and directed &quot;The Happy Ending&quot; (1969) for her, and she received her second Oscar nomination.

===1970s and 1980s===
By the 1970s, Simmons turned her focus to stage and television acting. She toured the United States in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, then took the show to London, thus originating the role of Desirée Armfeldt in the West End. Performing in the show for three years, she said she never tired of Sondheim&#x27;s music; &quot;No matter how tired or &#x27;off&#x27; you felt, the music would just pick you up.&quot;

She portrayed Fiona &quot;Fee&quot; Cleary, the Cleary family matriarch, in the miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983); she won an Emmy Award for her role. She appeared in &quot;North and South&quot; (1985–86), again playing the role of the family matriarch as Clarissa Main, and starred in &quot;The Dawning&quot; (1988) with Anthony Hopkins and Hugh Grant. In 1989, Simmons appeared as murder mystery author Eudora McVeigh Shipton, a self-proclaimed rival to Jessica Fletcher, in the two-part Murder, She Wrote episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror, On the Wall&quot; with Angela Lansbury.

===1990s and 2000s===
In 1989, she starred in a remake of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, this time playing the role of Miss Havisham, Estella&#x27;s adoptive mother. In 1991, she appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Drumhead&quot; as a retired Starfleet admiral and hardened legal investigator who conducts a witch hunt; and as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard/Naomi Collins, in the short-lived revival of the 1960s daytime series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, in roles originally played by Joan Bennett. From 1994 until 1998, Simmons narrated the A&amp;E documentary television series &quot;Mysteries of the Bible&quot;. In 1995, she appeared in &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; with Winona Ryder, Maya Angelou, Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, and Alfre Woodard. In 2004, she voiced the lead role of Sophie in the English dub of &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;.

==Personal life==

Simmons was married and divorced twice. At 21, she married Stewart Granger in Tucson, Arizona, on 20 December 1950. She and Granger became US citizens in 1956; in the same year, their daughter Tracy Granger was born. They divorced in 1960.

On 1 November 1960, Simmons married director Richard Brooks; their daughter, Kate Brooks, was born a year later, in 1961. Simmons and Brooks divorced in 1980. Although both men were significantly older than Simmons, she denied that she was looking for a father figure. Her father had died when she was just 16, but she said: They were really nothing like my father at all. My father was a gentle, softly spoken man. My husbands were both much noisier and much more opinionated ... it&#x27;s really nothing to do with age ... it&#x27;s to do with what&#x27;s there – the twinkle and sense of humour. In a 1984 interview, given in Copenhagen at the time she was shooting the film &quot;Going Undercover&quot; (1988, a.k.a. &quot;Yellow Pages&quot;; completed 1985) she elaborated slightly on her marriages, stating, 

Simmons had two daughters, Tracy Granger (a film editor since 1990), and Kate Brooks (a TV production assistant and producer), one by each marriage – their names bearing witness to Simmons&#x27;s friendship with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Simmons moved to the East Coast of the US in the late 1970s, briefly owning a home in New Milford, Connecticut. She returned to California, settling in Santa Monica, California, where she lived until her death. 

In the 2003 New Year Honours, Simmons was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to acting.

In 2003, she became the patron of the British drugs and human rights charity Release. In 2005, she signed a petition to British Prime Minister Tony Blair asking him not to upgrade cannabis from a class C drug to class B.

==Death==

Simmons died from lung cancer at her home in Santa Monica on 22 January 2010, nine days before her 81st birthday. She is interred in Highgate Cemetery, north London.

<text>The Caroline&quot; affair(also known as the Caroline&quot; case) was an international incident involving the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Canadas which started in 1837 and lasted until 1842. While ultimately a minor historical event, it eventually acquired substantial international legal significance.

The affair began on December 28, 1837, when hundreds of Americans who had been recruited by Upper Canada Rebellion leader William Lyon Mackenzie encamped on Navy Island on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. They had been brought there by the small American steamer &quot;Caroline&quot;, which had made several trips that day between Navy Island and Schlosser, New York. Late that night, a British force crossed the Niagara River to board and capture the vessel where it was moored at Schlosser&#x27;s Landing in U.S. territory. Shots were exchanged and an American watchmaker was killed, before the force set fire to &quot;Caroline&quot; and set it adrift in the Niagara River, about above Niagara Falls. Sensationalized accounts of the affair were published by newspapers.

The burning was praised in Canada and condemned in the United States. In retaliation, a group of thirteen Americans destroyed a British steamer in American waters, and U.S. citizens demanded their government declare war on Britain. The diplomatic crisis was defused during the negotiations of several US–UK disputes that led to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842. In the course of these negotiations, both the United States and Britain made concessions concerning their conduct. The incident was used to establish the principle of &quot;anticipatory self-defense&quot; in international relations, which holds that it may be justified only in cases in which the &quot;necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation&quot;. This formulation is part of the &quot;Caroline&quot; test.

==Background==

The Reform Movement of Upper Canada in Ontario was a movement to make the British colonial administration in Canada more democratic and less corrupt. William Lyon Mackenzie was one of the key leaders of this movement. He was repeatedly elected to serve in a hostile parliament that repeatedly ejected him for his reform efforts. By 1837, Mackenzie had given up on peaceful means for reform and began to prepare for an uprising.

In December 1837, Mackenzie began the Upper Canada Rebellion by fighting government troops in the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern. His forces were heavily outnumbered and outgunned, and they were defeated in less than an hour. Mackenzie&#x27;s allies suffered another major setback a few days later in London. After these defeats, Mackenzie and his followers fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River, which they declared the foundation of the Republic of Canada on board the vessel &quot;Caroline&quot;. Throughout these events, the Canadian rebels enjoyed widespread support from American citizens, who provided them supplies and bases from which to launch raids on the British authorities in Canada.

==Burning of &quot;Caroline&quot;==

On December 29, 1837, Canadian militia colonel Allan MacNab and Royal Navy captain Andrew Drew led a British force consisting of militiamen and law enforcement officers across the Canada–United States border. The force chased off the crew of &quot;Caroline&quot;, towed the vessel into the currents of the Niagara River and set her on fire before casting the ship adrift; &quot;Caroline&quot; proceeded to float over the Niagara Falls and was destroyed. During the confrontation between the British force and the crew, which involved shots being fired, a Black American watchmaker, Amos Durfee, was accidentally killed by an unknown person. As news of the burning spread, a number of American newspapers falsely reported &quot;the death of twenty-two of her crew&quot; when only Durfee was killed. Public opinion in the United States was outraged over the burning, and President Martin Van Buren protested to the government of the United Kingdom over the incident.

British diplomat Henry Stephen Fox summarized the British justification for the incursion in an 1841 letter to John Forsyth:

The Attorney General of New York, Willis Hall, responded by stating:

==Aftermath==

News of the incident led to a public uproar in the United States, and many people in American towns bordering Canada demanded the U.S. government declare war on Britain. In Canada, the burning was celebrated by the Canadian public and MacNab was knighted for his efforts. Canadian sheriff Alexander McLeod, was arrested in the United States while travelling there in 1840 due to allegations over his role in the death of Durfee. The arrest led to another international incident as the British demanded his release, arguing that McLeod could not be held criminally responsible due to the fact that he was legally carrying out orders of the Crown. McLeod was placed on trial, during which American legal officials unsuccessfully attempted to identify who shot Durfee. McLeod was acquitted of all charges, as witness statements made it clear that he had no involvement in the incident. 

In response to the incident, a group of thirteen Americans captured and burned the British merchant steamer &quot;Sir Robert Peel&quot; while she was in American waters. Van Buren sent General Winfield Scott to prevent further American incursions into Canada. 

Correspondence between U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British minister to the United States Lord Ashburton outlined the conditions under which one nation might lawfully violate the territorial sovereignty of another state. The &quot;Caroline&quot; test (also known as the &quot;Caroline doctrine&quot;) states that exceptions do exist to territorial inviolability, but &quot;those exceptions should be confined to cases in which the necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation&quot;. According to academic Tom Nichols, the &quot;Caroline&quot; test remains an accepted part of international law today. In 2008, he wrote:

<text>The Aroostook War (sometimes called the Pork and Beans War), or the Madawaska War, was a military and civilian-involved confrontation in 1838–1839 between the United States and the United Kingdom over the international boundary between the British colony of New Brunswick and the U.S. state of Maine. The term &quot;war&quot; was rhetorical; local militia units were called out but never engaged in actual combat. The event is best described as an international incident.

Negotiations between British diplomat Baron Ashburton and United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster settled the dispute. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842 established the final boundary between the countries, giving most of the disputed area to Maine while preserving an overland connection between Lower Canada and the Maritime colonies.

==Disputed border==
The Treaty of Paris (1783) ended the Revolutionary War but did not clearly determine the boundary between British North America (Quebec and New Brunswick) and the United States. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts thereafter began issuing land grants in its District of Maine, including areas to which the British had already laid claim.

Questions regarding the boundary line arose not long afterward, and the negotiators of the 1794 Jay Treaty agreed that a commission should determine the source of the St. Croix River, the principal geographical feature identified in the earlier treaty. The parties sent a collaborative survey team to locate the mouth of the proper river, and to establish its headwaters. In 1798 the commission decided the southernmost portion of this boundary, from the mouth of the St. Croix to its source, which was determined to be the Chiputneticook Lakes. This commission did no work to finalize details of the border north of the lakes, which was described as running in a straight line north to the highlands separating the Saint Lawrence River watershed from watersheds draining to the south. It also left unresolved the question of who claimed which islands in Passamaquoddy Bay.

During the War of 1812, the British occupied most of eastern Maine, including Washington County, Hancock County, and parts of Penobscot County, for eight months, intending to permanently annex the region into British North America as New Ireland.

The Treaty of Ghent ended the war in 1815 and re-established the boundary line of the 1783 treaty. A commission was appointed which resolved most of the issues surrounding the islands (Machias Seal Island continues to be formally disputed between the United States and Canada). A recommendation by the British commissioner that the northward line to the &quot;highlands&quot; end at Mars Hill (about south of where this line was eventually negotiated to end) was rejected.

When Maine broke away from Massachusetts as a separate state in 1820, the status and location of the border emerged as a chief concern to the new state government. Massachusetts also retained an interest in the matter, as it retained ownership of half the public lands in Maine, including a large part of the disputed territory, as part of the separation. For their part the British considered that Maine&#x27;s territory protruding so deeply into British territory and nearly reaching the St. Lawrence in some areas constituted a serious hindrance to communications between Lower Canada and the maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Securing the northern half of Maine would cut travel time between Quebec City and Halifax almost in half, as it lay directly between them.

As late as September 1825, Maine and Massachusetts land agents issued deeds, sold timber permits, took censuses, and recorded births, deaths, and marriages in the contested area of the Saint John River valley and its tributaries. Massachusetts land agent George Coffin recorded in his journal during one such journey during autumn 1825, returning from the Upper Saint John and Madawaska area to Fredericton, New Brunswick, that a thunderstorm had ignited a forest fire. This Miramichi Fire destroyed thousands of acres of prime New Brunswick timber, killed hundreds of settlers, left thousands more homeless, and destroyed several thriving communities. The journal entries of the newly appointed Governor of New Brunswick record the destruction and comments that survival of New Brunswick depended on the vast forests to the west in the area disputed with the United States.

==Growing tensions==
Mostly early Acadians (descendants of the original French colonists) settled the Saint John and Madawaska River basins. Some Americans then settled in the Aroostook River Valley. During 1826–1830, provincial timber interests also settled the west bank of the Saint John river and its tributaries, and British families built homes in Woodstock, Tobique, and Grand Falls, New Brunswick.

The French-speaking population of Madawaska were &quot;Brayons&quot; – nominally British subjects – who (at least rhetorically) considered themselves to belong to the unofficial &quot;République du Madawaska&quot;, and thus professed allegiance to neither the United States nor Great Britain. Another factor was the mutual sympathy between John Baker (see below) and many members of French-speaking communities located near Baker&#x27;s mill, who both felt betrayed by their respective authorities. The population of the area swelled with outsiders, however, when winter freed lumbermen from farm work to &quot;long-pole&quot; up the Saint John River to the valley. These migrant seasonal lumbermen caused particular tension for the governments of Maine and Massachusetts, responsible for the protection of resources and revenues of their respective states. Some itinerant lumbermen eventually settled year-round in the Saint John valley. Most settlers found themselves too remote from the authorities to apply formally for land. Disputes heated as factions maneuvered for control over the best stands of trees.

John Baker on 4 July 1827 raised an American flag, which his wife made, on the western bank of Baker Brook at its confluence with the Saint John River, on the river&#x27;s left (here northern) bank, now Canadian territory. New Brunswick authorities subsequently arrested Baker, fined him £25, and held him in jail until he paid his fine.

==Crisis of 1830==
In preparation for a United States census in 1830, the Maine Legislature sent John Deane and Edward James to the disputed area to document the numbers of inhabitants and to assess the extent of what they considered to be British trespass. During that summer, several residents of the west bank of the Saint John at Madawaska filed requests for inclusion of their land in Maine. Acting on advice from Penobscot County, Maine, officials, they called a meeting to select representatives preparatory to incorporating Madawaska as a town. A local resident from the east bank of the Saint John river alerted local representatives of the New Brunswick militia, who entered the hall during one of these meetings and threatened to arrest any resident attempting to organize. The meetings continued, however, even as more militiamen arrived. New Brunswick authorities arrested some residents, others fled to the woods, and local Americans sent letters to the Maine authorities in Augusta. The Treaty of Ghent (ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1815) provided for the establishment of a neutral third party as arbitrator in the event that a joint commission could not agree on the border; commissioners Cornelius P. Van Ness of Vermont and Thomas Henry Barclay for Britain asked King William I of the Netherlands to arbitrate.

William was given a topographical map of the disputed area with the parties&#x27; arguments, with detailed scientific and diplomatic evidence for each. A century later, Canadian Hugh L. Keenleyside and American Gerald S. Brown wrote:

William indeed found reconciling the treaty with the map so difficult that he gave up. On 20 January 1831 he called the treaty &quot;inexplicable and impractical&quot;, and compromised by drawing a line between the two listed options. The United States received and Britain received . The British government accepted this decision, but Maine rejected it and the new treaty failed to pass the United States Senate. Although the king had not made a judicial decision for one side as expected, he had followed the arbitration agreement&#x27;s request to &quot;make a decision on the points of difference&quot;. The American refusal to accept his decision would ultimately cost the United States of territory.

==Posses, arrests, and the mobilization of militia==
In 1835 the British rescinded their acceptance of the Dutch compromise and offered another boundary, which the Americans rejected. The United States offered to ask Maine to accept the Saint John River as the boundary, which the British rejected. In 1836 Maine took a special census. Penobscot County Census Representative Ebenezer Greeley thus began a census of the upper Aroostook River territory. Governor John Harvey of New Brunswick had Greeley arrested. Letters from New Brunswick accused the Governor of Maine of bribery and threatened military action if Maine continued to exercise jurisdiction in the basins of the Aroostook river and its tributaries. In response, Governor Robert Dunlap of Maine issued a general order announcing that a foreign power had invaded Maine. In March 1838, the state demanded a survey based on the American claim and that the federal government enforce the claim. Washington refused, but did authorize a survey for possible fortifications. The state legislature authorized $800,000 for military defense, and Congress gave the President authority to raise the militia with a $10,000,000 budget. Meanwhile, Nova Scotia voted $100,000 in funds to defend New Brunswick.

Both American and New Brunswick lumberjacks cut timber in the disputed territory during the winter of 1838–1839, according to reports submitted to the Maine Legislature, resulting in the Battle of Caribou and other conflicts. On 24 January 1839, the Maine Legislature authorized the newly elected Governor John Fairfield to send Maine&#x27;s land agent, Rufus McIntire, the Penobscot County sheriff, and a posse of volunteer militia to the upper Aroostook to pursue and arrest the New Brunswickers. The posse left Bangor, Maine, on 8 February 1839. Arriving at T10 R5 (now Masardis), the posse established a camp at the junction of Saint Croix Stream and the Aroostook River and began confiscating New Brunswick lumbering equipment, and sending any lumbermen caught and arrested back to Maine for trial. A group of New Brunswick lumbermen learned of these activities and, unable to retrieve their oxen and horses, broke into the arsenal in Woodstock to arm themselves. They gathered their own posse, and seized the Maine land agent and his assistants in the middle of the night. This New Brunswick posse transported the Maine officials in chains to Woodstock and held them for an &quot;interview&quot;.

Terming the Americans &quot;political prisoners&quot;, Sir John Harvey sent correspondence to Washington, D.C., that he lacked the authority to act on the arrests without instructions from London, which he awaited. He added that he intended meanwhile to exercise his responsibilities to ensure British jurisdiction over the Aroostook, and he demanded removal from the region of all Maine forces. He then sent his military commander to the T10 R5 campsite and ordered the Maine militia to leave. Captain Rines and the others refused, stating they were following orders and doing their duty. The Maine side then took the New Brunswick military commander himself into custody.

On 15 February 1839, the Maine Legislature authorized militia Major General Isaac Hodsdon to lead 1,000 additional volunteers to augment the posse then on the upper Aroostook River. Additional correspondence from governor Sir John Harvey of New Brunswick, reports of British Army troops arriving from the West Indies, reports of the Mohawk people offering their services to Quebec, and reports of New Brunswick forces gathering on the Saint John River resulted in the issuance of General Order No 7 on 19 February 1839, calling for a general draft of Maine militia. Maine militia companies mustered in Bangor and traveled to the Upper Aroostook until 26 February 1839, when the early construction of Fort Fairfield, which the earlier posse built on the Aroostook River from seized stolen timber, allowed for camping troops on the eastern boundary.

==American and British governments step in==
During Congressional debates in Washington on 2 March 1839, Representative Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith of Maine outlined the events and the various communications sent and received since 1825. Representative Smith noted the primary responsibility of the national government to protect and defend its own territory and citizens, but declared that Maine would defend its territory alone if the national government chose to not fulfill its obligations. President Martin Van Buren assigned Brigadier General Winfield Scott, then involved in the Cherokee removal, to the conflict area; he arrived in Boston in early March 1839.

Additional information arriving in Washington through April and May 1839 kept Congressional debate lively until Congress authorized a force of 50,000 men and appropriated $10 million, placed at the disposal of the President in the event foreign military troops crossed into United States territory during the Congressional recess of summer 1839. Maine initially committed three thousand to ten thousand militia to the conflict in addition to the land agent&#x27;s posse.

Sir John Harvey had supervised Winfield Scott during his time as prisoner of war during the War of 1812, and the President and his advisers saw that relationship as a point of mutual respect. Pursuant to the terms of the truce for administration within the disputed area, the Maine Legislature on 6 April 1839 created an armed civil posse. On advice of Brigadier General Scott, Maine issued General Orders to recall the militia in May and June 1839 and to replace the militiamen with the armed civil posse. The office of the Maine state land agent led the armed civil posse with Deputy Land Agent William Parrott at Fort Fairfield and Captain Stover Rines at Camp Jarvis on the Fish River (later Fort Kent, Maine). The United States Army began the permanent structure of Fort Fairfield in April 1839 and that of Fort Kent in October 1839. Major R. M. Kirby commanded of Hancock Barracks post near Houlton, Maine, with three companies of the United States 1st Artillery Regiment. Four companies of the British 11th Regiment marched to the area from Quebec City to represent Canada with the intent to build a suitable barracks across the Saint John River from Fort Kent. New Brunswick meanwhile armed every tributary of the Saint John River that flowed from the Aroostook Territory with regular and militia soldiers.

In 1840, Maine created Aroostook County, Maine, to administer the civilian authority of the area. However, reports of collusion resulted in the Maine Executive Council assigning Alphus Lyons to investigate Sheriff Packard and District Attorney Tabor. The two nations agreed to refer the dispute to a boundary commission, but further clashes between their forces continued in the interim.

==Settlement==
Neither nation wanted a war that would have greatly interfered with the two nations&#x27; trade. Daniel Webster and Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, reached a compromise, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of Washington in 1842, which settled the Maine–Canada–New Brunswick boundary and the boundaries between British North America and New Hampshire, Michigan and Minnesota. This treaty awarded to the United States and to British control. The British retained the northern area of the disputed territory, including the Halifax Road with its year-round overland military communications between the Province of Canada and Nova Scotia. The U.S. federal government agreed to pay the states of Maine and Massachusetts $150,000 each for the loss of the lands of their states and for expenses incurred during the time Maine&#x27;s armed civil posse administered the truce period.

Webster used a map that American Jared Sparks found in the Paris Archives while searching for pro-American evidence, which Benjamin Franklin had supposedly marked with a red line, to persuade Maine and Massachusetts to accept the agreement. The map showed that the disputed region belonged to the British, and so helped convince the representatives of those states to accept the compromise. Webster replied to later criticism for hiding the map, &quot;I did not think it a very urgent duty to go to Lord Ashburton and tell him that I had found a bit of doubtful evidence in Paris.&quot; Ashburton agreed, saying &quot;My own opinion is that in this respect no reproach can fairly be made.&quot; The British Foreign Office, without Ashburton&#x27;s knowledge, acted similarly by hiding the &quot;Mitchell&#x27;s map&quot;, which generally supported the American case. Some claim that British officials created the Franklin map as a fake to pressure the American negotiators. The evidence is that the British map placed the entire disputed area on the American side of the border.

While Lord Palmerston and many Conservatives in Parliament denounced the treaty, the British government was pleased, and Conservatives such as Benjamin Disraeli supported it. Similarly, Maine and Massachusetts complained but were happy to be paid for the loss of territory. Canada and New Brunswick were unhappy, however, as it viewed the treaty as the British improving relations with the United States by permitting American territory to separate Canada from the Maritimes. Keenleyside and Brown later wrote &quot;Unjust as such accusations are, it is nevertheless a fact that many Canadians still consider the Ashburton Treaty of 1842 to be the first and most important instance of the loss of Canadian rights due to the complacency of Great Britain and the crooked diplomacy of the United States.&quot;

British North America retained a militarily vital connection between Canada and the Maritime colonies, as well as a project for a commercial right-of-way that would allow British commercial interests to transit through Maine on their way to and from southern New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. This right-of way is still used in 2013 by the Eastern Maine Railway subsidiary of the New Brunswick Railway Company and by the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway. That trackage was originally part of the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Sherbrooke – Saint John rail line.

==Casualties==
The Aroostook War, though without direct combat, did see militiamen die of accident and disease; one example was Private Hiram T. Smith.

==In popular culture==
The tensions leading up to the Aroostook War are referenced in the 1835 short story &quot;The Squatter&quot; by John Neal. The narration of the main character, Hayes, voices critical comments on these events from a soldier&#x27;s point of view before the conflict came to a head.

<text>Carl Philipp Stamitz (; baptized 8 May 17459 November 1801) was a German composer of partial Czech ancestry. He was the most prominent representative of the second generation of the Mannheim School.

He was the eldest son of Johann Stamitz, a violinist and composer of the early classical period. Born in Mannheim, he received lessons from his father and Christian Cannabich, his father&#x27;s successor as leader of the Mannheim orchestra. As a youth, Stamitz was employed as a violinist in the court orchestra at Mannheim. In 1770, he began travelling as a virtuoso, accepting short-term engagements, but never managing to gain a permanent position. He visited a number of European cities, living for a time in Strasbourg and London. In 1794, he gave up travelling and moved with his family to Jena in central Germany, but his circumstances deteriorated and he descended into debt and poverty, dying in 1801. Papers on alchemy were found after his death.

Stamitz wrote symphonies, symphonies concertantes, and concertos for clarinet, cello, flute, oboe, bassoon, basset horn, violin, viola, viola d&#x27;amore and different combinations of these instruments. Some of his clarinet and viola concertos are particularly admired. He also wrote duos, trios and quartets. Two operas, &quot;Der verliebte Vormund&quot; and &quot;Dardanus&quot;, are now lost. Stylistically, his music resembles that of Mozart or Haydn and is characterized by appealing melodies, although his writing for the solo instruments is not excessively virtuosic. The opening movements of his orchestral works, which are in sonata form, are generally followed by expressive and lyrical middle movements and final movements in the form of a rondo.

== Biography ==
=== Early life in Mannheim ===

Carl Stamitz was born at Mannheim and baptized on 8 May 1745, the eldest son of Johann Stamitz, a violinist and composer of the early classical era. Johann Stamitz was the leader of the highly reputed court orchestra at Mannheim Palace, and trained it to be disciplined and technically polished. The players created a sensation with their ability to play with subtlety and precision, as well as with a great dynamic range.

Carl received his first lessons in violin and musical composition from his father. After Johann Stamitz&#x27;s death in 1757, the 12-year-old Stamitz was taught by the composer Christian Cannabich, his father&#x27;s successor as concert-master and leader of the Mannheim orchestra. Ignaz Holzbauer, the court-director of music, and the court-composer Franz Xaver Richter also had a hand in the boy&#x27;s education.

=== Early career ===

By the time he was seventeen, Stamitz was employed as a violinist in the court orchestra. In 1770, he resigned from his post and began travelling. As a travelling virtuoso on the violin, the viola and viola d&#x27;amore, Stamitz often accepted short-term engagements, but never managed to gain a permanent position with one of the European princes or in one of the orchestras of his time.

In 1770 he went to Paris, where he went into service with Louis, Duke of Noailles, who made him his court composer. He also appeared in the Concerts Spirituels, sometimes together with his brother Anton, who had probably come to Paris with him. With Paris as his base, he made frequent concert tours to a number of German cities: on 12 April 1773 he appeared in Frankfurt; a year later he was in Augsburg; and in 1775 he ventured as far as the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1777 he dwelt for a time in Strasbourg where Franz Xaver Richter was music director. During the years 1777 and 1778 he was successful in London, one of many Austro-German musicians, such as Carl Friedrich Abel, J. C. Bach and in his last years Haydn, to be drawn there. His stay in London was possibly facilitated through his contact with Thomas Erskine, Earl of Kellie (1753–1781), who had received lessons from Carl&#x27;s father Johann during a tour of the continent. Between 1782 and 1783, Stamitz gave concerts in The Hague and in Amsterdam. In 1785 he returned to Germany to appear in concerts in Hamburg, Lübeck, Braunschweig, Magdeburg and Leipzig. In April 1786 he made his way to Berlin, where on 19 May 1786 he participated in the performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, under the baton of Johann Adam Hiller.

He later travelled to Dresden, Prague, Halle and then Nuremberg, where on 3 November 1787 he staged a &quot;Great Allegorical Musical Festivity in Two Acts&quot; in celebration of the balloon ascent of the French aviation pioneer Jean-Pierre Blanchard. During the winter of 1789–90 he directed the amateur concerts in Kassel, but failed to gain an employment with the Schwerin court. By now married and the father of four young children, he was forced to resume a life of travelling.

On 12 November 1792 he gave a concert in the Weimar court theatre, which was then under the direction of Goethe. In 1793 he undertook a last journey along the River Rhine to his native Mannheim, before he finally gave up travelling. Sometime in the winter of 1794–95 he moved his family to the university town of Jena in central Germany.

=== Final years ===

During the years Stamitz spent at Jena, there was neither a town band nor an orchestra to speak of. According to some sources, he was in some way connected to the university, but this seems a matter of dispute. Stamitz gradually descended into poverty. After his death in November 1801, a substantial number of tracts on alchemy were found in his library. Because of this it is thought that he dabbled in attempts at making gold.

== Music ==
Carl Stamitz wrote more than 50 symphonies, at least 38 symphonies concertantes and more than 60 concertos for violin, viola, viola d&#x27;amore, cello, clarinet, basset horn, flute, bassoon and other instruments. He also wrote a large volume of chamber music. Some of the clarinet and viola concertos that Stamitz composed are considered to be among the finest available from the period.

During the period when he lived in Paris, Stamitz began to cooperate with the Bohemian born clarinet virtuoso Joseph Beer (1744–1811), which proved fruitful for both Stamitz and Beer. At least one of Stamitz&#x27;s clarinet concertos (the concerto No. 6 in E-flat major) seems to have been composed jointly by the two men, as both of their names appear on the title page of the Viennese manuscript. Stamitz was the first composer to specify a left-hand pizzicato (an important virtuoso device) in a musical composition. This occurs in his Viola Concerto in D major, where the passage in question is designated by an &quot;0&quot; above the notes.

Stamitz&#x27;s cello concertos were written for Frederick William II of Prussia, who was a gifted amateur musician: both Mozart and Beethoven wrote music for the king.

=== Style ===
Stylistically, Stamitz&#x27;s music is not too far removed from the galante works of the young Mozart, or those of Haydn&#x27;s middle period. Stamitz&#x27;s works are characterized by regular periods and appealing melodies, with the voices quite often led in thirds, sixths and tenths. The writing for the solo instruments is idiomatic and virtuosic, but not excessively so.

The opening movements of Stamitz&#x27;s concertos and orchestral works are regularly constructed in sonata form, with an extensive double exposition. Their structure is additive in nature and does not exhibit the thematic development that is considered typical of the Viennese classical style. The middle movements are expressive and lyrical, sometimes called &#x27;Romance&#x27; and usually constructed according to the &quot;Liedform&quot; (ABA, ABA&#x27; or AA&#x27;B). The final movement is often (and in the concertos almost always) a French-style rondo.

Just as his teacher Franz Xaver Richter had done, Stamitz preferred minor keys, as he generally used a variety of (sometimes remote) keys.

<text>The Webster–Ashburton Treaty, signed August 9, 1842, was a treaty that resolved several border issues between the United States and the British North American colonies (the region that later became the Dominion of Canada). Negotiated in the US federal capital city of Washington, DC, it was signed August 9, 1842, under the new administration of US President John Tyler, who as the former vice president, had just recently succeeded and became chief executive upon the unexpected death of his running mate and predecessor, William Henry Harrison, who had only served a single month in office. The Daniel Webster–Lord Ashburton negotiations and newly drawn-up 1842 treaty resolved many of the issues of the recent border conflicts and skirmishes between Americans and New Brunswickers in the Aroostook War of 1838–1839. It arose from disputes and controversies over the vague indefinite terms and text of the old peace agreement of the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War.

The provisions of the 1842 treaty between Britain and the United States included:

* The settlement of the location of the Maine–New Brunswick international border, which was the primary cause of the Aroostook War.
* Establishment of the international border between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods, originally defined in the Treaty of Paris in 1783
* Reaffirmation of the location of the border (at the 49th parallel) in the westward frontier up to the far western Rocky Mountains defined in the previous Treaty of 1818
* Definition of seven crimes subject to extradition
* Agreement that the two parties would share use of the Great Lakes
* Agreement that there should be a final end to the slave trade on the high seas

The treaty also retroactively confirmed the southern boundary of the Province of Quebec that land surveyors John Collins and Thomas Valentine had marked with stone monuments in 1771–1773. The treaty intended that the international border be fixed at the 45 degrees north parallel of latitude, but the border is in some places nearly north of the 45th parallel. The treaty was signed by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and British diplomat Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton.

==In the East==

An arbitration of various border issues in the East before King William I of the Netherlands in 1831 had failed to yield a binding decision.

The Treaty of Paris had established the 45th parallel as part of the northern boundary of modern-day New York and Vermont. Most of that portion of the boundary had previously been surveyed in the early 1770s, but the survey line was inaccurate. Since &quot;Fort Blunder&quot;—an unnamed U.S. fort in what is now part of northeastern New York—had been constructed north of the actual 45th parallel, the United States wanted to follow the old survey line, and the Webster–Ashburton treaty incorporated this change, leaving the half-finished fort on U.S. soil. Following the signing of the treaty, the U.S. resumed construction on the site. The new project replaced the aborted 1812-era construction with a massive third-system masonry fortification known as Fort Montgomery.

This treaty marked the end of local confrontations between lumberjacks (known as the Aroostook War) along the Maine border with the British colonies of Lower Canada (which later became Quebec) and New Brunswick. The newly agreed border divided the disputed territory between the two nations. The British were assigned the Halifax–Quebec road route, which their military desired because Lower Canada had no other connection in winter to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The treaty adjusted portions of the border to give the United States a little more land to the north. It also resolved issues that had led to the Indian Stream dispute as well as the &quot;Caroline&quot; Affair. The Indian Stream area was assigned to the United States. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty failed to clarify ownership of Machias Seal Island and nearby North Rock, which remain in dispute. Additionally, the signing of the treaty put an end to several building improvements planned for Upper Canadian defense forts such as Fort Malden in Amherstburg, which the British government later abandoned, as they no longer served a defensive purpose.

==In the West==

The border between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods in the Great Lakes region needed clarification because the faulty Mitchell Map used in the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris (1783) was inadequate to define the border according to the terms of that British-American treaty. Ambiguity in the map and treaty resulted in Minnesota&#x27;s Arrowhead region being disputed between the two nations years later, and previous negotiations had not resolved the question. The treaty had the border pass through Long Lake, but did not state that lake&#x27;s location. However, the map showed the lake flowing into Lake Superior near Isle Royale, which is consistent with the Pigeon River route.

The British, however, had previously taken the position that the border should leave Lake Superior at &quot;Fond du Lac&quot; (the &quot;head of the lake&quot;) in modern Duluth, Minnesota, proceed up the Saint Louis and Embarrass rivers, across the height of land, and down Pike River and Lake Vermilion to the Rainy River.

To counter this western route, the U.S. side advocated for an eastern route, used by early French explorer Jacques de Noyon in 1688, and the later a well-used fur traders&#x27; route after 1802. This way headed north from the lake at the site of Fort William up the Kaministiquia and Dog Rivers to Cold Water Lake, crossed the divide by Prairie Portage to Height of Land Lake, then went west by way of the Savanne, Pickerel, and Maligne rivers to Lake La Croix, where it joined the present international border.

The Mitchell map had shown both of those routes, and also showed the &quot;Long Lake&quot; route between them. Long Lake was thought to be the Pigeon River (despite the absence of a lake at its mouth).

The traditional traders&#x27; route left the lake at Grand Portage and went overland to the Pigeon, up that river and a tributary across the Height of Land Portage, and thence down tributaries of the Rainy River to Lac La Croix, Rainy Lake and River, and Lake of the Woods. This is finally the route the treaty designated as the border.

The treaty clarified the channel that the border would follow between Lake Huron and Lake Superior, awarding Sugar Island to the U.S.

Another clarification made in this treaty resulted in clarifying the anomaly of the Northwest Angle. Again, due to errors on the Mitchell Map, Treaty of Paris reads &quot;... through the Lake of the Woods to the most northwesternmost point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi ...&quot; In fact, a course due west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the Mississippi. The Anglo-American Convention of 1818 defined the boundary about Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains.

This 1842 treaty reaffirmed the border and further defined it by modifying the border definition to instead read as: 

The Webster–Ashburton Treaty failed to deal with the Oregon question, although the issue was discussed in negotiations.

==Other issues==
Article 10 of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty identified seven crimes subject to extradition: &quot;murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper.&quot; It did not include slave revolt or mutiny. In addition, the United States did not press for the return or extradition of an estimated 12,000 fugitive slaves who had fled the U.S. going north and reached British territory in Canada.

While agreeing to call for a final end to the slave trade on the high seas, Secretary Webster and Lord Ashburton agreed to pass over the &quot;Creole&quot; case of 1841 in the Caribbean Sea, which was then in contention. In November 1841, a slave revolt on the American merchantman brig &quot;Creole,&quot; part of the coastwise slave trade, had forced the ship to call at the port of Nassau in the Bahamas. British / Bahamian colonial officials eventually emancipated all 128 slaves who chose to stay in Nassau, as Britain had already abolished slavery in its colonies, effective seven years before in 1834. The United States initially demanded return of the slaves and then compensation. A settlement was made in 1855 as part of a much larger claims treaty of 1853, which covered claims by both nations dating back to 1814.

The treaty laid down minimum levels of joint anti-slaving naval activity off the West African coast by warship squadrons of both the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy. It formalised levels of co-operation that had briefly existed in 1820 and 1821. It fell short of providing greater co-operation in suppression of the slave trade; there was, for instance, no mutual right for the two countries to inspect vessels flying each other&#x27;s flag even when the United States flag / colours were being flown fraudulently by a slaver from a third country. The treaty, therefore, had only a minimal effect for the time in reducing the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

==Results==
As a result of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the United States ceded of disputed territory to the British colonies along the American-claimed northern Maine border, including the Halifax–Quebec Route, but kept of the disputed wilderness. In addition, the United States received in compensation with the compromise of further west, which included the Mesabi Range of mountains, west of Lake Superior. Shortly after the advice and consent process with the ratification of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty by the United States Senate, the Ojibwa nations on the south shore of Lake Superior ceded land to the United States in the subsequent Treaty of La Pointe. However, the news of the ratification of the British-American international treaty did not reach either of the two parties further west, involved in negotiating the land cession. The Grand Portage Band was mistakenly omitted from the Ojibwe treaty council. In addition, the Grand Portage Band was misinformed on the details of the Treaty of Paris of 1783; they believed that the border passed through the center of Lake Superior to the Saint Louis River, placing both Isle Royale and their band in British territory. The Treaty of Paris specifically notes that Isle Royale is in the United States. Consequently, because of this misunderstanding / misinterpretation, a later Isle Royale Agreement was signed between the United States and the Grand Portage Band in 1844 as an adhesion / amendment to the Treaty of La Pointe, with other Ojibwa tribes reaffirming the treaty.

Ten months of negotiations for the 1842 Treaty were held largely at Ashburton House, home of the British legation, facing on Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.

To make the controversial treaty more palatable and popular in the United States, Secretary of State Webster released a map of the Maine–Canada–New Brunswick border, taken from the national archives, which he claimed that Benjamin Franklin had drawn of the territory. It showed contested areas of that time during the original 1783 Paris treaty negotiations largely resolved in favor of the United States.

<text>Petén (from the Itz&#x27;a, , &#x27;Great Island&#x27;) is a department of Guatemala. It is geographically the northernmost department of Guatemala, as well as the largest by area at it accounts for about one third of Guatemala&#x27;s area. The capital is Flores. The population at the mid-2018 official estimate was 595,548.

==Geography==
The Petén department is bordered on the east by Belize and by Mexico (with the Mexican states of Chiapas to the west, Tabasco to the northwest and Campeche to the north). To the south it borders the Guatemalan departments of Alta Verapaz and Izabal. Much of the western border with Mexico is formed by the Usumacinta River and its tributary the Salinas River. Portions of the southern border of the department are formed by the rivers Gracias a Dios and Santa Isabel.

The Petén lowlands are formed by a densely forested low-lying limestone plain featuring karstic topography. The area is crossed by low east–west oriented ridges of Cenozoic limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as &quot;bajos&quot;. A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of the Petén; during the rainy season some of these lakes become interconnected. This drainage area measures approximately east-west by north-south. The largest lake is Lake Petén Itza, near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures . A broad savannah extends south of the central lakes; it features a compact red clay soil that is too poor to support heavy cultivation. This resulted in a relatively low level of pre-Columbian occupation. The savannah has an average altitude of above mean sea level with karstic ridges reaching an average altitude of . The savannah is surrounded by hills with unusually steep southern slopes and gentler northern approaches; the hills are covered with dense tropical forest. To the north of the lakes region &quot;bajos&quot; become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of the Petén the Mirador Basin forms another interior drainage region. To the south Petén reaches an altitude of approximately as it rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets Paleozoic metamorphic rocks.

The main bodies of standing water in the department are the lakes Petén Itzá, Peténchel, Quexil, Salpetén and Macanche in the centre of the department; Yaxhá and Sacnab in the east, Petexbatún in the southwest, and Perdida, Larga, La Gloria, San Diego, Mendoza, El Repasto and Lacandón in the west.

==Climate==
The climate of Petén is divided into wet and dry seasons, although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south; the climate varies from tropical in the south to semitropical in the north. Temperature varies between , although it does not usually drop beneath . Mean temperature varies from in the southeast around Poptún to around Uaxactún in the northeast. Highest temperatures are reached from April to June; January is the coldest month. All Petén experiences a hot dry period in late August. Annual precipitation is high, varying from a mean of in the northeast to in central Petén around Flores. The extreme southeast of Petén experiences the largest variations in temperature and rainfall, with precipitation reaching as much as in a year.

==History==
The Petén department was created by decree of the Guatemalan government on 8 May 1866.

Starting in the 1960s the Guatemalan government offered land in Petén to any citizen willing to settle on it and pay a fee of $25. A road was opened up to Flores, although it was unpaved, and the notorious bus trip to Flores was known to take up to 24 hours to travel the . Small airports were built at Flores and Tikal, bringing tourists to the region. In the early 1970s a road was opened from Tikal to Belize. The first paved road in Petén was built in 1982.

Since the 1990s many new settlers have come to Petén. The area is also experiencing severe deforestation in its southern half. Deforestation has been particularly rapid near Laguna del Tigre National Park in western Petén. To combat deforestation, Guatemalan president Álvaro Colom proposed dramatically expanding ecotourism around Maya archaeological sites, especially El Mirador, and trying to further develop an agricultural system in the southern portion of the Maya Biosphere Reserve that would prevent further northward migration. He called his plan &quot;Cuatro Balam&quot;.

The Mundo Maya International Airport, in Santa Elena, is the second largest in Guatemala.

== Municipalities ==

Petén consists of the following 14 municipalities, listed below with their populations in 2002 and 2018. Las Cruces was separated from La Libertad in 2011, and El Chal was separated from Dolores in 2014.

<doc id="193621" wikidata="Q444530" url="?curid=193621" title="Clayton–Bulwer Treaty">
<text>The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty was a treaty signed in 1850 between the United States and the United Kingdom. The treaty was negotiated by John M. Clayton and Sir Henry Bulwer, amidst growing tensions between the two nations over Central America, a region where the British had traditionally held strong influence but also saw increasing American expansion into the area. The treaty proved instrumental in preventing the outbreak of war between the two nations by resolving tensions over American plans to construct a Nicaraguan Canal that would connect the Pacific and the Atlantic. There were three main provisions in the treaty: neither nation would build such a canal without the consent and cooperation of the other; neither would fortify nor found new colonies in the region; when a canal was built, both powers would guarantee that it would be available on a neutral basis for all shipping. Construction on the proposed canal never came to fruition, although the treaty remained in effect until 1901.

Britain had indefinite territorial claims in three regions: British Honduras (modern-day Belize), the Mosquito Coast (part of modern-day Nicaragua and Honduras) and the Bay Islands (now part of modern-day Honduras). The United States, while not making any territorial claims, held in reserve, ready for ratification, treaties with Nicaragua and Honduras which gave the United States a certain diplomatic advantage with which to balance the pre-eminent British influence in the region. With it soon becoming apparent to American negotiators that agreement on these points would be impossible and agreement on the canal question was possible, the latter was put into the foreground during the negotiations. By 1857, however, the British had ended their diplomatic opposition to American western expansion, while steadfastly maintaining their rights to a potential Nicaraguan canal.

==Essential points of the treaty==
The resulting treaty had four essential points:

# It bound both parties not to &quot;obtain or maintain&quot; any exclusive control of the proposed canal, or unequal advantage in its use. 
#It guaranteed the neutralization of the canal. 
#It declared that the parties agreed &quot;to extend their protection by treaty stipulation to any other practicable communications, whether by canal or railway, across the isthmus which connects North and South America.&quot; 
#Finally, it stipulated that neither signatory would ever &quot;occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast or any part of Central America&quot;, nor make use of any protectorate or alliance, present or future, to such ends.

==Signature and ratification==
The treaty was signed on April 19, 1850, and was ratified by both governments, but before the exchange of ratifications the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, on June 8, directed Bulwer to make a &quot;declaration&quot; that the British government did not understand the treaty &quot;as applying to Her Majesty&#x27;s settlement at Honduras, or its dependencies.&quot; Clayton made a counter-declaration which recited that the United States did not regard the treaty as applying to &quot;the British settlement in Honduras commonly called British-Honduras. .. nor the small islands in the neighborhood of that settlement which may be known as its dependencies&quot;; that the treaty&#x27;s engagements did apply to all the Central American states, &quot;with their just limits and proper dependencies&quot; (referring to the Mosquito Coast and the Bay Islands); and that these declarations, not being submitted to the United States Senate, would in no way affect the legality of the treaty.

==Disagreement==
The interpretation of the declarations soon became a matter of contention. The phraseology reflects the effort made by the United States to render impossible ownership of the canal by the United Kingdom through the territory held by the British at its mouth, just as the explicit prohibitions of the treaty rendered impossible such control politically by either power.

===British view===
The United Kingdom contended that the excepted &quot;settlement&quot; at Honduras was the &quot;Belize&quot; covered by the furthest British claim; that the Bay Islands were a dependency of Belize; and that, as for the Mosquito Coast, the abnegatory clauses being wholly prospective in intent, Britain was not required to abandon her protectorate.

===American view===
The United States asserted that the Bay Islands were not the &quot;dependencies&quot; of Belize, which were the small neighboring islands mentioned in the same treaties, and nothing else; that the excepted &quot;settlement&quot; was the British-Honduras of definite extent and narrow purpose recognized in British treaties with Spain; that the United States had not confirmed by recognition the large, indefinite and offensive claims whose dangers the treaty was primarily designed to lessen; and that, as to the Mosquito Coast, the treaty was retrospective, and mutual in the rigor of its requirements. The claims to a part of Belize and the Bay Islands were very old in origin, but were heavily clouded by interruptions of possession, contested interpretations of Spanish–British treaties, and active controversy with the Central American States. The claim to some of the territory was new and still more contestable.

==Analysis==
Binding both nations not to &quot;occupy&quot; any part of Central America or the Mosquito Coast necessitated the abandonment of British colonies and protectorates in Central America, and the United States government demanded the British completely abandon their Central American colonies and protectorates, which Britain demurred in doing so. Britain violated the treaty in 1852 when it transformed the Bay Islands into a British colony, as this was an infraction of the terms of the treaty. In regards to Belize, the British diplomatic arguments were stronger; as regards to the Mosquito Coast, disregard the fact that the protectorate was recognized by the treaty, do demand its absolute abandonment was unwarranted, although to satisfy the treaty Britain was bound materially to weaken it and also to give grant to the Hay–Sasha Treaty 1923.

==Treaties of 1859–1860==
In 1859–1860, via British treaties with Central American states, the Bay Islands and Mosquito questions were settled nearly in accord with the American contentions. (Britain ceded the Bay Islands to Honduras in 1860 and ceded suzerainty over the Mosquito Coast to Nicaragua the same year, although they would continue to maintain a presence there until 1895). However, by the same treaties Belize was accorded limits much greater than those contended for by the United States. This settlement the United States accepted without complaint for many years.

==The Hay–Pauncefote Treaty==
Until 1866 the policy of the United States was consistently for interoceanic canals open equally to all nations, and unequivocally neutralized; indeed, until 1880 there was practically no official divergence from this policy. But in 1880–1884 a variety of reasons was advanced why the United States might justly repudiate at will the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. The new policy was based on national self-interest. The arguments advanced on its behalf were quite indefensible in law and history, and although the position of the United States in 1850–1860 was in general the stronger in history, law and political ethics, that of the United Kingdom was even more conspicuously the stronger in the years 1880–1884. Among the arguments advanced by the United States was that circumstances had changed fundamentally since the signing of the treaty, therefore invalidating it. Although ultimately this argument was not successful, it is noteworthy as the first time the American government invoked this principle in its handling of international law. In 1885 the United States government reverted to its traditional policy, and the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty of 1901, which replaced the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, adopted the rule of neutralization for the Panama Canal.

<text>Eric Richard Kandel (; born Erich Richard Kandel, November 7, 1929) is an Austrian-born American medical doctor who specialized in psychiatry, a neuroscientist and a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. He was a recipient of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the physiological basis of memory storage in neurons. He shared the prize with Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard.

Kandel was from 1984 to 2022 a Senior Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He was in 1975 the founding director of the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, which is now the Department of Neuroscience at Columbia University. He currently serves on the Scientific Council of the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation. Kandel&#x27;s popularized account chronicling his life and research, &quot;In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind&quot;, was awarded the 2006 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Science and Technology.

==Early years==
Eric&#x27;s mother, Charlotte Zimels, was born in 1897 in Kolomyia, Pokuttya (modern Ukraine). She came from an Ashkenazi Jewish family. At that time Kolomyya was part of Austria-Hungary. His father, Hermann Kandel, was born in 1898 in Olesko, Galicia (then part of Austria-Hungary). At the beginning of World War I, his parents moved to Vienna, Austria, where they met and married in 1923.

Eric Kandel was born on November 7, 1929, in Vienna. Shortly after, Eric&#x27;s father established a toy store. Although thoroughly assimilated and acculturated, the family sensed the Nazi danger and, unlike others, left Austria after the country had been annexed by Germany in March 1938 at great expense. As a result of Aryanization (&quot;Arisierung&quot;), attacks on Jews had escalated and Jewish property was being confiscated. When Eric was 9, he and his brother Ludwig, 14, boarded the &quot;Gerolstein&quot; at Antwerp, Belgium, and joined their uncle in Brooklyn on May 11, 1939, to be followed later by his parents.

After arriving in the United States and settling in Brooklyn, Kandel was tutored by his grandfather in Judaic studies and was accepted at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, from which he graduated in 1944. He attended Brooklyn&#x27;s Erasmus Hall High School in the New York City school system.

Kandel&#x27;s undergraduate major at Harvard was History and Literature. He wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on &quot;The Attitude Toward National Socialism of Three German Writers: Carl Zuckmayer, Hans Carossa, and Ernst Jünger&quot;. While at Harvard, a place where psychology was dominated by the work of B. F. Skinner, Kandel became interested in learning and memory. However, while Skinner championed a strict separation of psychology, as its own level of discourse, from biological considerations such as neurology, Kandel&#x27;s work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology.

The world of neuroscience was opened up to Kandel as a consequence of his favorite literature teacher at the time, Karl Viëtor&#x27;s, sudden passing in 1951 and leaving Kandel&#x27;s next term schedule at Harvard, besides feeling &quot;deep personal loss&quot; over Viëtor&#x27;s death, unexpectedly empty. Around that time Kandel had met Anna Kris, whose parents Ernst Kris and Marianne Rie were psychoanalysts from Sigmund Freud&#x27;s Vienna-based circle. Freud was a pioneer in revealing the importance of unconscious neural processes, and his lines of thought are at the root of Kandel&#x27;s interest in the biology of motivation and unconscious and conscious memory. Kandel changed his course to pursue and began his M.D. program at New York University in 1952.

== Medical school and early research ==
In 1952 he started at the New York University Medical School. By graduation he was firmly interested in the biological basis of the mind. During this time he met his future wife, Denise Bystryn. Kandel was first exposed to research in Harry Grundfest&#x27;s laboratory, for six months in 1955-56, at Columbia University. Grundfest was known for using the oscilloscope to demonstrate that conduction velocity during an action potential depends on axon diameter. The researchers Kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of intracellular recordings of the electrical activity of the relatively small neurons of the vertebrate brain.

After starting his neurobiological work in the difficult thicket of the electrophysiology of the cerebral cortex, Kandel was impressed by the progress that had been made by Stephen Kuffler using a much more experimentally accessible system: neurons isolated from marine invertebrates. After becoming aware of Kuffler&#x27;s work in 1955, Kandel graduated from medical school and learned from Stanley Crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons.

Karl Lashley, a well-known American neuropsychologist, had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain. When Kandel joined the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the US National Institutes of Health in 1957, William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner had recently described the patient HM, who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his hippocampus. Kandel took on the task of performing electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Working with Alden Spencer, he found electrophysiological evidence for action potentials in the dendritic trees of hippocampal neurons. The team also noticed the spontaneous pacemaker-like activity of these neurons, as well as a robust recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus. They provided the first intracellular records of the electrical activity that underlies the epileptic spike (the intracellular paroxysmal depolarizing shift) and the epileptic runs of spikes (the intracellular sustained depolarization). But, with respect to memory, there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage.

Kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the synaptic connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses. Kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior, such as those by Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and Karl von Frisch had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals. Kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage. He believed that, ultimately, the results would be found to be applicable to humans. This decision was not without risk: many senior biologists and psychologists believed that nothing useful could be learned about human memory by studying invertebrate physiology.

In 1962, after completing his residency in psychiatry, Kandel went to Paris to learn about the marine mollusk &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; from Ladislav Tauc. Kandel had realized that simple forms of learning such as habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning could readily be studied with ganglia isolated from &quot;Aplysia&quot;. &quot;While recording the behavior of a single cell in a ganglion, one nerve axon pathway to the ganglion could be stimulated weakly electrically as a conditioned [tactile] stimulus, while another pathway was stimulated as an unconditioned [pain] stimulus, following the exact protocol used for classical conditioning with natural stimuli in intact animals.&quot; Electrophysiological changes resulting from the combined stimuli could then be traced to specific synapses. In 1965 Kandel published his initial results, including a form of presynaptic potentiation that seemed to correspond to a simple form of learning.

==Faculty member at New York University Medical School==

Kandel took a position in the Departments of Physiology and Psychiatry at the New York University Medical School, eventually forming the Division of Neurobiology and Behavior. Working with Irving Kupferman and Harold Pinsker, he developed protocols for demonstrating simple forms of learning by intact &quot;Aplysia&quot;. In particular, the researchers showed that the now famous gill-withdrawal reflex, by which the slug protects its tender gill tissue from danger, was sensitive to both habituation and sensitization. By 1971 Tom Carew had joined the research group and helped extend the work from studies restricted to short-term memory to experiments that included physiological processes required for long-term memory.

By 1981, laboratory members including Terry Walters, Tom Abrams, and Robert Hawkins had been able to extend the &quot;Aplysia&quot; system into the study of classical conditioning, a finding that helped close the apparent gap between the simple forms of learning often associated with invertebrates and more complex types of learning more often recognized in vertebrates. Along with the fundamental behavioral studies, other work in the lab traced the neuronal circuits of sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons involved in the learned behaviors. This allowed analysis of the specific synaptic connections that are modified by learning in the intact animals. The results from Kandel&#x27;s laboratory provided solid evidence for the mechanistic basis of learning as &quot;a change in the functional effectiveness of previously existing excitatory connections.&quot; Kandel&#x27;s winning of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was a result of his work with &quot;Aplysia&quot; on the biological mechanisms of memory storage.

==Molecular changes during learning==
Starting in 1966 James Schwartz collaborated with Kandel on a biochemical analysis of changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage. By this time it was known that long-term memory, unlike short-term memory, involved the synthesis of new proteins. By 1972 they had evidence that the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) was produced in &quot;Aplysia&quot; ganglia under conditions that cause short-term memory formation (sensitization). In 1974 Kandel moved his lab to Columbia University and became founding director of the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior. It was soon found that the neurotransmitter serotonin, acting to produce the second messenger cAMP, is involved in the molecular basis of sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex. By 1980, collaboration with Paul Greengard resulted in demonstration that cAMP-dependent protein kinase, also known as protein kinase A (PKA), acted in this biochemical pathway in response to elevated levels of cAMP. Steven Siegelbaum identified a potassium channel that could be regulated by PKA, coupling serotonin&#x27;s effects to altered synaptic electrophysiology.

In 1983 Kandel helped form the Howard Hughes Medical Research Institute at Columbia devoted to molecular neural science. The Kandel lab then sought to identify proteins that had to be synthesized to convert short-term memories into long-lasting memories. One of the nuclear targets for PKA is the transcriptional control protein CREB (cAMP response element binding protein). In collaboration with David Glanzman and Craig Bailey, Kandel identified CREB as being a protein involved in long-term memory storage. One result of CREB activation is an increase in the number of synaptic connections. Thus, short-term memory had been linked to functional changes in existing synapses, while long-term memory was associated with a change in the number of synaptic connections.

==Experimental support for Hebbian learning==
Some of the synaptic changes observed by Kandel&#x27;s laboratory provide examples of Hebbian theory. One article describes the role of Hebbian learning in the &quot;Aplysia&quot; siphon-withdrawal reflex.

The Kandel lab has also performed important experiments using transgenic mice as a system for investigating the molecular basis of memory storage in the vertebrate hippocampus. Kandel&#x27;s original idea that learning mechanisms would be conserved between all animals has been confirmed. Neurotransmitters, second messenger systems, protein kinases, ion channels, and transcription factors like CREB have been confirmed to function in both vertebrate and invertebrate learning and memory storage.

==Continuing work at Columbia University==
Since 1974, Kandel actively contributes to science as a member of the Division of Neurobiology and Behavior at the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University. In 2008, he and Daniela Pollak discovered that conditioning mice to associate a specific noise with protection from harm, a behavior called &quot;learned safety&quot;, produces a behavioral antidepressant effect comparable to that of medications. This finding, reported in &quot;Neuron&quot;, may inform further studies of the cellular interactions between antidepressants and behavioral treatments.

Kandel is also well known for the textbooks he has helped write, such as &quot;Principles of Neural Science&quot;. First published in 1981 and now in its sixth edition, the book is often used as a teaching and reference text in medical schools and undergraduate and graduate programs. Kandel has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1974.

He has also been at Columbia University since 1974 and lives in New York City.

==Current views about Vienna==
When Kandel won the Nobel Prize in 2000, initially the media reported of an &quot;Austrian&quot; Nobel Prize winner, phrasing that Kandel found &quot;typically Viennese: very opportunistic, very disingenuous, somewhat hypocritical&quot;. He also said it was &quot;certainly not an Austrian Nobel, it was a Jewish-American Nobel&quot;. After that, he got a call from then Austrian president Thomas Klestil asking him, &quot;How can we make things right?&quot; Kandel said that first, Doktor-Karl-Lueger-Ring should be renamed; Karl Lueger was an anti-Semitic mayor of Vienna, cited by Hitler in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The street was ultimately renamed in 2012 into Universitätsring. Second, he wanted the Jewish intellectual community to be brought back to Vienna, with scholarships for Jewish students and researchers. He also proposed a symposium on the response of Austria to Nazism, which at that time had been wanting greatly. Kandel has since accepted an honorary citizenship of Vienna and participates in the academic and cultural life of his native city, similar to Carl Djerassi. Kandel&#x27;s 2012 book, &quot;The Age of Insight&quot;—as expressed in its subtitle, &quot;The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present&quot;—represents a wide-ranging historical attempt to place Vienna at the root of cultural modernism by focussing on the personal interconnections between doctors such as Carl von Rokitansky, Emil Zuckerkandl, Sigmund Freud, with artists such as Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka and the writer Arthur Schnitzler, all of whom engaged with the &quot;unconscious&quot; in one way or another and influenced, Kandel claims, one another in the tight-knit salon of Berta Zuckerkandl and related occasions.

<doc id="193623" wikidata="Q1500063" url="?curid=193623" title="Louisiana Territory">
<text>The Territory of Louisiana or Louisiana Territory was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from July 4, 1805, until June 4, 1812, when it was renamed the Missouri Territory. The territory was formed out of the District of Louisiana, which consisted of the portion of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 33rd parallel (which is now the Arkansas–Louisiana state line).

==Background==
The Eighth Congress of the United States on March 26, 1804, passed legislation entitled &quot;An act erecting Louisiana into two territories, and providing for the temporary government thereof,&quot; which established the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana as organized incorporated U.S. territories. With regard to the District of Louisiana, this organic act, which went into effect on October 1, 1804, detailed the authority of the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory to provide temporary civil jurisdiction over the expansive region.

==Establishment==
On March 3, 1805, Congress passed legislation changing the District of Louisiana into the Louisiana Territory, effective July 4, 1805.

==Boundaries==
The Louisiana Territory included all of the land acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase north of the 33rd parallel. The eastern boundary of the purchase, the Mississippi River, functioned as the territory&#x27;s eastern limit. Its northern and western boundaries, however, were indefinite, and remained so throughout its existence. The northern boundary with the British territory of Rupert&#x27;s Land was established by the Treaty of 1818, and the western boundary with the Spanish viceroyalty of New Spain was defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819.

==Subdivisions==
The Louisiana Territory had five subdivisions: St. Louis District, St. Charles District, Ste. Genevieve District, Cape Girardeau District, and New Madrid District. In 1806, the territorial legislature created the District of Arkansas from lands ceded by the Osage Nation.

In the 1810 United States census, six counties in the Louisiana Territory, which included five counties in present-day Missouri and one county in present-day Arkansas, reported the following population counts:
==Government==
The territorial capital was St. Louis.

On March 11, 1805, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Gen. James Wilkinson as the first governor of the Territory of Louisiana.
Wilkinson concurrently held the position of Senior Officer of the United States Army. Meriwether Lewis (1807–1809) served as the 2nd and William Clark (1813–1820) served as the 4th, and final, territorial governor.

==Renaming==
On June 4, 1812, the Twelfth U.S. Congress enacted legislation which renamed Louisiana Territory as Missouri Territory, in order to avoid confusion with the recently admitted State of Louisiana.

==Current States==
The areas of the &quot; Louisiana Territory &quot; and &quot; Orleans Territory &quot; now cover several U.S. states, from the Gulf of Mexico to the border of Canada.

<doc id="193629" wikidata="Q191923" url="?curid=193629" title="Mulatto">
<text>&#x27; (, ) (original Italian spelling) is a racial classification that refers to people of mixed African and European ancestry only. When speaking or writing about a singular woman in English, the word is &#x27; (). The use of this term began in the United States of America shortly after the Atlantic Slave Trade began and its use was widespread, derogatory and disrespectful. After the post Civil Rights Era, the term is now considered to be both outdated and offensive in the United States. In other Anglophone countries (the English-speaking world) such as English and Dutch-speaking West Indian countries, the word mulatto is still used. The use of this word does not have the same negative associations found among English speakers. Among Latinos in both the US and Latin America, the word is used in every day speech and its meaning is a source of racial and ethnic pride. In four of the Latin-based languages, the default, masculine word ends with the letter &quot;o&quot; and is written as follows: Spanish and Portuguese – &quot;mulato&quot;; Italian – &quot;mulatto&quot;. The French equivalent is &quot;mulâtre&quot;. In English, the masculine plural is written as &quot;mulattoes&quot; while in Spanish and Portuguese it is &quot;mulatos&quot;. The masculine plural in Italian is &quot;mulatti&quot; and in French it is &quot;mulâtres&quot;. The feminine plurals are: English – &quot;mulattas&quot;; Spanish and Portuguese – &quot;mulatas&quot;; Italian – &quot;mulatte&quot;; French – &quot;mulâtresses&quot;.
Countries with the highest percentages of multi-racials who specifically have equally high European and African ancestry — &quot;Mulatto&quot; — are the Dominican Republic (74%) and Cape Verde (71%). Mulattos in many Latin American countries, aside from predominately European and African ancestry, usually also have slight indigenous admixture. &quot;Race-mixing&quot; has been strong in Latin America for centuries, since the start of the European colonization of the Americas in many cases. Many Latin American multiracial families (including mulatto) have been mixed for several generations. In the 21st century, multiracials now frequently have unions and marriages with other multiracials. Other countries and territories with notable mulatto populations in percentage or total number include Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama, Colombia, South Africa, and the United States.

==Etymology==
The English term and spelling &quot;mulatto&quot; is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese . It was a common term in the Southeastern United States during the era of slavery. Some sources suggest that it may derive from the Portuguese word (from the Latin ), meaning &#x27;mule&#x27;, the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey. The Real Academia Española traces its origin to in the sense of hybridity; originally used to refer to any mixed race person. The term is now generally considered outdated and offensive in non-Spanish and non-Portuguese speaking countries, and was considered offensive even in the 19th century.

Jack D. Forbes suggests it originated in the Arabic term &quot;muwallad&quot;, which means &#x27;a person of mixed ancestry&#x27;. literally means &#x27;born, begotten, produced, generated; brought up&#x27;, with the implication of being born of Arab and non-Arab parents. is derived from the root word (Arabic: , direct Arabic transliteration: &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; ) and colloquial Arabic pronunciation can vary greatly. means &#x27;descendant, offspring, scion; child; son; boy; young animal, young one&#x27;.

In al-Andalus, referred to the offspring from parents of Arab Muslim origin and non-Arab Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of Arab or Berber Muslims and indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several generations of living among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion.

In English, printed usage of &quot;mulatto&quot; dates to at least the 16th century. The 1595 work &quot;Drake&#x27;s Voyages&quot; first used the term in the context of intimate unions producing biracial children. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defined mulatto as &quot;one who is the offspring of a European and a Black&quot;. This earliest usage regarded &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; as discrete &quot;species&quot;, with the &quot;mulatto&quot; constituting a third separate &quot;species&quot;.

According to Julio Izquierdo Labrado, the 19th-century linguist Leopoldo Eguilaz y Yanguas, as well as some Arabic sources is the etymological origin of &quot;.&quot; These sources specify that would have been derived directly from independently of the related word &quot;muladí,&quot; a term that was applied to Iberian Christians who had converted to Islam during the Moorish governance of Iberia in the Middle Ages.

The Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) casts doubt on the theory. It states, &quot;The term is documented in our diachronic data bank in 1472 and is used in reference to livestock mules in &quot;,&quot; whereas (from ) does not appear until the 18th century, according to [Joan] Corominas&quot;.

Scholars such as Werner Sollors cast doubt on the mule etymology for &quot;mulatto&quot;. In the 18th and 19th centuries, racialists such as Edward Long and Josiah Nott began to assert that mulattoes were sterile like mules. They projected this belief back onto the etymology of the word mulatto. Sollors points out that this etymology is anachronistic: &quot;The Mulatto sterility hypothesis that has much to do with the rejection of the term by some writers is only half as old as the word &#x27;Mulatto&#x27;.&quot;

==Africa==
Of São Tomé and Príncipe&#x27;s 193,413 inhabitants, the largest segment is classified as &quot;mestiço,&quot; or mixed race. 71% of the population of Cape Verde is also classified as such. The great majority of their current populations descend from unions between the Portuguese, who colonized the islands from the 15th century onward, and black Africans they brought from the African mainland to work as slaves. In the early years, mestiços began to form a third-class between the Portuguese colonists and African slaves, as they were usually bilingual and often served as interpreters between the populations.

In Angola and Mozambique, the constitute smaller but still important minorities; 2% in Angola and 0.2% in Mozambique.

&quot;Mulatto&quot; and are not terms commonly used in South Africa to refer to people of mixed ancestry. The persistence of some authors in using this term, anachronistically, reflects the old-school essentialist views of race as a &quot;de facto&quot; biological phenomenon, and the &#x27;mixing&#x27; of race as legitimate grounds for the creation of a &#x27;new race&#x27;. This disregards cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity and/or differences between regions and globally among populations of mixed ancestry.

In Namibia, an ethnic group known as Rehoboth Basters, descend from historic liaisons between the Cape Colony Dutch and indigenous African women. The name &quot;Baster&quot; is derived from the Dutch word for &#x27;bastard&#x27; (or &#x27;crossbreed&#x27;). While some people consider this term demeaning, the Basters proudly use the term as an indication of their history. In the early 21st century, they number between 20,000 and 30,000 people. There are, of course, other people of mixed race in the country.

===Cape Verde===
As of 2018, 71% of Cape Verdeans were Mulatto or Creole.

===South Africa===
The Coloured / Cape Malay people from Africa are descendants of mixed ancestry, from the early 17th Century European colonizers namely Dutch, British and French intermixed with the indigenous Khoisan and Bantu tribes of that region, as well as intermixing with Asian slaves from Indonesia, Malaysia and India.

The intermixing of different races began in the Cape province of South Africa during the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch east India company brought enslaved people from Asian regions, including; Indonesia, Malaysia and India these individuals were brought to the Cape Colony to work on farms, in households, as they were enslaved labourers . There is a significant genetic mixture of European, African and (Indian) Asian DNA in the modern ethnic group of Coloured people. Thus forced into their own communities and therefore created a generational mix of people and are to date an ethnic group.

In addition to African, European and Asian ancestry, Coloured people had some portion of Spanish or Portuguese ancestry. In the early 19th century some immigrants from Brazil arrived in South Africa as sailors, traders or refugees, and some intermarried with local mixed race (Coloured) communities. Also The (Canary Islands) Spain off the northwest coast of Africa, were a Spanish colony, and during the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch east India Company and other European powers brought enslaved people from the Canary Islands to South Africa, particularly to the Cape Colony (now known as South Africa). The Dutch East India Company&#x27;s ship &quot;Het Gelderland&quot;, which arrived at the Cape in 1671 with 174 slaves from the Canary Islands and The Portuguese ship, &quot;Sao Jose&quot; which was captured by the Dutch in 1713 and brought to the Cape with slaves from the Canary Islands. These enslaved people were forced to work on farms, in households, and in other industries and many were subjected to harsh conditions and treatment. The intermixing among European men and Spanish and Portuguese women&#x27;s descendants are part of the diverse Coloured communities in South Africa. It is however important to note that Spanish and Portuguese ancestry is not a dominant feature amongst the Coloured identity in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Individual family histories and ancestry may vary widely while the African, European and Asian ancestry is dominant amongst Coloured people from Africa.

Based on the Population Registration Act to classify people, the government passed laws prohibiting mixed marriages. Many people who classified as belonging to the &quot;Asian&quot; category could legally intermarry with &quot;mixed-race&quot; people because they shared the same nomenclature. The use of the term &quot;Coloured&quot; has changed over the course of history. For instance, in the first census after the South African war (1912), Indians were counted as &#x27;Coloured&#x27;. Before and after this war, they were counted as &#x27;Asiatic&#x27;. Zimbabwean Coloureds were descended from Shona or Ndebele mixing with British and Afrikaner settlers and Arab slaves.

Griqua, on the other hand, are descendants of Khoisan and Afrikaner trekboers. The Griqua were subjected to an ambiguity of other creole people within Southern African social order. According to Nurse and Jenkins (1975), the leader of this &quot;mixed&quot; group, Adam Kok I, was a former slave of the Dutch governor. He was manumitted and provided land outside Cape Town in the eighteenth century. With territories beyond the Dutch East India Company administration, Kok provided refuge to deserting soldiers, refugee slaves, and remaining members of various Khoikhoi tribes.

===Mulattoes in colonial Mexico===

Africans were transported by Spaniards slave traders to Mexico starting in the early 16th century. Offspring of Spaniards and African women resulted early on in mixed-race children, termed mulattoes. In Spanish law, the status of the child followed that of the mother, so that despite having a Spanish parent, their offspring were enslaved. The label &quot;mulatto&quot; was recorded in official colonial documentation, so that marriage registers, censuses, and court documents allow research on different aspects of mulattoes’ lives. Although some legal documents simply label a person a &quot;mulatto/a&quot;, other designations occurred. In the sales of casta slaves in 17th-century Mexico City, official notaries recorded gradations of skin color in the transactions. These included or (&#x27;white mulatto&#x27;), for light-skinned slave. These were usually American-born slaves. Some said categorized persons i.e. used their light skin to their advantage if they escaped slavery. often emphasized their Spanish parentage, and considered themselves and were considered separate from or &quot;pardos&quot; and ordinary mulattoes. Darker mulatto slaves were often termed or sometimes . In Chile, along with , there were also (&#x27;dark Spaniards&#x27;).

There was considerable malleability and manipulation of racial labeling, including the seemingly stable category of mulatto. In a case that came before the Mexican Inquisition, a woman publicly identified as a mulatta was described by a Spanish priest, Diego Xaimes Ricardo Villavicencio, as &quot;a white with curly hair, because she is the daughter of a dark-skinned and a Spaniard, and for her manner of dress she has flannel petticoats and a native blouse (&quot;huipil&quot;), sometimes silken, sometimes woolen. She wears shoes, and her natural and common language is not Spanish, but Chocho [an indigenous Mexican language], as she was brought up among Indians with her mother, from which she contracted the vice of drunkenness, to which she often succumbs, as Indians do, and from them she has also received the crime of [idolatry].&quot; Community members were interrogated as to their understanding of her racial standing. Her mode of dress, very wavy hair and light skin confirmed for one witness that she was a mulatta. Ultimately though, her rootedness in the indigenous community persuaded the Inquisition that she was an , and therefore outside of their jurisdiction. Even though the accused had physical features of a mulatta, her cultural category was more important. In colonial Latin America, could also refer to an individual of mixed African and Native American ancestry, but the term &quot;zambo&quot; was more consistently used for that racial mixture.

Dominican friar Thomas Gage spent over a decade in the Viceroyalty of New Spain in the early 17th century; he converted to Anglicanism and later wrote of his travels, often disparaging Spanish colonial society and culture. In Mexico City, he observed in considerable detail the opulence of dress of women, writing that &quot;The attire of this baser sort of people of blackamoors and mulattoes (which are of a mixed nature, of Spaniards and blackamoors) is so light, and their carriage so enticing, that many Spaniards even of the better sort (who are too too [sic] prone to venery) disdain their wives for them... Most of these are or have been slaves, though love have set them loose, at liberty to enslave souls to sin and Satan.&quot;

In the late 18th century, some mixed-race persons sought legal &quot;certificates of whiteness&quot; (), in order to rise socially and practice professions. American-born Spaniards (&quot;criollos&quot;) sought to prevent the approval of such petitions, since the &quot;purity&quot; of their own whiteness would be in jeopardy. They asserted their &quot;purity of blood&quot; (&quot;limpieza de sangre&quot;) as white persons who had &quot;always been known, held and commonly reputed to be white persons, Old Christians of the nobility, clean of all bad blood and without any mixture of commoner, Jew, Moor, Mulatto, or converso in any degree, no matter how remote.&quot; Spaniards both American- and Iberian-born discriminated against pardos and mulattoes because of their &quot;bad blood.&quot; One Cuban sought the grant of his petition in order to practice as a surgeon, a profession from which he was barred because of his mulatto designation. Royal laws and decrees prevented pardos and mulattoes from serving as a public notary, lawyer, pharmacist, ordination to the priesthood, or graduation from university. Mulattas declared white could marry a Spaniard.

===Mulattoes in the modern era===
====Brazil====

The term &quot;Pardo&quot; was first used by the Portuguese after their arrival in Brazil in 1500. The earliest reference comes from a letter by Pero Vaz de Caminha. Over time, the term evolved from the Latin word &quot;Pardus&quot; and was used to name birds called &quot;Pardais&quot; in the Middle East and the Americas. Currently, &quot;Pardo&quot; is officially used in Brazil by the IBGE(Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) for the classification of color/race. &quot;Pardo&quot; can also be known as &quot;mulatto,&quot; referring to a person of mixed ethnic ancestry, typically including white, black, and indigenous roots
According to the IBGE 2020 census, 45,3% of Brazilians identified as , a term for people of mixed backgrounds. Many mixed-race Brazilians have varying degrees of European, Amerindian and African ancestry. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics census 2006, some 42.6% of Brazilian identify as &quot;,&quot; an increase over the 2000 census.

==== Haiti ====

Mulattoes account for up to 5% of Haiti&#x27;s population. In Haitian history, such mixed-race people, known in colonial times as free people of color, gained some education and property before the Revolution. In some cases, their white fathers arranged for multiracial sons to be educated in France and join the military, giving them an advance economically. Free people of color gained some social capital and political power before the Revolution, were influential during the Revolution and since then. The people of color have retained their elite position, based on education and social capital, that is apparent in the political, economic and cultural hierarchy in present-day Haiti. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti&#x27;s history have been people of color.

Many Haitian mulattoes were slaveholders and often actively participated in the oppression of the black majority. Some Dominican mulattoes were also slave owners.

The Haitian Revolution was started by mulattoes. The subsequent struggle within Haiti between the mulattoes led by André Rigaud and the black Haitians led by Toussaint Louverture devolved into the War of Knives. With secret aid from the United States, Toussaint eventually won the conflict and made himself ruler of the entire island of Hispaniola. Napoleon ordered for Charles Leclerc and a substantial army to put down the rebellion; Leclerc seized Toussaint in 1802 and deported him to France, where he died in prison a year later. Leclerc was succeeded by General Rochambeau. With reinforcements from France and Poland, Rochambeau began a bloody campaign against the mulattoes and intensified operations against the blacks, importing bloodhounds to track and kill them. Thousands of black POW and suspects were chained to cannonballs and tossed into the sea. Historians of the Haitian Revolution credit Rochambeau&#x27;s brutal tactics for uniting black and mulatto soldiers against the French. 

In 1806, Haiti divided into a black-controlled north and a mulatto-ruled south. Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer, the son of a Frenchman and a former African slave, managed to unify a divided Haiti but excluded blacks from power. In 1847, a black military officer named Faustin Soulouque was made president, with the mulattoes supporting him; but, instead of proving a tool in the hands of the senators, he showed a strong will, and, although by his antecedents belonging to the mulatto party, he began to attach the blacks to his interest. The mulattoes retaliated by conspiring; but Soulouque began to decimate his enemies by confiscation, proscriptions, and executions. The black soldiers began a general massacre in Port-au-Prince, which ceased only after the French consul, Charles Reybaud, threatened to order the landing of marines from the men-of-war in the harbor.

===== Dominican Republic =====
Soulouque considered the neighbouring Dominican Republic&#x27;s white and mulatto rulers as his &quot;natural&quot; enemies. He invaded the Dominican Republic in March 1849, but was defeated at the Battle of Las Carreras by Pedro Santana near Ocoa on 21 April and compelled to retreat. Haitian strategy was ridiculed by the American press:
The Haitians were unable to ward off a series of Dominican navy reprisal raids along Haiti&#x27;s south coast, launched by Dominican president Buenaventura Báez. Despite the failure of the Dominican campaign, Soulouque caused himself to be proclaimed emperor on 26 August 1849, under the name of Faustin I. He was called a &quot;rey de farsa&quot; (clown emperor) by the Dominicans. Toward the close of 1855, he invaded the Dominican Republic again at the head of an army of 30,000 men, but was again defeated by Santana, and barely escaped being captured. His treasure and crown fell into the hands of the enemy. Soulouque was ousted in a military coup led by mulatto General Fabre Geffrard in 1858–59.

In the eastern two-thirds of Hispaniola, the mulattoes were an ever-growing majority group, and in essence they took over the entire Dominican Republic, with no organized black opposition. Many of its rulers and famous figures were mulattoes, such as Gregorio Luperón, Ulises Heureaux, José Joaquín Puello, Matías Ramón Mella, Buenaventura Báez, and Rafael Trujillo. The Dominican Republic has been described as the only true mulatto country in the world. Pervasive Dominican racism, based on rejection of African ancestry, has led to many assaults against the large Haitian immigrant community, the most lethal of which was the 1937 parsley massacre. Approximately 5,000–67,000 men, women, children, babies and elderly, who were selected by their skin color, were massacred with machetes, or were thrown to sharks.

==== Dominican Republic ====

Mixed Dominicans, also referred to as mulatto, mestizo or historically quadroon, are Dominicans who are of mixed racial ancestry. Dominican Republic has many racial terms and some are used differently than in other countries, for example Mestizo signifies any racial mix and not solely a European/indigenous mix like in other Latin American countries, while Indio describes people of skin tones between white and black and has nothing to do with native peoples. Representing 73.9% of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s population, they are by far the single largest racial grouping of the country. Mixed Dominicans are the descendants from the racial integration between the Europeans, Native Americans, and later the Africans. They have a total population of approximately 8 million.

The Dominican Republic was the site of the first European settlement in the Americas, the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo founded in 1493. After the arrival of Europeans and the founding of the colony, African people were imported to the island. The fusion of European, native Taino, and African influences contributed to the development of present-day Dominican culture. From the start of the colonial period in the 1500s, Miscegenation (&quot;Mestizaje)&quot;, intermixing of races particularly Spanish settlers, native Tainos, and imported Africans (free or enslaved), was very strong. In fact, colonial Santo Domingo had higher amount of mixing and lesser racial tensions in comparison to other colonies, even other Spanish colonies, this was due to the fact that for most of its colonial period, Santo Domingo was a poorer colony where even the majority of the white Spanish settlers were poor, which helped foster a relatively peaceful racial atmosphere, allowing for growth in its mixed race population and racial fluidity. Santo Domingo as a colony was used a military base and had an economy based on Cattle ranching, which was a far less labor-intensive than the more common plantation slavery at the time. By the 1700s, the majority of the population was mixed race, forming the basis of the Dominican ethnicity as a distinct people well before independence was achieved. During colonial times, mixed-race/mulatto Dominicans had a lot of influence, they were instrumental in the independence period and the founding of the nation. Many Dominican presidents were mulatto, and mulatto Dominicans have had influence in every aspect of Dominican culture and society.

According to recent genealogical DNA studies of the Dominican population, the genetic makeup is predominantly European and Sub-Saharan African, with a lesser degree of Native American ancestry. The average Dominican DNA of the founder population is estimated to be 73% European, 10% Native, and 17% African. After the Haitian and Afro-Caribbean migrations the overall percentage changed to 57% European, 8% Native and 35% African. Due to mixed race Dominicans (and most Dominicans in general) being a mix of mainly European and African, with lesser amounts of indigenous Taino, they can accurately be described as &quot;Mulatto&quot; or &quot;Tri-racial&quot;. Dominican Republic have several informal terms to loosely describe a person&#x27;s degree of racial admixture, Mestizo means any type of mixed ancestry unlike in other Latin American countries it describes specifically a European/native mix, &quot;Indio&quot; describes mixed race people whose skin color is between white and black.

In Dominican Republic and some other Latin American countries, it can sometimes be difficult to determine the exact number of racial groups, because the lines between whites and lighter multiracials are very blurry, which is also true between blacks and darker multiracials. As race in Dominican Republic acts as a continuum of white—mulatto—black and not as clear cut as in places like the United States. And many times in the same family, there can be people of different colors and racial phenotypes who are blood related, this is due to the large amounts of interracial mixing for hundreds of years in Dominican Republic and the Spanish Caribbean in general, allowing for high amounts of genetic diversity. The majority of the Dominican population is tri-racial, with nearly all Dominicans having Taíno Native American ancestry along with European and African ancestry. European ancestry in the mixed population typically ranges between 50% and 60% on average, while African ancestry ranges between 30% and 40%, and the Native ancestry usually ranges between 5% and 10%. European and Native ancestry tends to be strongest in cities and towns of the north-central Cibao region, and generally in the mountainous interior of the country. African ancestry is strongest in coastal areas, the southeast plain, and the border regions.

==== Puerto Rico ====
Although the average Puerto Rican is of mixed-race, few actually identified as multiracial (&quot;two or more races&quot;) in the 2010 census; only 3.3% did so. They more often identified with their predominant heritage or phenotype. However, in the 2020 census, the amount of Puerto Ricans identifying as multiracial went up to 49.8% and an additional 25.5% identified as &quot;some other race&quot;, showing a marked change in the way Puerto Ricans view themselves. This may show that Puerto Ricans are now more open to embracing all sides of their mixed-race heritage and do not view themselves as part of the standard race dynamic in the United States hence the high number of people identifying as &quot;some other race&quot;, a similar phenomenon went on in the mainland United States with the overall US Hispanic/Latino population. 
Most have significant ancestry from two or more of the founding source populations of Spaniards, Africans, and Tainos, although Spanish ancestry is predominant in a majority of the population. Similar to many other Latin American ethnic groups, Puerto Ricans are multi-generationally mixed race, though most are European dominant in ancestry, Puerto Ricans who are &quot;evenly mixed&quot; can accurately be described &quot;&quot;Mulatto&quot;, &quot;Quadroon&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Tri-racial&quot; very similar to mixed populations in Cuba and Dominican Republic. Overall, Puerto Ricans are European-dominant Tri-racials, however there are many with near even European and African ancestry. According to the National Geographic Genographic Project, &quot;the average Puerto Rican individual carries 12% Native American, 65% West Eurasian (Mediterranean, Northern European and/or Middle Eastern) and 20% Sub-Saharan African DNA.&quot;

Studies have shown that the racial ancestry mixture of the average Puerto Rican (regardless of racial self-identity) is about 64% European, 21% African, and 15% Native Taino, with European ancestry strongest on the west side of the island and West African ancestry strongest on the east side, and the levels of Taino ancestry (which, according to some research, ranges from about 5%-35%) generally highest in the southwest of the island.

A study of a sample of 96 healthy self-identified White Puerto Ricans and self-identified Black Puerto Ricans in the U.S. showed that, although all carried a contribution from all 3 ancestral populations (European, African, and Amerindian), the proportions showed significant variation. Depending on individuals, although often correlating with their self-identified race, African ancestry ranged from less than 10% to over 50%, while European ancestry ranged from under 20% to over 80%. Amerindian ancestry showed less fluctuation, generally hovering between 5% and 20% irrespective of self-identified race.

Many Spaniard men took indigenous Taino and West African wives and in the first centuries of the Spanish colonial period the island was overwhelmingly racially mixed. Under Spanish rule, mass immigration shifted the ethnic make-up of the island, as a result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. Puerto Rico went from being two-thirds black and mulatto in the beginning of the 19th century, to being nearly 80% white by the middle of the 20th century. This was compounded by more flexible attitudes to race under Spanish rule, as epitomized by the &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot;. Under Spanish rule, Puerto Rico had laws such as &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot; or &quot;Gracias al Sacar&quot;, which allowed persons of mixed ancestry to pay a fee to be classified as white, which was the opposite of &quot;one-drop rule&quot; in US society after the American Civil War.

==== Cuba ====
In the 2012 Census of Cuba, 26.6% (2.97 million) of the Cubans self-identified as mulatto or mestizo. But the percentage multiracial/mulatto make up varies widely, from as low as 26% to as high as 51%. Unlike, the two other Spanish Caribbean islands (Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico) where nearly everyone even most self-proclaimed whites and blacks are mixed to varying degrees, in Cuba there are significant pure or nearly pure European and African populations. Multi-racials/Mulattos are widespread throughout Cuba. The DNA average for the Cuban population is 72% European, 23% African, and 5% indigenous, though among mulatto Cubans the European and African ancestry is more even.

Prior to the 20th century, majority of the Cuban population was of mixed race descent to varying degrees, with pure Spaniards or criollos being a significant minority. Between 1902 and 1933, some 750,000 Spaniards migrated to Cuba from Europe, which changed the racial demographics of the region rapidly. Many of the newly arrived Spanish migrants did not intermix with the native Cuban population, unlike the earlier colonial settlers and conquistadors who intermixed with Tainos and Africans at large scale rates. Self identified “white” Cubans with colonial roots on the island usually have Amerindian and or African admixture to varying degrees, as well as self identified “black” Cubans with colonial roots having varying degrees of European and or Amerindian admixture.

===Colonial and Antebellum eras===


Historians have documented sexual abuse of enslaved women during the colonial and post-revolutionary slavery times by white men in power: planters, their sons before marriage, overseers, etc., which resulted in many multiracial children born into slavery. Starting with Virginia in 1662, colonies adopted the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot; in slave law, which said that children born in the colony were born into the status of their mother. Thus, children born to slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of who their fathers were and whether they were baptized as Christians. Children born to white mothers were free, even if they were mixed-race. Children born to free mixed-race mothers were also free.

Paul Heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color listed in the 1790–1810 censuses in the Upper South were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in Virginia between white women, who were free or indentured servants, and African or African American men, servant, slave or free. In the early colonial years, such working-class people lived and worked closely together, and slavery was not as much of a racial caste. Slave law had established that children in the colony took the status of their mothers. This meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free. The colony required them to serve lengthy indentures if the woman was not married, but nonetheless, numerous individuals with African ancestry were born free, and formed more free families. Over the decades, many of these free people of color became leaders in the African-American community; others married increasingly into the white community. His findings have been supported by DNA studies and other contemporary researchers as well.

A daughter born to a South Asian father and Irish mother in Maryland in 1680, both of whom probably came to the colony as indentured servants, was classified as a &quot;mulatto&quot; and sold into slavery.

Historian F. James Davis says,

Historically in the American South, the term mulatto was also applied at times to persons with mixed Native American and African American ancestry. For example, a 1705 Virginia statute reads as follows: 
&quot;And for clearing all manner of doubts which hereafter may happen to arise upon the construction of this act, or any other act, who shall be accounted a mulatto, Be it enacted and declared, and it is hereby enacted and declared, That the child of an Indian and the child, grand child, or great grand child, of a negro shall be deemed, accounted, held and taken to be a mulatto.&quot;However, southern colonies began to prohibit Indian slavery in the eighteenth century, so, according to their own laws, even mixed-race children born to Native American women should be considered free. The societies did not always observe this distinction.

Certain Native American tribes of the Inocoplo family in Texas referred to themselves as &quot;mulatto&quot;. At one time, Florida&#x27;s laws declared that a person from any number of mixed ancestries would be legally defined as a mulatto, including White/Hispanic, Black/Native American, and just about any other mix as well.

In the United States, due to the influence and laws making slavery a racial caste, and later practices of hypodescent, white colonists and settlers tended to classify persons of mixed African and Native American ancestry as black, regardless of how they identified themselves, or sometimes as Black Indians. But many tribes had matrilineal kinship systems and practices of absorbing other peoples into their cultures. Multiracial children born to Native American mothers were customarily raised in her family and specific tribal culture. Federally recognized Native American tribes have insisted that identity and membership is related to culture rather than race, and that individuals brought up within tribal culture are fully members, regardless of whether they also have some European or African ancestry. Many tribes have had mixed-race members who identify primarily as members of the tribes.

If the multiracial children were born to slave women (generally of at least partial African descent), they were classified under slave law as slaves. This was to the advantage of slaveowners, as Indian slavery had been abolished. If mixed-race children were born to Native American mothers, they should be considered free, but sometimes slaveholders kept them in slavery anyway. Multiracial children born to slave mothers were generally raised within the African-American community and considered &quot;black&quot;.

===California===

The first pioneers of Alta California were of mulatto ancestry.

===Louisiana===

The American Guide to Louisiana, published by the Federal Writers Project in 1941, included a breakdown of traditional race classifications in that region, stating &quot;The following elaborate terminology, now no longer in use because of the lack of genealogical records upon which to base finely drawn blood distinctions, was once employed to differentiate between types according to diminution of Negro blood.&quot; (Original orthography preserved.)

A 1916 history called &quot;The Mulatto in the United States&quot; reported two other archaic race-classification systems:

===Contemporary era===

Mulatto was used as an official census racial category in the United States, to acknowledge multiracial persons, until 1930. (In the early 20th century, several southern states had adopted the one-drop rule as law, and southern Congressmen pressed the US Census Bureau to drop the mulatto category: they wanted all persons to be classified as &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot;.)

Since 2000, persons responding to the census have been allowed to identify as having more than one type of ethnic ancestry.

Mulatto (&quot;Biracial&quot; in the U.S.) populations come from various sources. Firstly, the average ancestral DNA of African Americans is about 90% African, 9% European, and 1% indigenous. Lighter skinned (African descendant Americans) are usually &quot;more mixed&quot; than the average African American, with the white ancestors sometimes being several generations back, which gives them a multiracial phenotype. Some of these lighter African Americans have abandoned the black identity and started to identify as multiracial. Many small isolate mixed race groups, such as for example Louisiana Creole people, got absorbed into the overall African American population. There also growing numbers of black/white interracial couples and multiracial people of recent origins– parents being of different races. Many immigrants who are racially Mulattos, have come to the United States from countries like Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, being most prevalent in cities like New York and Miami.

<text>No Place to Run is the eighth studio album by English rock band UFO, released in January 1980 by Chrysalis Records. It was the band&#x27;s first record to feature Paul Chapman, who replaced Michael Schenker on lead guitar.

The album was produced by George Martin, best known for his work with The Beatles. The album cover appeared in different varieties in the UK, although the only difference was the colour of the title. The album yielded two singles: &quot;Young Blood&quot; and &quot;Lettin&#x27; Go&quot;.

&quot;At the time, I thought &quot;No Place to Run&quot; sounded a bit flat with George Martin&#x27;s mix&quot;, remarked Chapman in 2009, when a remastered version was released, with an expanded booklet and bonus tracks. &quot;And I still do, kind of, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as flat as I first thought.&quot;

<doc id="193662" wikidata="Q13263919" url="?curid=193662" title="Borborites">
<text>According to the &quot;Panarion&quot; of Epiphanius of Salamis (ch. 26), and Theodoret&#x27;s &quot;Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium&quot;, the Borborites or Borborians (; in Egypt, Phibionites; in other countries, Koddians, Barbelites, Secundians, Socratites, Zacchaeans, Stratiotics) were a Christian Gnostic sect, said to be descended from the Nicolaitans. It is difficult to know for sure the practices of the group, as both Epiphanius and Theodoret were opponents of the group. According to Epiphanius, the sect were libertines who embraced the pleasures of the earthly world.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Borborite&quot; comes from the Greek word , meaning &quot;mud&quot;; the name &quot;Borborites&quot; can therefore be translated as &quot;filthy ones&quot;, and is unlikely to be the term the sect used for themselves. The name &quot;Koddian&quot; is claimed by Epiphanius to derive from an Aramaic term for a dish or bowl; J. J. Buckley writes that the likely root, &quot;kuda&quot;, refers in both Syriac Aramaic and Mandaic Aramaic to a hemorrhage after birth, or to the caul of a fetus, suggesting that the reference to a &#x27;bowl&#x27; is euphemistic.

== Teachings ==

=== Sacred texts ===
The Borborites possessed a number of sacred books, including &quot;Noria&quot; (the name they gave to Noah&#x27;s wife), a &quot;Gospel of Eve&quot;, &quot;The Apocalypse of Adam&quot;, and &quot;The Gospel of Perfection&quot;. They also used a version of &quot;The Gospel of Philip&quot;, but a quotation from the Borborite &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot; found in Epiphanius&#x27; &quot;Panarion&quot; is not found anywhere in the surviving version from Nag Hammadi. Several of the Borborites&#x27; sacred scriptures revolved around the figure of Mary Magdalene, including &quot;The Questions of Mary&quot;, &quot;The Greater Questions of Mary&quot;, &quot;The Lesser Questions of Mary&quot;, and &quot;The Birth of Mary&quot;. The Borborites also used a number of sacred texts attributed to Seth, the son of Adam and Eve, including the &quot;Second Treatise of the Great Seth&quot; and the &quot;Three Steles of Seth&quot;. Although the Borborites did also use both the Old Testament and the New Testament, they renounced the God of the Old Testament as an impostor deity.

=== Cosmology ===
They taught that there were eight heavens, each under a separate archon. In the seventh reigned a figure variously called Yaldabaoth or Sabaoth, creator of heaven and earth, the God of the Jews, represented by some Borborites under the form of an ass or a hog; hence the Jewish prohibition of swine&#x27;s flesh. In the eighth heaven reigned Barbelo, the mother of the living; the Father of All, the supreme God; and Jesus Christ. They denied that Christ was born of Mary, or had a real body, defending instead docetism; and also denied the resurrection of the body. The human soul after death wanders through the seven heavens, until it obtains rest with Barbelo. Man possesses a soul in common with plants and beasts.

Epiphanius also indicates that the Phibionites honored 365 archons, with the 8 listed archons merely being the greatest of them. According to him, a male would have sex for each one of the archons as an offering.

Tangentially during his description of the Nicolaitans, Epiphanius claims that certain Gnostics, a subset of those &quot;who are called Gnostics and Phibionites, the so-called disciples of Epiphanes, the Stratiotics, Levitics, Borborites and the rest&quot;, believed Barbelo to appear repeatedly to the archons in an attractive form so as to collect their semen, and in the process of doing so recover the power that had been &quot;sown&quot; in them. J. J. Buckley notes that this belief may have served as the grounds for certain Phibionite rituals.

=== Sexual sacramentalism ===
Epiphanius claims that the Borborites were inspired by Sethianism and that elements of sexual sacramentalism formed an important role in their rituals. He asserts that the Borborites engaged in a version of the eucharist in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively. He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her monthly period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual.

The Borborites were also said to extract fetuses from pregnant women and consume them, particularly if the women accidentally became pregnant during related sexual rituals. Buckley notes that this implies treatment of an aborted foetus as &quot;strayed semen&quot;, and would serve to prevent it from developing into another body &quot;for the archons&#x27; clutches&quot;.

== Historiography ==
=== Background of Epiphanius ===
Epiphanius wrote that he had some first-hand knowledge of the sect. According to him, two Gnostic women approached him and attempted to recruit him into the sect and seduce him. They also allowed him to read their scriptures, yet Epiphanius claims he was untempted and did not join. Instead, he reported the group to the bishops, resulting in the expulsion of around 80 people from the city of Alexandria.

=== Opinions of modern scholars on reliability ===
Because everything that is known about the Borborites comes exclusively from polemics written by their opponents, it is still disputed whether or not these reports accurately reflect Borborite teachings or if they are merely propaganda intended to discredit them.

Stephen Gero finds the accounts written by Epiphanius and later writers plausible and connects them with earlier Gnostic myths.

J. J. Buckley, similarly, highlights parallels which the Phibionite or Koddian belief system and rituals described by Epiphanius show with other Gnostic groups. The consumption of seminal and fetal material, as a microcosm of Barbelo&#x27;s seduction of the archons to recover captive light, shows parallels with the Manichaean belief that when vegetables are consumed by the Elect, the captive light-particles or divine sparks within are purified and liberated. The ritual use of semen and menses parallels the use of water and hamra, respectively, in a ritual metaphor for fertilization in a Mandaean masiqta. Contrasts include Mandaean pronatalism versus Phibionite antinatalism, the stratification of society into priests and laity (Mandaeism) or elect and hearers (Manichaeism) versus the work to liberate divine sparks being carried out by the Phibionite laity, and the Manichaean view of semen and menses as demonic versus the Phibionite identification of their own bodily fluids with the body of Christ.

Bart Ehrman, conversely, finds Epiphanius almost entirely unreliable. Ehrman writes that accusing opponents of wild sexual practices was common in Roman antiquity, so Epiphanius&#x27;s lurid accounts should be seen as an outgrowth of that. He also finds Epiphanius&#x27;s story of how he learned of their alleged doctrines implausible – if they truly were having scandalous rites, they would be unlikely to share them with non-members. More generally, documents written by Egyptian Gnostics themselves such as those found in the Nag Hammadi library do not seem to match what the anti-heresy writers claimed. While both their opponents and the Gnostics agreed that Gnosticism scorned the material world of the flesh, Gnostic writing has generally indicated a trend toward asceticism as a result – of ignoring or punishing the flesh through exertion and fasting. Proto-Orthodox writers instead concluded that if the Gnostics believed the material world to be inferior to that of the spirit, they would have thrown themselves into debauchery, a claim Ehrman finds unsupported by evidence and the opposite of what the actual Gnostics likely thought.

== In Mandaean texts ==
Gelbert (2013, 2023) suggests that one passage in the Ginza Rabba (Right Ginza 9.1, paragraph 26) describes the Borborites, although they are not given a name in Mandaic.

<doc id="193669" wikidata="Q2031261" url="?curid=193669" title="Piedras Negras (Maya site)">
<text>Piedras Negras is the modern name for an ancient, ruined city of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization located on the north bank of the Usumacinta River in the Petén department of northwestern Guatemala. The Mayan name for the city was Yo&#x27;k&#x27;ib&#x27; () or Yokib&#x27;. Piedras Negras was one of the most powerful of the Usumacinta ancient Maya urban centers. Occupation at Piedras Negras is known from the Late Preclassic period onward, based on dates retrieved from epigraphic information found on multiple stelae and altars at the site. Piedras Negras is a priceless archaeological site, known for its large sculptural output when compared to other ancient Maya sites. The wealth of sculpture, in conjunction with the precise chronological information associated with the lives of the settlement&#x27;s elite, has allowed archaeologists to reconstruct the political history of the city&#x27;s polity and its geopolitical footprint.

== Location ==
Piedras Negras is located in the Southern Lowlands of Guatemala, very close to the border with Mexico.

== Geography ==
Piedras Negras is located along the eastern banks of the Usumacinta River. The settlement is oriented around plazas, without a grid system. The polity is built into a series of hills, offering a natural defensive structure, and is currently heavily forested.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Piedras Negras&quot; means &quot;black stones&quot; in Spanish; in the language of the Classic Maya, the name has been read (in Maya inscriptions) as Yo&#x27;k&#x27;ib&#x27; (), meaning &quot;great gateway&quot;, or &quot;entrance&quot;, considered a possible reference to a large (and now dry) sinkhole nearby. It may also have been a reference to its location as a prominent intermediary along the trade routes leading to the Tabasco floodplain. Some authors think that the name is &quot;Paw Stone&quot;, but is more likely to be the name of the founder, as hieroglyphs on Throne 1 and Altar 4 show.

==History of Piedras Negras==

Piedras Negras had been populated since the 7th century BC. Its population seems to have peaked twice; the first peak occurred in the Late Preclassic period, around 200 BC, and was followed by a subsequent decline. The second peak happened in the Late Classic period, around the second half of the 8th century, during which the maximum population of the principal settlement is estimated to have been around 2,600 people. At the same time, Piedras Negras was also the largest polity in the region, with a total population estimate of around 50,000.
Piedras Negras was an independent city-state for most of the Early and Late Classic periods, although it may have been allied with other adjacent states and may have paid-tribute to others, at times. It had an alliance with Yaxchilan, in what is now Chiapas state, Mexico, some 40 km up the Usumacinta River. Ceramics show the site was occupied from the mid-7th century BC to 850 AD. Its most impressive period of sculpture and architecture dated from about 608 through 810, although there is some evidence that Piedras Negras was already a city of some importance since 400 AD.

Panel 12 of Piedras Negras shows three neighboring rulers as captives of Ruler C. One of the captives might be the ninth king of Yaxchilan, Joy B&#x27;alam (also known as Knot-Eye Jaguar I), who continued to reign after the panel was made. As subservient rulers were often depicted as bound captives, even while continuing to rule their own kingdoms, the panel suggests that Piedras Negras may have established its authority over the middle Usumacinta drainage in about 9.4.0.0.0 (514 AD).

The artistry of the sculpture of the Late Classic period of Piedras Negras is considered particularly fine. The site has two ball courts and several plazas; there are vaulted palaces and temple pyramids, including one that is connected to one of the many caves on the site. Along the banks of the river is a large boulder with the emblem glyph of Yo’ki’b carved on it, facing skyward.

A unique feature of the monuments at Piedras Negras is the frequent occurrence of the so-called &quot;artists&#x27; signatures&quot;. Individual artists have been identified by the use of recurring glyphs on stelae and other reliefs.

Ruler 7 (reigned 781-808?) of Piedras Negras was captured by K&#x27;inich Tatbu Skull IV of Yaxchilan. This event was recorded on the lintel 10 of Yaxchilan. Piedras Negras might have been abandoned within several years after this event.

Before the site was abandoned, some monuments were deliberately damaged, including images and glyphs of rulers being defaced, while other were left intact, suggesting a revolt or conquest by people literate in Maya writing.

=== Late Preclassic/Early Classic Rulers ===
Relatively little is known of the Late Preclassic/Early Classic rulers, but excavations of the West Group Plaza found masonry dating to the Early Classic; altar 1 is dedicated to Ruler A, dating to AD 297.

K&#x27;an Ahk I: AD 297- ?, induction Long Count Date: 8.13.0.0.0

K&#x27;an Ahk II: AD ca 460-ca 478

Yat Ahk I (or Turtle Tooth): 510-514. Panel 2 mentions him, and states that Turtle Tooth had an overlord at an unknown site; Ancient Maya name is unknown, but some scholars believe his name to be Yah Ahk 1.

Ruler C: 514–53, induction Long Count Date: 9.4.0.0.0. Lintel 12 depicts Ruler C receiving 4 captives, including Knot-eye Jaguar of Yaxchilan. Stela 30, long count 9.5.0.0.0 (AD 534), is possibly a celebration of a &quot;k&#x27;atun&quot; ending. Stela 29, long-count 9.5.5.0.0 (AD 539), is in celebration of a &quot;hotun (a five-year period)&quot;ending during Ruler C&#x27;s reign. Both would have been causes of celebration in antiquity.

=== Late Classic Rulers ===
K’inich Yo’nal Ahk I: 603–639, induction long count: 9.8.10.6.16. K’inich Yo’nal Ahk I ran a series of military conquests throughout the Usumacinta area, and defeated Palenque in AD 628, taking captive Ch’ok Balum, one of Palenque&#x27;s lords. Stela 25 commemorates his accession. After K’inich Yo’nal Ahk I&#x27;s accession, he razed the Early Classic monuments and some of the buildings in an effort to discredit the symbols of earlier kings, and, additionally, begin construction and renovation on older architecture in the South Group to establish his dynasty and lineage.

Dedications:

Stelae: 25, 26, 31

Itzam K&#x27;an Ahk I: 639–686, induction Long Count: 9.10.6.5.9. The son of K’inich Yo’nal Ahk I, Ruler 2 continued his father&#x27;s military conquests, and in 662, was victorious over Santa Elena, which is commemorated in Stela 35. Panel 15 celebrates the capture of an unknown polity and an unknown captive, which was issued by Ruler 2&#x27;s son after his death. This act of commissioning an artist to memorial one&#x27;s predecessor is not rare and can be seen again in Ruler 2&#x27;s commission of Panel 2 which celebrates the &quot;k’atun&quot; anniversary of the death of K’inich Yo’nal Ahk I. It also recalls Turtle Tooth&#x27;s receiving of 6 captives after battle and mentions his unknown overlord at another site. Later in his reign two stelae were placed in the West Group, whereas early stelae were raised in South Group.

Dedications:

Panels: 2, 4, 7

Stelae: 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39

Throne: 2

K’inich Yo’nal Ahk II: 687–729, ascension long count: 9.12.14.13.1. All eight of his stelae, placed in West Group, indicating that K’inich Yo’nal Ahk II abandoned the South Group which had been used by his ancestor&#x27;s. The son of Ruler 2, K’inich Yo’nal Ahk II is most known for his marriage alliance and military defense. He married Lady K’atun Ajaw from Namaan in AD 686. While the site of Namaan is currently unidentified, this marriage shows that Piedras Negras and Namaan were important to one other, and both would have benefited from the marriage. While Ahk II suffered a few military losses, notably the loss of La Mar and in 725 the capture of one of his &quot;sajal (a lesser lord)&quot; by Palenque, the ruler was victorious over Yaxchilan in 727, capturing a &quot;sajal&quot;, as commemorated in Stela 8. K’inich Yo’nal Ahk II&#x27;s tomb has been identified as Burial 5, under Patio 1 in front of J-3.

Dedications:

Altar 1

Panel: 15

Stelae: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Itzam K&#x27;an Ahk II: 729–757, induction long count: 9.14.18.3.13. Ascension Stela: Stela 11. Son of K’inich Yo’nal Ahk II. Most of his stelae were in West Group. Using Panel 3, issued by Ruler 7, was placed in front of O-13, in the East Group. Excavated in 1997 by Héctor Escobedo and Tomás Barrientos, a royal interment, Burial 13, was found. The interment was similar to that of Burial 5, with the exception that it had been reentered later, indicated by absent or burned bones. Tomb reentry was culturally significant to the Maya, and indicates that Ruler 4 was well respected both in life and in death.

Dedications:

Altar: 2

Stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, 40

Yo’nal Ahk III: 758–767, induction long count: 9.16.6.17.1. Son of Ruler 4, ascension stela: Stela 14. Stelae were placed in the East Group, indicating a move from the South and West Groups previously used by rulers.

Dedications:

Stelae: 14, 16

Ha’ K’in Xook: 767–780, induction long count: 9.16.16.0.4. Accession stela: Stela 23. Brother of Yo’nal Ahk III, son of Ruler 4, abdicated in 780, according to Throne 1.

Dedications:

Stelae: 13, 18, 23

K&#x27;inich Yat Ahk II: 781–808, induction long count: 9.17.10.9.4. Son of Ruler 4, brother of Yo’nal Ahk III and Ha’ K’in Xook, ruler 7 continued to use the East Group, specifically O-13, as the area for his stelae to be placed. In 785, he commissioned Throne 1, placing it in str. J-6, one of the finest pieces of sculpture from Piedras Negras. Ruler 7 engaged in numerous military conquests, including the defeat of Santa Elena in 787 and wars with Pomoná. Stela 12 depicts Ruler 7 with La Mar Ajaw, Parrot Chaak, sitting in judgement over captives from Pomoná, indicating a close military allegiance between the two. Ruler 7&#x27;s campaigns ended in 808 when he was captured by K’inich Tatb’u Skull III, ruler of Yaxchilan, depicted in Lintel 10.

Dedications:

Altar 4

Stelae: 12, 15

Panel: 3

Throne: 1

=== Decline of Piedras Negras ===
Ruler 7 is the last known of king of Piedras Negras. With his capture, the dynasty which had governed over Piedras Negras since AD 603 effectively ended. However, even before his capture, the polity seemed to be in decline. When Throne 1 was unearthed in 1930, it had been shattered. After additional excavations in the 1990s, it became evident that there were other signs of burning and destruction throughout the site, but most notably at the royal palace. The internal feuding between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilán, beginning in the fifth century AD, played a large role in the instability of the polity. The conflict between the two was not limited to fighting and warfare; the two polities both are known for their artistic output which offered an additional way in which to validate and enforce the polity&#x27;s respective power. Though monument construction and dedication did not continue into the ninth century, occupation of the site itself did. The site was abandoned by AD 930. It is not possible to fully ascertain whether limited occupation continued as no archaeological evidence has yet been unearthed for occupation continuing after AD 930.

== Glyphs ==
Using the abundant number of stelae recovered from Piedras Negras, Tatiana Proskouriakoff revolutionized current understanding of Maya hieroglyphs. Proskouriakoff realized that stelae which depicted a person within a niche and the glyphic texts on them were in fact the long count recounting important events in the life of a ruler, such as their date of birth and accession to the throne. Proskouriakoff&#x27;s contribution to Mayan epigraphy changed the idea of the ancient Maya from a people of peace and cosmology to a people actively participating and recording political and social histories.

== List of rulers ==
== Modern history of the site ==

The site was first explored, mapped, and its monuments photographed by Teoberto Maler at the end of the 19th century.

An archeological project at Piedras Negras was conducted by the University of Pennsylvania from 1931 to 1939 under the direction of J. Alden Mason and Linton Satterthwaite. Further archaeological work here was conducted from 1997 to 2000, directed by Stephen Houston of Brigham Young University and Hector Escobedo of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, with permission from the Instituto de Antropología e Historia de Guatemala (IDAEH).

Mayanist Tatiana Proskouriakoff was the first to decipher the names and dates of a Maya dynasty from her work with the monuments at this site, a breakthrough in the decipherment of the Maya Script. Prouskourikoff was buried here in Group F after her death in 1985.

In 2002 the World Monuments Fund earmarked 100,000 United States dollars for the conservation of Piedras Negras. It is today part of Guatemala&#x27;s Sierra del Lacandón national park.

<text>The Huntley–Brinkley Report (sometimes known as The Texaco Huntley–Brinkley Report for one of its early sponsors) is an American television program broadcast by NBC. Anchored by Chet Huntley in New York City, and David Brinkley in Washington, D.C. It aired from October 29, 1956 to July 31, 1970, replacing &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot; and was replaced by &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. The program ran for 15 minutes at its inception but expanded to 30 minutes on September 9, 1963, exactly a week after the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with Walter Cronkite did so. It was developed and produced initially by Reuven Frank. Frank left the program in 1962 to produce documentaries (Eliot Frankel replaced him) but returned to the program the following year when it expanded to 30 minutes. He was succeeded as executive producer in 1965 by Robert &quot;Shad&quot; Northshield and by Wallace Westfeldt in 1969.

==Overview==

===Background===

By 1956, NBC executives had grown dissatisfied with John Cameron Swayze in his role anchoring the network&#x27;s evening news program, which fell behind its main competition, CBS&#x27;s &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot;, in 1955. Network executive Ben Park suggested replacing Swayze with Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who had garnered favorable attention anchoring NBC&#x27;s coverage of the national political conventions that summer. Bill McAndrew, NBC&#x27;s director of news (later NBC News president), had seen a highly rated local news program on NBC affiliate WSAZ-TV in Huntington, West Virginia, with two anchors reporting from different cities. He replaced &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot; with the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, which premiered on October 29, 1956, with Huntley in New York and Brinkley in Washington. Producer Reuven Frank, who had advocated pairing Huntley and Brinkley for the convention coverage, thought using two anchors on a regular news program &quot;was one of the dumber ideas I had ever heard.&quot;

Huntley handled the bulk of the news most nights, with Brinkley specializing in Washington-area topics such as the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Pentagon. (When one was on vacation the other would typically handle the full broadcast alone, leaving viewers with a familiar anchor instead of a little-known substitute such as a field reporter.) The closing credits music for the broadcast was the second movement (scherzo) of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, from the 1952 studio recording with Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra.

===Enter Texaco===
Initially, the program lost audience from Swayze&#x27;s program, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower let it be known that he was displeased by the switch. In the summer of 1957, the program had no advertisers. As its content improved, though, it began attracting critical praise and a larger audience, and by 1958, it had pulled even with CBS&#x27;s program. The program received a big boost when, in June 1958, Texaco began purchasing all of its advertising, an arrangement that continued for three years.

===Critical reception===
Critics considered Huntley to possess one of the best broadcast voices ever heard, and Brinkley&#x27;s dry, often witty, newswriting presented viewers a contrast to the often sober output from CBS News. The program received a Peabody Award in 1958 for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in News,&quot; the awards committee noting that the anchors had &quot;developed a mature and intelligent treatment of the news that has become a welcome and refreshing institution for millions of viewers.&quot; The program received the award again two years later in the same category, the committee concluding that Huntley and Brinkley had &quot;dominated the news division of television so completely in the past year that it would be unthinkable to present a Peabody Award in that category to anybody else.&quot; By that time, the program had surpassed CBS&#x27;s evening news program, &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot;, in ratings and maintained higher viewership levels for much of the 1960s, even after Walter Cronkite took over CBS&#x27;s competing program (initially named &quot;Walter Cronkite with the News&quot; on April 16, 1962 and renamed the &quot;CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot; on September 2, 1963). It received eight Emmy Awards in its 14-year run.

Huntley and Brinkley conveyed a strong chemistry, and a survey for NBC later found that viewers liked that the anchors talked to each other. In fact, aside from their sign-off, Huntley and Brinkley&#x27;s only communication came when one anchor finished a story and handed off to the other by saying the other&#x27;s name, a signal to an AT&amp;T technician to switch the long-distance transmission lines from New York to Washington or vice versa. The anchors gained great celebrity, and surveys showed them better known than John Wayne, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, or the Beatles. In 1961, Frank Sinatra and Milton Berle entertained a crowd in Washington by singing, to the tune of &quot;Love and Marriage,&quot; &quot;Huntley, Brinkley/Huntley, Brinkley/One is glum, the other quite twinkly.&quot; The anchors appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; on March 13, 1961, with a similar tagline, &quot;TV&#x27;s Huntley and Brinkley: One is Solemn, the Other Twinkly.&quot; The impact of &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; on popular culture of the 1960s can be illustrated by a verse from the 1965 song &quot;So Long, Mom (A Song for World War III)&quot; by the satirist Tom Lehrer:

:&quot;While we&#x27;re attacking frontally,&quot;
:&quot;Watch Brink-a-ley and Hunt-a-ley&quot;
:&quot;Describing contrapuntally&quot;
:&quot;The cities we have lost...&quot;

Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. was shown in a 1964 photograph watching &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; on a television backstage in his dressing room in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, who quoted him saying, &quot;My only contact with reality. Whatever I&#x27;m doing, I stop to watch these guys.&quot;

===Ratings===
By 1965, the program brought in more advertising revenue than any other on television. On November 15 of that year, &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; became the first weekday network evening news program broadcast in color. The network&#x27;s weekend programs, Saturday&#x27;s &quot;Scherer-MacNeil Report&quot; and Sunday&#x27;s &quot;Frank McGee Report&quot;, were also broadcast in color at that time.

The program&#x27;s ratings slipped late in the decade as CBS&#x27;s Walter Cronkite gained fame for his coverage of the space program, a field in which neither Huntley nor Brinkley had much interest (although Huntley and Brinkley occasionally participated in space coverage, another NBC newsman, Frank McGee, was the prime anchor of NBC&#x27;s space coverage). Some contemporary observers at NBC felt the program began to slip after a 1967 strike by members of AFTRA. Brinkley honored the picket lines but Huntley, who viewed himself as &quot;a newsman, not a performer&quot; did not, remaining at the anchor desk. This split puzzled viewers, who had come to admire them for their teamwork. Unbeknownst to most viewers, that relationship was fairly limited—Huntley and Brinkley operated from different cities and rarely met in person, except for live coverage of political conventions, election nights, or a few other events.

===Saturday evening broadcasts===
For most of its run, &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; aired only Monday through Friday, but in January 1969, the network expanded it to Saturday evenings, with Huntley and Brinkley working solo on alternating weeks, although sometimes, the other would be seen in a taped essay or commentary recorded on Friday. On July 19, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission, both co-anchored live (Huntley and Brinkley were commentators during NBC&#x27;s coverage of the historic Moon landing, again with McGee as anchor). After the Saturday edition failed to garner sufficient ratings to justify two anchors, veteran correspondent Frank McGee took over as anchor, with Sander Vanocur substituting, although the broadcast kept the &quot;HBR&quot; name. &quot;The Frank McGee Report,&quot; a documentary program not tied to the day&#x27;s news, aired on Sundays in the time slot.

On February 16, 1970, NBC announced that Huntley would retire later that year. Huntley and Brinkley concluded their final newscast together on July 31, 1970.

Upon Huntley&#x27;s retirement, the network renamed the program the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Huntley died in 1974. Brinkley worked as co-anchor or commentator on &quot;Nightly News&quot; until 1981 when he departed for ABC News and its new weekly Sunday morning news program &quot;This Week&quot;. He died in 2003.

==In popular culture==
The program was parodied in one of the most oft-seen segments of the early Jim Henson program &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, which had originated from NBC-owned-and-operated WRC-TV in Washington, DC. Using audio from a broadcast of the show, puppet characters Hank and Frank lipsynch dialogue spoken by Huntley and Brinkley in response to original dialogue remarks by Kermit. The segment was sponsored by Esskay Meats in a bit performed by Harry the Hipster and a loudmouthed Professor Madcliffe.

Tom Lehrer&#x27;s bitterly satirical So Long Mom (a Song for WWIII) mentions the pair: &quot;While we&#x27;re attacking frontally watch Brinkaly and Huntaly recounting contrapuntally the cities we have lost...&quot;

<doc id="193671" wikidata="Q1630581" url="?curid=193671" title="Hostage Rescue Team">
<text>The Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) is the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s (FBI) elite tactical unit. The HRT was formed to provide a full-time federal law enforcement tactical capability to respond to major terrorist incidents throughout the United States. Today, the HRT performs a number of tactical law enforcement and national security functions in high-risk environments and conditions and has deployed overseas, including with military Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) units. In an article to mark its 40th anniversary, it was reported that since its formation in 1983 the HRT had deployed more than 900 times.

The HRT, along with the Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU), the SWAT Operations Unit that manages the field office SWAT program, and the Tactical Helicopter Unit (THU), comprise the Tactical Section of the FBI&#x27;s Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). The Hostage Rescue Team was founded in 1983 by Danny Coulson, former Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI, and completed its final certification exercise in October 1983. 

==History==

The HRT was conceived during the late 1970s after FBI director William H. Webster witnessed a demonstration by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Delta Force. When Webster reviewed the equipment used by the force he noticed there were no handcuffs. An operator told him &quot;We put two rounds in their forehead. The dead don&#x27;t need handcuffs.&quot; The HRT was to be an augmented SWAT and counter-terrorist team, capable of handling extraordinary hostage situations, large-scale counter-terrorist operations, situations involving nuclear or biological agents, or operations that local law enforcement or the regional FBI field office were not trained or equipped to handle. Final approval for the HRT was given in early 1982, and formal planning began in March that year. The initial HRT selection course was held in June 1982 and consisted of three groups of 30 candidates each. Most candidates were experienced SWAT team members and former military veterans including former Navy SEAL Thomas R. Norris. Of this group, 50 candidates were selected to continue to more advanced training.

The final touches were added to the facilities just before Thanksgiving 1982 and, after a short holiday break, the team began its initial training program. After receiving tactical SWAT instruction, each individual was given expertise to research, such as explosives and door breaching tactics. Each operator also served as a liaison to one of the existing elite counter-terrorism teams from around the world.

As part of their liaison duties, the men attended training exercises held by their assigned counter-terrorism unit and shared their experiences with the team. The team spent most of January 1983 honing their shooting and tactical skills at Quantico, and then traveled to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in February for a month of training and instruction with Delta Force. The team returned to Quantico for further training. It became operational in August 1983.

The team&#x27;s final certification exercise, code-named Operation Equus Red, was held in October 1983 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. During the exercise, the HRT, a local SWAT team, and a United States Department of Energy Nuclear Emergency Search Team (NEST) were tasked with assaulting a terrorist stronghold. The &quot;terrorist&quot; group was also believed to be in possession of a simulated nuclear device, which was at a separate location and had to be recovered or neutralized. After the NEST aircraft confirmed the location of the device, HRT operators infiltrated the terrorist safe house, secured the device, and managed to &quot;kill&quot; the terrorist involved in approximately 30 seconds. The FBI&#x27;s senior leadership viewed the exercise as a complete success and granted final approval for the team to become fully operational.

Upon completion of the certification exercise, the HRT began to expand its capabilities by sending small teams of operators out for more specialized training courses. Approximately a dozen operators visited Naval Amphibious Base Coronado to receive combat diver, maritime operations, and tactics (such as visit, board, search, and seizure—VBSS) training from the United States Navy SEALs. Other team members conducted helicopter operations and aerial insertion training with the US Army&#x27;s Task Force 160. Every operator also received 80 hours of medical training. The HRT traveled to Camp Peary, near Williamsburg, Virginia, for counter-terrorism training courses to develop skills in breaching barricades, running roadblocks, and defensive driving.

Over time, HRT operators studied with the U.S. military, along with local, federal, and foreign tactical teams, and attended private courses to learn more about air assault tactics, rappelling, close quarters combat, chemical agents, terrorist psychology, surveillance methods, sniping/counter-sniping, communications and more. Tactics learned during training were shared with the team. Eventually, for close quarter battle training, the HRT decided to make things more realistic on advice from SEAL Team Six (later known as the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group or DEVGRU) commander Richard Marcinko, and the HRT introduced blood bags and wax bullets. The wax bullets were used for team-versus-team drills.

The HRT became part of the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) upon its formation in 1994, due to the need to consolidate the assets necessary to respond to a critical incident in one group. Since being added to CIRG, HRT has been used to conduct law enforcement operations and counterterrorism operations globally, sometimes deploying with military special operations forces and intelligence units.

==Capabilities==
The HRT&#x27;s equipment and tactics are the most advanced of the FBI&#x27;s 56 SWAT teams and the 14 enhanced SWAT teams. The HRT&#x27;s capabilities are distinguished because the HRT operators (assault and sniper teams) serve full-time and train daily.

The HRT has the ability &quot;to deploy within four hours, with part or all of its personnel and resources, to any location within the United States or its territories&quot;. The unit is able to operate in a variety of environments (chemical, extreme cold, night and low-light, or rural environments). The HRT&#x27;s tactical teams have the ability to fast-rope, a technique in which the team rapidly descends a rope from the side of a helicopter. This technique is useful for deploying troops into an area where a helicopter cannot touch down. Even more advanced capabilities are possessed by the HRT, including High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) parachute operations, to name just one. The HRT&#x27;s capabilities include advanced ground tactics, advanced maritime operations, and advanced tactical aviation operations.
===Maritime capabilities===

The HRT, as a whole, possesses enhanced capabilities in the maritime domain, including advanced &quot;breaching&quot; capabilities (the ability to circumvent locked doors aboard a ship) and ship-boarding capabilities. The HRT has vessels that are outfitted for maritime assaults, most of which have been upgraded since 2004.

HRT also has a specialized maritime team with additional maritime capabilities including subsurface diving, closed-circuit diving (scuba gear that does not emit bubbles), and combat swimming undergoing the second phase of BUD/S. In addition operators of the maritime assault team element are also qualified to pilot and operate a freighter.

===Aviation capabilities===

The HRT&#x27;s Tactical Aviation Unit is staffed by FBI special agents. The Tactical Helicopter Unit, a sub-unit of the Tactical Aviation Unit, contains a variety of specially modified helicopters. These include military converted tactical Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks and tactically enhanced Bell 407s and Bell 412s. Unlike the military, whose aircraft are not always in the same location as their tactical operators, the HRT&#x27;s Tactical Helicopter Unit is in the vicinity of HRT central command. The HRT&#x27;s tactical aviators are required to fly daily.

== Organization ==
Gold Squadron - Maritime

Red Squadron - Buildings and hardpoints

Blue Squadron - Tubed structures (buses, trains, planes)

==Roles==
The primary roles of the HRT are hostage rescue and counter-terrorism. Secondary roles of the HRT include:
* Apprehending barricaded subjects;
* Executing helicopter operations and rescue missions;
* Executing mobile assaults;
* Performing high-risk raids, searches, arrests, and warrants;
* Coordinating manhunt and rural operations
* Providing force protection for FBI personnel overseas.

To a lesser extent, the HRT may deploy teams or individual operators to act as snipers, or to provide protective service details for certain high-profile federal witnesses or dignitaries. Teams provide support for missions overseas and support Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Teams at home and abroad perform typical law enforcement activities, such as making arrests, processing scenes for evidence recovery, and testifying in court.

The HRT has provided traditional law enforcement during hurricane relief operations, tactical surveys, and special events such as the Olympic Games, presidential inaugurations, and political conventions.

==Selection and training==

Prospective HRT operators are selected based upon their background and experience, as well as their demonstrated performance during the HRT selection course. The rigorous two-week selection process includes long-distance runs, forced marches, obstacle courses, and other tests of physical and mental stamina. Throughout the entire selection process, candidates are evaluated on their ability to think under pressure and to perform whilst physically exhausted. After a six-month initial training period known as &quot;New Operator Training School&quot; (&quot;NOTS&quot;), they are headquartered at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Both the selection course and NOTS are near mirror images of the 1st SFOD-D (&quot;Delta Force&quot;) selection and training courses, with some minor adjustments for mission differences.

Experienced HRT operators assigned to observer/sniper teams are sent to the United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper Basic Course. After successfully completing the course, they receive further instruction from HRT snipers. Maritime HRT operators are sent to a variety of maritime special operations courses, including Phase II of U.S. Navy BUD/S at Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, California.

When not operationally deployed, the HRT conducts full-time training for its members at various locations throughout the country. Two to three hours each day are set aside for physical training, a defensive tactics session, and combative training. One day a week is devoted to maintaining either perishable skills (such as fast roping, breaching, and photography) or specialized skills (such as mobile assaults, manhunt and rural operations), maritime operations, helicopter operations, parachuting, weapons of mass destruction training (provided by the United States Department of Energy), and cold weather operations. During a routine week of training, it is not unusual for HRT operators to fire thousands of rounds to keep their shooting skills honed with the HRT also participating in combined exercises that may involve a variety of governmental entities, such as the FBI and the Departments of Defense, State, Energy, and Homeland Security.

Three teams rotate through three 120-day cycles: training, operations, and support. During the training cycle, the team refreshes its skills and takes part in exercises, attends other courses, or trains with foreign and domestic units. During the operations cycle, the team is available for deployment (domestic or foreign). During the support cycle, the team works on special projects, maintains the HRT&#x27;s equipment, and conducts research.

The HRT is known to conduct joint training exercises and participate in exchange programs with some U.S. military units such as the Army&#x27;s Combat Applications Group (otherwise known as 1st SFOD-D or Delta Force) or the Navy&#x27;s DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six). The HRT routinely trains with other federal tactical teams such as the DEA&#x27;s FAST Team, the United States Border Patrol&#x27;s BORTAC unit or the United States Capitol Police&#x27;s CERT. Occasionally the HRT trains with the French GIGN, British SAS and SBS, Irish ERU, Australia’s SRG, German GSG 9, Italy’s GIS and other international units as well as assist in the formation of corresponding units within the NATO framework such as the Hellenic Coast Guard &quot;Special Missions Echelons&quot; (&quot;ΚΕΑ&quot; ΛΣ/ΕΛ.ΑΚΤ.). In addition to the HRT&#x27;s own facilities, the HRT routinely uses private and 1st SFOD-D Delta Force shoot houses and ranges. The HRT has also been known to train at Camp Peary and Harvey Point.

==Operations==
Since its inception, the HRT has been involved in many of the FBI&#x27;s most high-profile cases, executing numerous operations involving domestic militant groups, terrorists, and violent criminals. The first test of the team&#x27;s capabilities came in the summer of 1984 when the team deployed to Los Angeles as part of the security buildup prior to the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.

Some cases have brought the HRT heavy media attention. The HRT came under increased public and Congressional scrutiny, along with federal law enforcement in general, due to what some saw as heavy-handed tactics used at Waco and Ruby Ridge.

In the aftermath of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, HRT had a rare full deployment to Yemen. Under the authority of the Yemeni Government, brokered by the State Department, HRT performed personal protection for FBI investigators and participated in capture operations with the Central Intelligence Agency against suspects in the bombing. 

On the other hand, the HRT has been involved in over 200 successful missions, both in the US and abroad. Many of these operations have received little or no attention from the world press, such as the unit&#x27;s combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Some higher-profile cases include the Waco siege; the Ruby Ridge standoff; the capture of the suspected masterminds of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Africa; the rescue following the 2013 abduction of a five-year-old boy in Alabama; the rescue of prison guards at Talladega, Alabama, and St. Martinville, Louisiana; an arrest in Watertown, Massachusetts, related to the manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of two perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing of April 15; the 2013 rescue of Hannah Anderson; the 2014 rescue of kidnap victim Frank Arthur Janssen; the capture of Eric Frein, the sole suspect in the 2014 Pennsylvania State Police barracks attack; the protection of the 2016 Republican National Convention and the 2016 Democratic National Convention; the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, the rescue of three hostages in the 2022 Colleyville synagogue hostage crisis, and the 2023 Greenspoint Hostage Crisis.

==Casualties==
The HRT has suffered four known fatalities, all training related. The first was James K. McAllister, who died during a fast rope training exercise in 1986. The second known fatality was Gregory J. Rahoi, who died in a live fire exercise in 2006.

In May 2005, an FBI HRT McDonnell Douglas 530 helicopter crashed while conducting a fast rope exercise. Crew members sustained injuries, but none were life-threatening.

On May 17, 2013, HRT suffered two fatalities, Christopher Lorek and Stephen Shaw, involving a helicopter while training off the coast of Virginia Beach.

<doc id="193675" wikidata="Q4759428" url="?curid=193675" title="Androcles and the Lion (play)">
<text>Androcles and the Lion (Shavian: ) is a 1912 play written by George Bernard Shaw. The play is Shaw&#x27;s retelling of the tale of Androcles, a slave who is saved by the requiting mercy of a lion. In the play, Shaw portrays Androcles to be one of the many Christians being led to the Colosseum for torture. Characters in the play exemplify several themes and takes on both modern and supposed early Christianity, including the cultural clash between Jesus&#x27; teachings and traditional Roman values.

==Characters==

*Androcles (main character)
*The Lion
*Magaera
*Centurion
*Captain
*Lavinia
*Lentulus
*Metellus
*Spintho
*Ferrovius
*Ox-Driver
*Call Boy
*The Editor
*Menagerie Keeper
*Caesar
*Secutor
*Retiariu
==Plot==
Androcles, a fugitive Christian tailor, accompanied by his nagging wife, is on the run from his Roman persecutors. While hiding in the forest he comes upon a wild lion who approaches him with a wounded paw. His wife runs off. Androcles sees that the cause of the animal&#x27;s distress is a large thorn embedded in its paw, which he draws out while soothing the lion in baby language.

Androcles is captured and is sent to the Colosseum to be executed with other Christians in gladiatorial combat. They are joined by a new Christian convert called Ferrovius, who struggles to reconcile his Christian principles with his violent inclinations. The Roman captain guarding them is attracted to the genteel convert Lavinia. Eventually the Christians are sent into the arena, but Ferrovius kills all the gladiators before they can harm any Christians. He is offered a job in the Praetorian Guard, which he takes. The Christians are to be released, but the crowd demands blood. To satisfy them, Androcles offers himself to be savaged by lions. But the lion that is supposed to kill him turns out to be the one that Androcles saved, and the two dance around the arena to the delight of the crowd. The emperor comes into the arena to get a closer look, and the lion attacks him. Androcles calls him off and the emperor is saved. He then declares an end to the persecution of Christians. Androcles and his new &#x27;pet&#x27; depart together.
==Preface==
The short play is often printed with a preface that includes a long examination of the Gospels by Shaw, in which Shaw analyzes the Bible and proclaims his findings. In summary, Shaw states that Jesus was a benevolent genius (in areas ranging from moral to social to economic) who eventually bought into popular ideas of his divinity and impending martyrdom. Shaw goes on to state that the teachings of Jesus were lost with his crucifixion, and that the Christian churches that followed are instead based on the teachings and philosophies of Paul (see Pauline Christianity) or Barabbas. The preface is about twice as long as the play.

==Significance==

The play was written at a time when the Christian Church was an important influence on society and there was strong pressure on non-believers in public life. The reversal of roles in the play possibly served to evoke empathy from his targeted audience. The characters also represent different &quot;types&quot; of Christian believers. The journey and outcome of each of the characters make it clear which believers Shaw sympathizes with the most, especially with Lavinia. One of the most famous passages of the play is Lavinia&#x27;s metaphor of capturing a mouse to converting from Christianity to believing in the Roman gods, where Lavinia shows that the most important part of religion is earnestness and a lack of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy was a characteristic in the Church that Shaw condemned.

The play has themes of martyrdom and persecution which are portrayed through the vehicle of comedy. Another point in the play is his position against vivisection, which connected to his philosophy in being a vegetarian. In the play, Shaw uses slapstick, verbal wit and physical comedy to portray his themes.

In compliance with a bequest in Shaw&#x27;s will, &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; was the first book printed in his Shavian alphabet when it was released in that orthography by Penguin Books in 1962, with an excerpt on the cover, including the title: .

==Adaptations==
A film version, &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;, was made of the play in 1952, produced by Gabriel Pascal.

There was a TV version in 1967 with Noël Coward.

A later film version, from 1984, was produced by Ronald Smedley.

A radio version was recorded by BBC Radio in 1967 and was most recently repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 16 August 2021, Leslie French playing Androcles.

During the 2017 Season with Tim Carrol as artistic director, the Shaw Festival produced a radically different interpretation with a large amount of audience participation. The Lion is/was played by an audience member, while a member of the cast chosen before production acted as an MC that would read the directions for the Lion to follow. Before the play starts, the cast spends time talking and interacting with the audience at the Courtroom Theatre, and some cast members hand out coloured juggling balls, to be used to pick the Lion from the audience. An audience member is called upon at the start of the play to choose a colour (red, green, blue or yellow), and the person holding that colour ball is then chosen as the lion. During the 2nd act (the march to Rome) the remaining balls could be thrown down onto the &quot;stage&quot; where each ball would call out a different response. For instance, if the yellow ball was the Lion, the green ball might pull a story, while the blue or red ball would call for what a cast member is thinking of at that particular time. During intermission the coloured balls would be handed out again, and then once more be able to be thrown down on the &quot;stage&quot; and prompt the actors for other tidbits of information. For example, one colour would be for a summary of the epilogue, another for something an actor has gleaned from the massive prologue, etc.
* The Fractured Fairy Tales, directed by Jay Ward has a segment of the title

<doc id="193684" wikidata="Q662263" url="?curid=193684" title="Yaxchilan">
<text>Yaxchilan () is an ancient Maya city located on the bank of the Usumacinta River in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. In the Late Classic Period Yaxchilan was one of the most powerful Maya states along the course of the Usumacinta River, with Piedras Negras as its major rival. Architectural styles in subordinate sites in the Usumacinta region demonstrate clear differences that mark a clear boundary between the two kingdoms.

Yaxchilan was a large center, important throughout the Classic era, and the dominant power of the Usumacinta River area. It dominated such smaller sites as Bonampak, and had a long rivalry with Piedras Negras and at least for a time with Tikal; it was a rival of Palenque, with which Yaxchilan warred in 654.

The site is particularly known for its well-preserved sculptured stone lintels set above the doorways of the main structures. These lintels, together with the stelae erected before the major buildings, contain hieroglyphic texts describing the dynastic history of the city.

==Etymology==
Epigraphers think that the ancient name for the city was probably the same as that of its realm, Pa&#x27; Chan. , meaning &quot;Cleft (or broken) Sky&quot;. Early archaeologist Désiré Charnay dubbed the ruins &quot;Lorillard City&quot; in honor of Pierre Lorillard who contributed to defray the expense of his expedition into the Maya zone, while Alfred Maudslay named it &quot;Menché&quot;. Teoberto Maler gave it its modern name, said to mean &quot;Green Stones&quot; in an unspecified Maya language. For some time, the Emblem Gylph was read as Siyaj Chan, or &quot;Sky Born&quot;.

==Location==

Yaxchilan is located on the south bank of the River, at the apex of a horseshoe-shaped meander. This loop defends the site on all sides except for a narrow land approach from the south. The site is upriver from the ruins of Piedras Negras, its major rival. Yaxchilan is from the ruins of Bonampak. The site lies in Ocosingo Municipality in the state of Chiapas, on the Mexican side of the international border with Guatemala, which follows the line of river. It is downriver from the Maya site Altar de Sacrificios.

== History ==

Yaxchilan has its origins in the Preclassic Period. A large part of what is known of the Classic Period history of the city comes from the hieroglyphic texts of the kings who ruled during its Late Classic apogee, one of the most important of which is Hieroglyphic Stairway 1. Some retrospective inscriptions appear to have been used to rewrite Yaxchilan&#x27;s dynastic history to suit king Bird Jaguar IV. Before the rule of king Itzamnaaj Balam II, who reigned from 681 to 742, the city was relatively small. The city-state then grew to a regional capital and the dynasty lasted into the early 9th century.

===Early Classic===
The known history of Yaxchilan starts with the enthronement of Yopaat B&#x27;alam I, most likely on 23 July 359. He was the founder of a long dynasty and took the throne when Yaxchilan was still a minor site. Hieroglyphic inscriptions dating to the Late Classic describe a series of wars in the Early Classic between the city and its neighbors. K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull I ruled in the early 5th century and was the first of the rulers of Yaxchilan to be recorded as having taken a rival king as a war captive, his prisoner being king Bird Jaguar of Bonampak (not to be confused with the four rulers of Yaxchilan who bore the same name). The long-running rivalry with Piedras Negras had already begun by the fifth century AD, with both cities struggling to dominate the Usumacinta trade route. King Moon Skull was credited with gaining a victory over Piedras Negras in 460 and with capturing the enemy king, known only as Ruler A. By the middle of the 5th century Yaxchilan had formal contacts with the great city of Tikal. Bird Jaguar II, the next king of Yaxchilan, captured a vassal of the king of Piedras Negras around 478.

Knot-eye Jaguar I was a warlike king who was recorded as capturing nobles from Bonampak, Piedras Negras, and the great city of Tikal. In 514, Knot-eye Jaguar I was taken captive by Ruler C of Piedras Negras, as depicted on Lintel 12 from that city, where he is shown kneeling before the enemy king with his wrists bound.

His successor, K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull II, was enthroned on 11 February 526. This king is notable for the series of carved lintels he commissioned, including a dynastic list that provides information on the early kings of the city. K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull II oversaw a revival of Yaxchilan&#x27;s fortunes, and he captured lords from Bonampak, Lakamtuun and, notably, the lord of Calakmul, one of the two great Maya powers of the Classic Period, as well as a success against Tikal, the second great power.

Little is known of the history of Yaxchilan from 537 to 629, although four kings are known to have reigned in this period. Knot-eye Jaguar II is known to have captured the lord of Lacanha in 564, one of the few events that can be identified from this period. It may be that the lack of an inscribed history for this lengthy period indicates that Yaxchilan had fallen under the dominion of a more powerful neighbor, such as Piedras Negras Palenque or Toniná, all of which were powerful polities in the Usumacinta region at this time.

===Late Classic===
The Yaxchilano murals at Bonampak&#x27;s Structure I commemorate Yaxchilan&#x27;s appointment of Chan Muwaan I as subordinate ruler. Yaxchilan rebuilt the site to point back toward Yaxchilan.

In 629, Bird Jaguar III was enthroned as king of Yaxchilan. In 646 or 647 he captured a lord from the site of Hix Witz (meaning &quot;Jaguar Hill&quot;), somewhere on the north side of the Usumacinta, most likely Zapote Bobal or Pajaral located to the south of the San Pedro Martir river in the Petén department of Guatemala, based on the findings of epigrapher David Stuart (Mayanist).

Yaxchilan reached its greatest power during the reigns of King Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II, who died in his 90s in 742, and his son Bird Jaguar IV. Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II was enthroned in October 681 and he ruled for more than sixty years. During the last third of his reign he was responsible for a monumental building programme that included the erection of magnificent buildings with richly carved lintels, hieroglyphic stairways and carved stelae, transforming the centre of the city. During his reign, the kingdom of Yaxchilán extended to include the nearby sites of La Pasadita and El Chicozapote to the northwest of the city. At times the sites of Lacanha and Bonampak appear to have been under his domination, although this region was controlled by Toniná in 715.

In 689, relatively early in his reign, Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II is recorded as having captured Aj Sak Ichiy Pat. In 713 he captured Aj K&#x27;an Usja, the &quot;ajaw&quot;, or lord, of B&#x27;uktunn, an otherwise unknown site. In 726, Yaxchilan was defeated by its rival Piedras Negras, an event described on Piedras Negras Stela 8. A &quot;sajal&quot; (subordinate lord) of Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II was captured by the enemy city, an event that is completely absent from inscriptions at Yaxchilán itself although, importantly, there is no false claim of victory. It is after this period, over forty years into the reign of Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II, that this king embarked upon his impressive building programme, this may indicate that at this time Yaxchilan was able to exert independence from the hegemony of once powerful neighbours and claim greater political independence and more lucrative control of riverine trade. In 729, Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II captured Aj Popol Chay, the lord of Lacanha. This event, together with the other victories of Itzamnaaj Balam II&#x27;s reign, is described both in the hieroglyphic texts of Structure 44 and also on a series of stelae near Structure 41. This victory over Lacanha is compared to the earlier victory of Knot-eye Jaguar II against the same city. Similarly, his capture of a lord of Hix Witz in 732 is compared to Bird Jaguar III&#x27;s victory over the same site.

In 749, Yopaat B&#x27;alam II of Yaxchilan attended a ceremony to honour Itzam K&#x27;an Ahk II of Piedras Negras. If Yopaat B&#x27;alam II was king of Yaxchilan at this time, this would indicate that he was subordinate to the king of Piedras Negras. This event was recorded on Piedras Negras Panel 3; there are no records of the reign of Yopaat B&#x27;alam II at Yaxchilan itself, indicating that any records were later destroyed if he had indeed ruled there.

Yaxchilan retaliated in 759, gaining a victory over its enemy. Circa 790 CE, Yaxchilan&#x27;s king Shield Jaguar III oversaw the installation of Chan Muwaan II in Bonampak, and hired Yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it (and the previous Chan Muwaan) in &quot;Structure I&quot;&#x27;s murals.

In 808, king K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull III marked his capture of K&#x27;inich Yat Ahk II, the last king of Piedras Negras, an event that probably represented the final overthrow of Yaxchilan&#x27;s long running enemy, ending dynastic rule there and destroying the city as a capital.

===Modern history===
The first published mention of the site seems to have been a brief mention by Juan Galindo in 1833, published by the Royal Geographical Society. Professor Edwin Rockstoh of the National College of Guatemala visited in 1881 and published another short account.

Explorers Alfred Maudslay and Désiré Charnay arrived here within days of each other in 1882, and they published more detailed accounts of the ruins with drawings and photographs. Maudslay ordered several lintels to be removed, and the British Museum acquired lintels 24 in 1932. Maudslay&#x27;s report was published by the Royal Geographical Society in 1883. Teoberto Maler visited the site repeatedly from 1897 to 1900, his detailed two volume description of the ruins and other nearby sites was published by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University in 1903.

In 1931 Sylvanus Morley led a Carnegie Institution expedition to Yaxchilan, mapped the site and discovered more monuments.

From 1970 onwards, Ian Graham made numerous visits to Yaxchilan and recorded the inscriptions there. These inscriptions were published from 1977 onwards in the &quot;Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions&quot; by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University.

The Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) conducted archeological research at Yaxchilan in 1972–1973, again in 1983, and further INAH work was conducted in the early 1990s. INAH has consolidated and preserved the central portion of the site.

Mayanist Tatiana Proskouriakoff did some pioneering work on deciphering Maya writing using the inscriptions of Yaxchilan, and was able to identify the glyphs for death, capture and captor. Since then Peter Mathews and others have expanded on her early work.

Since 1990, the project &quot;La Pintura Mural Prehispánica en México&quot; (Prehispanic Wall Painting in Mexico) of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México has examined and recorded precolumbian murals such as those at Yaxchilan.

Yaxchilan has long been difficult to reach other than by river. Until recently, no roads existed within 100 miles. The only ways to get to the site were hundreds of miles by boat, or else by small plane. Since the construction of the Border Highway by the Mexican Government in the early 1980s, it is possible for tourists to visit. To reach the site, it is necessary now only to take an hour-long boat ride down the Usumacinta River from Frontera Corozal.

Some Lacandon Maya still make pilgrimages to Yaxchilan to carry out rituals to the Maya gods.

==The site==
The site contains impressive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River. The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills to the south of the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond. Yaxchilan is known for the large quantity of excellent sculpture at the site, such as the monolithic carved stelae and the narrative stone reliefs carved on lintels spanning the temple doorways. Over 120 inscriptions have been identified on the various monuments from the site.

The major groups are the Central Acropolis, the West Acropolis and the South Acropolis. The South Acropolis occupies the highest part of the site. The site is aligned with relation to the Usumacinta River, at times causing unconventional orientation of the major structures, such as the two ballcourts.

===Structures===

Structure 6 is near the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. It is in a good state of preservation and has six doorways, three facing the plaza and three facing the river. The doorways that open onto the plaza were blocked up in antiquity and new doorways were cut into the sides of the structure. The facade of the building facing the plaza has a surviving frieze with a sculpture of a head. The structure has a surviving perforated roof comb and is believed to date to the Early Classic.

Structure 7 is beside Structure 6 but is in a much poorer state of preservation, with its vaulted ceiling having collapsed. This structure also had doorways facing both the river and the Main Plaza.

Structure 8 is located in the Main Plaza in front of Structure 7 and divides the plaza into northwestern and southeastern sections.

Structure 9 is an unrestored mound northwest of Structure 7. Stela 27 stands in front of it.

Structure 10 shares an L-shaped platform with Structures 13 and 74, in the Central Acropolis. The structure contains a series of hieroglyphic lintels describing the birth and accession of king Bird Jaguar IV.

Structure 12 is a small structure in the Central Acropolis, close to the river. It contained eight lintels dating to the early 6th century. The structure is located in the Central Acropolis close to one of the ballcourts. The lintels record nine generations of rulers of the city. The lintels were commissioned by K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull II, their original location is unknown, being reset into Structure 12 in the 8th century by king Bird Jaguar IV. Some of the lintels remain in place.

Structure 13 rests on an L-shaped platform in the Central Acropolis, together with Structures 10 and 74.

Structure 14 is the northwest ballcourt. It is located on the Main Plaza of the Central Acropolis. Five sculpted ballcourt markers were found here, three of which were aligned on the playing area and one on each of the platforms to either side. One of the ballcourt markers was removed from the site, the rest are broken and eroded.

Structure 16 is close to the northwest ballcourt. It contains Lintels 38 through to 40, which have been reset in their original positions.
Structure 19 is also known as the Labyrinth. It lies at the western edge of the Central Acropolis. The structure is a temple with rooms spread over three levels, linked by interior stairways. The temple facade has four doorways, with three doorway-sized niches between them. Two sculptured altars are located in front of the structure, which still has the remains of a perforated roof comb.

Structure 20 is in the Central Acropolis and has three rooms. The three doorways to this structure once supported sculpted Lintels 12, 13 and 14, although only two now remain. A small amount of the roof comb of the building remains, and the sloped roof still has surviving friezes containing niches. Structure 20 was excavated by Ian Graham in 1982, during the excavations a hieroglyphic step was found in front of the building, it was reburied in order to preserve it.

Structure 21 is on a terrace below Structure 25 and 26. The three lintels over the doorways in this structure were Lintels 15 through to 17, although they were removed in the 19th century and are now in the British Museum in London. Structure 21 was excavated in 1983. The vaulted roof of the structure had already collapsed before 1882, filling the rooms with rubble that has now been removed, uncovering several important monuments, including Stela 35 and the remains of life size stucco figures on the back wall behind the stela itself.

Structure 22 is on a terrace in the Central Acropolis near the Main Plaza. It still has sculptured lintels in place.

Structure 23 is in the Central Acropolis, overlooking the Main Plaza. It was built during the reign of Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II and is especially significant because it was the first major construction undertaken after a lapse of 150 years. Structure 23 is dedicated to Lady K&#x27;ab&#x27;al Xook, a wife of the king. It originally had three lintels set above its doorways that appear to mark the re-founding of Yaxchilan in an effort to reinforce the lineage and right to rule of king Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II. Lintels 24 and 25 were removed at the end of the 19th century and are now in the British Museum, while Lintel 26 is in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. This series of lintels are among the finest relief sculpture surviving in the Maya region.

Structure 24 is on a terrace near the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. It still has sculptured lintels in place.

Structure 25 is in the Central Acropolis close to the approach to Structure 33. It has not been excavated or restored, although it has some intact vaulting.

Structure 26 is located beside Structure 25 in the Central Acropolis and has not been excavated. It is the least well preserved of the two structures.

Structure 30 is in the Central Acropolis, it has three doorways facing onto the Plaza. The structure has two parallel rooms with well-preserved vaulting.

Structure 33, in the Central Acropolis, has been described as a masterpiece in stone and was probably dedicated in 756 by Bird Jaguar IV. The structure overlooks the plaza and the river and would have been prominent to river traffic in the 8th century. It has plain lower walls with three doorways, each of which supports a well-preserved lintel (Yaxchilan Lintels 1 to 3). In the centre of the back wall of the structure, opposite the central doorway, is a niche containing the headless sculpture of a human figure, probably Bird Jaguar IV himself. The roof of the structure is largely intact, including a sloped roof supporting a frieze and a well-preserved roof comb. There are niches in both the roof comb and the frieze, the niche in the roof comb contains the remains of a sculpted figure. Tennons on both roof sections once supported stucco decoration. Leading up to the front of Structure 33 from the plaza is a stairway, the top step of which is sculpted, this step is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 2.

The South Acropolis consists of Structures 39, 40 and 41. A number of stelae and altars are associated with them.

Structure 39 has been restored and lies within the South Acropolis. It has three stepped doorways that open onto a single, irregularly shaped room. The remains of a perforated roof comb survive, with tenons that once supported stucco decoration.

Structure 40 is flanked by structures 39 and 41. It has been restored and also has three doorways opening onto a single room and the remains of a perforated roof comb. The room has the remains of murals that once covered all the interior walls. Stelae 12 and 13 stand before structure 40 and Stela 11 once stood between them.

Structure 41 has also been restored. Like the other two structures in the South Acropolis, it has three doorways that open onto a single room. It is not as well preserved as Structures 39 and 40 and much of the vaulted roof has collapsed. A fraction of stucco frieze from the sculpture may date the building to 740, the 3rd K&#x27;atun anniversary of Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II&#x27;s reign. The central doorway is stepped and the front wall has been buttressed. It is one of three principal structures atop the highest vantage point in the city and a series of stelae was set in front of it that described the military campaigns of Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II.

Structure 42 is located in the West Acropolis. The structure had a series if carved limestone lintels that depict Bird Jaguar IV&#x27;s efforts to consolidate power, emulating events carried out by his father Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II.

Structure 44 is in the West Acropolis. It still contains a carved lintel, and has sculpted steps. A number of stelae were originally associated with Structure 44. This temple was built by Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II and was dedicated around 732. The sculpted texts from this building provide an account of the 8th century resurgence of the city. Each of the three doorways contained sculptured lintels and two hieroglyphic steps.

Structure 67 is the southeast ballcourt, located in the Central Acropolis.

===Monuments===
====Hieroglyphic stairways====
Hieroglyphic Stairway 1 leads up to Structure 5 in the Central Acropolis. It has six sculpted risers consisting of various carved blocks, many of which are heavily eroded.

Hieroglyphic Stairway 2 is the riser of the uppermost step approaching Structure 33. It consists of 13 sculptured blocks, numbered from left to right as Steps I to XIII. Steps VI, VII and XVIII are extremely well preserved and depict Bird Jaguar IV and two of his predecessors dressed as ball players.

====Lintels====
Lintel 1 is above the eastern doorway of Structure 33 in the Central Acropolis. It depicts 8th-century king Bird Jaguar IV accompanied by his wife Lady Great Skull Zero.

Lintel 2 is set above the central doorway of Structure 33. It shows Bird Jaguar IV accompanied by his son and heir, Shield Jaguar II.
Lintel 3 is above the westernmost doorway of Structure 33. It also shows Bird Jaguar IV, this time accompanied by an ally.

Lintel 10 is the last known monument at Yaxchilan, dating to 808. It depicts K&#x27;inich Yat Ahk II of Piedras Negras as a captive of Yaxchilan king K&#x27;inich Tatbu Skull IV.

Lintel 12 was originally set into Structure 20 in the Central Acropolis. It is now in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City.

Lintel 13 is above a doorway in Structure 20. It had fallen when the roof of the building collapsed but has since been reset. The sculpture on the lintel is very well preserved.

Lintel 14 is set above a doorway in Structure 20 and is particularly well preserved.

Lintel 15 originally spanned a doorway in Structure 21, it was removed to the British Museum in 1982–83. Like Lintels 16 and 17 from the same series, it was carved from limestone. It was originally set above the southeast doorway of the central room. Lintel 15 depicts Lady Wak Tuun, one of the wives of king Bird Jaguar IV, during a bloodletting ritual that results in the appearance of the Vision Serpent. Lady Wak Tuun is carrying a basket containing the tools used for the bloodletting ritual, including a stingray spine, rope and bloodstained paper. The Vision Serpent emerges from a bowl containing strips of bark paper.

Lintel 16 also spanned a doorway in Structure 21 and was removed to the British Museum in 1982–3. It was sculpted from limestone and was originally set above the central doorway of the central room. It shows Bird Jaguar IV holding a spear and standing over a kneeling captive. Bird Jaguar IV wears the same costume that his father is depicted wearing on Lintel 26. The capture event depicted on Lintel 16 took place in 752.

Lintel 17 was another lintel from a doorway in Structure 21 that is now in the British Museum. It is sculpted from limestone and was originally set above the northwest doorway of the central room. It dates to the reign of Bird Jaguar IV. The lintel depicts Bird Jaguar IV and his wife Lady B&#x27;alam Mut participating in a bloodletting ritual. The king watches while his wife pulls a rope through her tongue draw blood. This ritual is recorded as having taken place eight days after the capture event depicted on Lintel 16.
Lintel 24 is sculpted from limestone and is regarded as a masterpiece of Maya art. It is one of a series of three lintels that were set above the doorways of Structure 23, this one having been set above the southeast doorway. It shows a bloodletting ritual being carried out by king Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II and his wife Lady K&#x27;ab&#x27;al Xook, the king stands holding a burning torch over his wife, who pulls a spiked rope through her tongue. A screenfold book lies in a basket in front of the kneeling princess. The lintel has traces of red and blue pigments. The ceremony represented on the sculpture took place on 28 October, 709. Lintel 24 was removed at the end of the 19th century and is now on display in the British Museum.

Lintel 25 was originally set above the central doorway of Structure 23. It was carved from limestone during the reign of king Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II and shows Lady Xook invoking the Vision Serpent to commemorate the accession of her husband to the throne. Lady Xook holds a bowl containing bloodletting apparatus consisting of a stingray spine and bloodstained paper. The Vision Serpent rising before her has two heads, one at each extreme, from the mouth of one emerges a warrior, from the other emerges the head of central Mexican deity Tlaloc, a water god from the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. The hieroglyphic inscription on the lintel is unusual, being reversed as if it were meant to be read in a mirror, although the significance of this is unknown. Like Lintel 24, Lintel 25 was removed at the end of the 19th century and is now on display in the British Museum. The events depicted on the lintel are described as having occurred &quot;in front of the water of Siyan Chan&quot;, a reference to the main plaza of the city being located on the shore of the Usumacinta River.
Lintel 26 was the third in the series set above the doorways of Structure 23, it is now in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It dates to 726 and bears a portrait of Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II.

Lintel 29 is set into Structure 10 in the Central Acropolis. It is part of a series of three lintels bearing a continuous hieroglyphic text detailing the birth and accession of king Bird Jaguar IV.

Lintel 30 is part of the lintel series carved with a continuous hieroglyphic text set into Structure 10.

Lintel 31 is another part of the series of three hieroglyphic lintels set into Structure 10.

Lintel 35 was found by Maudslay among the rubble of Structure 12 and is now kept at the British Museum. It was sculpted from limestone in the 6th century under the rule of K&#x27;inich Tatb&#x27;u Skull II and records a series of victories including that over the great city of Calakmul.

Lintel 38, Lintel 39 and Lintel 40 have been reset in their original positions in Structure 16 in the Central Acropolis. Unlike most of the other lintels at Yaxchilan, they are sculpted on their edges instead of the undersides.

Lintel 41 was set above the south doorway of Structure 42 in the West Acropolis. It had fallen and broken into two pieces when Maudsley found it in the late 19th century. The upper section is on display in the British Museum, the lower section is damaged. The lintel was carved from limestone and is one of a series of lintels set in the same structure that celebrate the victories of king Bird Jaguar IV. The king is shown preparing for a battle that took place in 755, his wife is offering him his spear, she is Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw from the site of Motul de San José in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala.

Lintel 50 is set into Structure 13 in the Central Acropolis.

Lintel 60 remains in its original setting in Structure 12. It was discovered during excavations of the structure in 1984.

====Stelae====

Stela 2 is on the lowest terrace opposite the stairway approach to Structure 33. It is badly weathered and dates to 613.

Stela 3 stands on a platform in the middle of a plaza by Structure 20. It was badly damaged and the fragments have been reassembled and the monument re-erected. One side of the stela has well-preserved sculpture.

Stela 5 is in front of the terrace holding Structure 20. The upper part of this monument depicts king Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II.

Stela 6 stands in front of the terrace supporting Structure 20. It is largely intact and depicts the 7th-century ruler Bird Jaguar III.

Stela 7 was badly damaged, being broken into fragments. The monument has now been reassembled and the surviving sculpture is of excellent quality. The stela stands in front of a terrace below Structure 20. It depicts a kneeling figure.

Stela 11 originally stood in front of Structure 40. The stela was removed in 1964 and shipped upriver to Agua Azul to be flown to Mexico City for display in the Museo Nacional de Antropología. However, it was too heavy to fly and was returned to Yaxchilan in 1965 and now lies near the bank of the river. The upper side of the stela depicts king Bird Jaguar IV and his father. The figures and the accompanying hieroglyphic panel are very well preserved. There are various dates inscribed on the stela with the earliest being 741. The stela is broken into two parts.

Stela 18 dates from some time after 723. It depicts the victorious king Itzamnaaj B&#x27;alam II standing over a kneeling captive, who is identified as Aj Popol Chaj, the ruling lord of Lacanha.

Stela 27 has been re-erected in front of Structure 9 on the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. The monument dates to 514 and depicts the king Knot-eye Jaguar I. This stela is the earliest known from Yaxchilan. Stela 27 is particularly notable because it was obviously damaged in antiquity and subsequently restored in the Late Classic, with substantial reworking in the lower third of the stela dating to the time of Bird Jaguar IV.

Stela 31 is located a short distance in front of Structure 33. It is a particularly unusual monument because it is sculpted from a stalactite. It is undated and depicts three incised figures and some hieroglyphs.

Stela 33 is a fragmented monument that was discovered during excavations of the platform supporting Stela 3.

Stela 35 is an exceptionally well preserved monument found during excavations of Structure 21 in 1983. The stela is fairly small and depicts Lady Eveningstar (also known as Lady Ik Skull), the mother of king Bird Jaguar IV.

<text>Otto (; ; 1 June 1815 – 26 July 1867) was King of Greece from the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece on 27 May 1832, under the Convention of London, until he was deposed in October 1862.

The second son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Otto ascended the newly created throne of Greece at age 17. His government was initially run by a three-man regency council made up of Bavarian court officials. Upon reaching his majority, Otto removed the regents when they proved unpopular with the people, and he ruled as an absolute monarch. Eventually, his subjects&#x27; demands for a constitution proved overwhelming, and in the face of an armed (but bloodless) insurrection, Otto granted a constitution in 1843.

Throughout his reign, although Otto tried to make significant reforms to modernize Greece, seeing himself as Enlightened absolutist, establishing educational Institutions and several state services, he was unable to resolve Greece&#x27;s major part of poverty and prevent economic meddling from outside. Greek politics in this era were based on affiliations with the three Great Powers that had guaranteed Greece&#x27;s independence, Britain, France and Russia, and Otto&#x27;s ability to maintain the support of the powers was key to his remaining in power. To remain strong, Otto had to play the interests of each of the Great Powers&#x27; Greek adherents against the others, while not irritating the Great Powers. When Greece was blockaded by the British Royal Navy in 1850 and again in 1854, to stop Greece from attacking the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War, Otto&#x27;s standing amongst Greeks suffered. As a result, there was an assassination attempt on Queen Amalia, and finally, in October 1862, Otto was deposed while in the countryside. He died in exile in Bavaria in 1867.

==Early life and Ascension ==

Otto was born as Prince Otto Friedrich Ludwig of Bavaria at Schloss Mirabell in Salzburg (when it briefly belonged to the Kingdom of Bavaria), as the second son of Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. His father served there as the Bavarian governor-general. Through his ancestor, the Bavarian Duke John II, Otto was a descendant of the Byzantine imperial dynasties of Komnenos and Laskaris. His father was a prominent Philhellene, and provided significant financial aid to the Greek cause during the War of Independence. 

Otto was a child of delicate health and temperament, with a slight stutter and a passion for the piano. As a teenager, he was tutored in Classical Greek and Latin by classical scholar and passionate Philhellene Friedrich Thiersch, who was the first to suggest the young prince as a candidate for the throne of the emerging nation. Thiersch&#x27;s suggestion was supported by Jean-Gabriel Eynard, a major financial benefactor of the Greek independence movement and friend of Ioannis Kapodistrias, Greece&#x27;s governor. Otto&#x27;s name therefore entered the discourse surrounding Greek independence, both within Greece and abroad. 

At the end of Greek War of Independence, the three Great Powers formulated the London Protocol of 1829, which recognized an autonomous Greek state. Article 3 of the protocol stated that Greece would be a monarchy, under the rule of a prince who was not from the ruling families of one of the three Great Powers. Numerous candidates were considered for the vacant throne, including Prince Frederick of the Netherlands and Otto&#x27;s uncle, Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria. Even an Irishman named Nicholas Macdonald Sarsfield Cod&#x27;d put himself forward, claiming descent from the Byzantine Palaiologos dynasty. Ultimately, they settled on Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and the amended London Protocol of 1830 recognized him as the &quot;de jure&quot; sovereign of Greece. Although initially enthusiastic, Leopold was discouraged by the limited borders established by the protocol and Britain&#x27;s refusal to grant financial support to the vulnerable new state. Due to this, as well as personal reasons, he formally rejected the crown three months later. Kapodistrias&#x27; assassination in 1831 destabilized Greece, and caused British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston to convene the London conference. Here, the crown was offered to the 17-year-old Prince Otto, which he happily accepted. The Bavarian House of Wittelsbach had no connections to the ruling dynasties of any of the Great Powers, and so was a neutral choice with which they were all satisfied. The Greeks were not consulted, but Greece was in chaos and no group or individual could claim to represent it anyway. The London Protocol of 1832 therefore finally recognized Greece as a fully independent state, with Otto as its king. 

The Great Powers extracted a pledge from Otto&#x27;s father to restrain him from hostile actions against the Ottoman Empire. They also insisted that Otto&#x27;s title would be &quot;King of Greece&quot;, rather than &quot;King of the Hellenes&quot;, because the latter would imply a claim over the millions of Greeks then still under Turkish rule. Not quite 18, the young prince arrived in Greece with 3,500 Bavarian troops (the Bavarian Auxiliary Corps) and three Bavarian advisors aboard the British frigate HMS &quot;Madagascar&quot;. Although he did not speak Greek, he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by adopting the Greek national costume and Hellenizing his name to &quot;Othon&quot; (some English sources, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, call him &quot;Otho&quot;). Thousands lined the docks of Nafplio to witness his arrival, including many heroes of the revolution such as Theodoros Kolokotronis and Alexandros Mavrokordatos. His arrival was initially enthusiastically welcomed by the Greek people as an end to the chaos of the prior years and the beginning of the rejuvenation of the Greek nation. A year later Greek poet Panagiotis Soutsos evoked the scene in &quot;Leander&quot;, the first novel to be published in independent Greece:
== Early reign ==

Otto&#x27;s reign is usually divided into three periods:
* The years of Regency Council: 1832–1835
* The years of absolute monarchy: 1835–1843
* The years of constitutional monarchy: 1843–1862

The Bavarian advisors were arrayed in a Regency Council, headed by Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, who, in Bavaria as minister of finance, had recently succeeded in restoring Bavarian credit, at the cost of his popularity. Von Armansperg was the President of the Privy Council and the first representative (or Prime Minister) of the new Greek government. The other members of the Regency Council were Karl von Abel and Georg Ludwig von Maurer, with whom von Armansperg often clashed. After the king reached his majority in 1835, von Armansperg was made Arch-Secretary, but was called Arch-Chancellor by the Greek press.

Britain and the Rothschild bank, who were underwriting the Greek loans, insisted on financial stringency from Armansperg. The Greeks were soon more heavily taxed than under Ottoman rule; as the people saw it, they had exchanged a hated Ottoman rule for government by a foreign bureaucracy, the &quot;Bavarocracy&quot; (Βαυαροκρατία).

In addition, the regency showed little respect for local customs. As a Catholic, Otto himself was viewed as a heretic by many pious Greeks; however, his heirs would have to be Orthodox, according to the terms of the 1843 Constitution.King Otto brought his personal brewmaster with him, Herr Fuchs, a Bavarian who stayed in Greece after Otto&#x27;s departure and introduced Greece to beer, under the label &quot;Fix&quot;.

Popular heroes and leaders of the Greek Revolution, such as generals Theodoros Kolokotronis and Yiannis Makriyiannis, who opposed the Bavarian-dominated regency, were charged with treason, put in jail and sentenced to death. They were later pardoned under popular pressure, while Greek judges who resisted Bavarian pressure and refused to sign the death warrants (Anastasios Polyzoidis and Georgios Tertsetis, for instance), were praised as heroes.

Otto&#x27;s early reign was also notable for his moving the capital of Greece from Nafplio to Athens. His first task as king was to make a detailed archaeological and topographic survey of Athens. He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in Athens.

Athens was chosen as the Greek capital for historical and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses at the foot of the Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), the National Observatory of Athens (1846) and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion. Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.

During 1836–37, Otto visited Germany, marrying a beautiful and talented 17-year-old, Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece but in Oldenburg, on 22 November 1836; the marriage did not produce an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her Lutheran faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had an affair with Jane Digby, a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover. 

Due to his having overtly undermined the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately upon his return from Germany. However, despite high hopes on the part of the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. Otto&#x27;s attempts to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.

==Parties, finances and the church==

Throughout his reign, King Otto found himself confronted by a recurring series of problems: partisanship of the Greeks, financial uncertainty, and ecclesiastical disputes.

Greek parties in the Othonian era were based on two factors: the political activities of the diplomatic representatives of the Great Powers Russia, United Kingdom and France and the affiliation of Greek political figures with these diplomats.

According to Richard Clogg, the financial uncertainty of the Othonian monarchy was the result of
# Greece&#x27;s poverty;
# the concentration of land in the hands of a small number of wealthy &quot;primates&quot; like the Mavromichalis family of Mani; and,
# the promise of 60,000,000 francs in loans from the Great Powers, which kept these nations involved in Greek internal affairs and the Crown constantly seeking to please one or the other power to ensure the flow of funds.

The political machinations of the Great Powers were personified in their three legates in Athens: Theobald Piscatory (France), Gabriel Catacazy (Russian Empire), and Sir Edmund Lyons (United Kingdom). They informed their home governments on the activities of the Greeks, while serving as advisers to their respective allied parties within Greece.

King Otto pursued policies such as balancing power among all the parties and sharing offices among the parties, ostensibly to reduce the power of the parties while trying to bring a pro-Othon party into being. The parties, however, became the entree into government power and financial stability.

The effect of his (and his advisors&#x27;) policies was to make the Great Powers&#x27; parties more powerful, not less. The Great Powers did not support curtailing Otto&#x27;s increasing absolutism, however, which resulted in a near permanent conflict between Otto&#x27;s absolute monarchy and the power bases of his Greek subjects.

Otto found himself confronted by a number of intractable ecclesiastical issues: 1) monasticism, 2) Autocephaly, 3) the king as head of the Church and 4) toleration of other churches. His regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, established a controversial policy of suppressing the monasteries. This was very upsetting to the Church hierarchy. Russia considered itself a stalwart defender of Orthodoxy, but Orthodox believers were found in all three parties. Once he rid himself of his Bavarian advisers, Otto allowed the statutory dissolution of the monasteries to lapse.

By tradition dating back to the Byzantine era, the king was regarded by the Church as its head.On the issue of the Church&#x27;s Autocephaly and his role as king within the Church, Otto was overwhelmed by the arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Catholicism (while the Queen was Protestant).

In 1833, the regents had unilaterally declared the Autocephaly of the Church of Greece. This was a recognition of the &quot;de facto&quot; political situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the political control of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people, concerned that having a Catholic as the head of the Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church, criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.

Tolerance of other religions was over-supported by some in the English Party and others educated in the West as a symbol of Greece&#x27;s progress as a liberal European state. In the end, power over the Church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the king maintained a veto over the decision of the Synod of Bishops. This was to keep balance and avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western Europe as a backward, religiously intolerant society.

Catholic communities had been established in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also existed in the country, those arriving after the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492) joining the earlier Romaniotes, Jews who had been living there since the times of Apostle Paul. Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto&#x27;s reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its repressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.

==3 September 1843 Revolution==

Although King Otto tried to function as an absolute monarch, as Thomas Gallant writes, he &quot;was neither ruthless enough to be feared, nor compassionate enough to be loved, nor competent enough to be respected.&quot;

By 1843, public dissatisfaction with him had reached crisis proportions and there were demands for a Constitution. Initially Otto refused to grant a Constitution, but as soon as Bavarian troops were withdrawn from the kingdom, a popular revolt was launched.

On 3 September 1843, the infantry, led by both Colonel Dimitris Kallergis and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council, General Yiannis Makriyiannis, assembled in Palace Square in front of the Palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much of the population of the small capital, the crowd refused to disperse until the king agreed to grant a constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.

Left with little recourse now that his German troops were gone, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed to the demands of the crowd over the objections of his opinionated queen. This square was renamed Constitution Square () to commemorate (through to the present) the events of September 1843—and was to feature in many later tumultuous events of Greek history. Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers&#x27; culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power.

The king&#x27;s prestige, which was based in large part on his support by the combined Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the &quot;Pacifico incident&quot; of 1850, when Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, sent the British fleet to blockade the port of Piraeus with warships to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.

==Crimean War==
The &quot;Great Idea&quot; (Μεγάλη Ιδέα), the irredentist concept that expresses the goal of reviving the Byzantine Empire, led him to contemplate entering the Crimean War on the side of Russia against Turkey and its British and French allies in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful and resulted in renewed intervention by the two Great Powers and a second blockade of the Piraeus port, forcing Greece to neutrality.

The continued inability of the royal couple to have children also raised the thorny issue of succession: the 1844 constitution insisted that Otto&#x27;s successor had to be Orthodox, but as the king was childless, the only possible heirs were his younger brothers, Luitpold and Adalbert. The staunch Catholicism of the Wittelsbachs complicated matters, as Luitpold refused to convert and Adalbert married Infanta Amalia of Spain. The sons of Adalbert, and especially the eldest, Ludwig Ferdinand, were now considered the most likely candidates, but due to the issue of religion, no definite arrangements were ever made. 

In 1861, a student named Aristeidis Dosios (son of politician Konstantinos Dosios) attempted to murder Queen Amalia and was openly hailed as a hero. His attempt, however, also prompted spontaneous feelings of monarchism and sympathy towards the royal couple among the Greek population.

== Exile and death ==

While Otto was visiting the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was launched and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (the same way they had come to Greece), taking with them the Greek regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. In 1863 the Greek National Assembly elected Prince William of Denmark, aged only 17, &quot;King of the Hellenes&quot; under the regnal name of George I.
It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, the king would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time. However, the Constitution of 1844 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.

Otto died in the palace of the former bishops of Bamberg, Germany, and was buried in the Theatiner Church in Munich. During his retirement, he would still wear the Greek traditional uniform, nowadays worn only by the evzones (Presidential Guards). Αccording to witnesses, Otto&#x27;s last words were &quot;Greece, my Greece, my beloved Greece.&quot;

==Archives==
Otto&#x27;s letters to his sister, Princess Mathilde Caroline of Bavaria, Grand Duchess of Hesse, written between 1832 and 1861, are preserved in the Hessian State Archive (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Darmstadt) in Darmstadt, Germany.

Otto&#x27;s letters to his father-in-law, Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, written between 1836 and 1853, are preserved in the Niedersächsisches Landesarchiv in Oldenburg, Germany.

<doc id="193687" wikidata="Q84192" url="?curid=193687" title="Maximilian I of Mexico">
<text>Maximilian I (; ; 6 July 1832 – 19 June 1867) was an Austrian archduke who became emperor of the Second Mexican Empire from 10 April 1864 until his execution by the Mexican Republic on 19 June 1867.

A member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, Maximilian was the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Before becoming Emperor of Mexico, he was commander-in-chief of the small Imperial Austrian Navy and briefly the Austrian viceroy of Lombardy–Venetia, but was removed by the emperor. Two years before his dismissal, he briefly met with French emperor Napoleon III in Paris, where he was approached by conservative Mexican monarchists seeking a European royal to rule Mexico. Initially Maximilian was not interested, but following his dismissal as viceroy, the Mexican monarchists&#x27; plan was far more appealing to him.

Since Maximilian was a descendant of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Spain when the Spaniards conquered the Aztecs (1519–21) and first brought Mexico into the Spanish Empire, a status it held until the Mexican independence in 1821, Maximilian seemed a perfect candidate for the conservatives&#x27; plans for monarchy in Mexico. Maximilian was interested in assuming the throne, but only with guarantees of French support. Mexican conservatives did not take sufficient account of Maximilian&#x27;s embrace of liberalism, and Maximilian failed to understand he would be viewed as a foreign outsider. When Maximilian was first mentioned as a possible emperor of Mexico, the idea seemed farfetched, but circumstances changed and made it viable. His tenure as emperor was just three years, ending with his execution by firing squad by forces of the Restored Republic on 19 June 1867.

Political conflicts in Mexico in the 1850s between conservative and liberal factions were domestic disputes initially, but the conservatives&#x27; loss on the battlefield to the liberal regime during a three-year civil war (1858–61) meant conservatives sought ways to return to power with outside allies, opening a path for France under Napoleon III to intervene in Mexico and set up a puppet regime with conservative Mexican support. When the liberal government of Mexican President Benito Juárez suspended payment on foreign debts in 1861, there was an opening for European powers to intervene militarily in Mexico. The intention of the French and Mexican conservatives was for regime change to oust the liberals, backed by the power of the French army. Mexican monarchists sought a European head of state and, with the brokering of Napoleon III, Maximilian was invited to establish what would come to be known as the Second Mexican Empire. With a pledge of French military support and at the formal invitation of a Mexican delegation, Maximilian accepted the crown of Mexico on 10 April 1864 following a bogus referendum in Mexico that purportedly showed the Mexican people backed him.

Maximilian&#x27;s hold on power in Mexico was shaky from the beginning. Rather than enacting policies that would return power to Mexican conservatives, Maximilian instead sought to implement liberal policies, losing him his domestic conservative backers. Internationally, his legitimacy as ruler was in doubt since the United States continued to recognize Benito Juárez as the legal head of state rather than Emperor Maximilian. The U.S. saw the French invasion as a violation of the Monroe Doctrine, but the U.S. was unable to intervene politically due to the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the United States began providing material aid to Juárez&#x27;s republican forces. In the face of a renewed U.S. interest in enforcing the Monroe Doctrine, under orders by Napoleon III, the French armies that had propped up Maximilian&#x27;s regime began withdrawing from Mexico in 1866. With no popular support and republican forces in the ascendant, Maximilian&#x27;s monarchy collapsed. Maximilian was captured in Querétaro. He was tried and executed by the restored Republican government alongside his generals Miguel Miramón, a former President of Mexico, and Tomás Mejía Camacho in June 1867. His death marked the end of monarchism as a major force in Mexico. In reassessments of his brief rule, he is portrayed in Mexican history less as the villain of nationalist, republican history and more as a liberal in Mexico, along with Presidents of the Republic Juárez, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, and Porfirio Díaz.

==Early life==
Maximilian was born on 6 July 1832 in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire. He was baptized the following day as &quot;Ferdinand Maximilian Josef Maria&quot;. The first name honored his godfather and paternal uncle, the future Emperor Ferdinand I, and the second honored his late maternal grandfather, Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria. His father was Archduke Franz Karl, the second surviving son of Emperor Francis I, during whose reign he was born. Maximilian was thus a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. His mother was Princess Sophie of Bavaria, a member of the House of Wittelsbach. Intelligent, ambitious and strong-willed, Sophie had little in common with her husband, whom historian Richard O&#x27;Conner characterized as &quot;an amiably dim fellow whose main interest in life was consuming bowls of dumplings drenched in gravy&quot;. Despite their different personalities, the marriage was fruitful, and after four miscarriages, four sons – including Maximilian – would reach adulthood. Rumors at the court alleged that Maximilian was the product of an extramarital affair between his mother and Napoleon II, Duke of Reichstadt. The existence of an illicit affair between Sophie and the duke, and any possibility that Maximilian was conceived from such a union, are dubious.
Maximilian&#x27;s upbringing was closely supervised. Until his sixth birthday, he was cared for by Baroness Louise von Sturmfeder, who was his &quot;aja&quot; (then rendered &quot;nurse&quot;, now nanny). His education was then entrusted to a tutor. Most of Maximilian&#x27;s day was spent in study. The hours per week of classes steadily increased from 32 at age seven to 55 by the time he was 17. The disciplines were diverse, ranging from history, geography, law and technology, to languages, military studies, fencing and diplomacy. From an early age, Maximilian tried to surpass his older brother Franz Joseph in everything, attempting to prove to all that he was the better qualified of the two and thus deserving of more than second-place status, but with primogeniture, Maximilian was destined for secondary status.

The highly restrictive environment of the Austrian court was not enough to repress Maximilian&#x27;s natural openness. He was joyful, highly charismatic, and able to captivate those around him with ease. Although he was a charming boy, he was also undisciplined. He mocked his teachers and was often the instigator of pranks – including even his uncle, the emperor, among his victims. His attempts to outshine his older brother and his ability to charm opened a rift between himself and the aloof and self-contained Franz Joseph that widened as years passed, and their close relationship in childhood would be all but forgotten.

During revolutionary unrest in Europe in 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favor of Maximilian&#x27;s older brother Franz Joseph. Maximilian accompanied his brother on campaigns to put down rebellions throughout the empire. Only in 1849 would the revolution be stamped out in Austria, with hundreds of rebels executed and thousands imprisoned. Maximilian was horrified at what he regarded as senseless brutality and openly complained about it. He would later remark, &quot;We call our age the Age of Enlightenment, but there are cities in Europe where, in the future, men will look back in horror and amazement at the injustice of tribunals, which in a spirit of vengeance condemned to death those whose only crime lay in wanting something different to the arbitrary rule of governments which placed themselves above the law.&quot;

At a court ball in Vienna, Maximilian met and fell in love with a young Moldavian noblewoman, Viktoria Keșco (1835–1856), paternal aunt of the future Queen of Serbia. But the match was impossible for Archduke Maximilian since her family was Orthodox and did not belong to the family reigning or former reigning monarchs. When their romance was discovered, her father Ioan Keșco (1809–1863), who served as Russian Marshal of Nobility in Bessarabia, quickly sent her back home and forcibly married her off to her longtime admirer, local rich nobleman of Greek descent, Alexander Dimitrievich Inglezi (1826–1903), son of Dimitri Spiridonovich Inglezi (1771–1846).

==Years in the Imperial Austrian Navy==

Not destined to rule, Maximilian entered military service, training in the small Imperial Austrian Navy. He displayed zeal in his naval career and his direct link with Emperor Franz Joseph enabled the diversion of resources to what had previously been a neglected service.

Maximilian embarked on the corvette &quot;Vulkan&quot;, for a brief cruise through Greece. In October 1850, he became a navy lieutenant. At the beginning of 1851, he embarked on another much more distant cruise on board the SMS &quot;Novara&quot;. He enjoyed that voyage so much that he anticipated in his diary &quot;I shall fulfill one of my most beloved dreams, a voyage by sea. I depart with my memories of my beloved Austrian homeland in a very emotional moment for me.&quot;

This voyage took him to Lisbon, where he met the princess Maria Amélia of Braganza, daughter of the late Brazilian Emperor Pedro I. She was described as beautiful, pious, clever, and of a refined education. The pair fell in love. His brother Franz Joseph and his mother approved of a prospective marriage between them. Unfortunately, in February 1852, Maria Amélia contracted scarlet fever. Her health worsened over the months, developing tuberculosis. Her doctors advised her to leave Lisbon and go to Madeira, where she arrived in August 1852. At the end of November, she had lost hope of ever recovering her health. Maria Amélia died on February 4, 1853, which deeply shocked Maximilian.

Other travels in this era included Italy, Spain, Madeira, Tangiers, and Algeria. He visited Beirut, Palestine, and Egypt. During his visit to Spain in 1854, he visited the tombs of his ancestors Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabel I of Castile in Granada. Later travels took him to the Empire of Brazil. In an 1859 letter to his father-in-law King Leopold I of Belgium he wrote &quot;It seems to me like a legend that I am the first descendant of Ferdinand and Isabela who since early childhood has thought it his mission to tread on the continent that has attained such gigantic importance for the fortunes of humanity.&quot;

Maximilian learned to command sailors and received a solid education regarding the technical aspects of navigation. On 10 September 1854, he was named Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy and was granted the rank of counter admiral. As commander-in-chief, Maximilian carried out several reforms to modernize the naval forces. He was instrumental in creating the naval ports at Trieste and Pola (now Pula), as well as the battle fleet with which Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff would later secure his victories. He was however criticized for diverting massive funds to ship building from the training, sea going experience, and morale of sailors. He also initiated a large-scale scientific expedition (1857–1859).

At the end of 1855, he sought refuge for his ship in the Gulf of Trieste during poor sailing weather. He was impressed enough to immediately consider building a residence there, a goal which he actually carried out in March 1856, when he began construction of what would later be called Miramare Castle, located near the city of Trieste.
At end of the Crimean War in March 1856 that brought a period of peace to Europe, Maximilian traveled to Paris to meet Emperor of the French, Napoleon III and his wife the Empress Eugénie. There he also met Mexican conservatives, who would later prove to be decisive in Maximilian&#x27;s life. The Archduke would write about this initial meeting in his diary &quot;although the emperor lacks the genius of his famous uncle, he retains fortunately for France, a grand personality. He stands tall over the century and shall surely leave his mark on it.&quot;

==Marriage to Charlotte of Belgium, personal life, and family remnants==
In May 1856, Franz Joseph asked Maximilian to return from Paris to Vienna, stopping on the way at Brussels, in order to visit the King of the Belgians, Leopold I. On 30 May 1856, he arrived in Belgium where he was received by Prince Philippe, younger son of King Leopold. He was accompanied by the Belgian princes, visiting the cities of Tournai, Kortrijk, Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, and Charleroi. In Brussels, Maximilian met the only daughter of the king and the late queen Louise of Orleans, Charlotte of Belgium, and romance blossomed. Leopold I, upon becoming aware of the couple&#x27;s feelings advised Maximilian to propose. From the Belgian viewpoint, the marriage was highly advantageous, since the nation was newly established and could benefit from ties to the Great Powers. Having been unlucky in love twice before, Maximilian&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of a reigning European monarch was suitable and would seem to be a happy conclusion to his bachelorhood. Maximilian proposed and was welcomed into the Belgian Court. He later remarked on the contrast of the Belgian Palace of Laeken to the splendor of the Imperial Viennese royal residences, not surprising since Belgium was but a small and new kingdom.

Prince George of Saxony, who previously had been rejected by Charlotte, warned Leopold I of the &quot;calculating character of the Viennese archduke.&quot; The son of Leopold I, the Duke of Brabant, and future Leopold II, in contrast, wrote to Queen Victoria, who was Charlotte&#x27;s cousin, &quot;Max is a youth filled with ingenuity, knowledge, talent and kindness.&quot;

The engagement was formally concluded on 23 December 1856. On 27 July 1857 Maximilian and Charlotte were married in the Royal Palace of Brussels. Distinguished European royals attended the ceremony, including the first cousin of Charlotte and husband of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert. The marriage also enhanced the prestige of the newly established Belgian dynasty as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha once more found itself allied with the powerful House of Habsburg.

The marriage was not fruitful, producing no children. However, when they were Emperor and Empress of Mexico, they adopted on 9 September 1865 Agustín de Iturbide y Green and his cousin Salvador de Iturbide y Marzán, both grandsons of Agustín de Iturbide, who had briefly reigned as emperor of the First Mexican Empire. Agustin&#x27;s mother, Alicia Iturbide, an American who was born Alice Green, agreed to give up her child. Soon after, she changed her mind and sent messages to Maximilian to renounce the adoption contract, but she was simply deported from Mexico without her child. Agustín and his cousin were granted the title Prince de Iturbide and the style of Highness by an imperial decree of 16 September 1865, and were ranked next in line after the reigning family. In October 1866, as the Empire began to falter, Maximilian wrote to Alice Iturbide that he was returning her son, Agustín, to her care.&quot;

One biographer claims that Maximilian took a mistress in Mexico. Historian Enrique Krauze suggests that Maximilian was rendered sterile due to venereal disease contracted from a Brazilian woman when he spent time in the country following his dismissal as viceroy. However, another biographer contends that not only did Maximilian have a secret entry way in his Cuernavaca residence, allowing him to discreetly have encounters with women, but that Maximilian fathered a child by a Mexican woman in Cuernavaca, Concepción Sedano y Leguizano, who died shortly after Maximilian&#x27;s execution. Unacknowledged as the emperor&#x27;s offspring, the boy was allegedly taken to Paris and educated with funds by a Mexican ex-patriate there. During World War I, he was living in Spain, where he was recruited by German intelligence. He was arrested as a traitor by the French and executed by firing squad in 1917. According to the biographer&#x27;s account, citing no sources in his publication, the charge read out at his execution began &quot;Sedano, son of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico.&quot;

Since Maximilian and Carlota had no offspring, there are no direct descendants. However, today members of the House of Habsburg consider Maximilian an important ancestor. But in terms of the Mexican political reality, they are not in the spotlight. The nearest living agnatic relative to Maximilian is the head of the Habsburg family, Karl von Habsburg, and members of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine still reside in Mexico, among them Carlos Felipe de Habsburgo, the first male of the former ruling house to be born in the country. Carlos Felipe is an academic who has given many interviews, conferences, and presentations regarding his family&#x27;s history, Maximilian and Carlota, and the Second Mexican Empire.

==Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, 1857–59==

On 28 February 1857, Franz Joseph named Maximilian as viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, an Italian-speaking region of the empire. On 6 September 1857, Maximilian and Charlotte made their entrance to the capital Milan. During their stay there the couple lived at the Royal Palace of Milan and occasionally resided at the Royal Villa of Monza. As viceroy, Maximilian lived as a sovereign surrounded by an imposing court of chamberlains and servants. During his two years as viceroy, Maximilian continued the construction of Miramar Castle, which would not be finished until three years later. Charlotte&#x27;s royal dowry aided in the construction. Her brother Leopold would remark in his diary that &quot;the construction of that palace amounts to endless madness.&quot;

Maximilian worked on developing the imperial navy, and he organized the expedition of the ship &quot;Novara&quot;, which would turn out to be the first circumnavigation of the globe conducted by the Austrian Empire, a scientific expedition, which lasted more than two years from 1857 to 1859, and which involved the participation of many Viennese intellectuals. Politically, the Archduke was strongly influenced by nineteenth-century liberalism, generally not a political position that those of royal blood adhered to. The appointment of the young progressive Maximilian to the office of viceroy was made in response to the growing discontent of the Italian population with the rule of the older Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. The appointment of an Archduke, indeed the Emperor&#x27;s own brother, was also intended to encourage the local population&#x27;s personal loyalty to the House of Habsburg.

Charlotte made efforts to win over her subjects, speaking Italian, visiting charitable institutions, inaugurating schools, and dressing in native Lombard dress. On Easter 1858, Maximilian and Charlotte sailed down the Grand Canal of Venice in ceremonial dress. Despite their efforts, anti-Austrian sentiment continued to spread rapidly throughout the Italian population.

Maximilian&#x27;s efforts in administering the province included a revision of the tax registry, a more equitable distribution of tax revenue, the establishment of medical districts, dredging the Venetian canals, expanding the port of Cuomo, draining swamps to put a stop to malaria, fertilization projects and the irrigation of the plains of Friuli. There was also a series of urban development projects. The Riva degli Schiavoni was extended to the royal gardens of Venice, while in Milan, the avenues gained priority, the Piazza del Duomo was widened, and a new piazza was built between the Teatro alla Scala and the Palazzo Marino. The Biblioteca Ambrosiana library was also restored.

The British minister of foreign relations wrote in 1859 that &quot;the administration of the provinces of Lombardy-Venetia were directed by the Archduke Maximilian with great talent, and both a liberal and conciliatory spirit.&quot;

===Dismissal as viceroy===

Maximilian&#x27;s tenure as viceroy was short-lived, lasting only two years during a period of rising local tensions. Although holding title of viceroy, his jurisdiction did not fully extend over the Austrian garrison, which was opposed to any sort of liberal reforms. Maximilian went to Vienna in April 1858 to ask his brother the emperor to grant him both military and administrative jurisdiction, while continuing a policy of concessions. Franz Joseph rejected the appeal. That left Maximilian with only the limited role of prefect of police while tensions with Piedmont were rising. On 3 January 1859, for security reasons, Carlota was asked to return to Miramar, and she sent her valuables out of Lombardy-Venetia. Only while safe in the royal Palace of Milan did she share her concerns with her mother-in-law Sophie.

In February 1859, the Austrian military cracked down, making numerous arrests in Milan and Venice. The prisoners came from the upper classes and were transported to Mantua and various prisons throughout the realm. The city of Brescia was occupied by militia, while several battalions were camped in Piacenza, and on the shores of the River Po. Maximilian hoped to moderate the severe dispositions of General Ferenc Gyulay. Maximilian had just received permission from his brother to open the private law schools in Pavia and Padua. In March 1859, there were incidents between the Milanese police and the Veronese public. In Pavia, one of the cities governed by Maximilian, Austria created a veritable state of military occupation. The Italian situation was becoming critical, and order could no longer be maintained without troops.

The Austrian archduke&#x27;s conciliatory efforts ultimately fell apart when his various projects for improving the wellbeing of the Italian public were shut down. Franz Joseph was intent on preventing any concessions to the populace. The emperor considered Maximilian too liberal and generous with the rebellious Italian population. Franz Joseph relieved his brother of his post as viceroy on 10 April 1859.

In Italy, news of Maximilian&#x27;s dismissal was received with sarcastic enthusiasm by statesmen there. A pivotal figure in the movement for Italian unification, the Count of Cavour, who declared that 

==Emperor of Mexico==
===Background to Accession===

After gaining independence in 1821 Mexico had soon divided itself into liberal and conservative parties, the latter of which had a monarchist faction. The failed monarchy of Agustín I that saw him forced to abdicate, swearing to remain in exile, met its final demise when he returned to Mexico and was shot in 1824. Nonetheless, Conservatives continued to see monarchy as a viable option. Monarchist plans had most clearly been laid out in an 1840 essay by the statesman José María Gutiérrez de Estrada, which argued that after two decades of chaos, the republic had failed, and that a European prince ought to be invited to establish a Mexican throne. Such ideas received official interest during the presidency of Mariano Paredes and during the last presidency of Santa Anna, but by the late 1850s the liberals had appeared to have achieved a decisive victory through the promulgation of the Constitution of 1857, which constrained the powers of the Mexican Catholic Church and the Mexican Army, two traditional bastions of conservativism. Conservatives declared the Constitution null and void and formed a rival conservative government. The three-year civil war (1858–61) between liberals and conservatives was won by liberals on the battlefield. Conservatives regrouped after the defeat and sought external allies for their monarchist cause.

Mexican diplomat José Hidalgo had been officially tasked by the Santa Anna administration to sound European courts for interest in establishing a Mexican monarchy, but after the fall of Santa Anna in 1853 with the successful liberal Revolution of Ayutla, Hidalgo had lost his official accreditation and continued his efforts independently. Hidalgo&#x27;s childhood friend, the Spanish noblewoman Eugénie de Montijo was now wife of Napoleon III, Emperor of France, and it was through her that Hidalgo managed to gain the attention of the French ruler.

The name of Maximilian came up swiftly in discussions among the Mexican monarchists on potential candidates for a Mexican throne. It was perceived as impolitic to propose a noble from one of the nations involved in the expedition and Maximilian already had a reputation as a capable administrator from his time spent as viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia. In 1859, Maximilian was first approached by Mexican monarchists—members of the Mexican nobility, led by José Pablo Martínez del Río—with a proposal to make him the emperor of Mexico. The Habsburg family had ruled the Viceroyalty of New Spain from its establishment until the Spanish throne was inherited by the Bourbons. As a member of the House of Habsburg, Maximilian was considered to have more potential legitimacy than other royal figures. He was unlikely to ever rule in Europe because of his elder brother&#x27;s position as emperor and disapproval of his younger brother&#x27;s liberalism. In that year, Maximilian declined the offer, but several attempts were made by the Mexican royalists. Later it was decided to again to make the offer to Maximilian, and that José María Gutiérrez de Estrada, because of his pivotal role in the history of Mexican monarchism, was to be given the role of again inviting Maximilian to assume a Mexican throne.

In early 1861, the United States was embroiled in its Civil War between the southern states that had seceded and formed the Confederate States of America and the northern states that fought their efforts to secede. In these circumstances, the U.S. government could not enforce the Monroe Doctrine, which asserted U.S. pre-eminence in the hemisphere and excluded foreign intervention. In July 1861, Mexican President Benito Juárez had suspended the payment of foreign debts that had been incurred by the defeated conservative government, providing a pretext for foreign intervention. Juárez&#x27;s government could ill-afford and had no desire to pay off the debts contracted by those that had challenged its legitimacy to rule. The suspension gave Napoleon III an opportunity to establish a French client state which could also serve as a buffer to the expansion of the United States. France gained the aid of Britain and Spain, which also had loaned money to the defeated conservatives, under the pretext of arranging an expedition simply to renegotiate Mexico&#x27;s debt agreements. Plans for such an expedition were formalized at the Convention of London on 31 October 1861.

Gutiérrez de Estrada received Maximilian&#x27;s answer at the beginning of October. The Archduke would accept the throne on two conditions: first, the Mexican people themselves should spontaneously ask for him; and second, that he should also be assured of the support of France and Great Britain. Maximilian&#x27;s older brother, Franz Joseph Emperor of Austria, now sent Count von Rechberg, the Austrian minister of foreign affairs to brief Maximilian on what lay in store in the event that France did militarily intervene in Mexico, and a Mexican plebiscite approved of Maximilian.

===French invasion, Mexican conservatives, and Maximilian&#x27;s agreement===

In the interim, the agreement among France, the United Kingdom, and Spain broke down as it became increasingly clear that France intended to overthrow Juárez&#x27;s liberal government of Mexico. France began military operations in April 1862. They were eventually joined by conservative Mexican generals who were not reconciled to their loss to the liberals in the War of Reform.

After Charles de Lorencez&#x27;s expeditionary force was repulsed at the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862, Napoleon III sent reinforcements, ultimately numbering about 38,900, and placed them under the command of General Élie Forey. Even so, it took the French a year to take Puebla, and then the capital in June 1863. The French now sought to establish a friendly Mexican provisional government. Forey appointed a committee of thirty-five Mexicans, the &quot;Junta Superior&quot; who then elected three Mexican citizens to serve as the government&#x27;s executive. In turn this triumvirate then selected 215 Mexicans to form together with the &quot;Junta Superior&quot;, an Assembly of Notables.

The Assembly met in July 1863 and resolved to invite Maximilian to be Emperor of Mexico. The executive triumvirate was formally changed into the Regency of the Mexican Empire. An official delegation left Mexico, arriving in Europe in October. Upon meeting the delegation, Maximilian set forth the condition that he would only accept the throne if a national plebiscite approved of it. By February 1864 French forces controlled territory comprising the majority of Mexico&#x27;s population. The Mexican plebiscite duly held in occupied territory &quot;was a farce&quot;, but Maximilian accepted the proclamation that a majority of Mexicans voted in favor of him as emperor.

The crown of Mexico came at a high cost to Maximilian. Although he had extracted promises from Napoleon III to militarily support the regime, he was to be entirely dependent on him. Emperor Franz Joseph isolated his younger brother Maximilian by forcing him to renounce any rights to the Austrian throne or as an archduke of Austria. On 9 April 1864 Maximilian reluctantly agreed to the &quot;Family Pact&quot;. Maximilian formally accepted the crown of Mexico at Miramar on 10 April 1864.

===Arrival in Mexico===

In April 1864, Maximilian stepped down from his duties as Chief of Naval Section of the Austrian Navy. He traveled from Trieste aboard SMS &quot;Novara&quot;, escorted by the frigates (Austrian) and &quot;Thémis&quot; (French), and the Imperial yacht &quot;Fantasie&quot; led the warship procession from his Miramare Castle out to sea. They received a blessing from Pope Pius IX, and Queen Victoria ordered the Gibraltar garrison to fire a salute for Maximilian&#x27;s passing ship.

The widespread doubts amongst informed persons concerning the wisdom of Maximilian&#x27;s venture were reflected by the French colonel François Claude du Barail, who while returning from arduous service in Mexico sighted the &quot;Novara&quot; during its Atlantic crossing. Wrote du Barail: &quot;If you succeed in bringing order out of this chaos, fortune into this misery, union into these hearts you will be the greatest sovereign of modern times. Go poor fool! You may regret your beautiful castle of Miramar!&quot;

The new emperor of Mexico landed at Veracruz on 29 May 1864, and received a sparse reception from the townspeople due to a yellow fever outbreak. The Imperial couple&#x27;s arrival at the capital was more celebrated, with fireworks and hundreds of triumphant arches. Maximilian and Carlota were crowned at the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral. He had the backing of Mexican conservatives, nobility, clergy, some Native American populations, and numerous European monarchs, but from the very outset he found himself involved in serious difficulties, since the Liberal forces led by President Benito Juárez refused to recognize his rule. There was continuous fighting between the French expeditionary forces (who were supplemented by Maximilian&#x27;s locally recruited Imperial Mexican troops) on one side and the Mexican Republicans on the other.

After a brief stay at the National Palace, the emperor and empress decided to set up their residence at Chapultepec Castle, located on the top of a hill formerly on the outskirts of Mexico City that had been a retreat of Aztec emperors and Spanish viceroys. Maximilian ordered a wide avenue cut through the city from Chapultepec to the city center and named it the Paseo de la Emperatriz, the project would survive him and the Empire and is today one of the central avenues of Mexico City, the Paseo de la Reforma. Maximilian also acquired a country retreat at Cuernavaca, a villa known as the Jardín Borda.

===Rule===

Although Maximilian had been brought to power with the support of Mexican conservatives expecting he would reverse the reforms of Mexican liberals, codified in the Constitution of 1857, Maximilian and Napoleon III did not want hardline Mexicans to control the regime. Napoleon III had a confidential policy known to his military commander François Achille Bazaine to marginalize the conservatives and create a moderate monarchy with wide support. Maximilian was in agreement and sought to establish a regime that included liberals. In the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals wishing to join the Empire. His conciliatory efforts eventually won over some moderate liberals such as José Fernando Ramírez, José María Lacunza, Manuel Orozco y Berra, and northern strongman Santiago Vidaurri, a former ally of Juárez.

Maximilian&#x27;s lack of understanding of the political situation on the ground in Mexico is seen in his offer to Juárez of amnesty and the post of prime minister. Juárez refused and continued to assert his role as the legitimate head of the Mexican state, despite being forced to decamp from the capital to Mexico&#x27;s north. He never left Mexico&#x27;s national territory, continuing to be recognized by the U.S. government. Juárez had appointed Matías Romero as minister plenipotentiary to the U.S. government, an effective advocate for the Mexican republic even as the U.S. was embroiled in its civil war. Juárez&#x27;s continued presence in Mexico denied Maximilian assertion of legitimacy as ruler.

A major aspect of liberalism in Mexico was the curtailment of the power and privileges of the ideologically conservative Catholic Church, including the forced sale of Church-owned property and freedom of religion, removing Catholicism as the sole religion of the nation. The papal nuncio, Pier Francesco Meglia, arrived in Mexico in December 1864, and informed Maximilian that the liberal laws were to be reversed, Church property was to be returned and religious toleration rescinded and Catholicism as the sole religion reinstated. Maximilian refused, decreeing freedom of worship and confirmed the sale of Church property, as well as other liberal reforms. The pope&#x27;s representative wrote to Maximilian, saying that the Church had supported the establishment of the empire, but now threatened that it would no longer do so if the regime were &quot;ungodly.&quot; Maximilian&#x27;s alienation of the high clergy was in line with his liberal views, but it removed a major pillar of conservative support for the empire.

Maximilian had other priorities as well, including reorganizing his ministries and reforming the Imperial Mexican Army. Having the Imperial Mexican Army under his control would have given him as monarch an armed force and draw on its traditional base of support, but Bazaine impeded that in order to consolidate French control.

During his short reign, Maximilian issued eight volumes of laws covering all aspects of government, including forest management, railroads, roads, canals, postal services, telegraphs, mining, and immigration, most of which were never implemented.
The emperor issued laws guaranteeing Mexicans&#x27; equality before the law and freedom of speech, and laws meant to defend the rights of laborers, especially that of the Natives. Maximilian attempted to implement a law guaranteeing the natives a living wage and outlawing corporal punishment for them, along with limiting their inheritance of debts. The measures faced backlash from the cabinet, but were ultimately issued during one of Carlota&#x27;s regencies. Labor laws in Yucatán actually became harsher on workers after the fall of the Empire. A national system of free schools was also planned based on the German gymnasia, and the emperor founded an academy of sciences and literature. Laws were published in Spanish and in Nahuatl, the Aztec language, which had the largest number of indigenous speakers. Maximilian appointed the Indigenous scholar Faustino Galicia as an advisor to his government. Galicia would also be named president of the Council for the Protection of the Impoverished.

The regime established an immigration agency to promote immigration from the United States, including former Confederates, such as those who immigrated to Brazil; as well as from Europe and Asia. Colonists were to be granted citizenship at once, and gained exemption from taxes for the first year, and an exemption from military services for five years. Two of the most prominent migrant communities built during this era were the New Virginia Colony and the &quot;Carlota Colony.&quot;

Many of Maximilian&#x27;s reforms were simply revivals of previous Mexican legislation. Franciso Arrangoiz who had been Maximilian&#x27;s minister to Britain, Holland, and Belgium, later accused Maximilian of passing such reforms to gain favorable public opinion in Europe, and to give the impression that he had a &#x27;creative genius&#x27; and was &#x27;lifting Mexico out of barbarism.&#x27;

In August 1864 Maximilian took a state trip through the nation while Empress Carlota reigned as regent, going to Querétaro, Guanajuato, and Michoacan, giving public audiences and visiting officials. He celebrated Mexican independence by commemorating the Cry of Dolores, in the actual town where it took place. In November, and December 1865, Carlota took a similar trip to Yucatán.

===Court life===

Maximilian lived for the most part at Chapultepec Castle, making occasional retreats to his villa at Cuernavaca, where he had also taken a mistress named Concepción Sedano. He preferred to dress plainly and also enjoyed wearing traditional Mexican clothing. He enjoyed the Mexican countryside and would often go horse-riding, walking, and swimming. On Sundays at Chapultepec Palace, Maximilian and Carlota frequently held audiences with people from all social and economic segments, including Mexico&#x27;s Indigenous peoples. The royal couple also hosted multiple balls for Mexican high society.

===Deteriorating military situation===
In April 1865, the American Civil War ended, and while the American government was reluctant to enter upon a conflict with France to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, official American sympathy remained with president Benito Juárez. The U.S. government refused to recognize the Empire and also ignored Maximilian&#x27;s correspondence. In December, a private American loan worth $30 million was approved for Juárez, and American volunteers kept joining the Mexican republican troops. An unofficial American raid occurred near Brownsville, and Juárez&#x27;s minister to the United States, Matías Romero, proposed that General Ulysses S. Grant or General William Tecumseh Sherman intervene in Mexico to help the liberals. The prospect of an American invasion to reinstate Juárez caused a number of Maximilian&#x27;s loyal adherents to abandon his cause and leave the capital. The United States refrained from direct military intervention, but continued to put diplomatic pressure on France to leave Mexico.

A concentration of French troops in the northern republican strongholds of Mexico only led to a surge of republican guerrilla activity in the south. While French troops controlled major cities, guerrillas continued to be a major military threat in the countryside. In an effort to combat the increasing violence and in a belief that Juárez had left Mexico, Maximilian in October signed a decree authorizing the court martial and execution of anyone found either aiding or participating with the guerrillas. The harsh measure resembled the 1862 measure by Juárez, but it proved to be widely reviled, being branded the Black Decree. It contributed to the growing unpopularity of the Empire. It is calculated that more than 11,000 Juárez supporters were executed as a result of the decree.

In January 1866, seeing the war as unwinnable and the cost of keeping troops there a financial drain, Napoleon III declared to the French Corps législatif that he intended to withdraw the French military from Mexico. Maximilian&#x27;s request for more aid or at least a delay in troop withdrawals was declined. Carlota arrived in Europe in an attempt to plead for the Empire&#x27;s cause but was unable to gain more support. After the failure of her mission Carlota became increasingly mentally unstable. She spent the rest of her life in seclusion in Belgium, living until 1927.

===Fall of the Empire===

In October 1866 Maximilian moved his cabinet to Orizaba and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation. He contemplated abdication, and on 25 November held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by his government. They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital. He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take. Such a measure would require a ceasefire from Juárez, who had no intention of conceding to someone whom he viewed as the puppet of the French invaders.

As the national assembly project fell through, Maximilian decided to focus on military operations, and in February 1867, as the last of the French troops were leaving, the Emperor headed for the city of Querétaro to join the bulk of his Mexican troops, numbering about 10,000 men. The liberal generals Mariano Escobedo and Ramón Corona converged on Querétaro, besieging it with 40,000 men, and yet the city held out. In the face of an increasing number of Republican troops, however, on 11 May, Maximilian resolved to attempt an escape through the enemy lines and make a break for the coast. This plan was sabotaged by Colonel Miguel López who had come to an agreement with Republican General Escobedo to open the gate to the Republican forces. López appears to have assumed that Maximilian would be allowed to escape.

The city fell on 15 May 1867, and Maximilian was captured the next morning after a failed attempt to escape through Republican lines by a loyal hussar cavalry brigade led by Felix Salm-Salm. Maximilian was captured along with his generals Tomás Mejía Camacho and Miguel Miramón.

===Execution===

Maximilian&#x27;s trial began on 13 June, in the Teatro Iturbide of Querétaro, and he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the Mexican government and with carrying out the Black Decree. Maximilian&#x27;s lawyers, which included the conservative statesman Rafael Martínez de la Torre, attempted to defend the legitimacy of the Empire and Maximilian&#x27;s benevolent rule. After only one day the court returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced Maximilian to death.

A number of the crowned heads of Europe and other prominent figures (including the eminent liberals Victor Hugo and Giuseppe Garibaldi) sent telegrams and letters to Mexico requesting that the Emperor&#x27;s life be spared.

Although he respected Maximilian on a personal level, Juárez refused to commute the sentence because he believed it was necessary to send a message that Mexico would not tolerate any more foreign invasions.

Felix Salm-Salm and his wife devised a plan to allow Maximilian to escape execution by bribing his jailors. However, Maximilian would not go through with the plan unless Generals Miramón and Mejía could accompany him and because he felt that shaving his beard to avoid recognition would undermine his dignity if he were to be recaptured.

The sentence was carried out in the &quot;Cerro de las Campanas&quot; at 6:40 a.m. on the morning of 19 June 1867, when Maximilian, along with Generals Miramón and Mejía, was executed by a Republican firing squad. He spoke only in Spanish and gave each of his executioners a gold coin in traditional European aristocratic fashion. His last words were, &quot;I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood which is about to be spilled end the bloodshed which has been experienced in my new motherland. Long live Mexico! Long live its independence!&quot; A photo of Maximilian&#x27;s firing squad is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gilman Collection.

After Maximilian&#x27;s execution, his body was embalmed and displayed in Mexico, and not repatriated to Austria until six months after his death. Photos of his corpse were taken. The Austrian admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff was sent to Mexico aboard SMS &quot;Novara&quot; to take the late emperor&#x27;s body back to Austria. After arriving in Trieste, the coffin was taken to Vienna and placed in the Imperial Crypt on 18 January 1868.

The Emperor Maximilian Memorial Chapel was constructed on the hill where his execution took place.

==Cultural depictions and portrayals==

Maximilian&#x27;s execution was portrayed in a series of three paintings by French painter Édouard Manet, who had Republican sympathies. His third depiction of the execution shows the Mexican soldiers wearing &quot;uniforms almost identical to French troops, and the man preparing for the coup de grâce shares the conspicuous features of Napoleon III. The implication was clear: Napoleon III had blood on his hands. Unsurprisingly, the painting was banned from public display in Paris&quot;

In the wake of his death, carte-de-visite cards with photographs commemorating his execution circulated both among his followers and among those who wished to celebrate his death. One such card featured a photograph of the shirt he wore to his execution, riddled with bullet holes.

Composer Franz Liszt included a &quot;Marche funèbre, en mémoire de Maximilian I, empereur de Mexique&quot; (a funeral march, in memory of Maximilian I, Emperor of Mexico) among the pieces in his famous collection of piano pieces entitled &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot;.

In Vienna, mementos of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and of the Second Mexican Empire are on display at the Schatzkammer Museum in the Hofburg Palace, at Heeresgeschichtliches Museum and at the Imperial Furniture Collection. A statue of Maximilian stands today in the 13th district of Vienna in front of the entrance to the Schönbrunn Palace Park. In Bad Ischl, the Maximilian fountain on the Traun, built in 1868, is a reminder of him.

In Italy, there is a statue of Maximilian in Trieste, brought back to its original place, Piazza Venezia, from the park of the Miramare Castle in 2009. Maximilian now &quot;overlooks&quot; part of the port of Trieste again. The Rostrata Columna, dedicated to him in 1876 in Maximilian Park in Pula, a work by Heinrich von Ferstel, was brought to Venice in 1919 as Italian spoils of war and is now, rededicated, on the edge of the Giardini della Biennale.

There are portrayals of Maximilian on stage, in film and television. In theater, the play by Franz Werfel &quot;Juarez and Maximilian&quot; focuses on the two historical figures; it was performed in Berlin in 1924, directed by Max Reinhardt. In cinema, the 1934 Mexican film &quot;Juárez y Maximiliano&quot; he is played by Enrique Herrera; in the 1939 American film &quot;Juarez&quot; by Brian Aherne. In the 1939 film &quot;The Mad Empress&quot;, about his wife, Maximilian was played by Conrad Nagel. Maximilian is portrayed in one scene in the 1954 American film &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, played by George Macready. In the Mexican telenovela &quot;El Vuelo del Águila&quot;, Maximilian was portrayed by Mexican actor Mario Iván Martínez. The German-produced Netflix historical drama &quot;The Empress&quot;, premiering in 2022, centers on the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Maximilian&#x27;s sister-in-law. Maximilian, played by actor Johannes Nussbaum, is portrayed in an unfavorable light.

In literary fiction, Harry Turtledove&#x27;s 1997 alternative history novel &quot;How Few Remain&quot; where the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War, Maximilian is still Emperor in 1881 and sells the provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua to the Confederacy for CS $3,000,000 because his country is financially strapped.

Conspiracy theorists writing in German allege Maximilian was not executed and that, having entered a secret agreement with Juárez, lived in exile in El Salvador as Justo Armas until 1936.

==Legacy==

With Maximilian&#x27;s execution in 1867 by a firing squad of the restored republic, schemes and dreams of a royal head of state came to an end in Mexico. Historians are still assessing the period in Mexican history and Maximilian&#x27;s role as well as that of the man he unsuccessfully aimed to depose, the liberal president of the Mexican Republic, Benito Juárez. With Maximilian&#x27;s execution, the second emperor of Mexico to have met that fate following that of Agustín I of Mexico, monarchism in Mexico ceased to be a goal of Mexican conservatives.

Maximilian saw himself as a liberal, aligned with the ideas of Mexican liberalism, but he lacked the understanding that his position was tenuous. Liberalism implemented in Mexico by a European royal propped up by the power of Napoleon III to guarantee the repayment of a fraudulent loan was not a strong basis for enduring rule. Maximilian was initially supported by Mexican conservatives, who failed to realize Maximilian&#x27;s political outlook. Far from repudiating laws of the Liberal Reform removing the privileged status of the Catholic Church in Mexico, Maximilian supported them, thereby losing support from Mexico&#x27;s conservatives who had given his regime a veil of legitimacy as a Mexican project. Mexican historian Erika Pani sees Maximilian in the tradition of Mexican liberals Juárez, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, and Porfirio Díaz advocating the disentailment and nationalization of ecclesiastical properties, the dismantling of private courts for privileged corporate entities of the Catholic Church and the Mexican Army, and major infrastructure project of the building of railways in Mexico. Mexican conservativism survived the execution of Maximilian, to fight the increased anticlericalism in the wake of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), but Mexican monarchism did not. Starting at the end of the twentieth century, the historiography, the writing of history, increasingly seeks not to denigrate Maximilian and the Second Mexican Empire, but to understand it.

One biographer in 1971, calls Maximilian and Carlotta &quot;tragic figures&quot;. He compares the era to that of &quot;grand opera&quot;, with &quot;actors on that stage [who] appear as posturing anachronisms rather than great personages ... only in terms of nineteenth-century melodrama ... does the whole affair assume the credibility of something more than a harlequinade. The blood, after all, was real. The tragedy of Maximilian and Carlotta, and that of the thousands who died or were bereft as a result of their venture in the New World, could have been the product only of a period phosphorescent with decay and delusion.&quot;

Maximilian has been praised by some historians for his liberal reforms, genuine desire to help the people of Mexico, refusal to desert his loyal followers, and personal bravery during the siege of Querétaro. Other researchers consider him short-sighted in political and military affairs, and unwilling to restore republican ideals in Mexico even during the imminent collapse of the Second Mexican Empire.

One of the lesser-known but wide reaching influences of Maximilian&#x27;s reign in Mexico involved music- Maximilian brought Central European marching bands and folk musicians with him to Mexico, and after his execution, those musicians fled to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. There they continued playing their European-based music such as polkas and waltzes, featuring European instruments such as the accordion, but blending with local Spanish and indigenous Mexican influences. This led to the development of musical genres such as &quot;norteño&quot; and &quot;tejano&quot;, which have been and still are extremely influential in Mexican and Mexican-American music as a whole.

In Mexico, there are no statues to Maximilian, but during the regime of Porfirio Díaz, a liberal army general who fought against the French, the Emperor Maximilian Memorial Chapel was built on the site of his and his generals&#x27; execution on the Cerro de las Campanas in Querétaro. Reportedly anti-republican and anti-liberal political groups who advocate the Second Mexican Empire, such as the far-right Nationalist Front of Mexico, founded in 2006, gather yearly in Querétaro to commemorate the deaths of Maximilian and his followers as martyrs. Mexican flags and national symbols have been left at the foot of Maximilian&#x27;s sarcophagus in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. Maximilian&#x27;s place in Mexican history is being reassessed by scholars seeking to understand the man and the period that brought him to his brief rule as emperor of Mexico.

<text>A nail clipper (also called nail clippers, a nail trimmer, a nail cutter or nipper type) is a hand tool used to trim fingernails, toenails and hangnails.

==Design==

Nail clippers are usually made of stainless steel but can also be made of plastic and aluminum. Two common varieties are the pliers type and the compound lever type. Many nail clippers come with a miniature file affixed to them, for manicuring (smoothing) the rough edges of nails, and some come with a nail catcher. 

The head of a nail clipper may be either concave or convex. Nail clippers with convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the cutter. Cutting heads that are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.

==History==
 
Before the invention of the modern nail clipper, people would use small knives to trim or pare their nails. Descriptions of nail trimming in literature date as far back as the 8th century BC. The Book of Deuteronomy exhorts in 21:12 that a man, should he wish to take a captive as a wife, &quot;shall bring her home to [his] house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails&quot;. A reference is made in Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot;, written circa 20 BC, to &quot;A close-shaven man, it&#x27;s said, in an empty barber&#x27;s booth, penknife in hand, quietly cleaning his nails.&quot;

The first United States patent for an improvement in fingernail clippers (then dubbed &quot;finger-nail trimmers&quot;) was filed in 1875 by Valentine Fogerty. Subsequent patents for improvements in fingernail clippers were filed in 1876, by William C. Edge, and in 1878, by John H. Hollman. Later patent filings for fingernail clippers include: one by Eugene Heim and Celestin Matz in 1881, one in 1885 by George H. Coates (for a &quot;finger-nail cutter&quot;), an 1886 patent by Hungarian Inventor David Gestetner, a 1905 patent by Chapel S. Carter, and another by Chapel S. Carter and Hedley P. Carter in 1922. 

Around 1913, Chapel S. Carter was secretary of the H. C. Cook Company in Ansonia, Connecticut, which was incorporated in 1903 as the H. C. Cook Machine Company by Carter, Henry C. Cook, and Lewis I. Cook. Around 1928, when Carter was president of the company, he claimed the &quot;Gem&quot; brand fingernail clipper was introduced in 1896.

In 1947, William E. Bassett (who started the W. E. Bassett Company in 1939) developed the &quot;Trim&quot; brand nail clipper, using the jaw-style design that had been around since the 19th century, but adding two nibs near the base of the file to prevent lateral movement, replacing the pinned rivet with a notched rivet, and adding a thumb-swerve in the lever.
