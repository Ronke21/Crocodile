<text>Napoléon (on-screen title: Napoléon vu par Abel Gance, &quot;Napoleon as seen by Abel Gance&quot;) is a 1927 French silent epic historical film, produced and directed by Abel Gance, that tells the story of Napoleon&#x27;s early years.

The only film to use Polyvision (for the finale), it is recognised as a masterwork of fluid camera motion, produced in a time when most camera shots were static. Many innovative techniques were used to make the film, including fast cutting, extensive close-ups, a wide variety of hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple-camera setups, multiple exposure, superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen and mosaic shots, multi-screen projection, and other visual effects. A revival of &quot;Napoléon&quot; in the mid-1950s influenced the filmmakers of the French New Wave. The film used the Keller-Dorian cinematography for its color sequences.

The film begins in Brienne-le-Château with youthful Napoleon attending military school where he manages a snowball fight like a military campaign, yet he suffers the insults of other boys. It continues a decade later with scenes of the French Revolution and Napoleon&#x27;s presence at the periphery as a young army lieutenant. He returns to visit his family home in Corsica but politics shift against him and put him in mortal danger. He flees, taking his family to France. Serving as an officer of artillery in the Siege of Toulon, Napoleon&#x27;s genius for leadership is rewarded with a promotion to brigadier general. Jealous revolutionaries imprison Napoleon but then the political tide turns against the Revolution&#x27;s own leaders. Napoleon leaves prison, forming plans to invade Italy. He falls in love with the beautiful Joséphine de Beauharnais. The emergency government charges him with the task of protecting the National Assembly. Succeeding in this he is promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Interior, and he marries Joséphine. He takes control of the army which protects the French–Italian border and propels it to victory in an invasion of Italy.

Gance planned for &quot;Napoléon&quot; to be the first of six films about Napoleon&#x27;s career, a chronology of great triumph and defeat ending in Napoleon&#x27;s death in exile on the island of Saint Helena. After the difficulties encountered in making the first film, Gance realised that the costs involved would make the full project impossible.

&quot;Napoléon&quot; was first released in a gala at the Palais Garnier (then the home of the Paris Opera) on 7 April 1927. &quot;Napoléon&quot; had been screened in only eight European cities when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to it, but after screening it in London, it was cut drastically in length, and only the central panel of the three-screen Polyvision sequences was retained before it was put on limited release in the United States. There, the film was indifferently received at a time when talkies were just starting to appear. The film was restored in 1981 after twenty years&#x27; work by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow, with further restoration done under his supervision in 2016. A new restoration of the film supervised by Georges
Mourier premiered in France in July 2024.

==Plot==

The scenario of the film as originally written by Gance was published in 1927 by Librairie Plon. Much of the scenario describes scenes that were rejected during initial editing, and do not appear in any known version of the film. The following plot includes only those scenes that are known to have been included in some version of the film. Not every scene described below can be viewed today.

===Act I===

====Brienne====
In the winter of 1783, young Napoleon Buonaparte (Vladimir Roudenko) is enrolled at Brienne College, a military school for sons of nobility, run by the religious Minim Fathers in Brienne-le-Château, France. The boys at the school are holding a snowball fight organised as a battlefield. Two bullies—Phélippeaux (Petit Vidal) and (Roblin)—schoolyard antagonists of Napoleon, are leading the larger side, outnumbering the side that Napoleon fights for. These two sneak up on Napoleon with snowballs enclosing stones. A hardened snowball draws blood on Napoleon&#x27;s face. Napoleon is warned of another rock-snowball by a shout from Tristan Fleuri (Nicolas Koline), the fictional school scullion representing the French everyman and a friend to Napoleon. Napoleon recovers himself and dashes alone to the enemy snowbank to engage the two bullies in close combat. The Minim Fathers, watching the snowball fight from windows and doorways, applaud the action. Napoleon returns to his troops and encourages them to attack ferociously. He watches keenly and calmly as this attack progresses, assessing the balance of the struggle and giving appropriate orders. He smiles as his troops turn the tide of battle. Carrying his side&#x27;s flag, he leads his forces in a final charge and raises the flag at the enemy stronghold.

The monks come out of the school buildings to discover who led the victory. A young military instructor, Jean-Charles Pichegru (René Jeanne), asks Napoleon for his name. Napoleon responds &quot;Nap-eye-ony&quot; in Corsican-accented French and is laughed at by the others. Despite the fact Pichegru thought Napoleon had said &quot;Paille-au-nez&quot; (straw in the nose), Pichegru tells him that he will go far.

In class, the boys study geography. Napoleon is angered by the condescending textbook description of Corsica. He is taunted by the other boys and kicked by the two bullies who hold flanking seats. Another of the class&#x27;s island examples is Saint Helena, which puts Napoleon into a pensive daydream.

Unhappy in school, Napoleon writes about his difficulties in a letter to his family. A bully reports to a monk that Napoleon is hiding letters in his bed, and the monk tears the letter to pieces. Angry, Napoleon goes to visit the attic quarters of his friend Fleuri, a place of refuge where Napoleon keeps his captive bird, a young eagle that was sent to him from Corsica by an uncle. Napoleon tenderly pets the eagle&#x27;s head, then leaves to fetch water for the bird. The two bullies take this opportunity to set the bird free. Napoleon finds the bird gone and runs to the dormitory to demand the culprit show himself. None of the boys admits to the deed. Napoleon exclaims that they are all guilty, and begins to fight them all, jumping from bed to bed. In the clash, pillows are split and feathers fly through the air as the Minim Fathers work to restore order. They collar Napoleon and throw him outside in the snow. Napoleon cries to himself on the limber of a cannon, then he looks up to see the young eagle in a tree. He calls to the eagle which flies down to the cannon barrel. Napoleon caresses the eagle and smiles through his tears.

====The French Revolution====
In 1792, the great hall of the Club of the Cordeliers is filled with revolutionary zeal as hundreds of members wait for a meeting to begin. The leaders of the group, Georges Danton (Alexandre Koubitzky), Jean-Paul Marat (Antonin Artaud) and Maximilien Robespierre (Edmond Van Daële), are seen conferring. Camille Desmoulins (Robert Vidalin), Danton&#x27;s secretary, interrupts Danton to tell of a new song that has been printed, called &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. A young army captain, Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle (Harry Krimer) has written the words and brought the song to the club. Danton directs de Lisle to sing the song to the club. The sheet music is distributed and the club learns to sing the song, rising in fervor with each passage. At the edge of the crowd, Napoleon (Albert Dieudonné), now a young army lieutenant, thanks de Lisle as he leaves: &quot;Your hymn will save many a cannon.&quot;

Splashed with water in a narrow Paris street, Napoleon is noticed by Joséphine de Beauharnais (Gina Manès) and Paul Barras (Max Maxudian) as they step from a carriage on their way into the house of Mademoiselle Lenormand (Carrie Carvalho), the fortune teller. Inside, Lenormand exclaims to Joséphine that she has the amazing fortune to be the future queen.

On the night of 10 August 1792, Napoleon watches impassively as mob rule takes over Paris and a man is hung by revolutionaries. In front of the National Assembly, Danton tells the crowd that they have cracked the monarchy. Napoleon senses a purpose rising within him, to bring order to the chaos. The mob violence has tempered his character.

Napoleon, on leave from the French Army, travels to Corsica with his sister, Élisa (Yvette Dieudonné). They are greeted by his mother, Letizia Buonaparte (Eugénie Buffet) and the rest of his family at their summer home in Les Milelli. The shepherd Santo-Ricci (Henri Baudin) interrupts the happy welcome to tell Napoleon the bad news that Corsica&#x27;s president, Pasquale Paoli (Maurice Schutz), is planning to give the island to the British. Napoleon declares his intention to prevent this fate.

Riding a horse and revisiting places of his childhood, Napoleon stops in Milelli gardens and considers whether to retreat and protect his family, or to advance into the political arena. Later in the streets of Ajaccio, Pozzo di Borgo (Acho Chakatouny) encourages a mob to put Napoleon to death for opposing Paoli, and the townsfolk surround the Buonaparte home. Napoleon stands outside the door and stares the crowd down, dispersing them silently. Paoli signs a death warrant, putting a price on Napoleon&#x27;s head. Napoleon&#x27;s brothers, Lucien (Sylvio Cavicchia) and Joseph (Georges Lampin), leave for Calvi to see if French authorities can intervene. Napoleon faces the danger alone, walking into an inn where men are arguing politics, all of whom would like to see him dead. He confronts the men and says, &quot;Our fatherland is France ...with me!&quot; His arguments subdue the crowd, but di Borgo enters the inn, accompanied by gendarmes. Napoleon evades capture and rides away on his horse, pursued by di Borgo and his men.

Upstairs in the Ajaccio town hall, a council declares war on France even while the French flag flies outside the window. Napoleon climbs up the balcony and takes down the flag, shouting to the council, &quot;It is too great for you!&quot; The men fire their pistols at Napoleon but miss as he rides away.

While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo stretches a rope across a road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his sabre and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering that it has no oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea.

Meanwhile, in Paris, meeting in the National Assembly, the majority Girondists are losing to the Montagnards: Robespierre, Danton, Marat and their followers. Robespierre calls for all Girondists to be indicted. (Napoleon&#x27;s boat is tossed by increasing waves.) The Girondists seek to flee but are repulsed. (A storm throws Napoleon back and forth in his boat.) The assembly hall rolls with the struggle between Girondists and Montagnards. (Napoleon grimly bails water to prevent his violently rocking boat from sinking.)

Later, in calm water, the small boat is seen by Lucien and Joseph Buonaparte aboard a French ship, &quot;Le Hasard&quot;. The larger ship is steered to rescue the unknown boat, and as it is pulled close, Napoleon is recognised, lying unconscious at the bottom, gripping the French flag. Waking, Napoleon directs the ship to a cove in Corsica where the Buonaparte family is rescued. The ship sails for France carrying a future queen, three future kings, and the future Emperor of France. The British warship sights &quot;Le Hasard&quot;, and a young officer, Horatio Nelson (Olaf Fjord), asks his captain if he might be allowed to shoot at the enemy vessel and sink it. The captain denies the request, saying that the target is too unimportant to waste powder and shot. As &quot;Le Hasard&quot; sails away, an eagle flies to the Buonapartes and lands on the ship&#x27;s flagpole.

===Act II===

In July 1793, fanatic Girondist Charlotte Corday (Marguerite Gance) visits Marat in his home and kills him with a knife. Two months later, General Jean François Carteaux (Léon Courtois), in control of a French army, is ineffectively besieging the port of Toulon, held by 20,000 English, Spanish and Italian troops. Captain Napoleon is assigned to the artillery section and is dismayed by the obvious lack of French discipline. He confronts Carteaux in an inn run by Tristan Fleuri, formerly the scullion of Brienne. Napoleon advises Carteaux how best to engage the artillery against Toulon, but Carteaux is dismissive. An enemy artillery shot hits the inn and scatters the officers. Napoleon stays to study a map of Toulon while Fleuri&#x27;s young son Marcellin (Serge Freddy-Karl) mimes with Napoleon&#x27;s hat and sword. Fleuri&#x27;s beautiful daughter Violine Fleuri (Annabella) admires Napoleon silently.

General Jacques François Dugommier (Alexandre Bernard) replaces Carteaux and asks Napoleon to join in war planning. Later, Napoleon sees a cannon being removed from a fortification and demands that it be returned. He fires a shot at the enemy and establishes the position as the &quot;Battery of Men Without Fear&quot;. French soldiers rally around Napoleon with heightened spirits. Dugommier advances Napoleon to the position of commander-in-chief of the artillery.

French troops under Napoleon prepare for a midnight attack. Veteran soldier Moustache (Henry Krauss) tells 7-year-old Marcellin, now a drummer boy, that the heroic drummer boy Joseph Agricol Viala was 13 when he was killed in battle. Marcellin takes courage; he expects to have six years of life left. Napoleon orders the attack forward amidst rain and high wind. A reversal causes Antoine Christophe Saliceti (Philippe Hériat) to name Napoleon&#x27;s strategy a great crime. Consequently, Dugommier orders Napoleon to cease attacking, but Napoleon discusses the matter with Dugommier and the attack is carried forward successfully despite Saliceti&#x27;s warnings. English cannon positions are taken in bloody hand-to-hand combat, lit by lightning flashes and whipped by rain. Because of the French advance, English Admiral Samuel Hood (W. Percy Day) orders the burning of the moored French fleet before French troops can recapture the ships. The next morning, Dugommier, seeking to promote Napoleon to the rank of brigadier general, finds him asleep, exhausted. An eagle beats its wings as it perches on a tree next to Napoleon. (&#x27;End of the First Epoch&#x27;.)

===Act III===
After being shamed in Toulon, Saliceti wants to put Napoleon on trial. Robespierre says he should be offered the command of Paris, but if he refuses, he will be tried. Robespierre, supported by Georges Couthon (Louis Vonelly) and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just (Abel Gance), condemns Danton to death. Saint-Just puts Joséphine into prison at Les Carmes where she is comforted by General Lazare Hoche (Pierre Batcheff). Fleuri, now a jailer, calls for &quot;De Beauharnais&quot; to be executed, and Joséphine&#x27;s ex-husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais (Georges Cahuzac) rises to accept his fate. Elsewhere, Napoleon is also imprisoned for refusing to serve under Robespierre. He works out the possibility of building a canal to Suez as Saliceti taunts him for not trying to form a legal defence.

In an archive room filled with the files of condemned prisoners, clerks Bonnet () and La Bussière (Jean d&#x27;Yd) work secretly with Fleuri to destroy (by eating) some of the dossiers including those for Napoleon and Joséphine. Meanwhile, at the National Assembly, Violine with her little brother Marcellin, watches from the gallery. Voices are raised against Robespierre and Saint-Just. Jean-Lambert Tallien (Jean Gaudrey) threatens Robespierre with a knife. Violine decides not to shoot Saint-Just with a pistol she brought. Back at the archives, the prison clerks are given new dossiers on those to be executed by guillotine: Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthon.

Joséphine and Napoleon are released from their separate prisons. Napoleon declines the request by to command infantry in the War in the Vendée under General Hoche, saying he would not fight Frenchman against Frenchman when 200,000 foreigners were threatening the country. He is given a minor map-making command as punishment for refusing the greater post. He draws up plans for an invasion of Italy. In Nice, General Schérer (Alexandre Mathillon) sees the plans and laughs at the foolhardy proposal. The plans are sent back, and Napoleon pastes them up to cover a broken window in the poor apartment he shares with Captain Marmont (Pierre de Canolle), Sergeant Junot (Jean Henry) and the actor Talma (Roger Blum). Napoleon and Junot see the contrast of cold, starving people outside of wealthy houses.

Joséphine convinces Barras to suggest to the National Assembly that Napoleon is the best man to quell a royalist uprising. On 3 October 1795 Napoleon accepts and supplies 800 guns for defence. Directed by Napoleon, Major Joachim Murat (Genica Missirio) seizes a number of cannons to fight the royalists. Di Borgo shoots at Napoleon but misses; di Borgo is then wounded by Fleuri&#x27;s accidental musket discharge. Saliceti is prevented from escaping in disguise. Napoleon sets Saliceti and di Borgo free. Joseph Fouché (Guy Favières) tells Joséphine that the noise of the fighting is Napoleon &quot;entering history again&quot;. Napoleon is made General in Chief of the Army of the Interior to great celebration.

A Victim&#x27;s Ball is held at Les Carmes, formerly the prison where Joséphine was held. To amuse the attendees, Fleuri re-enacts the tragedy of the executioner&#x27;s roll-call. The beauty of Joséphine is admired by Thérésa Tallien (Andrée Standard) and Madame Juliette Récamier (Suzy Vernon), and Napoleon is also fascinated. He plays chess with Hoche, beating him as Joséphine watches and entices Napoleon with her charms. The dancers at the ball become uninhibited; the young women begin to dance partially nude.
In his army office, Napoleon tells 14-year-old Eugène de Beauharnais (Georges Hénin) that he can keep his executed father&#x27;s sword. The next day, Joséphine arrives with Eugène to thank Napoleon for this kindness to her only son. The general staff officers wait for hours while Napoleon clumsily tries to convey his feelings for Joséphine. Later, Napoleon practises his amorous style under the guidance of his old friend Talma, the actor. Napoleon visits Joséphine daily. Violine is greatly hurt to see Napoleon&#x27;s attentions directed away from herself. In trade for agreeing to marry Napoleon, Joséphine demands of Barras that he place Napoleon in charge of the French Army of Italy. Playing with Joséphine&#x27;s children, Napoleon narrowly misses seeing Barras in her home. Joséphine hires Violine as a servant.

Napoleon plans to invade Italy. He wishes to marry Joséphine as quickly as possible before he leaves. Hurried preparations go forward. On the wedding day, 9 March 1796, Napoleon is 2 hours late. He is found in his room planning the Italian campaign, and the wedding ceremony is rushed. That night, Violine and Joséphine both prepare for the wedding bed. Violine prays to a shrine of Napoleon. Joséphine and Napoleon embrace at the bed. In the next room, Violine kisses a shadowy figure of Napoleon that she has created from a doll.

===Act IV===

Just before leaving Paris, Napoleon enters the empty National Assembly hall at night, and sees the spirits of those who had set the Revolution in motion. The ghostly figures of Danton and Saint-Just speak to Napoleon, and demand answers from him regarding his plan for France. All the spirits sing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.

Only 48 hours after his wedding, Napoleon leaves Paris in a coach for Nice. He writes dispatches, and letters to Joséphine. Back in Paris, Joséphine and Violine pray at the little shrine to Napoleon.

Napoleon speeds to Albenga on horseback to find the army officers resentful and the soldiers starving. He orders a review of the troops. The troops respond quickly to the commanding presence of Napoleon and bring themselves to perfect attention. Fleuri, now a soldier, tries and fails to get a hint of recognition from Napoleon. The Army of Italy is newly filled with fighting spirit. Napoleon encourages them for the coming campaign into Italy, the &quot;honour, glory and riches&quot; which will be theirs upon victory. The underfed and poorly armed force advances into Montenotte and takes the town. Further advances carry Napoleon to Montezemolo. As he gazes upon the Alps, visions appear to him of future armies, future battles, and the face of Joséphine. The French troops move forward triumphantly as the vision of an eagle fills their path, a vision of the blue, white and red French flag waving before them.

==Primary cast==

==Music==
The film features Gance&#x27;s interpretation of the birth of the song &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, the national anthem of France. In the film, the French singer portrays the spirit of the song. &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is played by the orchestra repeatedly during a scene at the Club of the Cordeliers, and again at other points in the plot. During the 1927 Paris Opera premiere, the song was sung live by Alexandre Koubitzky to accompany the Cordeliers scene. Koubitzky played Danton in the film, but he was also a well-known singer. Gance had earlier asked Koubitzky and Damia to sing during the filming of the Cordeliers scene to inspire the cast and extras. Kevin Brownlow wrote in 1983 that he thought it was &quot;daring&quot; of Gance &quot;to make a song the highpoint of a silent film!&quot;

The majority of the film is accompanied by incidental music. For this material, the original score was composed by Arthur Honegger in 1927 in France. A separate score was written by Werner Heymann in Germany, also in 1927. In pace with Brownlow&#x27;s efforts to restore the movie to something close to its 1927 incarnation, two scores were prepared in 1979–1980; one by Carl Davis in the UK and one by Carmine Coppola in the US.

Beginning in late 1979, Carmine Coppola composed a score incorporating themes taken from various sources such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Hector Berlioz, Bedřich Smetana, Felix Mendelssohn and George Frideric Handel. He composed three original themes: an heroic one for Napoleon, a love theme for scenes with Josephine, and a Buonaparte family theme. He also used French revolutionary songs that were supplied by Davis in early 1980 during a London meeting between Coppola, Davis and Brownlow. Two such songs were &quot;Ah! ça ira&quot; and &quot;La Carmagnole&quot;. Coppola returns to &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as the finale. Coppola&#x27;s score was heard first in New York at Radio City Music Hall performed for very nearly four hours, accompanying a film projected at 24 frames per second as suggested by producer Robert A. Harris. Coppola included some sections of music carried solely by an organist to relieve the 60-piece orchestra.

Working quickly from September 1980, Davis arranged a score based on selections of classical music; especially the Eroica Symphony by Beethoven who had initially admired Napoleon as a liberator, and had dedicated the symphony to Napoleon. Taking this as an opportunity to research the music Napoleon would have heard, Davis also used folk music from Corsica, French revolutionary songs, a tune from Napoleon&#x27;s favourite opera (&quot;Nina&quot; by Giovanni Paisiello) and pieces by other classical composers who were active in France in the 18th century. Davis uses &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as a recurring theme and returns to it during Napoleon&#x27;s vision of ghostly patriots at the National Assembly. In scoring the film, Davis was assisted by David Gill and Liz Sutherland; the three had just completed the Thames Television documentary series &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), on the silent film era. To accompany a screening of 4 hours 50 minutes shown at 20 frames per second during the 24th London Film Festival, Davis conducted the Wren Orchestra. Following this, work continued on restoration of the film with the goal of finding more footage to make a more complete version. In 2000, Davis lengthened his score and a new version of the movie was shown in London, projected at 20 frames per second for 5 hours 32 minutes. The 2000 score was performed in London in 2004 and 2013, and also in Oakland, California, in 2012, with Davis conducting local orchestras.

==Triptych sequence==

Polyvision is the name that French film critic Émile Vuillermoz gave to a specialised widescreen film format devised exclusively for the filming and projection of Gance&#x27;s &quot;Napoléon&quot;. It involves the simultaneous projection of three reels of silent film arrayed in a horizontal row, making for a total aspect ratio of 4.00:1 . Gance was worried the film&#x27;s finale would not have the proper impact by being confined to a small screen. Gance thought of expanding the frame by using three cameras next to each other. This is considered to be the best-known of the film&#x27;s several innovative techniques. Though American filmmakers began experimenting with 70mm widescreen (such as Fox Grandeur) in 1929, widescreen did not take off until CinemaScope was introduced in 1953.

Polyvision was only used for the final reel of Napoleon, to create a climactic finale. Filming the whole story in Polyvision was logistically difficult as Gance wished for a number of innovative shots, each requiring greater flexibility than was allowed by three interlocked cameras. When the film was greatly trimmed by the distributors early on during exhibition, the new version only retained the centre strip to allow projection in standard single-projector cinemas. Gance was unable to eliminate the problem of the two seams dividing the three panels of film as shown on screen, so he avoided the problem by putting three completely different shots together in some of the Polyvision scenes. When Gance viewed Cinerama for the first time in 1955, he noticed the widescreen image was still not seamless, and the problem was not entirely fixed.

==Restorations==

Film historian Kevin Brownlow conducted reconstructions of the film in the years leading up to 1980, including the Polyvision scenes. As a boy, Brownlow had purchased two 9.5 mm reels of the film from a street market. He was captivated by the cinematic boldness of short clips, and his research led to a lifelong fascination with the film and a quest to reconstruct it. On 31 August 1979, &quot;Napoléon&quot; was shown to a crowd of hundreds at the Telluride Film Festival, in Telluride, Colorado. The film was presented in full Polyvision at the specially constructed Abel Gance Open Air Cinema, which is still in use today. Gance was in the audience until the chilly air drove him indoors after which he watched from the window of his room at the New Sheridan Hotel. Kevin Brownlow was also in attendance and presented Gance with his Silver Medallion.
Brownlow&#x27;s 1980 reconstruction was re-edited and released in the United States by American Zoetrope (through Universal Pictures) with a score by Carmine Coppola performed live at the screenings. The restoration premiered in the United States at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 23–25 January 1981; each performance showed to a standing room only house. Gance could not attend because of poor health. At the end of 24 January screening, a telephone was brought onstage and the audience was told that Gance was listening on the other end and wished to know what they had thought of his film. The audience erupted in an ovation of applause and cheers that lasted several minutes. The acclaim surrounding the film&#x27;s revival brought Gance much-belated recognition as a master director before his death eleven months later, in November 1981.

Another restoration was made by Brownlow in 1983. When it was screened at the Barbican Centre in London, French actress Annabella, who plays the fictional character Violine in the film (personifying France in her plight, beset by enemies from within and without), was in attendance. She was introduced to the audience prior to screenings and during one of the intervals sat alongside Kevin Brownlow, signing copies of the latter&#x27;s book about the history and restoration of the film.
Brownlow re-edited the film again in 2000, including previously missing footage rediscovered by the Cinémathèque Française in Paris. Altogether, 35 minutes of reclaimed film had been added, making the 2000 restoration five and a half hours.

The film is properly screened in full restoration very rarely due to the expense of the orchestra and the difficult requirement of three synchronised projectors and three screens for the Polyvision section. One such screening was at the Royal Festival Hall in London in December 2004, including a live orchestral score of classical music extracts arranged and conducted by Carl Davis. The screening itself was the subject of hotly contested legal threats from Francis Ford Coppola via Universal Studios to the British Film Institute over whether the latter had the right to screen the film without the Coppola score. An understanding was reached and the film was screened for both days. Coppola&#x27;s single-screen version of the film was last projected for the public at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in two showings in celebration of Bastille Day on 13–14 July 2007, using a 70 mm print struck by Universal Studios in the early 1980s.

At the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in July 2011, Brownlow announced there would be four screenings of his 2000 version, shown at the original 20 frames per second, with the final triptych and a live orchestra, to be held at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California, from 24 March to 1 April 2012. These, the first US screenings of his 5.5-hour-long restoration were described as requiring 3 intermissions, one of which was a dinner break. Score arranger Carl Davis led the 46-piece Oakland East Bay Symphony for the performances.

At a screening of &quot;Napoléon&quot; on 30 November 2013, at the Royal Festival Hall in London, full to capacity, the film and orchestra received a standing ovation, without pause, from the front of the stalls to the rear of the balcony. Davis conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in a performance that spanned a little over eight hours, including a 100-minute dinner break.

On 13 November 2016, &quot;Napoléon&quot; was the subject of the &quot;Film Programme&quot; on BBC Radio 4. The BBC website announced: &quot;Historian Kevin Brownlow tells Francine Stock about his 50-year quest to restore Abel Gance&#x27;s silent masterpiece Napoleon to its five and half-hour glory, and why the search for missing scenes still continues even though the film is about to be released on DVD for the very first time.&quot;

A restoration of the almost-seven-hour-long so-called Apollo version (i.e. the version of &quot;Napoléon&quot; shown at the Apollo Theatre in Paris in 1927), conducted by Cinémathèque Française under the direction of the restorer and director Georges Mourier, and financed by the CNC along with Netflix, was scheduled to be completed by 5 May 2021. Because of complications associated with the restoration process, the release was postponed, and premiered in France in July 2024.

;Released versions and screenings
==Legacy==
&quot;Napoléon&quot; is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most innovative films of not only the silent era but also of all time. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of critics have given the film a positive review, based upon 67 reviews, with an average score of 9.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Monumental in scale and distinguished by innovative technique, &quot;Napoléon&quot; is an expressive epic that maintains a singular intimacy with its subject.&quot;

Anita Brookner of &quot;London Review of Books&quot; wrote that the film has an &quot;energy, extravagance, ambition, orgiastic pleasure, high drama and the desire for endless victory: not only Napoleon’s destiny but everyone’s most central hope.&quot; The 2012 screening has been acclaimed, with Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; calling the film, &quot;A rich feast of images and emotions.&quot; He also praised the triptych finale, calling it, &quot;An overwhelming and surprisingly emotional experience.&quot; Judith Martin of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;inspires that wonderfully satisfying theatrical experience of whole-heartedly cheering a hero and hissing villains, while also providing the uplift that comes from a real work of art&quot; and praised its visual metaphors, editing, and tableaus. Peter Bradshaw wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;Napoléon&quot; &quot;looks startlingly futuristic and experimental, as if we are being shown something from the 21st century’s bleeding edge. It’s as if it has evolved beyond spoken dialogue into some colossal mute hallucination.&quot; Mark Kermode described the film &quot;as significant to the evolution of cinema as the works of Sergei Eisenstein and D. W. Griffith&quot; that &quot;created a kaleidoscopic motion picture which stretched the boundaries of the screen in every way possible.&quot;

Director Stanley Kubrick was not a fan of the film, saying in an interview &quot;I found it really terrible. Technically [Gance] was ahead of his time and he introduced new film techniques – in fact Eisenstein credited him with stimulating his initial interest in montage – but as far as story and performance goes it&#x27;s a very crude picture.&quot;

It is included by the Vatican in a list of important films, as compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Art&quot;.

==Home media==
For many years the Brownlow restoration with Carl Davis&#x27;s score was unavailable for home viewing. In 2016 it was released by BFI and Photoplay Productions on DVD, Blu-ray and for streaming via the BFI Player.

Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1980 edit (3 hours and 43 minutes), accompanied by Carmine Coppola&#x27;s score and projected at 24 fps, has been released on VHS and Laserdisc in the US, and in Australia on a Region 4 DVD. These have also been pirated on DVDs emanating from Europe and elsewhere. To suit home viewers watching on a single standard-width television screen, the triptych portion is letterboxed, such that image height is reduced to one-third for that portion of the film.

<text>Shehu Usman dan Fodio (; full name; 15 December 1754 – 20 April 1817). (Uthman ibn Muhammad ibn Uthman ibn Saalih ibn Haarun ibn Muhammad Ghurdu ibn Muhammad Jubba ibn Muhammad Sambo ibn Maysiran ibn Ayyub ibn Buba Baba ibn Musa Jokolli ibn Imam Dembube`) was a Fulani scholar, Islamic religious teacher, poet, revolutionary and a philosopher who founded the Sokoto Caliphate and ruled as its first caliph. 

After the successful revolution, the &quot;Jama&#x27;a&quot; gave him the title Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin (commander of the faithful). He rejected the throne and continued calling to Islam.

Born in Gobir, Usman was a descendant of the Torodbe clans of urbanized ethnic Fulani people living in the Hausa Kingdoms since the early 1400s. In early life, Usman became well educated in Islamic studies and soon, he began to preach Sunni Islam throughout territories that would later become parts of independent Nigeria and Cameroon. He wrote more than a hundred books concerning religion, government, culture and society. He developed a critique of existing African Muslim elites for what he saw as their greed, paganism, violation of the standards of the Sharia.

Usman formed and began an Islamic religious and social revolution which spread from Gobir throughout modern Nigeria and Cameroon. This revolution influenced other rebellions across West Africa and beyond. In 1803, he founded the Sokoto Caliphate and his followers pledged allegiance to him as the Commander of the Faithful (). Usman declared jihad against the tyrannical kings and defeated the kings. Under Usman&#x27;s leadership, the caliphate expanded into present-day Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Southern Niger and most of Northern Nigeria. Ɗan Fodio declined much of the pomp of rulership, and while developing contacts with religious reformists and jihad leaders across Africa, he soon passed actual leadership of the Sokoto state to his son, Muhammed Bello.

He encouraged literacy and scholarship, for women as well as men, and several of his daughters emerged as scholars and writers. His writings and sayings continue to be much quoted today, and are often affectionately referred to as Shehu in Nigeria. Some followers consider ɗan Fodio to have been a mujaddid, a divinely sent &quot;reformer of Islam&quot;.
Shehu dan Fodio&#x27;s uprising was a major episode of a movement described as the jihad in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It followed the jihads successfully waged in Futa Bundu, Futa Tooro and Fouta Djallon between 1650 and 1750, which led to the creation of those three Islamic states. In his turn, the Shehu inspired a number of later West African jihads, including those of Seku Amadu, founder of the Massina Empire and Omar Saidou Tall, founder of the Toucouleur Empire, who married one of ɗan Fodio&#x27;s granddaughters.

== Early life ==

=== Lineage and childhood ===
Usman Danfodio belongs to the generation of wandering scholars who started settling in Hausaland since the 1300-1400s, some 400–500 years before the Jihad The Sheikh&#x27;s ancestors were Toronkawa who migrated from Futa Tooro in the 1300s under the leadership of Musa Jokollo. Musa Jokollo is the 11th grandfather of the Shehu. There were 11 generations between Musa Jokollo and Shehu Danfodio. 

Abdullahi dan Fodio stated that the Torankawa (Turubbi/Torobe) have Arab ancestry through one Uqba who married a Fulani woman called Bajjumangbu. Muhammed Bello was not sure if it was Uqba ibn Nafi, Uqba ibn Yasir or Uqba ibn Amir. Usman dan Fodio&#x27;s mother Hauwa is believed to be a direct descendant of Muhammad as she was descended from Maulay Idris I, the first Emir of Morocco, who was the great-grandchild of Hasan, grandson of Muhammad. Ahmadu Bello, the first Premier of Northern Nigeria and great-grandson of Muhammed Bello, also said this in his autobiography, tracing his family&#x27;s connection to Muhammad through Hauwa and Muhammad Fodio.

The Toronkawa first settled in a village called Konni on the borders of Bornu Empire and Songhai Empire, till persecution drove them to Maratta under the leadership of Muhammad Sa&#x27;ad, the Sheikh&#x27;s great-grandfather. A faction of them split and moved to Qoloba. It was in Maratta that Usman Danfodio was born on 15 December 1754. He was born as bi Fodiye, dan Fodio or Ibn Fudiyi, &#x27;the son of Fodiye&#x27;, his father has earned the Fulani title of Fodiye &#x27;the learned&#x27;. A further move by the sheikh&#x27;s father, Muhammad Bn Fodio after 1754 brought them from Maratta to Degel, but several of their relatives still stayed in the town of Konni. Other Toronkawa, such as Gidado&#x27;s family moved to Kebbi.

His father Muhammad Fodio was an Islamic scholar who the Young Danfodio will later mention in his books as having great influence on him. Muhammad Fodio died in Degel and is buried there. Usman&#x27;s mother is Hauwa Bn Muhammad. She is believed to be a direct descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad as she was descended from Maulay Idris I, the first Emir of Morocco. Usman and Abdullahi&#x27;s first teacher was their mother Hauwa who came from a long line of famous literary scholars. Her mother, Usman&#x27;s grandmother, was Ruqayyah bin Alim, who was a well respected ascetic and teacher. According to Murray Last, Ruqayya is linked to the branch of the family noted for its learning. Ruqayyah&#x27;s work &quot;Alkarim Yaqbal&quot; was popular among Islamic scholars of the 18th and 19th century. Hauwa&#x27;s father and Ruqayyah&#x27;s husband, Muhammad bin Uthman bin Hamm, was even more famous and respected than Ruqayya. He was regarded as the most learned Fulani cleric of the time.

=== Education ===
While Usman was young, he and his family shifted to Degel where he studied the Quran. After studying the Qur&#x27;an with his father, Danfodio moved to other teachers. They included his relations, Uthman Bn Duri, and Muhammad Sambo. After being thought by Uthman Binduri, Danfodio joined Jibril bin Umar. Ibn Umar was a powerful intellectual and religious leader at the time, who was a staunch proponent of Jihad. Jibrin Ibn Umar was a controversial figure who later fall out with Danfodio; his preaching on defining who a Muslim is became a subject of disagreement between him and Shehu later in life. The Son of Ibn Umar later joined Shehu at the beginning of the Jihad. Other students of Ibn Umar include Danfodio&#x27;s brother Abdullahi dan Fodio, and cousins Muhammad Firabri and Mustapha Bin Uthman At age 20, Usman set up his school in Degel, he was preaching and studying at the same time. Soon after, he became well educated in classical Islamic science, philosophy and theology, and also became a revered religious thinker. 

in 1786, Danfodio attended the assembly of his cousin Muhammad bn Raji where he received further academic certifications (p.7). 

By 1787, Danfodio was writing a number of books in Arabic and composing long poems in Fulfulde. One of the famous of his books &quot;Ihyā’ al-sunna wa ikhmād al-bid’a (The revival of the Prophetic practice and obliteration of false innovation)&quot; finished before 1773 and seems to established Danfodio&#x27;s reputaion among contemporary scholars. In his dispute with local scholars over scholasticism, he wrote over 50 works against the quibbles of local scholars.

=== Call to Islam ===
In 1774, Usman began his itinerant preaching as an &quot;Mallam&quot; and continued preaching for twelve years in Gobir and Kebbi, followed by further five years in Zamfara. Among Usman&#x27;s well-known students include his younger brother Abdullah, the Hausa King Yunfa, and many others.

His preaching tours took him from to Faru. After his return from Faru, he continued to tour going beyond Kebbi as far as Illo across the Niger River, and in the South travelling to Zugu beyond the Zamfara River valley.

Usman criticized the ruling elite with his writings, condemning them for enslavement, worshiping idols, sacrificial rituals, overtaxation, arbitrary rule and greed. He also insisted on the observance of the Maliki fiqh in personal observances as well as in commercial and criminal law. Usman also denounced the mixing of men and women, pagan customs, dancing at bridal feasts, and inheritance practices against women contrary to Sharia. Soon, the young Danfodio got massive followership among the peasants and other lower class.

Usman broke from the royal court and used his influence to secure approval for creating a religious community in his hometown of Degel that would, he hoped, be a model town. He stayed there for 20 years, writing, teaching and preaching. As in other Islamic societies, the autonomy of Muslim communities under ulama leadership made it possible to resist the state and the state version of Islam in the name of sharia and the ideal caliphate.

He was also influenced by the mushahada or mystical visions he was having. In 1789, a vision led him to believe he had the power to work miracles, and to teach his own mystical &quot;wird&quot;, or litany. His litanies are still widely practiced and distributed in the Islamic world. In the 1790s, Usman later had visions of Abdul Qadir Gilani, (the founder of the Qadiri tariqah) and ascension to heaven, where he was initiated into the Qadiriyya and the spiritual lineage of Muhammad. Usman later became head of his Qadiriyya brotherhood calling for the purification of Islamic practices. His theological writings dealt with concepts of the mujaddid (renewer) and the role of the Ulama in teaching history, and other works in Arabic and the Fula language.

== Notable works ==
Danfodio wrote more than a hundred books concerning Economy, History, Law, Administration, Women&#x27;s rights, government, culture, Politics and society. He wrote 118 poems in Arabic, Fulfulde, and Hausa languages.

== Reforms ==

=== Women rights ===
The first major revolutionary action that Danfodio took at the beginning of his mission was the mass education of women. The Shehu criticized ulama for neglecting half of human beings and ‘leaving them abandoned like beasts’ (Nur al-Albab, p. 10, quoted by Shagari &amp; Boyd, 1978, p. 39). He responded convincingly to objections raised against this (ibid. pp. 84-90) raised by Elkanemi of Borno.

He equally educated and taught his sons and his daughters who carried on his mission after him. Several of his daughters emerged as scholars and writers. Especially his daughter Nana Asma’u translated some of her father’s work into local languages.

It was particularly revolutionary at the time because Danfodio decided that women were to receive the exact kind of education as men and thus he placed them in the same classrooms.

=== Economic reforms ===
The Shehu strongly criticized the Hausa ruling elite for their heavy taxation and violation of the Muslim Law. He ‘condemned oppression, all unfairness, the giving and acceptance of bribes, the imposition of unfair taxes, the seizing of land by force, unauthorized grazing of other people’s crops, extraction of money from the poor, imprisonment on false charges and all other injustices (Shagari and Boyd, 1978, p. 15). The Shehu’s followers were required not to remain idle. They were encouraged to learn a craft in order to earn a living. It was considered improper to eat what one had not earned by one’s own efforts’. They engaged in various handcrafts to produce necessities of life (Shagari and Boyd, 1978. p. 18).

He argued for revival of just Islamic economic institutions such as al-hisbah, hima, bayt al-mal (State treasury), Zakat, Waqf, etc. Mostly his economic ideas are found in his work Bayan Wujub al-Hijrah `ala’-Ibad. Other works in which some economic ideas are found are Kitab al-Farq, Siraj al-Ikhwan, Bayan Bid`ah al-Shaytaniyah, Najm al-Ikhwan and Nur al-Ibad.

==== Economic system ====
The Shehu advocates foundation of an economic system based on values such as justice, sincerity, moderation, modesty, honesty, etc. According to him justice is the key for progress while injustice leads to decadence. A just government can last even with unbelief but it cannot endure with injustice(Dan Fodio, 1978, p. 142). On the other hand he warned against the unhealthy practices such as fraud, adulteration and extravagance and their bad consequences in the economy (Dan Fodio, 1978, p. 142). He exalted labour and hard work, and rejected begging. He encouraged his follower to engage in earning livelihood even through an ordinary occupation (Kani, 1984, pp. 86-87). Division of labour and cooperation occupy a very high place in his economic thought (Balogun, 1985, p. 30, quoted by Sule Ahmed Gusau, 1989). Property earned through fraudulent means would be confiscated and the funds obtained credited to the state treasury.

The Shehu was very emphatic on Fair market functioning. In his work Bayan al-Bid`ah al-Shaytaniyah (On Satanic Innovations) he forbade ignorant persons from dealing in market. It is for the sake of fairness in dealing in the market that he emphasized revival of the Hisba institutions whose functions include checking the prices, Inspection of the quality of goods, correct weights and measures, prevention of Fraud and Usurious practices, removal of Monopolisation of products, etc. (The Shehu’s work al-Bid`ah al-Shaytaniyah, quoted by Kani, p. 65).

==== Public expenditure ====
On public expenditure, the Shehu based his ideas on Ibn al-Juza’iy (d.741/1340) and al-Ghazali (d. 505-1111). In his treatise to the Emirs, Shehu emphasised expenditure on Defence by preparing armaments and by paying soldiers. If there remains anything, it goes to the judges, state officials, for the building of mosques and bridges and then it is divided among the poor. If any still remains, the Emir has the option of either giving it to the rich or keeping it (in the bayt al-mal) to deal with disasters that may occur (ibid. p. 131, quoted by Gusau, 1989, pp. 144-45).

According to the Shehu, the zakat al-fitr (poor due at the fast breaking) would be spent on the poor and the needy only. The state&#x27;s income is not exclusively for the poor. Nor is it necessary to spend equally on all heads of expenditure (Gusau, 1989, pp. 144-145).

=== Land reforms ===
All lands belong to the state. The Shehu declared all lands as Waqf, or owned by the entire community. However, the Sultan allocated land to individuals or families, as could an emir. Such land could be inherited by family members but could not be sold. Tax on land was introduced.

== Background to the Jihad ==

=== Origins and foundation ===
In 1780–the 1790s, Usman&#x27;s reputation increased as he appealed to justice and morality and rallied the outcasts of Hausa society. The Hausa peasants, slaves and preachers supported Usman, as well as the Toureg, Fulbe and Fulani pastoralists who are overtaxed and their cattle seized by powerful government officials. These pastoralist communities were led by the clerics living in rural communities who were Fulfulde speakers and closely connected to the pastoralists. Many of Usman&#x27;s followers later hold the most important offices of the new states. Usman&#x27;s jihad served to integrate several peoples into a single religious-political movement. The sultan responded violently to Danfodio&#x27;s Islamic Community. Some members of the Jama&#x27;a were imprisoned.

In the Shaykh’s book, “Tanbih al-ikhwan”, we get his brother’s account of why the Jihad began. This was narrated by Abdullah at the insistence of the Shaykh himself 

By the year 1788–89, The authority of Gobir began declining, as the power of the Shehu is increasing. Feeling threatened the 75-year old ailing Sultan of Gobir, Bawa Jan Gwarzo summoned Shehu at Magami during Eid al-Adha. All the scholars of the royal court joined Danfodio&#x27;s followers leaving the Sultan. Danfodio managed to win the famous 5 concessions. These are what Danfodio demanded;

# That all prisoners be free
# That anyman wearing the Turban (A symbol of Shehu&#x27;s Islamic Community - The Jama&#x27;a) be respected.
# To be allowed to call to God
# And none should be stopped from responding to the call.
# That his subjects should not be burdened with tax.

=== Conflict with Nafata ===
After Bawa&#x27;s death, the power of Gobir continue to decline due to battles with the neighbouring states. Yaaqub son of Bawa was killed in a battle, hostility between Gobir and Zamfara crystallised. In Zurmi,Ali Al-faris, the leader of the Alibawa Clan of Fulani was killed by the Gobirawa, the Alibawa will later join hands with the Shehu. The Zamafarawa too, who were recently subdued by the Gobirawa were again in revolt and Nafata lacked the power to put the revolt down. At home, the Shehu is getting massive followership at the expense of the Sultan.

In 1797–98, King Nafata of Gobir in trying to quel the power of the Shehu decided to delegalise some Islamic practices. He forbade &quot;Shaykhs&quot; to preach, the Islamic community from wearing turbans and veils (Hijab), prohibited conversions and ordered converts to Islam to return to their old religion. The proclamation thus reversed the policy of the Sultan of Gobir Bawa made ten years earlier. This was highly resented by Usman who wrote in his book &quot;Tanbih al-Ikhwan &#x27;ala away al-Sudan&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Government of Our Country and Neighboring Countries in Sudan&quot;) Usman wrote: &quot;The government of a country is the government of its king without question. If the king is a Muslim, his land is Muslim; if he is an unbeliever, his land is a land of unbelievers. In these circumstances, anyone must leave it for another country&quot;.

=== Assassination attempt ===
In 1802, Nafata&#x27;s successor Yunfa, a former student of Usman, turned against him, revoking Degel&#x27;s autonomy and attempting to assassinate Usman at Alkalawa. He captured some of Shehus followers as prisoners. After unsuccessful attempt, Yunfa then turned for aid to the other leaders of the Hausa states, warning them that Usman could trigger a widespread jihad., 

Yunfa at the end of his first year faced rebellion from Zamfara, Invasion by Katsina, the Sullubawa who are loyal to Katsina, and the Muslim Community who are becoming increasingly powerful and who are restive unde the moderation of the Shehu.

The crisis precipitated as a Gobir expedition returning to Alkalawa with Muslim prisoners was made to free them as it went up past Degel where the Muslim community is concentrated. Yunfa though not in the command of the expedition, could not overlook the challenge. Yunfa&#x27;s response was an attempt to kill the Sheikh. Yunfa&#x27;s forces attacked Gimbana and Muslims were taken as prisoners.

=== Exile/Emigration/Hijra ===
It is at this point that Danfodio wrote the book &quot;Masa&#x27;il muhimma&quot; where he stated the Obligation of emigration on persecuted Muslims. With the threat of attack from Gobir, the Muslim community had to reach out of Yunfa&#x27;s army. Though they were not prepared, they fled to Gudu, a journey of about four or five days, and a distance of about sixty miles. Not everybody could make the journey, the Tuareg scholar, Agali who is carrying Shehu&#x27;s books on top of camels and donkeys had to return to with camels to help in evacuation.

After they fled Degel, other Muslim communities across Hausaland began to join the migrating entourage of Danfodio. Muhammed Bello, went to Kebbi and other neighbouring states distributing Pamphlets calling Muslims out for the emigration (Hijrah). It is in this period that the book &quot;Wathiqat ahl-Sudan&quot; was circulated (a message to the people of Hausaland) containing brief instructions on what is islamically lawful and unlawful and what causes of action are compulsory for a Muslim as an individual an Muslims as a community. Emigrants continue to join the Shehu for months after the original hijrah, some coming with and without their families and belongings.

The king of Gobir worried about the depopulation of his kingdom tried to stop further emigration by harassing and confiscating the goods of the refuges but to no avail (p.24)

=== Notable companions ===
At Degel with the Shehu is hs father, Muhammad Fodiye, his elder brother, Ali and his younger brother, Abdullahi. 

Another notable personality is Umar Al-Kammu, his closest friend who accompanied him on the occasion of Yunfa&#x27;s assassination attempt. He was third after Abdullahi and Muhammed Bello in saluting Shehu as Commander of the Believers. He acted as a treasurer during the Jihad. He was present during the battle of Tsuntsua, but died before the Sheikh in Birnin Fulani near Zauma. His remains were later brought to Sokoto by Bello where he was buried near the Shehu.

The Scribes: In the book &quot;Raud Al-jinan,&quot;17 scribes were mentioned, notable among them are Al-Mustapha, the Chief scribe. Two are nicknamed Al-Maghribi, implying North African origin and another &quot;Malle&quot; indicating Malian ancestry.

The Imams: Notable among them is Imam Muhammad Sambo who died in the battle of Tsuntsua; Muezzin Ahmad Al-Sudani who died early in Sarma early in the Jihad; Muhammad Shibi; M. Mijji, Yero, etc.

Sulaiman Wodi: Sent with a letter to the Sarkin Gobir at the start of the Jihad. Later acted as a treasurer.

62 neighbours. When the Muslims went to Alkalawa to meet Bawa, there are said to be more than a thousand scholars with the Sheikh. At Tsuntsua, Bello said 2,000 died, 200 of them being memorisers of the Quran. 

Outside the circle of the Sheikh, 69 other scholars were mentioned in Raud Al-jinan, a third of them are likely Fulani or have Fulani names suggesting a Fulani origin.

On ethnic composition, Murray Last citing the book Rawd al-jinan, apart from the Shehus close community from Degel, 69 other scholars were mentioned, roughly a third are Fulani or have Fulani names which suggest Fulani origin, &quot;but the rationale of the list is not evident:most of the first thirty-four are identifiably connected with the Sokoto area, while 15 of the rest are identifiably unconnected&quot;

=== Declaration of Jihad ===

==== Emergence as the Commander of the Believers. ====
With negotiations between the Muslim Community and Gobir in a stalemate, an attack is therefore imminent, the Muslims prepared defences and elected a leader. Abdullahi dan Fodio&#x27;s name was put forward, alternative candidates were Umar Al-Kammu and Imam Muhammad Sambo, the later being Muhammed Bello&#x27;s choice. Usman&#x27;s followers entitled him the Commander of the Believers () and elected him as the leader. They also gave the title &quot;Sarkin Muslim&quot; (Head of Muslims) to Usman. The salute of allegiance was first given by Abdullahi dan Fodio, and then by Muhammed Bello. Danfodio was old (50 years) and weak and was to take no part in the fighting. The position was mere ceremonial (p. 24).

By April in the same year, the Muslim Community have mobilised in Gudu and were ready to face the emerging cavalry of Gobir. The call for Jihad have spread widely across Hausaland and even beyond as can be seen in this poem written by a Bornu scholar;

In the same year, Usman started the jihad and founded the Sokoto Caliphate. By this time, Usman had assembled a wide following among the Fulani, Hausa peasants and Toureg nomads. This made him a political as well as religious leader, giving him the authority to declare and pursue a jihad, raise an army and become its commander. There were widespread uprisings in Hausaland and its leadership was largely composed of the Fulani and widely supported by the Hausa peasantry, who felt over-taxed and oppressed by their rulers.

After Usman declared Jihad, he gathered an army of Hausa warriors to attack Yunfa&#x27;s forces in Tsuntua. Yunfa&#x27;s army, composed of Hausa warriors and Tuareg allies, defeated Usman&#x27;s forces and killed about 2,000 soldiers, 200 of whom were &quot;hafiz&quot; (memorizers of the Quran). Yunfa&#x27;s victory was short-lived as soon after, Usman captured Kebbi and Gwandu in the following year. At the time of the war, Fulani communications were carried along trade routes and rivers draining into the Niger-Benue valley, as well as the delta and the lagoons. The call for jihad reached not only other Hausa states such as Kano, Daura, Katsina and Zaria, but also Borno, Gombe, Adamawa and Nupe. These were all places with major or minor groups of Fulani &quot;alims&quot;.

=== The Battle of Tabkin Kwotto ===
The first skirmishes when a small group of soldiers from Gobir were beaten back (p.24). The Muslims went to capture Matankari and Konni, both important towns on their northern flank. The division of the Booty was not in accordance with Islamic law and for this reason, the Shehu appointed Umar Al-Kammu to serve as a treasure. 

The Muslim Community were warned of the approaching cavalry of Yunfa first by a Toureg nomad and secondly by some Fulani soldiers of Yunfa who escaped the cavalry. Yunfa first approached the Sullubawa for alliance before heading on.

On the strength of the Cavalry, Muhammed Bello said its a hundred cavalry strong consisting of mostly Tuaregs, Sullubawa and Gobirawa while Danfodio&#x27;s army consist of Hausa, Fulani, Konni Fulani who provide local support, Tuaregs under the leadership of Agali and Adar muslims including the son of Emir of Adar who also joined the Hijra (p. 27).

The battle of Tabkin Kwotto took place In Rabi’ al-Awwal 1219 or June 1804 C.E., the heavily armed Gobir forces under Yunfa met the ill-equipped and smaller army of the Jama’a under the commendarship of Abdullah. Though the muslims are smaller, ill-equipped with only a few horses and bows, they were helped by geographical factors. On one flank, they are covered by a river which now had water due to rainy season. The ground though flat is covered in thick forest as well. The advantage in morale was also high; facing destruction if they are captured.

By the lake Kwotto near Gurdam, not far from Gudu. Soon after the battle broke out, the Muslims were able to defeat the Gobir forces, who were then forced to flee. Abdullah describes how he shadowed the Gobir army for days, trying to bring it to battle, yet they were reluctant to meet him on a battleground of his choosing. With a plan to get behind him and cut his line of retreat, the Gobir army moved west to of his army and took up a position near Lake Kwotto (Tabkin Kwotto in Hausa), on hilly ground with a cover of thicket in their front, which they were counting on to keep the Muslims at bay. Beyond the thicket laid an open ground which the cavalry needed to ride down the Muslims. They then waited there for the night, expecting an easy win against the Muslims the next day. Abdullah who had figured out the plan and had confidence in his army’s mobility and good shooting prowess of his archers, decided to fight them at the lake. Here, the Muslim army piously performed prayers, promising themselves to death or victory in the bloody battle area.

The battle began around midday with a leading assault from Abdullah, the battle then quickly evolved into bloody hand-to-hand combat, waged with axes, swords and short ranged archery. By noon, the Gobirawa had had enough, they turned around, hoping to flee. Yunfa himself, quickly fleed away from the field of battle. This battle boosted the morale of the muslim community. Abdullah further wrote letters inviting other muslims to join the victorious fighters. With this, the Muslim army received a huge wave of reinforcements from initial bystanders.

==== Food scarcity ====
The rains of 1804 have already started but food supply before the year&#x27;s harvest were still low. The local villagers were hostile and unwilling to sell Maize to the muslim community. When a source of food is finished the only alternative is to move to a new area. According to Murray Last, The campaigns of the Jihad explicable in these terms; the search for food, in addition pasture and water for the cattles.

After the success at Tabkin Kwotto, some local kings started aligning themselves with the Shehu notable among them were the leaders of Mafara, Burmi and Donko leaving only the Sarki of Gummi in South-Western Zamfara to support Gobir. They knew the Shehu 20 years previously when he was on his preaching tours in Zamfara. They sent traders with food to the Muslim Community, but according to Muhammed Bello, their friendship was due to their hostility with Gobir than there adherence to Islam or the need for reform. (p. 27). Still the issue of food scarcity wasn&#x27;t solved. The peasentry were losing their patience.

=== The Battle of Tsuntsua ===
With the harvest in October 1804, the first set of the aggressive campaign began, able to retreat out of the valleys into scrubland, they were safe against cavalry attack. They gain more freedom of movement, they therefore move to the hinterland of the Gobir capital, Alkalawa.

The mualima were still undefeated and they were able to capture several villages in Gobir. A mediation attempt by Sarki of Gummi was unsuccessful as the Muslims are now strong enough to dictate terms of any agreement. They demanded that the Yunfa come in person to the Sheikh. 

The Muslims continued to gain allies. The Gobir army started to attack their Sullubawa allies since some started to favour the Shehu. On the borders of Adar and Gobir, a group of Muslims under Tuareg Agali have been fighting. In South-eastern Gobir, in the old Zamfara, the Muslims had further allies; the Alibanawa Fulani who had suffered in the hands of Gobir.

It was in the month of Ramadan, With the Muslim&#x27;s camp now less than a day&#x27;s journey to the capital, and dispersed in search of food, the Gobir army with their Tuareg allies launched a counterattack at Tsuntsua, two miles from the capital. According to Muhammed Bello, the Muslims lost about 2000 people, 200 of which knew the Qur&#x27;an by heart. Muhammed Bello was sick while Abdullahi dan Fodio was wounded in the leg. Among the dead were relatives of Shehu like Imam Muhammad Samo, Zaid bin Muhammad Sa&#x27;ad and Mahmud Gurdam.

After the defeat at Tsuntsua, the Muslims stayed the rest of Ramadan in the valley before starting upriver towards Zamfara in January and February in search of food. 

==== The capture of Kebbi ====
Somewhere in Southern Zamfara, the Muslims had established friends. Though the Zamfarawa were largely pagans, they are more hostile to the Gobirawa than to the Muslims. Some 50 years back, the Gobirawa had sacked Zamfara and had been overrunning the country, driving out the Zamfarawa refugees.

At first the expedition at Sabon Gari was against Kebbi and Gobir and later against local towns in Zamfara. The Kebbi expedition was under the Vizier Abdullahi and Ali Jedo, the Commander of the Army. The Kebbi capital was taken and the Kebbawa fled North upriver. Kebbi was a strategic place as it now allows the next move to Gwandu possible and allows a permanent settlement to be founded there, ending the Muslim&#x27;s long tedious treks. Meanwhile from Sabon Gari, expeditions were sent partly to collect food and partly to make the country safer for the Muslims.

With Kebbi now under Muslim control and with their base secure, the Muslims could continue the main war against Gobir with less risk of repeating the disaster at Tsuntsua (p.34)

=== The Battle of Alwassa ===
Soon after the arrival at Gwandu, the Muslims faced a combined attack of Gobirawa, Tuareg and Kebbawa pagans. The Muslims here too lost about a thousand men according to Muhammed Bello but once the attack was pressed over Gwandu, the rougher terrain favoured the Muslims and hindered the camels of the Tuaregs and soon the Muslims drove the invaders off.

=== Expansion of the Jihad ===

The defeat of Gobir alerted many of the Hausa kings and chiefs, and many of them began a strong assault on the Islamic communities in their territories. Meanwhile, a commercial embargo was placed on the town of Gudu and its surroundings. It was here that the ties of the Shehu with Zamfara came into play. Although, it was pointed out that the amity of Zamfara was due to their enmity with Gobir and not born out of adherence to Islam. 

After the battle of Kwotto, it became evident that the Jihad was now no longer a matter of defense against Gobir, but a matter of saving the cause of Islam, which the Hausa kings were set to destroy. Considering this, the Shaykh appointed fourteen leaders and sent them back to their respective territories and communities, to lead their people in Jihad against their enemies who had assaulted them. It was these developments that led to the major spread of Islam all over Hausa land and even parts of Bornu.

By 1808, Usman had defeated the rulers of Gobir, Kano, Katsina and other Hausa Kingdoms. After only a few years, Usman found himself in command of the states. The Sokoto Caliphate had become the largest state south of the Sahara at the time. In 1812, the caliphate&#x27;s administration was reorganized, with Usman&#x27;s son Muhammed Bello and brother Abdullahi dan Fodio carrying on the jihad and administering the western and eastern governance respectively. Around this time, Usman returned to teaching and writing about Islam. Usman also worked to establish an efficient government grounded in Islamic law.

The Sokoto Caliphate was a combination of an Islamic state and a modified Hausa monarchy. Muhammed Bello introduced Islamic administration, Muslim judges, market inspectors and prayer leaders were appointed, and an Islamic tax and land system were instituted with revenues on the land considered &quot;kharaj&quot; and the fees levied on individual subjects called jizya, as in classical Islamic times. The Fulani cattle-herding nomads were sedentarized and converted to sheep and goat raising as part of an effort to bring them under the rule of Muslim law. Mosques and Madrassahs were built to teach the populace, Islam. The state patronized large numbers of religious scholars or mallams. Sufism became widespread. Arabic, Hausa and Fulfulde languages saw a revival of poetry, and Islam was taught in Hausa and Fulfulde.

== Death ==
In 1815, Usman moved to Sokoto, where Bello built him a house in the western suburbs. Usman died in the same city on 20 April 1817, at the age of 62. After his death, his son Muhammed Bello, succeeded his as &quot;amir al-mu&#x27;minin&quot; and became the second caliph of the Sokoto Caliphate. Usman&#x27;s brother Abdullahi was given the title &quot;Emir of Gwandu&quot; and was placed in charge of the Western Emirates of Nupe. Thus, all Hausa states, parts of Nupe and Fulani outposts in Bauchi and Adamawa were all ruled by a single political-religious system. By 1830, the jihad had engulfed most of what are now Northern-Nigeria and the northern Cameroon. From the time of Usman ɗan Fodio to the British conquest at the beginning of the 20th-century there were twelve caliphs.

== Legacy ==
Usman has been viewed by Encyclopedia Britannica as the most important reforming leader of the 19th century Western Sudan. Muslims view him as a &quot;Mujaddid&quot; (renewer of the faith). Many of the people led by Usman ɗan Fodio were unhappy that the rulers of the Hausa states were mingling Islam with aspects of the traditional regional religion. Usman created a theocratic state with a stricter interpretation of Islam. In &quot;Tanbih al-ikhwan &#x27;ala ahwal al-Sudan&quot;, he wrote: &quot;As for the sultans, they are undoubtedly unbelievers, even though they may profess the religion of Islam, because they practice polytheistic rituals and turn people away from the path of God and raise the flag of a worldly kingdom above the banner of Islam. All this is unbelief according to the consensus of opinions&quot;.
In &quot;Islam outside the Arab World&quot;, David Westerlund wrote: &quot;The jihad resulted in a federal theocratic state, with extensive autonomy for emirates, recognizing the spiritual authority of the caliph or the sultan of Sokoto&quot;.
Usman addressed in his books what he saw as the flaws and demerits of the African non-Muslim or nominally Muslim rulers. Some of the accusations he made were corruption at various levels of the administration and neglect of the rights of ordinary people. Usman also criticized heavy taxation and obstruction of the business and trade of the Hausa states by the legal system.
Dan Fodio believed in a state without written constitution, which was based on the Quran, the Sunnah and the ijma.

== Personal life ==
Usman ɗan Fodio was described as well over , lean and looked like his mother Sayda Hauwa. His brother Abdullahi dan Fodio (1761–1829) was also over in height and was described as looking more like their father Muhammad Fodio, with darker skin and a portly physique later in life.

In &quot;Rawd al-Janaan&quot; (The Meadows of Paradise), Waziri Gidado ɗan Laima (1777–1851) listed ɗan Fodio&#x27;s wives as his first cousin Maymuna and Aisha ɗan Muhammad Sa&#x27;d. With Maymuna he had 11 children, including Aliyu (1770s–1790s) and the twins Hasan (1793– November 1817) and Nana Asmaʼu (1793–1864). Aisha was also known as &quot;Gaabdo&quot; (&#x27;Joy&#x27; in Fulfulde) and as &quot;Iyya Garka&quot; (Hausa for &#x27;Lady of the House/Compound&#x27;). She was famed for her Islamic knowledge and for being the matriarch of the family. She outlived her husband by many decades. Among others, she was the mother of Muhammad Sa&#x27;d (1777 – before 1800).

== Writings ==
Usman ɗan Fodio &quot;wrote hundreds of works on Islamic sciences ranging from creed, Maliki jurisprudence, hadith criticism, poetry and Islamic spirituality&quot;, the majority of them being in Arabic. He also penned about 480 poems in Arabic, Fulfulde and Hausa.

== In fiction ==
Usman ɗan Fodio appears as a playable character in the 2020 video game &quot;Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition&quot;.

<text>Shelton Brooks (May 4, 1886September 6, 1975) was a Canadian-born American composer and performer of popular music and jazz. He was known for his ragtime and vaudeville style, and wrote some of the biggest hits of the first third of the 20th century; including &quot;Some of These Days&quot; and &quot;At the Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;. He composed &quot;Some of These Days&quot; at the Pekin Theatre.

==Early life and education==
Brooks was born in Amherstburg, Canada in 1886. His father was a preacher, and Brooks taught himself music on their church&#x27;s pump organ. His family moved to Detroit, Michigan, in 1901 and that was where Brooks first made a name for himself in music and comedy. While he never learned to read music, his works were highly sought after for their brash style, which contrasted the previous restrictive styles of Victorian era music. Towards the end of his life, his style of music had lost popularity.

==Career==
Brooks sang, played piano, and performed on the vaudeville circuit (notably, as a Bert Williams imitator) as well as having a successful songwriting career. His first hit song was &quot;Some of These Days&quot;, which he was able to get to headliner Sophie Tucker in 1909. Tucker adopted it as her theme song, and performed it regularly for the next 55 years.

He starred in several 1920s musicalcomedies. He appeared in the cast of Lew Leslie&#x27;s Plantation Revue, which was opened in 1922. After the sudden death of his partner Florence Mills in 1927, he stopped appearing in stage shows and pursued a nightclub act. He had a radio show on the CBS network in the 1930s, and he is also credited as a contributor to the music featured in the 1932 film &quot;Harlem Is Heaven&quot;. In the 1940s he became a regular in Ken Murray&#x27;s &quot;Blackouts&quot;, a long-running salute to burlesque that played in both New York and Los Angeles, California.

Brooks sang and provided piano accompaniments on records with vocalists Ethel Waters and Sara Martin.

==Discography==
Brooks&#x27; works include &quot;Some of These Days&quot;, &quot;At the Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;, &quot;I Wonder Where My Easy Rider&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;Every Day&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in France&quot;, &quot;Swing That Thing&quot;, &quot;That Man of Mine&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time&quot;.

He also composed &quot;Honey Gal, You Aint Talkin&#x27; to Me&quot; and &quot;If I Were a Bee and You Were a Red, Red Rose&quot;.

==History==
===Founding of Loyola===
The university was originally known as St. Vincent&#x27;s College for Boys, founded and run by the Vincentians until 1911. The university served as the first institution of higher learning in Southern California. In 1865, the Vincentian Fathers were commissioned by Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi to found the school in Los Angeles. Father John Asmuth was the first President Rector. Classes were held for two years in the Lugo Adobe on the east side of the Plaza while a new campus building remained under construction. The historic building, donated by Don Vicente Lugo, was one of few two-story adobes in the city at the time, standing across Alameda Street between the Plaza and Union Station (near Olvera Street).

The new 7th Street campus, a stone building now called St. Vincent&#x27;s Place, encompassed a block bounded by Fort (Broadway), 6th, Hill, and 7th streets. In 1869, St. Vincent&#x27;s was accredited by the state. In 1887, the college moved to a new campus, bordered by Grand Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Hope Street, and 18th. The campus had a chapel, residence hall, cottages, and traditional brick-and-ivy complex housing classrooms and lecture halls. The new campus retained a tall, central tower topped with St. Vincent&#x27;s trademark mansard roof.

Alongside campus expansion, the athletic program grew, and the Catholic Collegiates competed against Occidental College&#x27;s Presbyterians and the University of Southern California&#x27;s Methodists. St. Vincent&#x27;s athletes were also recruited into professional sports. During this era, from St. Vincent&#x27;s College graduated numerous notable alumni, including Isidore Dockweiler, Eugene Biscailuz and Leo Carrillo.

In 1911, the Vincentians left educational ministry. Bishop Thomas Conaty appointed the Jesuits as the Vincentians replacement. The group moved the college to a larger property and renamed the school Los Angeles College. The campus consisted of several bungalows at Avenue 52, Highland Park, Los Angeles. The old campus became St. Vincent&#x27;s School. In 1922, St. Vincent&#x27;s campus was sold. Over time, the historic buildings of old St. Vincent&#x27;s College have been torn down and replaced by developments such as the Grand Olympic Auditorium (1924) and parking lots. Father Richard A. Gleeson was the first Jesuit president of the institution.

Rapid growth prompted the Jesuits to seek a new campus on Venice Boulevard in 1917. Graduate instruction began in 1920 with the foundation of a separate law school, the only program into which women were admitted. The law school was the second in Los Angeles after USC to admit Jewish students. In 1928, the undergraduate division of Loyola relocated to the present Westchester campus in 1930, becoming Loyola University of Los Angeles. Loyola Law School did not move with the rest of the university, but in 1964 was reestablished at a Frank Gehry-designed campus in downtown Los Angeles.

As enrollment dropped during World War II, University President Father Edward Whelan brokered a deal with the US Army to form an officer training program for both Army and Navy officers. The contract allowed the university to remain open during the war. Enrollment hit all-time highs as returning veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill in the mid-to-late 1940s. During World War II, President Whelan was openly critical of the treatment of Japanese Americans and the establishment of Japanese internment camps. 

In 1949, Father Charles Cassassa was named president. His work included the formation of a graduate division on the Westchester campus in June 1950. As well as the establishment of the Teacher Education Program during the preceding two years. Cassassa also expanded campus infrastructure and established the Institute of Human Relations to promote improved racial relations in business and government. In 1950, he ordered the school&#x27;s football team to forfeit an away game against Texas Western since the school&#x27;s rules prevented African-American players, including Loyola team member Bill English, to play on their field. Loyola University also continued as an all-male school until its merger with Marymount College in 1973, with several notable exceptions.

At the time of the 1965 Watts riots, Loyola and Marymount were predominantly white institutions. In response to the riots and the evolving local civil rights movement, Black students organized a Black students&#x27; union in 1968. In response, Loyola president Charles S. Casassa issued policies on &#x27;unlawful student protests&#x27;. Despite stonewalling from Casassa, the Black Student Union of Loyola pledged that it would &quot;work through established channels, to dialogue, and to present our case in an intelligent, cohesive, and non-violent fashion.&quot; When the campus newspaper &quot;The Loyolan&quot; surveyed students, most were generally supportive of introducing inclusive courses such as Black history.

===Founding of Marymount===

The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary began teaching local young women in 1923. After invitation by Bishop John Cantwell, seven sisters of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, led by Mother Cecilia Rafter, formed an elementary school which developed into Marymount High School. Within a decade, high student demand prompted the Marymount sisters to open Marymount Junior College in Westwood in 1933.

Mother Gertrude Cain was the first president of the junior college and guided its development into a four-year college. In 1948, the college assumed the name Marymount College of Los Angeles. In 1960, having outgrown its shared Westwood campus, Marymount College moved its programs to the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwestern Los Angeles, becoming Marymount California University.

In 1967 Sister Raymunde McKay, president of Marymount College, alongside Sister Mary Felix Montgomery General Superior of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange, merged Marymount College with St. Joseph College of Orange. St. Joseph College was originally formed as St. Joseph Teacher&#x27;s College, a junior college affiliated with The Catholic University of America in 1953. In 1959 it was incorporated as an autonomous, four-year institution, and assumed the St. Joseph College name. However, in 1968 Marymount and St. Joseph&#x27;s Colleges merged under the Marymount name with an agreement that the traditions and heritage of both the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange would be retained.

Subsequently, the institution was renamed Marymount College of Orange. During the academic year, it remained a college for women religious seeking their baccalaureate degrees; college courses were offered to men and women during the summers at the Orange campus. However, in the same year, Marymount College began its affiliation with Loyola University, moving its four-year program at the Palos Verdes campus to the Westchester campus of Loyola University.

===Loyola-Marymount merger and expansion===
By the mid-1960s, Loyola University of Los Angeles had unsuccessfully petitioned the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal James Francis McIntyre, to allow coeducation for several years. In 1967, McIntyre permitted Sister McKay to begin an affiliation with Loyola University. In 1968 when Marymount&#x27;s baccalaureate program moved to Loyola&#x27;s Westchester campus; this arrangement of two independent schools on one campus continued for five years. In 1970, the Student Governments of Loyola University (ASLU—Associated Students of Loyola University) and Marymount College (ASMC—Associated Students of Marymount College) joined to form the Associated Students of Loyola and Marymount (ASLM).

Loyola University and Marymount College officially merged and assumed the name Loyola Marymount University in 1973. The expanded university retained its roots of Catholic higher education and incorporated the educational traditions of the Jesuits, Marymount sisters, and Orange sisters into one institution. The ASLM became known as the Associated Students of Loyola Marymount University (ASLMU). Father Donald Merrifield, who first assumed the presidency of Loyola University in 1969, continued his role after the merger. The academic vice president of Marymount College, Sister Renee Harrangue, became the provost. During Father Merrifield&#x27;s tenure, thirteen new buildings were constructed on Loyola Marymount&#x27;s main campus. Father Merrifield oversaw the expansion of Loyola Law School&#x27;s campus in Pico-Union, near downtown Los Angeles. Merrifield and the university commissioned architect Frank Gehry to design the new campus, which was needed to accommodate increased enrollment.

Merrifield also implemented a number of programs to increase minority enrollment, such as financial aid packages and scholarships, and added African American and Latino studies programs. He stepped down as president of Loyola Marymount in 1984, but remained the university&#x27;s chancellor until 2002.

===Recent history===
In 2007, the university reestablished its presence in Orange County, California when the Theological Studies Department began offering a two-year master&#x27;s program in Pastoral Theology in Orange, California. The first cohort graduated in the spring of 2009 with three additional cohorts completing a three-year master&#x27;s degree in Pastoral Theology until the cohort program ended in 2018. The classes were held in the Marywood offices of the Diocese of Orange and then at the Diocese&#x27;s Christ Cathedral campus, each nearby the former Orange Campus of the university.


In 2010, Loyola Marymount President, Father Robert B. Lawton, announced his retirement. Lawton cited health problems, including a slow recovery from a 2009 back surgery, as the main reason for his departure. He had served as president since 1999.

David W. Burcham became the first lay president in the school&#x27;s history. Burcham held the office from 2010 to 2015. Timothy Law Snyder became the 16th president in 2015.

==Campus==
LMU is located on the Del Rey Hills in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles. It overlooks the former site of Hughes Aircraft. The original were donated to the university by Harry Culver, a prominent real-estate developer. Xavier Hall, named for St. Francis Xavier, and St. Robert&#x27;s Hall, named after St. Robert Bellarmine, a cardinal and Doctor of the Church, were the first two buildings to be built on the current Westchester Campus. Following their completion in 1929, Xavier Hall housed both the Jesuit Faculty and the students at the time while St. Robert&#x27;s Hall served as the academic and administrative building.

Sacred Heart Chapel and the Regents Bell Tower were the next non-residential structures to be built on the campus (1953–55). The Malone Student Center, named after Lorenzo M. Malone, an alumnus of the university and former dean of students and treasurer of the university, was completed in 1958 and renovated in 1996. LMU now houses 36 academic, athletic, administrative, and event facilities as well as twelve on-campus residence halls and six on-campus apartment complexes. The campus houses four large open grass areas not reserved exclusively for athletic play.

LMU acquired the building in January 2000 from Raytheon, which bought Hughes Aircraft. LMU completed the interior remodel in April 2001. The building, which houses the university&#x27;s Bellarmine College of Liberal Arts, is constructed of steel and concrete and is divided into seven structures above ground.

In 2022 &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked LMU as having the fourth-most beautiful campus in America. CampusSqueeze college e-zine ranked LMU as having the third-most beautiful campus in America.

The university cabinet consists of: the president, executive vice president &amp; provost, senior vice president &amp; chief academic officer (under whose direction the deans of the Bellarmine College of Liberal Arts, College of Business Administration, College of Communication and Fine Arts, Seaver College of Science and Engineering, School of Education, School of Film and Television, and University Libraries operate), senior vice president for administration, senior vice president &amp; chief financial officer, senior vice president for student affairs, senior vice president for university relations, and senior vice president Fritz B. Burns Dean of Loyola Law School.

The Jesuit Community is headed by a rector (appointed by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus); the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary are led by local coordinator who report to the provincial superior of the Western American Province; and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange are led by a local superior who reports to the general superior of their congregation. Each of the three sponsoring religious communities is represented on the board of trustees.

==Sponsoring religious orders==
LMU is sponsored primarily by three religious orders that have long been associated with education, the Society of Jesus, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange.

===Society of Jesus===
LMU is home to around 35 Jesuits holding various positions in administrative, staff, and faculty positions.

===Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary===
The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary also house several religious sisters adjacent campus. From 1968 until 1999 the sisters lived on campus in the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center. In 1999, they donated the building to the university and moved into residential houses off campus. The Western American provincial center, which had been in the Leavey center, was moved to Montebello. The Marymount Sisters sponsor the Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts which attempts to preserve the transformative educational tradition of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and promotes a dialogue between faith and culture as expressed in fine, performing, literary and communication arts.

==Campus ministry==

Loyola Marymount&#x27;s Office of Campus Ministry is a component to the promotion of the university&#x27;s mission and identity. Founded in 1911 as the University Chaplain, this division became known as Campus Ministry in 1973 with a stipulation that the Director would be a Jesuit. By 1986 this requirement was waived when Sr. Margaret Mary Dolan, R.S.H.M. became the director. Dolan, an alumna of Marymount College&#x27;s class of 1958, received her Master&#x27;s from LMU in 1974 and also served the university as a campus minister, director of alumni relations, residence hall minister, and alumni chaplain since 1973.

In 2008, as part of the university&#x27;s Centennial Capital Campaign, it was announced that an $8 million fundraising goal was set to endow the office as the &quot;Peg Dolan, RSHM Campus Ministry Center&quot; in honor of Dolan&#x27;s contributions to the university. The same year, the university asked her to address the class of 2008 at the undergraduate commencement exercises and she was awarded an honorary doctorate. At the dedication ceremony in September 2008, over 700 alumni returned to campus to honor her legacy at the university. When Dolan died in 2009, more than 1,000 people returned to campus for two days of liturgies celebrating her life.

Located at the north end of the university, Sacred Heart Chapel is the main worship space on campus. A basilica-style church, Sacred Heart has two side altars and the Mary chapel, which is located behind the crucifix, in addition to the main chapel space. The chapel is lined by tall stained-glass windows.

==Academy of Catholic Thought and Imagination==
The Academy of Catholic Thought and Imagination (ACTI) at Loyola Marymount University is a hub for scholarship, interdisciplinary research, pedagogy, and outreach on LMU&#x27;s campus and in the southwest United States. ACTI sponsors and co-sponsors events, supports interdisciplinary dialogue within the university, and publishes academic work promoting its mission. Founded in April 2014 and Directed by Dr. Brian Treanor, ACTI has been sponsoring and organizing events since April 2015.

==The Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts==
Founded in 1991, the Marymount Institute encourages interdisciplinary and intercultural scholarly and artistic activity in the form of research, publication, exhibits, performances, conferences, seminars, and lectures.

2008 saw the opening of the Marymount Institute Press. Itself an imprint of Tsehai Publishers and Distributors, the MIP was founded by the Ethiopian-born journalist, publisher, and social activist, Elias Wondimu, and already has two publications to its credit: &quot;Panim el Panim: Facing Genesis, Visual Midrash&quot; and &quot;A Journey into Love: Meditating with Piers Plowman&quot;.

The President&#x27;s Marymount Institute Professor in Residence is Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka.

==Athletics==

Athletic teams at Loyola Marymount are known as Lions; the school&#x27;s primary athletic affiliation is with the West Coast Conference. While LMU has had success in several sports, it is probably best remembered for its men&#x27;s basketball teams between 1985 and 1990, with Paul Westhead as coach and for the death of star player Hank Gathers (#44), who collapsed during the second round of the WCC tournament on March 4, 1990, and for his friendship with teammate Bo Kimble (#30). Their jerseys have been retired at LMU.

Especially well-remembered was the 1990 team, led by Gathers and Kimble until tragedy struck in the WCC tournament. Gathers collapsed during a game and died due to a previously diagnosed heart condition. Playing for their fallen teammate, the Lions advanced to the Elite Eight (regional final) of the NCAA tournament before falling to eventual champions UNLV.

The primary indoor athletic facility is the Gersten Pavilion.
Former Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitcher C. J. Wilson attended and pitched at Loyola Marymount in 2001. LMU Softball holds many records. It owns more titles than any other PCSC (Pacific Coast Softball Conference) team, with three in 2003, 2005, and 2007. In 2007, Tiffany Pagano and LMU beat UCLA 4–2 in the Los Angeles regional in the NCAA Tournament, to mark their first win over the Bruins, and the first time that UCLA had not won a regional and advanced to the Women&#x27;s College World Series.

In January 2024, Loyola Marymount announced that it would cut six athletic programs after the 202324 season: men&#x27;s cross-country, men&#x27;s rowing, men&#x27;s track and field, women&#x27;s rowing, women&#x27;s swimming, and women&#x27;s track and field.

==Student government==
ASLMU, The Associated Students of Loyola Marymount University, is the functioning student government. The government body is composed of an Executive Branch, composed of the Management Team and Cabinet Departments; a Legislative Branch, composed of the Senate; and a Judicial Branch, composed of the Judicial Committee. The only elected positions are those of the President, Vice President and the Senate. Unlike the senators, the President and Vice President have a limited term of two years.

==Student media==

===&quot;The Los Angeles Loyolan&quot;===
The &quot;Los Angeles Loyolan&quot; newspaper has been published for 100 years. As of 2020, publication is completely digital.

The paper is supported by its advertising department, which has historically paid from 80% to 100% of the cost of publication. Its regular sections include News, Opinion, Sports, Social Justice, and Life+Arts. Special sections include Business, Travel, Cartoon and the parody section, named The Bluff after LMU&#x27;s distinctive landmark.

In August 2013, the student staff of the &quot;Loyolan&quot; took the publication to a digital-focused format.

===&quot;Tower Yearbook&quot;===
Over the years, the Loyola University Los Angeles yearbook was known by several titles, including the Lair Annual. After the merger the university began publishing the annual &quot;Tower Yearbook&quot; which is financed through a mandatory annual student yearbook fee (collected along with tuition).

In 2016, the National Scholastic Press Association awarded the Tower yearbook the Pacemaker Award. SEEK, the winning issue was headed by Mali McGuire the editor-in-chief for the year. The 2015-16 yearbook was also awarded the Gold Crown by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.

In 2024 at Associated College Press Best of Show Awards, the Tower Yearbook won first prize for Yearbook Design and third prize for Best Yearbook.

=== &quot;LMU Magazine&quot; ===
LMU Magazine is a national award-winning university magazine that has earned more than 90 awards. 

===ROAR Studios===
ROAR Studios is the newest student media on-campus. It provides a forum for student produced programming to be broadcast both via the on-campus cable TV system.

== Service organizations ==

===Center for Service and Action===
CSA also oversees LMU&#x27;s student service organizations. The ten service organizations work to help the university and surrounding community of Los Angeles. The members of these organizations make themselves available for on-campus service as well as on-going commitments to serve at specific non-profit agencies in Southern California. Each organization has a moderator and a chaplain.

=== Emergency Medical Services ===
LMU EMS is the on-campus emergency medical services program, consisting of volunteer full-time undergraduate students who are nationally certified EMTs. The organization is 1 of 27 active members of the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation (NCEMSF) and the first collegiate EMS group on the West Coast, founded in 1986. LMU EMS responds to between 300-500 medical calls on the LMU Westchester campus during the academic year, whenever the campus health clinic is closed, which establishes 24/7 medical coverage of the campus during the school year, serving more than 10,000 work hours annually. As a non-transporting agency, LMU EMS works with the Los Angeles Fire Department for transportation of patients to local emergency departments. LMU EMS was honored as the smallest school to win NCEMSF&#x27;s Organization of the Year award and Debbie Wilson, the program&#x27;s founder, was also the first woman to win NCEMSF&#x27;s Collegiate EMS Advisor of the Year award. The program has also won nine university-wide awards, and four national awards.

==Fraternities and sororities==
The sorority and fraternity community at Loyola Marymount University consists of 20 chapters – 10 sororities and 10 fraternities. More than 1,500 students (25 percent of the total campus population) are reported to be involved in the Greek community.

<text>Back in Black is the seventh studio album by Australian rock band AC/DC, released on 25 July 1980, by Albert Productions and Atlantic Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Brian Johnson as lead singer, following the death of their previous vocalist Bon Scott.

After the commercial breakthrough of their 1979 album &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, AC/DC was planning to record a follow-up, but in February 1980, Scott died from alcohol poisoning after a drinking binge. The remaining members of the group considered disbanding, but ultimately chose to continue on and recruited Johnson, who had previously been the vocalist for Geordie.

The album was composed by Johnson and brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, and recorded over seven weeks in the Bahamas from April to May 1980 with producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who had also produced &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. Following its completion, the group mixed &quot;Back in Black&quot; at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The album&#x27;s all-black cover was designed as a &quot;sign of mourning&quot; for Scott.

&quot;Back in Black&quot; was an unprecedented commercial and critical success. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in music history. AC/DC supported the album with a yearlong world tour that cemented them among the most popular music acts of the early 1980s. It has since been included on numerous &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists. On 21 August 2024, the album was certified 27× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it the third best-selling album in the United States and the best-selling album that never reached the top spot on the American charts.

==Background==

Formed in 1973, AC/DC first broke into international markets in 1977 with their fourth album, &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, and by 1979 they were poised for greater success with their sixth studio album, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. Producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange helped to make the band&#x27;s sound more catchy and accessible, and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; became their first gold album in the United States, selling over 500,000 copies, while also peaking at number 17 on that country&#x27;s pop charts and number eight in the United Kingdom.

As the new decade approached, the group set off for the UK and France for the final leg of the Highway to Hell Tour, planning to begin recording their next album shortly after playing those dates. On 19 February 1980, vocalist Bon Scott went on a drinking binge in a London pub that caused him to lose consciousness, so a friend let him rest in the back of his Renault 5 overnight. The next morning, Scott was found unresponsive and rushed to King&#x27;s College Hospital, where medical personnel pronounced him dead on arrival. The coroner ruled that pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott&#x27;s death, but the official cause was listed on the death certificate as &quot;acute alcoholic poisoning&quot; and classified as &quot;death by misadventure&quot;. Scott was cremated, and his ashes were interred by his family at Fremantle Cemetery in Fremantle, Western Australia. The loss devastated the band, who considered breaking up, but friends and family (particularly Scott’s) persuaded them to carry on.

After Scott&#x27;s funeral on 1 March, the band immediately began auditions for a replacement frontman. At the advice of Lange, they brought in Geordie singer Brian Johnson, who impressed the group. The band begrudgingly worked through the rest of the list of applicants in the following days, and then brought Johnson back for a second rehearsal. On 29 March, to Johnson&#x27;s surprise, Malcolm Young called the singer to offer him the job.

==Recording and production==

As AC/DC commenced writing new material for the followup to &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, vocalist Bon Scott, who began his career as a drummer with The Spektors, played the drums on demo recordings of &quot;Let Me Put My Love into You&quot; and &quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot;. In a 2021 interview with &quot;Paste&quot;, Angus Young claimed this was the full extent of Scott&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Back in Black&quot; (though, at this point, he said the demos on which Scott played drums were of &quot;Hells Bells&quot; and &quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot;).

Three weeks of rehearsals for &quot;Back in Black&quot; were scheduled at London&#x27;s E-Zee Hire Studios, but the rehearsals were cut to one week when an opening came up at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, in the Bahamas. Although the band had wanted to record their next effort in the UK, there were no studios available, and the Bahamas presented a nice tax advantage, so &quot;Back in Black&quot; was recorded at Compass Point from mid-April to May 1980 with producer &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. Johnson recalled that &quot;It was hardly any kind of studio, we were in these little concrete cells, comfy mind, you had a bed and a chair. And this big old black lady ran the whole place. Oh, she was fearsome, she ruled that place with a rod of iron. We had to lock the doors at night because she&#x27;d warned us about these Haitians who&#x27;d come down at night and rob the place. So she bought us all these six-foot fishing spears to keep at the fucking door! It was a bit of a stretch from Newcastle, I can tell you.&quot;

Around the time of the band&#x27;s arrival in the Bahamas, the area was hit by several tropical storms, which wreaked havoc on the electricity at Compass Point. Johnson referenced the bad weather on the opening lines of &quot;Hells Bells&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m rolling thunder, pourin&#x27; rain. I&#x27;m comin&#x27; on like a hurricane. My lightning&#x27;s flashing across the sky. You&#x27;re only young but you&#x27;re gonna die.&quot; In addition, some of the group&#x27;s equipment was initially held up by customs, while other gear was slowly freighted over from the UK.

Having never recorded with the group, Johnson felt pressure during the process, and he also reported having trouble adjusting to the environment. Lange focused particular attention on Johnson&#x27;s vocals, demanding perfection out of each take.

The general attitude during recording was optimistic, though engineer Tony Platt was dismayed to find the rooms at Compass Point were not sonically complementary to the group&#x27;s sound, which was designed to be very dry and compact. A humorous anecdote from the sessions involved a take being interrupted by a crab shuffling across the studio&#x27;s wooden floor. Angus Young&#x27;s particular guitar sound on the album was achieved, in part, through the use of the Schaffer–Vega diversity system, a wireless guitar device designed by Ken Schaffer that provided a signal boost and was reissued as a separate guitar effect in 2014.

Near the end of the recording process, the band asked manager Ian Jeffery to find a bell to include on the album. Jeffery located a foundry to produce the bell, but, with seven weeks having already gone by, he suggested Platt instead record the bells of a nearby church. Platt did so, but these recordings did not suffice, due to the sound of a flurry of birds flying away that accompanied each peal of the bells. The foundry brought forward production on the bell, which turned out perfectly tuned, and it was recorded with Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Mobile Studio. Following the completion of recording, &quot;Back in Black&quot; was mixed at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.

According to Angus Young, the album&#x27;s all-black cover was a &quot;sign of mourning&quot; for Scott. Atlantic Records disliked the cover, but accepted it, on the condition that the band put a grey outline around the AC/DC logo.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Back in Black&quot; was first released in the United States on 25 July 1980. Its release in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe followed on 31 July, and it was released in Australia on 11 August. The album was an immediate commercial success, debuting at number one on the British albums chart and reaching number four on the American chart, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;an exceptional showing for a heavy-metal album&quot;. It topped the British chart for two weeks, and remained in the top 10 of the American chart for more than five months. In Australia, the album reached number one on the ARIA Charts in March 1981.

After &quot;Back in Black&quot; was released, AC/DC&#x27;s previous records &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, &quot;If You Want Blood You&#x27;ve Got It&quot;, and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; all re-entered the British charts, which made them the first band since The Beatles to have four albums in the British Top 100 simultaneously. &quot;Back in Black&quot;″s American success prompted Atlantic, the band&#x27;s US record company, to release their 1976 album &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; for the first time in the US, and in May 1981 &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; reached number three on the US chart, surpassing &quot;Back in Black&quot;&#x27;s peak position.

To promote the album, music videos were filmed for &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, the title track, &quot;Rock and Roll Ain&#x27;t Noise Pollution&quot;, &quot;Let Me Put My Love into You&quot;, and &quot;What Do You Do for Money Honey&quot;, though only the first four of those songs were released as singles. &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; became AC/DC&#x27;s first Top 40 hit in the US, peaking at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

On August 21, 2024, the album was certified 27× multi-platinum by the RIAA, denoting 27 million American sales. This placed it sixth on the list of the best-selling albums in the US. Worldwide, it has sold 50 million copies, leading Mark Beaumont of &quot;NME&quot; to call it &quot;the biggest selling hard rock album ever made&quot;; rock historian Brock Helander had previously called it &quot;ostensibly the best-selling [...] heavy-metal album in history&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1980, David Fricke regarded it as &quot;not only the best of AC/DC&#x27;s six American albums&quot;, but also &quot;the apex of heavy-metal art: the first LP since &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; that captures all the blood, sweat and arrogance of the genre.&quot; Red Starr of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; was more critical, saying he found the songs indistinguishable from one another and marred by hypermasculine fantasies, rock music stock phrases, garish guitar, and dull rhythms, on &quot;yet another triumph for lowest common denominator headbanging—the new thoroughly predictable, thoroughly dreadful AC/DC album&quot;, and gave &quot;Back in Black&quot; a score of 3 out of 10.

In a retrospective review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Christian Hoard praised the album as the band&#x27;s greatest work, possibly &quot;the leanest and meanest record of all time—balls-out arena rock that punks could love.&quot; Barry Walters from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;Back in Black&quot; &quot;still sounds thoroughly timeless, the essence of unrepentantly simple but savagely crafted hard rock&quot; and called the album &quot;a celebration of thrashing, animal sex&quot;, though he observed &quot;mean-spirited sexism&quot; on songs such as &quot;What Do You Do for Money Honey&quot; and &quot;Given the Dog a Bone&quot;. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990) that he found the band somewhat too &quot;primitive&quot; and their sexual imagery &quot;unimaginative&quot;, and that, on the album, &quot;Angus Young does come up with killer riffs, though not as consistently as a refined person like myself might hope, and lead singer Brian Johnson sings like there&#x27;s a cattle prod at his scrotum, just the thing for fans who can&#x27;t decide whether their newfound testosterone is agony or ecstasy.&quot;

Writing in 2011, Kitty Empire of &quot;The Observer&quot; admitted the album is &quot;a preposterous, drongoid record [...] built on casual sexism, eye-rolling double entendres, a highly questionable attitude to sexual consent (&#x27;Don&#x27;t you struggle/ Don&#x27;t you fight/ Don&#x27;t you worry/ Cos it&#x27;s your turn tonight&#x27;) a penchant for firearms, and a crass celebration of the unthinking macho hedonism that killed the band&#x27;s original singer&quot;, but, nonetheless, concurred with Fricke&#x27;s original view of the album as a heavy metal masterpiece and named it her favourite album ever, &quot;the obsessive soundtrack of my adolescence, the racy middle-brow thriller that spoke to me both as a tomboy who wanted to be one of the guys, and the increasingly female ingenue who needed to work out the world of men. Plus teenagers love death.&quot;

The album is featured on many &quot;best of&quot; lists. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 26 on their 1989 list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;, and number 73 on their 2003 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; (it was number 77 on the 2012 revised list and number 84 on the 2020 list), while the title track was ranked number 190 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. VH1 ranked &quot;Back in Black&quot; number 82 on their 2001 list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums&quot;, and the title track was ranked number 2 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; ranked the album number 9 on their 2006 list of the &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; included it in their 2010 &quot;All-TIME 100 Albums&quot; list, and Rolling Stone Australia ranked it number one on their December 2021 list of the &quot;200 Greatest Australian Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2005, the album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and it was listed at number 2 in the 2010 book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. Apple Music listed &quot;Back in Black&quot; as 90th pick for their 100 Best Albums list in 2024.

==Lyrics controversy==
Five months after Bon Scott&#x27;s death, AC/DC finished the work they had begun with him; they released &quot;Back in Black&quot; as a tribute to him, but his name did not appear in the writing credits. The issue of whether Scott&#x27;s lyrics were used, uncredited, on the album remains an enduring topic of debate.

The Senior Vice President of Atlantic Records in London from 1968 to 1985, Phil Carson, stated, &quot;[Johnson] wrote all the lyrics. It&#x27;s fucking stupid to say anything else.&quot;

The official credits on the album were and remain &quot;Young/Young/Johnson&quot;. In 2022, Johnson released his autobiography, &quot;The Lives of Brian&quot;, and denied Scott had written lyrics for &quot;Back in Black&quot;. He stated, &quot;The conspiracy theories are legion – usually started by people who think they know but weren&#x27;t there... it was &quot;me&quot; at the end of the pen, writing every night and every morning, with only the title to work with. That&#x27;s what happened. That&#x27;s the truth and I really hope that settles it.&quot; Johnson made particular reference to writing the lyrics to &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot;, &quot;Hells Bells&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot;, and stated that he was given nothing more than a riff and a title to work with. He also said that the title of the song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Ain&#x27;t Noise Pollution&quot; had come directly from a story Scott had told the rest of the band.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;Back in Black&quot; is an influential hard rock and heavy metal album. According to Tim Jonze of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it has been hailed by some as &quot;a high watermark&quot; for heavy metal music. &quot;NME&quot; regarded it as an important release in 1980s metal and heavy rock, naming it one of the 20 best metal albums of its decade, while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked it as one of the 20 greatest heavy metal albums of all time. Paul Brannigan of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; cited it as one of the ten albums that helped reestablish the genre&#x27;s global popularity in 1980, which he called &quot;the greatest year for heavy metal&quot;. In 2005, it was ranked number one on &quot;Rock Hard&quot; list of the &quot;500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

According to rock journalist Joe S. Harrington, &quot;Back in Black&quot; was released at a time when heavy metal stood at a turning point between a decline and a revival, as most bands in the genre were playing slower tempos and longer guitar solos, while AC/DC and Van Halen adopted punk rock&#x27;s &quot;high-energy implications&quot; and &quot;constricted their songs into more pop-oriented blasts&quot;. Harrington credited producer Lange for drawing AC/DC further away from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums, and toward a more dynamic attack that concentrated and harmonized each element of the band: &quot;the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive, and vocalist Johnson belowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage Robert Plant.&quot; The resulting music, along with contemporaneous records by Motörhead and Ozzy Osbourne, helped revitalize and reintroduce metal to a younger generation of listeners, &quot;eventually resulting in the punk-metal crossover personified by Metallica and others.&quot; In &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; (2008), Tom Moon said &quot;Back in Black&quot;″s &quot;lean mean arena rock&quot; and the production&#x27;s &quot;delicate balance of power and finesse [...] defined the commercial side of heavy music for years after its release.&quot;

Lange&#x27;s production for the album has had an enduring impact in the music industry. Harrington wrote that &quot;to this day, producers still use it as the de facto paint-by-numbers guidebook for how a hard-rock record should sound&quot;, and, in the years after its release, studios in Nashville would use it to check the acoustics of a room, while Motörhead would use it to tune their sound system. American death metal group Six Feet Under recorded a cover of the entire album under the title &quot;Graveyard Classics 2&quot;.

==Track listing==

*According to the official AC/DC website and most worldwide releases, track four was originally &quot;Given the Dog a Bone&quot;. On some albums, particular Australian releases, and also in the iTunes Store, it is sometimes shown as either &quot;Giving the Dog a Bone&quot; or &quot;Givin the Dog a Bone&quot;. The band&#x27;s official website later changed the title of the song to &quot;Givin the Dog a Bone&quot;, with no apostrophe.

<text>Highway to Hell is the sixth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 27 July 1979. It is the first of three albums produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, and is the last album featuring lead singer Bon Scott, who died on 19 February 1980.

==Background==
By 1978, AC/DC had released five albums internationally and had toured Australia and Europe extensively. In 1977, they landed in America and, with virtually no radio support, began to amass a live following. The band&#x27;s most recent album, the live &quot;If You Want Blood&quot;, had reached number 13 in the United Kingdom, and the two albums previous to that, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Powerage&quot;, had seen the band find their raging, blues-based hard rock sound. Although the American branch of Atlantic Records had rejected the group&#x27;s 1976 LP &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;, it now believed the band was poised to strike it big in the States if only they would work with a producer who could give them a radio-friendly sound. Since their 1975 Australian debut &quot;High Voltage&quot;, all of AC/DC&#x27;s albums had been produced by George Young and Harry Vanda. According to the book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, the band was not enthusiastic about the idea, especially guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young, who felt a strong sense of loyalty to their older brother George:
The producer Atlantic paired the band with was South African-born Eddie Kramer, best known for his pioneering work as engineer for Jimi Hendrix but also for mega-bands Led Zeppelin and Kiss. Kramer met the band at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida but, by all accounts, they did not get on. Geoff Barton quotes Malcolm Young in &quot;Guitar Legends&quot; magazine: &quot;Kramer was a bit of a prat. He looked at Bon and said to us, &#x27;Can your guy sing?&#x27; He might&#x27;ve sat behind the knobs for Hendrix, but he&#x27;s certainly not Hendrix, I can tell you that much.&quot; Former AC/DC manager Michael Browning recalls in the 1994 book &quot;Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott&quot;, &quot;I got a phone call from Malcolm in Florida, to say, &#x27;This guy&#x27;s hopeless, do something, he&#x27;s trying to talk us into recording that Spencer Davis song,&#x27; &#x27;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;,&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m a Man,&#x27; whatever it was.&quot; Browning turned to Zambian-born producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange to step in. Lange was best known for producing the Boomtown Rats number-one hit &quot;Rat Trap&quot; and post-pub rock bands like Clover, City Boy, and Graham Parker. In 1979, singer Bon Scott told &quot;Rock Australia Magazine&quot;, &quot;Three weeks in Miami and we hadn&#x27;t written a thing with Kramer. So one day we told him we were going to have a day off and not to bother coming in. This was Saturday, and we snuck into the studio and on that one day we put down six songs, sent the tape to Lange and said, &#x27;Will you work with us?&#x27;&quot; The band had also signed up with new management, firing Michael Browning and hiring Peter Mensch, an aggressive American who had helped develop the careers of Aerosmith and Ted Nugent.

==Recording==
With &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange in place as producer, recording commenced at the Roundhouse Recording Studios in Chalk Farm, north London on 24 March 1979, and ended on 14 April. Clinton Walker described this process in his book &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. The band had spent about three months at Roundhouse Studio, constantly working on the album. They worked for fifteen hours a day, usually for days on end, working on and reworking the songs within the album. This process was a culture shock to the band, who had grown used to spending about three weeks or so on an album, not the exhausting three-month period they spent on Highway to Hell. In spite of this, Lange&#x27;s process was appreciated by the band, who had a similarly solid work ethic, themselves. Brothers Malcolm and Angus Young later went on to describe Lange&#x27;s contributions to the band in an article by Mojo&#x27;s Sylvie Simmons. Lange was able to refine the tracks for the band, ensuring that sound, guitar, drums, and even vocals were up to par with both his and the band&#x27;s expectations. Tour manager, Ian Jeffery, who was present during recordings recalled the many changes Lange had put the band through, such as during a particular recording session that led to an argument between Bon Scott and Lange. Lange had advised Scott to control his breathing during the recording of &quot;If You Want Blood,&quot; leading Scott to demand that he do the technique himself. Lange was able to do it without complication, much to the shock of those in the room. Soon after, the band became receptive to Lange&#x27;s instruction.

In &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Arnaud Durieux writes that Lange, a trained singer, showed Scott how to breathe so he could be a technically better singer on songs like &quot;Touch Too Much&quot; and would join in on background vocals himself, having to stand on the other side of the studio because his own voice was so distinctive. The melodic backing vocals were a new element to the band&#x27;s sound, but the polish Lange added did not detract from the band&#x27;s characteristic crunch, thereby satisfying both the band and Atlantic Records at the same time.

Lange also taught Angus some useful lessons, instructing him to play his solos while sitting next to the producer. Jeffrey recalled an instance where he sat down with the lead guitarist to show him how he wanted him to play. While Angus initially reacted with hostility, he sat down with Lange, who instructed him by pointing toward notes on the fretboard. These notes turned out to be the solo from &quot;Highway to Hell.&quot; Moments like these stood out as significant to the band. Lange didn&#x27;t ask them to do the impossible, nor tell them their past process was incorrect. He heightened their process further, shaping the album into what it came to be.

==Tracks==
The album&#x27;s most famous song is the title track. From the outset, Atlantic Records hated the idea of using the song as the album title, with Angus later telling &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s Alan Di Perna that, despite backlash, the name is meant to depict the experience of touring for the band.

In a 2003 interview with Bill Crandall of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Angus further recalled the genesis of the song. Residing in Miami at the time, Angus and his brother Malcolm played the guitar intro and drum beat to &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; while playing in a rehearsal studio. They recorded this initial intro and beat on a cassette tape. Which was then taken by a man in the studio with the two, who gave the cassette to his child, who then proceeded to unravel the tape. Bon Scott was then able to later repair the broken cassette for further use.

&quot;Highway to Hell&quot; quickly took on a life of its own just after the death of Bon Scott in 1980. Just months after the album was first released to the public, Scott was found dead in his car, apparently having drunk himself to death. Scott&#x27;s death gave a new perspective to the lyrics of the album&#x27;s title song, becoming more a representation of his life up to mortem. His literal &quot;Highway to Hell.&quot; They show the carefree attitude when it comes to Scott&#x27;s lifestyle, his so-called &quot;fierce independence,&quot; and the company he kept during his hectic lifestyle. It is a physical manifestation of everything the singer stood for, making the song seem all the more alive, as Scott embraces his fate with enthusiasm.

Scott&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; deal almost exclusively with lust (&quot;Love Hungry Man&quot;, &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot;), sex (&quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot;, &quot;Touch Too Much&quot;, &quot;Walk All Over You&quot;), and partying on the town (&quot;Get It Hot&quot;, &quot;Shot Down in Flames&quot;). In his 2006 band memoir, Murray Engelheart reveals that Scott felt the lyrics of songs like &quot;Gone Shootin&#x27;&quot; from the preceding &quot;Powerage&quot; were &quot;simply too serious.&quot;

&quot;Touch Too Much&quot; had been first recorded in July 1977, with a radically different arrangement and lyrics from its &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; incarnation. The final version was performed by Scott and AC/DC on the BBC music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; a few days before the singer&#x27;s death in 1980. The song &quot;If You Want Blood (You&#x27;ve Got It)&quot; borrowed the title of the band&#x27;s live album from the previous year and stemmed from Scott&#x27;s response to a journalist at the Day on the Green festival in July 1978: when asked what they could expect from the band, Scott replied, &quot;Blood&quot;.

The opening guitar riff of &quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot; has been referred to by journalist Phil Sutcliffe as &quot;almost a tribute... a reflection, I hesitate to say a copy&quot; of &quot;Oh Well&quot; by Fleetwood Mac.

Asked in 1998, &quot;What&#x27;s the worst record you&#x27;ve ever made?&quot;, Angus replied: &quot;There&#x27;s a song on &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; called &#x27;Love Hungry Man&#x27; which I must have written after a night of bad pizza – you can blame me for that.&quot;

&quot;Night Prowler,&quot; the album&#x27;s outro song, has gained a degree of infamy over the years, due to an alleged association with Los Angeles serial killer Richard Ramirez. Coined the &quot;Night Stalker&quot; by the media, Ramirez is accredited to a series of brutal murders, rapes, and attempted murders taking place from 1984 to 1985, and a claimed fan of AC/DC. Ramirez left behind an AC/DC hat at the scene of a murder, and according to friends of Ramirez, he had a particular love for the album and the song &quot;Night Prowler.&quot; Ramirez himself never confirmed such an association. This alleged connection brought bad publicity to AC/DC, whose ensuing concerts and albums faced protests by parents and the general public. Despite backlash, the band had stated the song was given a murderous connotation by Ramirez&#x27;s crimes, revealing on an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; about AC/DC that the song was actually about a boy sneaking into his girlfriends bedroom at night while her parents are asleep, despite lyrics such as, &quot;And you don&#x27;t feel the steel, till it&#x27;s hanging out your back.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Highway to Hell&quot; was originally released on 27 July 1979 by Albert Productions, who licensed the album to Atlantic Records for release outside of Australia, and it was re-released by Epic Records in 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series. In Australia, the album was originally released with a slightly different album cover, featuring flames and a drawing of a bass guitar neck superimposed over the same photo of the band used on the international cover; also, the AC/DC logo is a darker shade of maroon, but the accents are a bit lighter. The East German release had different and much plainer designs for the front and back of the album, apparently because the authorities were not happy with the sleeve as released elsewhere.

&quot;Highway to Hell&quot; is featured in the 2003 film &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; and the 2010 films &quot;Megamind&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; and &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot;. &quot;If You Want Blood (You&#x27;ve Got It)&quot; is featured in the films &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995), &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (2005), &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (2005), &quot;Shoot &#x27;Em Up&quot; (2007), and &quot;Final Destination 5&quot; (2011). &quot;Walk All Over You&quot; is featured in the 2010 film &quot;Grown Ups&quot;. &quot;Touch Too Much&quot; is featured on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned&quot;, and it was also the theme song for the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s SummerSlam event in 1998.

==Reception==

The album became AC/DC&#x27;s first LP to break the top 100 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, eventually reaching number 17, and it propelled the band into the top ranks of hard rock acts. It is the second-highest selling AC/DC album (behind &quot;Back in Black&quot;) and is generally considered one of the greatest hard rock albums ever made. On 25 May 2006, the album was certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA.

Of the album, Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;The songs are more compact, the choruses fattened by rugby-team harmonies. The prize moment: Scott closes the hip-grinding &#x27;Shot Down in Flames&#x27; with a cackle worthy of the Wicked Witch of the West.&quot; In a 2008 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story, David Fricke noted: &quot;Superproducer &#x27;Mutt&#x27; Lange sculpted AC/DC&#x27;s rough-granite rock into chart-smart boogie on this album.&quot; AllMusic called the song &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; &quot;one of hard rock&#x27;s all-time anthems.&quot; The album was ranked number 199 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it was number 200 on the 2012 revised list. The 2010 book &quot;The 100 Best Australian Albums&quot; included &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; in the top 50 (&quot;Back in Black&quot; was No. 2).

In 2013, AC/DC fans Steevi Diamond and Jon Morter (who was behind a Rage Against the Machine Facebook campaign in 2009) spearheaded a Facebook campaign to make &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; a Christmas number one single on the UK Singles Chart, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of AC/DC, and to prevent &quot;The X Factor&quot; from achieving another number one hit single. The campaign raised funds for Feel Yourself, a testicular cancer-awareness charity. The song peaked at number four on the Official Singles Chart for Christmas that year, making it AC/DC&#x27;s first-ever UK Top 10 single.

<doc id="196950" wikidata="Q4162143" url="?curid=196950" title="Esophageal motility disorder">
<text>An esophageal motility disorder (EMD) is any medical disorder resulting from dysfunction of the coordinated movement of esophagus, which causes dysphagia (i.e. difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation of food).

Primary motility disorders are:

* Achalasia
* Diffuse esophageal spasm
* Nutcracker esophagus
* Hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter

An esophageal motility disorder can also be secondary to other diseases. For example, it may be a result of CREST syndrome, referring to the five main features: calcinosis, Raynaud syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia.

==Symptoms==
The most common symptom of esophageal motility disorders is dysphagia. Compared to causes of mechanical obstruction, which usually coincide with difficulties only with solids, dysphagia occurs in both solid foods and liquids. Heartburn, odynophagia, chest pain, and dyspnea are frequent symptoms of esophageal motility disorders, as they are in other esophageal disorders. Advanced achalasia is characterized by regurgitation of previously swallowed, undigested food material. Individuals with diffuse esophageal spasm or nutcracker esophagus, due to disordered peristalsis propagation, may experience severe chest pain and dysphagia, mimicking cardiac ischemia.

Achalasia&#x27;s most common symptoms include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing solids and liquids), regurgitation of undigested food, respiratory issues (aspiration and nocturnal cough), chest pain, and weight loss.

Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) is a motility disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of chest pain or dysphagia as well as nonpropulsive (tertiary) contractions on radiographs.

Nutcracker esophagus is characterized by high-amplitude peristaltic contractions that are frequently prolonged and cause dysphagia and chest pain.

HLES (hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter) is a rare manometric abnormality seen among individuals with dysphagia, chest pain, gastroesophageal reflux, and hiatal hernia.

== Diagnosis ==
Testing to diagnose EMD includes barium esophagography, upper endoscopy, and esophageal manometry.

== Treatment ==

There is no cure for EMD, but symptoms can be managed. Some symptom management includes eating slower and taking smaller bites; in some cases medications can be useful to manage other issues that contribute to EMD such as a proton pump inhibitor to ease gastroesophageal reflux (acid reflux), or a smooth muscle relaxant for issues with the muscles.

<text>Kings of the Wild Frontier is the second album by English new wave band Adam and the Ants. It was released on 7 November 1980 by CBS Records in the UK and Epic Records internationally. The album was the UK number 1 selling album in 1981 (and the 48th best seller in 1980) and won Best British Album at the 1982 Brit Awards.

==Background and recording==
After having his previous backing band wooed away by producer Malcolm McLaren to form Bow Wow Wow, Adam Ant recorded &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; with guitarist Marco Pirroni as his new writing partner.

==Release and commercial performance==
&quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK Album Chart and spawned three hit singles: &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot;, which was released in July and reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart; &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, which reached No. 4; and &quot;Antmusic&quot;, released in December and reaching No. 2, as well as No. 1 in Australia for five weeks.

Initial UK copies of the album featured a different version of &quot;Antmusic&quot; that started with a fade-in, but after the song became a hit the subsequent pressings used the 7&quot; single mix with the familiar drumstick intro.

The album was remastered and reissued in 2004 with several bonus tracks.

A multi-disc &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; was released 20 May 2016. It includes a DVD of the long out-of-print &quot;Ants in Japan&quot; concert video and a CD of a 1981 concert from Chicago. This edition scraped a single week in the UK Album Chart in its own right at number 69 and is considered to be a separate chart hit from the original album (rather than a 67th week for the album as a whole) Ant performed the entire album live on tour in the UK that year, and in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in 2017.

==Cover==
Photographer Peter Ashworth wrote, &quot;On 5 August 1980, prior to his first slot on Top of the Pops, Adam Ant got the band together in a small rehearsal room in Brixton to create a video test. Shooting stills from the monitor screen during the band performance produced some powerful images. Two days later a repeat shoot from the video recording, in a blacked-out studio, produced the sleeve image...&quot;
The US version of the album dropped &quot;Making History&quot; in favour of two tracks penned by Ant prior to teaming up with Marco Pirroni, &quot;(You&#x27;re So) Physical&quot; and &quot;Press Darlings&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviewing the US edition for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in March 1981, Robert Christgau judged the album as a response to British punk rock nihilism: &quot;The music, needless to say, is rock and roll, a clever pop-punk amalgam boasting two drummers, lots of chanting, and numerous B-movie hooks. Especially given Adam&#x27;s art-schooled vocals, I find that the hooks grate, but that may just mean that when it comes to futuristic warriors I prefer Sandinistas.&quot;

In his retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it &quot;one of the great defining albums of its time. There&#x27;s simply nothing else like it, nothing else that has the same bravado, the same swagger, the same gleeful self-aggrandizement and sense of camp. This walked a brilliant line between campiness and art-house chutzpah, and it arrived at precisely the right time – at the forefront of new wave&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; cites it as the album where Adam Ant &quot;found his groove&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It is also one of twenty CDs in the &quot;Great British Albums&quot; box set released by Sony Records in 2012. In 1992, Nine Inch Nails released a cover version of &quot;Physical (You&#x27;re So)&quot; on the EP &quot;Broken&quot;, remade in an industrial rock style with more aggressive guitars and vocals than the original. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list.

==Cultural references==
The songs on the album reference and quote numerous cultural sources in both lyrics and music. The abiding themes are drawn from a stew of popular, historical and contemporary sources to create an immersive tableau of pop-mythology. The title track evokes Davy Crockett, and media representations thereof, and posits the band and its followers as a new royal family. &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; was inspired by a quotation attributed to Margaret Thatcher. &quot;Feed Me To The Lions&quot; includes a musical quotation of the theme from the film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. &quot;Los Rancheros&quot; refers to Clint Eastwood. As well as evoking the film &quot;Them!&quot;, &quot;Ants Invasion&quot; mentions a &#x27;Forbidden Zone&#x27; as in the 1968 film of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (a theme returned to on the following year&#x27;s &quot;Picasso Visita el Planeta de los Simios&quot;). &quot;Killer In The Home&quot; quotes &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in its lyrics. &quot;The Magnificent Five&quot; homages &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, and quotes Friedrich Nietzsche. &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Square (Be There)&quot; refers to an earlier, unreleased Adam and the Ants song, which itself obliquely referenced the actor Dirk Bogarde. &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; is musically identical with the theme to &quot;Seven Guns for the MacGregors&quot;, composed by Ennio Morricone. &quot;Making History&quot; quotes &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. &quot;The Human Beings&quot; lyrical content consists almost entirely of the chanted names of Native American tribes Blackfoot, Pawnee, Cheyenne, Crow, and the name of Goklayeh, a Bedonkohe Apache leader.

<doc id="196954" wikidata="Q2650944" url="?curid=196954" title="Geoffrey O'Hara">
<text>Geoffrey O&#x27;Hara (February 2, 1882 – January 31, 1967) was a Canadian-American composer, singer and music professor.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Hara was born in Chatham, Ontario, Canada. He initially planned a military career. O&#x27;Hara entered the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario at age 18 and he trained with the 1st Hussars. He had to abandon his military career upon the death of his father, Robert O&#x27;Hara.

==Career==
He moved to the United States in 1904, the same year he began performing in Vaudeville. He began recording for Edison Records in 1905. In 1913 O&#x27;Hara undertook the recording of traditional Indian songs on behalf of the American government. He was recorded on phonograph cylinder lecturing about the complexity of the music as well as singing and playing several types of Navajo traditional songs in 1914. During World War I, he was a singing instructor of patriotic songs for American troops.

O&#x27;Hara lectured on music and songwriting and held positions at Teachers&#x27; College of Columbia University (1936–37), Huron College and the University of South Dakota, where he later received an honorary Doctor of Music degree in 1947. He lectured for the remainder of his life. In 1920, O&#x27;Hara helped organize The Composers&#x27; and Lyric Writers&#x27; Protective League. He also was a board member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), was the president of the Composers-Authors Guild, and served in the United Service Organizations (USO).

He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.

==Personal life==
In 1919, he married Constance Dougherty from Massachusetts, and together they had two children; the same year, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

==Works==
O&#x27;Hara composed over 500 popular and patriotic songs, and hymns. He had some moderate popular music hits in the 1910s with songs such as &quot;Your Eyes Have Told Me What I Did Not Know&quot; (1913), &quot;Tennessee, I Hear You Calling Me&quot; (1914), &quot;The Old Songs&quot;, and &quot;Over the Top: Military March&quot; (1917).

His one huge hit was his song K-K-K-Katy (1918), one of the most popular tunes of the World War I era. It was sung in both World War I and World War II, occasionally as &quot;K. K. K. K. P.&quot;

He was commissioned by the Wilson administration to compose the modern day version of the Star Spangled Banner.

<doc id="196957" wikidata="Q1092304" url="?curid=196957" title="Congregation (The Afghan Whigs album)">
<text>Congregation is the third studio album by American alternative rock band The Afghan Whigs. It was released on January 31, 1992, by Sub Pop and followed two years of the band&#x27;s touring in support of their first album for the label, &quot;Up in It&quot; (1990).

The Afghan Whigs recorded &quot;Congregation&quot; in sessions held at Bear Creek Studios in Washington state&#x27;s Woodinville and Buzz&#x27;s Kitchen in Los Angeles from July to August 1991, with the band&#x27;s frontman Greg Dulli producing alongside audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. Initially working on a $15,000 advance from Sub Pop, the production and release became hindered by the label&#x27;s financial difficulties; these were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of fellow Sub Pop act Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

Expanding on the aggressive sound of the band&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Congregation&quot; has more refined musical details and slower-tempo songs, incorporating ballads, R&amp;B, soul, and funk influences. The album&#x27;s cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white baby in her arms, interpreted as a comical allusion to the band&#x27;s African-American music influences. The lyrics explore themes of pleasure and guilt in the context of dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.

&quot;Congregation&quot; was well received by contemporary critics, who praised its musical quality, stylistic elements, and emotional content. It was promoted with two singles, &quot;Turn On the Water&quot; and &quot;Conjure Me&quot;, and The Afghan Whigs&#x27; extensive touring in the United States and Europe. Although it did not chart, the album helped the band attain a cult following and receive offers from major record labels, leading to their signing to Elektra Records. Since its initial reception, &quot;Congregation&quot; has been viewed by writers as the band&#x27;s breakthrough album and a significant release in rock music during the 1990s.

After forming in 1986 in Cincinnati, The Afghan Whigs—vocalist and rhythm guitarist Greg Dulli, bassist John Curley, lead guitarist Rick McCollum, and drummer Steve Earle—released their 1988 debut album &quot;Big Top Halloween&quot; on an independent record label and gained the attention of Seattle-based label Sub Pop. With their second album &quot;Up in It&quot; (1990) released on the label, the band toured regularly in the United States for two years and occasionally in Europe before recording &quot;Congregation&quot;. Sub Pop gave the band a $15,000 advance to record the album, which Dulli later said was a &quot;then-unheard-of&quot; and &quot;bloated&quot; amount.

While collectively interested in classic rock, the band members had other individual tastes, including McCollum&#x27;s interest in free jazz, experimental, and Indian music, and Dulli&#x27;s love of hip hop, soul, and funk, particularly Motown artists and Prince. According to &quot;Stereogum&quot;, their African-American music influences were comically referred to in &quot;Congregation&quot;″s cover photo, which depicted a nude black woman sitting on a blanket with a white baby held in her arms.

== Recording and production ==
The Afghan Whigs began recording the album in July 1991. They held sessions at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington and Buzz&#x27;s Kitchen in Los Angeles, California. Dulli wrote most of its songs and produced the album with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. Session musicians such as Miss Ruby Belle, Shecky Stein, and Lance Ellison also contributed; Belle sung lead vocals on &quot;Her Against Me&quot;, Stein played piano on &quot;Conjure Me&quot;, and Ellison played piano and sung lead vocals on &quot;The Temple&quot; with John Curley and Rick McCollum. Singer-songwriter Shawn Smith contributed backing vocals to &quot;This Is My Confession&quot; and &quot;Dedicate It&quot;. After the rest of the band finished recording their parts, Dulli stayed in Los Angeles to record his vocals, overdub the recorded tracks, and mix the album. However, the album&#x27;s production was delayed due to Sub Pop&#x27;s financial difficulties, and Dulli got another job in Los Angeles to pay for the studio.

Although the label eventually settled the studio&#x27;s bills and the album&#x27;s sessions ended in August 1991, the band was unsure if Sub Pop had enough money to release any more albums, let alone &quot;Congregation&quot;. After the massive commercial success of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Sub Pop recovered financially by receiving royalties from the album after the band left them for a major label. Dulli later said that while he was &quot;stranded in L.A. ... Nirvana saved the whole fuckin&#x27; label&quot;. He recalled thanking the band&#x27;s frontman Kurt Cobain upon the album&#x27;s completion, saying that &quot;I went to Nirvana&#x27;s show at the Palace in L.A. and hugged Kurt and said, &#x27;Good one, bro. Congratulations. And thank you—now I can go home.&#x27;&quot;

After the album&#x27;s sessions were done, Dulli was inspired to write and record an additional track on the day of Miles Davis&#x27; death, September 28, 1991. He received two messages on his answering machine from music executive David Katznelson, the first providing directions to a cookout and the second informing Dulli that Davis had died, saying that &quot;Miles is dead. Don&#x27;t forget the alcohol.&quot; Working at Ultrasuede in Cincinnati, Dulli incorporated Katznelson&#x27;s line as a lyric and, with a guitar riff from Rick McCollum, hastily recorded &quot;Miles Iz Ded&quot;, which was included as a hidden track on the album. &quot;Congregation&quot; was mastered by Jack Skinner at K Disc Mastering in Hollywood. Dulli subsequently took a drive in his car and listened to the album while observing his scenery, a practice he continued with future albums.

== Music ==

The album expands on the aggressive sound of the band&#x27;s previous work with refined musical details and occasionally slower songs. In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (2003), music journalist Alex Ogg writes that The Afghan Whigs were &quot;managing to balance volume with subtlety&quot; amid the burgeoning grunge music scene. The album&#x27;s music incorporates heavy counterpoint rhythms, indie rock harmonics, wah-wah and slide guitars, and staccato riffs with funk, metal, and blues influences. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Brad Webber compares its melodies to those of &quot;later Hüsker Dü&quot;. &quot;Option&quot; perceives influences from &quot;ex-indie guitar bands&quot; such as Dinosaur Jr. and Nirvana in the songs&#x27; &quot;catch-iness and in the arrangements&#x27; juxtaposition of frenzy and laziness.&quot; David Sprague of the &quot;Trouser Press&quot; comments that the band&#x27;s instrumentation &quot;contriv[es] panoramic images through judicious use of wah-wah guitar ... and the tribal drumbeats with which Steven Earle invokes an air of ritualistic surrender.&quot;

The album&#x27;s rock sound is complemented by a predominant soul influence. According to &quot;The Vinyl District&quot; writer Joseph Neff, on &quot;Congregation&quot;, the Afghan Whigs expand on contemporary alternative and indie rock with an integrated dimension of R&amp;B, soul, and funk. &quot;Magic&quot; magazine&#x27;s Christophe Basterra characterizes the resulting music as &quot;The Four Tops appropriating &#x27;Search and Destroy&#x27; by Iggy &amp; the Stooges&quot;. The slow-burning ballad &quot;Let Me Lie to You&quot; incorporates soul and grunge musical styles. Dulli wrote the song in an attempt to deviate from the aesthetic of Sub Pop, who he felt discouraged its acts from recording slow songs. He cites writing the song as the moment he began having faith in himself as a songwriter. Songs such as &quot;Miles Iz Ded&quot;, &quot;Conjure Me&quot;, and &quot;Turn On the Water&quot; incorporate funk influences and wah-wah guitar. Pitchfork Media&#x27;s Stephen M. Deusner cites the latter song as an example of how the band &quot;integrate[d] African-American sounds and influences into their white rock&quot;, writing that it &quot;uses Isaac Hayes&#x27; wakka-chikka guitars as a punk accessory, and its jumpy guitar riffs instill these songs with a sense of motion that suggests amped-up r&amp;b.&quot; &quot;Tonight&quot; features bluesy acoustic guitar.

=== Lyrics ===

Dulli&#x27;s lyrics throughout the album explore dysfunctional intimate relationships and sexual deviancy, featuring themes of pleasure and guilt. The songs are narrated from the perspective of an emotionally wounded sinner and with sinister and narcissistic tones. The lyrics also feature haunting refrains and expressions of angst and melodrama. In &quot;Stereogum&quot; writer Peter Helman&#x27;s analysis, &quot;Congregation&quot; debuts the predominance of Dulli&#x27;s &quot;leviathan libido&quot; over an album-length work, avoiding the multi-layer metaphors of classic rock-inspired contemporaries such as Eddie Vedder and instead expressing emotions in an R&amp;B style: &quot;Artists like the Supremes, the Temptations, and even the Four Tops often wrote songs that seethed with domestic drama and pent-up sexual energy.&quot;

Dulli&#x27;s baritone vocals throughout the album are moaningly husky and feature falsetto wails. Daniel Fidler of &quot;Spin&quot; compares them to those of &quot;a young Paul Westerberg .&quot; David Sprague of the &quot;Trouser Press&quot; calls &quot;Congregation&quot; a &quot;strangely flamboyant&quot; album that showcases &quot;Dulli&#x27;s metamorphosis from everypunk wallflower to rakish scoundrel with a .&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic calls Dulli &quot;a truly magnetic presence&quot; and writes of his performance on the album, &quot;by turns predator (&#x27;Tonight&#x27;) and prey (&#x27;I&#x27;m Her Slave&#x27;), he&#x27;s the guy your parents always warned you about, delivering each syllable of his remarkable lyrics with equal measures of innuendo and venom.&quot; Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody comments that his lyrics are &quot;full of stifling dissatisfaction and boozy philosophy&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;m Her Slave&quot; is a heroin anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites &quot;Turn On the Water&quot; as an example of when &quot;the twisted narrator is the victim&quot; and &quot;cast adrift&quot; in Dulli&#x27;s lyrics. Inspired by a paranoid breakup, &quot;Conjure Me&quot; is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On &quot;Kiss the Floor&quot;, the narrator recounts stealing a girl&#x27;s virginity and avoiding her brothers. &quot;This Is My Confession&quot; has a theme of absolution, depicted as an empty sexual experience: &quot;Shove my head against the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in.&quot; &quot;The Temple&quot; is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. &quot;Let Me Lie to You&quot; has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. &quot;Tonight&quot; depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator&#x27;s corrupt one-track mind: &quot;Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we&#x27;ll disappear / I&#x27;ll hold your hand, we&#x27;ll never tell / Our private little trip to hell&quot;. The album&#x27;s hidden track &quot;Miles Iz Ded&quot; is about seduction and alcohol, evoking a last call and sense of a despair.

== Marketing ==

&quot;Congregation&quot; was released by Sub Pop on January 31, 1992, and distributed by Caroline Records, on both LP and CD formats. To promote the record, &quot;Turn On the Water&quot; was released in January as a 7-inch single (with &quot;Miles Iz Ded&quot; on its B-side), as a CD single (coupled with the tracks &quot;Chalk Outline&quot; and &quot;Miles Iz Ded&quot;), and on February 25 as a cassette single. &quot;Conjure Me&quot; was released in May as a 7-inch single backed with the Afghan Whigs&#x27; cover of the 1965 Supremes song &quot;My World Is Empty Without You&quot;. A music video for the single was filmed—featuring a topless woman caressing Dulli as he lip syncs the song—and received rotation on MTV.

The Afghan Whigs promoted the album with an appearance on MTV and an international tour with dates in major American cities and Europe. During their shows, the Afghan Whigs interspersed R&amp;B songs in their set list, including an interpolation of The Spinners&#x27; 1972 song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Around&quot; during &quot;Turn On the Water&quot;. The band&#x27;s extensive touring for the album helped them garner a larger audience, although the album did not impact the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It was reissued in September 1998.

== Critical reception and legacy ==

&quot;Congregation&quot; was met with highly positive reviews from critics. Reviewing in September 1992, Daniel Fidler from &quot;Spin&quot; viewed the record as &quot;a clean move toward musical excellence&quot;, showing the Afghan Whigs &quot;bursting its Sub Pop chains with catchy, heavy guitar riffs, downright lovable song arrangements, melodies that jerk your emotions back and forth, and yes, endearing, raspy vocals that wail, moan, scream, and shout&quot;. Michael Azerrad called it &quot;superb&quot; in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, while Brad Webber of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found the album more accessible to listeners than contemporary Seattle or Minneapolis-based, guitar-oriented grunge bands. Additionally, Webber said the Afghan Whigs are &quot;on rock&#x27;s cutting edge&quot; while stirring &quot;a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs&quot;. In &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, J. D. Considine said the band is &quot;clever enough to find hooks in the sort of gnarled riffs and guitar noise Fugazi plays for atmosphere&quot;, as well as &quot;canny enough to avoid most of the mannerisms that make much Amerindie rock seem so cliched.&quot; Considine concluded in his review, &quot;The best reason to join this &quot;Congregation&quot; is that the songs are catchy enough to hold their own against the best work of bands like Dinosaur Jr. or the Replacements.&quot; &quot;Option&quot; was less impressed, appreciating the record&#x27;s &quot;sheer listenability&quot;, &quot;clear recording and dynamic performances&quot;, but criticizing Dulli&#x27;s lyrics and the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Temple&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked &quot;Congregation&quot; at number 25 on its year-end best albums for 1992.

With the album&#x27;s critical acclaim and the band&#x27;s steady touring, the Afghan Whigs attained a cult following and was courted by several major labels who wanted to sign them. Frustrated with the distribution limitation of a small record label, they signed to Elektra Records after their final release for Sub Pop, an EP of soul cover songs called &quot;Uptown Avondale&quot; (1992). Their major label debut &quot;Gentlemen&quot; was released in 1993 to critical acclaim and mainstream exposure.

Along with &quot;Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Congregation&quot; is generally considered by music journalists to be part of the Afghan Whigs&#x27; peak recording period. Dulli cites it as &quot;the record where we came into our own&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; dubbed it &quot;the finest rock LP of the decade&quot; and commented that it is &quot;nothing less than rock raping pop, a ferocious deflowering of Motown&#x27;s romantic ideal&quot;. With &quot;Congregation&quot;, Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody found the band to be &quot;crucial to the birth of &#x27;90s alternative rock.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny said that it was the band&#x27;s artistic breakthrough and &quot;ticket to the big leagues&quot;, &quot;an incendiary and insidious set which bridges the gap between the noisy aggression of the band&#x27;s early releases and the soulful swagger of their later work.&quot; Ankeny also cited it as &quot;the grunge era&#x27;s most overlooked masterpiece&quot; and an indication of the band&#x27;s musical growth, writing that &quot;while still unmistakably a member of the Sub Pop stable, there&#x27;s a greater maturity and depth to their sinewy sound, with a newfound grasp of mood and nuance&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Joe Gross called it a &quot;quantum leap&quot; over the band&#x27;s previous work, commenting that it &quot;shows that they ditched grunge for soul because they were no damn good at the former and ladies dig the latter.&quot; The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995) was somewhat less enthusiastic, writing that &quot;the results feel like dress rehearsals for &quot;Gentlemen&quot;, with one partial exception, &#x27;Conjure Me,&#x27; and one absolute triumph: a surging final track ... that might be the Afghan Whigs&#x27; strongest recorded performance.&quot;

In 2002, Italian music magazine &quot;Il Mucchio Selvaggio&quot; included &quot;Congregation&quot; on its list of 100 Best Albums by Decade. Polish webzine &quot;Screenagers&quot; ranked it number 79 on its 2004 list of the Top 100 Albums of the &#x27;90s. Italian music journalists Eddy Cilìa and Federico Guglielmi included &quot;Congregation&quot; in their 2010 book on essential rock albums. In 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included it in their list of the &quot;25 Best Grunge Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;; in the accompanying blurb, Stuart Berman wrote that the record &quot;showed how grunge&#x27;s roar could express an emotional depth beyond anger and disillusionment. Full of white-knuckled songs brimming with sensuality, obsession, and betrayal, the album plays out like some alt-rock soap opera.&quot;

<text>A tughra (; ) is a calligraphic monogram, seal or signature of a sultan that was affixed to all official documents and correspondence. Inspired by the tamgha, it was also carved on his seal and stamped on the coins minted during his reign. Very elaborate decorated versions were created for important documents that were also works of art in the tradition of Ottoman illumination, such as the example of Suleiman the Magnificent in the gallery below.

The tughra was designed at the beginning of the sultan&#x27;s reign and drawn by the court calligrapher or &quot;nişancı&quot; on written documents. The first tughra examples are from the 14th century.

Tughras served a purpose similar to the cartouche in ancient Egypt or the Royal Cypher of British monarchs. Every Ottoman sultan had his own individual tughra.

==Etymology==
There are two main schools of thought on the origins of the word tughra. The first sees it derived from a Turkic secretarial emblem called &quot;tughragh&quot;, and the second as an effort by Persian scribes to shape the name of the ruler into a bow-like element called &quot;turgha&quot;/&quot;turghay&quot;, subsequently mispronounced as tughra.

The primary argument for the first school is a remark by Mahmud al-Kashgari in his &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot;:
==Visual elements of a tughra==

The tughra has a characteristic form, two loops on the left side, three vertical lines in the middle, stacked writing on the bottom and two extensions to the right. Each of these elements has a specific meaning, and together they make up the form that is easily recognizable as a tughra. 

The name of the sultan is written out in the bottom section, called a &quot;sere&quot;. Depending on the period, this name can be as simple as Orhan, son of Osman, in the first tughra in 1326. In later periods honorifics and prayers are also added to the name of the tughra holder and his father.

The loops to the left of the tughra are called &quot;beyze&quot;, from Arabic meaning &quot;egg&quot;. Some interpretations of tughra design claim that the beyzes are supposed to symbolize the two seas the sultans held sway over: the outer larger loop signifying the Mediterranean and the inner, smaller loop signifying the Black Sea.

The vertical lines on the top of the tughra are called &quot;tuğ&quot;, or flagstaff. The three tugs signify independence. The S-shaped lines crossing the tugs are called &quot;zülfe&quot; and they, together with the tops of the tugs that also look to the right, signify that the winds blow from the east to the west, the traditional movement of the Ottomans.

The lines to the right of the tughra are called &quot;hançer&quot; and signify a sword, symbol of power and might.

==Tughras of the Ottoman sultans==
== Other tughras ==
Although the tughra is largely identified with the Ottoman Sultans, they have also sometimes been used in other states, such as the Qajar dynasty, Safavid Empire, the Crimean khanate, the Khanate of Kazan. Later, tughras were used among the Imperial Russia of Tartary.
The Mughal Emperors are also known to have used calligraphic symbols, alongside the Ottomans, the Mughal &quot;Tughra&quot; was circular in shape with three points at its tip, beside the calligraphic signature of the emperor.

Afghan currency notes from 1919 to 1936 had the tughra present as well. Pakistan had the tughra on its coins from 1947 till 1974; both of these are present in the State Bank Museum in Karachi. The nawab of Bahawalpur and the Nizam of Hyderabad had tugras on their coinage as well. The flowing lines could symbolize the wide reach of Suleyman&#x27;s rule and his future conquests. It could also signify the spread of Islam to other realms beyond the Ottoman Empire.

==Post-imperial interpretations==
There are modern calligraphy artists that use the characteristic tughra form today. Examples are the tughras of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Emperor of Japan, Akihito, created by artist Vladimir Popov.

<doc id="196962" wikidata="Q16242612" url="?curid=196962" title="The Art of Drowning (album)">
<text>The Art of Drowning is the fifth studio album by American rock band AFI. It was released on September 19, 2000, through Nitro Records.

==Production==
In June 2000, the band finished recording &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;.

==Composition==
The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;The Lost Souls&quot;, was originally titled &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;. &quot;The Despair Factor&quot; features AFI&#x27;s first notable use of electronic drums. On the song, vocalist Davey Havok states: &quot;My whole life is a dark room... one big dark room,&quot; a line spoken by Winona Ryder in the film &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). The track title inspired the name of the band&#x27;s official fan club, The Despair Faction.

==Artwork==
The band name and album title appear in orange in a hand-designed horror punk-esque typeface. The front cover illustration depicts a wintry graveyard with deformed stone sculptures resembling either angels or demons. The central figure sits atop a frozen fountain and holds its hands in the prayer position. On the back cover, the scene continues to the left with more tombstones and a gate.

The CD booklet features additional illustrations: a man behind a fence (later sold as a toy named Art), a bed with candles on each bedpost, demonic forms convulsing in the corner of a room, an eye with fiery skull shapes inside, skeletal forms in front of a fire and a heart motif, and a demonic figure which also appears on the CD label, as well as behind the CD tray (and on the cover of &quot;The Days of the Phoenix EP&quot;). On the case&#x27;s inner spine appears the hidden message &quot;Battled&quot;, the title of the album&#x27;s hidden track. The lyrics and spine use the Caslon Antique font, prominently featured on the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot;.

The album&#x27;s art was produced by Alan Forbes - a San Francisco artist, and long-time collaborator with the band. Alan had previously produced the album art for 1999&#x27;s Black Sails in the Sunset, as well as number of the band&#x27;s merchandise designs, and tour posters.

==Release==
&quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; was released in September 2000, through Nitro Records. In November, the band supported Rancid on their tour of the US. The lead single, &quot;The Days of the Phoenix&quot;, experienced moderate airplay on modern rock stations, the most notable being KROQ-FM. A music video was released for the song, directed by Marc Webb. &quot;Wester&quot; was released in the form of a promotional single. In March 2001, the band toured across Canada with Death by Stereo, Catch 22, Ann Beretta, and Rise Against. &quot;The Days of the Phoenix&quot; was released as an EP in May 2001, to coincide with some UK shows; it included &quot;Wester&quot;, and the outtake &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Between June and August 2001, the group performed on the Warped Tour. Following the September 11 attacks, the band were stuck in Japan for a time due to an air-travel lockdown in the US. As a result of this, the first half of the band&#x27;s headlining US tour were postponed to November. In November 2002, the album was included as part of a vinyl box of the band&#x27;s albums on Nitro Records.

==Reception==

In an AllMusic review, MacKenzie Wilson says &quot;Punk rawkers AFI exude another powerful disposition on their fifth album, The Art of Drowning. Issued on Dexter Holland&#x27;s Nitro Records, AFI&#x27;s quick and haughty, spiraling guitar riffs and crashing percussion make for another mishmash for single-fisted anthems for punk revivalists and enigmatic pop kids raging against the machine. Nothing short of Pennywise, D Generation, and Powerman 5000, AFI is rowdy with their old-school-inspired rants like &quot;Ever and a Day&quot; and &quot;Of Greetings and Goodbyes.&quot; Frontman Davey Havok casts a rough demeanor, but certainly not anything intimidating because punk rock became friendly after the war of early-&#x27;90s grunge. The snarl and sweat are not as fashionable as it once was, but the attitude remains the same.&quot;

The album was listed by &quot;Alternative Press&quot; as one of the ten most influential punk albums of the year 2000. The album was included in &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 101 Modern Classics list at number 40. In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;The Days of the Phoenix&quot; at number 80 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

The album was the band&#x27;s first to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, at #174 for the week of October 13, 2000. It sold around 8,000 copies in its first week.

<text>Ender&#x27;s Shadow (1999) is a parallel science fiction novel by the American author Orson Scott Card, taking place at the same time as the novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and depicting some of the same events from the point of view of Bean, a supporting character in the original novel. It was originally to be titled &quot;Urchin&quot;, but it was retitled &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; prior to release. &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; was shortlisted for a Locus Award in 2000.

==Plot summary==

Bean is a homeless child living on the hellish streets of Rotterdam around 2170 after escaping as an infant from an illegal genetic engineering laboratory. Highly intelligent and extremely young, he is on the brink of dying from starvation, but manages to convince a nine-year-old named Poke to let him join her band of homeless children by offering her an idea. He tells Poke she should recruit an older bully to help fend off other bullies who prevent the younger children from eating at a local soup kitchen. She chooses Achilles, a bully with a bad leg; Bean realizes that Achilles is too intelligent and dangerous a choice, but is unable to change Poke&#x27;s mind. Achilles is able to manipulate Poke&#x27;s group, and eventually kills Poke.

Bean&#x27;s incredible intelligence, creativity and determination bring him to the attention of Sister Carlotta, a nun who is recruiting children for the International Fleet (IF) for a war of survival against the alien Buggers. She gets him admitted to Battle School, despite official resistance and skepticism about his background. Bean has to overcome being much younger and smaller than the other child recruits and faces scrutiny when it is revealed that he scored record highs in all of the school&#x27;s mental tests. As he proves himself, they constantly compare him to Ender Wiggin, another prodigy who preceded him. Bean begins to ferret out secrets and truths about the school. Meanwhile, Sister Carlotta uncovers Bean&#x27;s past.

Ender has been chosen as the best chance to save humanity from the Buggers; Bean comes to be the backup in case Ender breaks down. Bean is assigned to draw up the roster for Ender&#x27;s army. At first, Ender does not appear to recognize Bean&#x27;s brilliance, but time shows that he was grooming Bean and he finally puts Bean in charge of a special new platoon to handle extraordinary missions. Ender wins combat games against the other, more established school armies; as time goes on, the other side is given more and more unfair advantages, but Ender never loses. Achilles joins Battle School, having also been selected for his intelligence and now with his leg healed. Bean concocts a scheme to trap Achilles and make him confess to multiple murders, including Poke&#x27;s, revealing that he is a sociopath bent on killing anyone who has seen or made him helpless. The IF arrests Achilles. 

Eventually, Bean and other students graduate from Battle School to work under Ender, who now commands one side in electronically simulated battles; he is told that his foe is Mazer Rackham, the legendary hero who saved humanity from the Second Invasion. However, Bean deduces from various clues (such as the lack of speed-limit induced communication delay in the simulation) that the &quot;simulations&quot; are real battles: Ender and his &quot;jeesh&quot; are commanding human fleets attacking Bugger planets via the Ansible, an instantaneous communications device. The pace increases and the enemy forces become stronger and stronger. Through it all, Ender keeps on winning, but he begins to break down under the pressure; at times, Bean gives the jeesh additional commands. In the final battle at the Buggers&#x27; home planet, Ender faces seemingly impossible odds; his only edge is a weapon—&quot;Dr Device&quot;—that can start a chain reaction that destroys matter, but only if the matter is concentrated enough. Ender freezes, unable to come up with a plan, until Bean&#x27;s prompt (inadvertently) shows him how they can win. With the victory, Ender commits genocide on the Buggers.

Throughout the book, Bean struggles against the IF administration and how they push Ender, seemingly willing to break him to achieve their goals. Bean also has to contend with his past and his struggle to understand what makes Ender human and better than him.

Bean also makes friends with an older boy named Nikolai who is drawn to Bean because of their similar looks. It is soon discovered, through Sister Carlotta&#x27;s research, that the two boys are genetic twins, except for Bean&#x27;s genetic enhancements. When Bean was illegally genetically engineered, the scientist Volescu had &quot;turned Anton&#x27;s Key,&quot; meaning that Bean&#x27;s body—including his brain—will never stop growing, which will result in a premature death between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five. Sister Carlotta ensures that Bean will get to live with Nikolai and his parents after the war. At the end of the story, after they defeat the buggers, Bean is united with his real parents and Nikolai.

&quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; is the first of a series that includes &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot;, &quot;Shadows in Flight&quot;, and &quot;The Last Shadow&quot;.

<doc id="196964" wikidata="Q29558" url="?curid=196964" title="President of Finland">
<text>The president of the Republic of Finland (; ) is the head of state of Finland. The incumbent president is Alexander Stubb, since 1 March 2024. He was elected president for the first time in 2024.

The president is directly elected by universal suffrage for a term of six years. Since 1994, no president may be elected for more than two consecutive terms. The president must be a natural-born Finnish citizen. The presidential office was established in the Constitution Act of 1919. Under the Constitution of Finland, executive power is vested in the Finnish Government and the president, with the latter possessing only residual powers. Only formally, the president ranks first in the protocol, before the speaker of the parliament and the prime minister of Finland.

Finland has, for most of its independence, had a semi-presidential system in which the president had much authority and power over both foreign and domestic policy, but constitutional amendments adopted in 1991, 2000 and 2012 reduced the president&#x27;s powers and moved the country towards a more parliamentary system. The president still leads the nation&#x27;s foreign politics in conjunction with the Government, and is the commander-in-chief of the Finnish Defence Forces.

== Title ==
Officially, the current head of state of Finland is known as the president of the Republic of Finland (; ) or, more often, the president of the Republic (&#x27;, &#x27;). This is in contrast to former presidents, who retain the title &quot;President&quot;.

==Election==

Presidential candidates can be nominated by registered parties which have received at least one seat in the previous parliamentary elections. A candidate may also be nominated by 20,000 enfranchised citizens. Between 1919 and 1988, the president was elected indirectly by an electoral college made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election. In the 1988 presidential election, a direct and an indirect election were conducted in parallel: if no candidate could gain a majority, the president was elected by an electoral college formed in the same elections. Since 1994, the president has been elected by a direct popular vote.

If only one candidate is nominated, that candidate becomes president without an election. Otherwise, the first round of balloting takes place on the fourth Sunday of January in the election year. The elections are two-staged. If one of the candidates receives more than half of the votes cast, that candidate is elected president. If no candidate wins a majority in the first stage, the top two candidates rerun in the second stage two weeks later. The candidate who then receives more votes is elected. In the event of a tie, the election is resolved by lot. The Government confirms the outcome of the election and, if necessary, conducts the drawing of lots. The president assumes office on the first day of the month following the election (either 1 February or 1 March depending on whether there were one or two rounds).

There have been several exceptional presidential elections. The first president, Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, was chosen by the Finnish parliament due to the transition rule of the constitution and also due to the martial law. In 1940 and 1943, the 1937 electoral college chose the president, as it was felt that a popular election could not be arranged due to the martial law (1940) and the Continuation War (1943). In 1944 special legislation directly stipulated that Marshal Mannerheim be elected president for six years after Risto Ryti had resigned mid-term. In 1946, special legislation empowered the Parliament to choose a successor for the remainder of Mannerheim&#x27;s term (until 1950), the latter having resigned. Then Prime Minister Juho Kusti Paasikivi was elected president by the Parliament. In 1973, special legislation extended President Urho Kekkonen&#x27;s term by four years until 1978, when he was re-elected regularly.

==Inauguration==
The president-elect, accompanied by the Speaker of the Parliament and the outgoing president, assumes office on the first day of the month following the election by making a solemn affirmation in both Finnish and Swedish at a ceremony in Parliament House. The affirmation is specified in Section 56 of the Constitution, and in English reads &quot;I, [N. N.], elected by the people of Finland as the President of the Republic, hereby affirm that in my presidential duties I shall sincerely and conscientiously observe the Constitution and the laws of the Republic, and to the best of my ability promote the wellbeing of the people of Finland.&quot;

The term of the president-elect begins at the moment the affirmation has been made (around 12:20 on the day of the inauguration). After the inauguration, the new president, accompanied by their predecessor, inspects the guard of honour outside Parliament House.

== Presidential sessions ==
The president exercises governmental powers &quot;in council&quot; with the Finnish Government, echoing the royal &quot;curia regis&quot;. The session is customarily arranged once a week. There is quorum of five ministers and the chancellor of justice is present as well. In the session, the respective ministers present the topic and a proposal for decision. Based on the proposal, the president makes his decision. The president may depart from the proposal and may return the proposal to the Government for reconsideration. There is no voting and normally there are no speeches aside from the aforementioned proposals. Except for approvals of new laws and appointments, the Government may present the issue to the Parliament, which will make the final decision on the matter on the Government&#x27;s proposal.

==Duties and powers==
The president&#x27;s functions and powers are directly defined in the Constitution. In addition to those specified there, the president also discharges functions assigned to the president in other laws. Under the Constitution of Finland, executive power is vested in the president and the Government, which must enjoy the confidence of parliament. This principle is reflected in other provisions of the constitution concerning the president&#x27;s functions and powers dealing with legislation, decrees, and appointment of public officials. Custom dictates that the president renounces any party affiliation while serving, to remain above day-to-day politics.

The president was originally vested with fairly broad executive power, particularly in the realm of foreign policy. Constitutional amendments enacted in 1999 reduced the president&#x27;s powers somewhat, and the president now shares executive authority with the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, presidents are still seen as providing a measure of stability, given that it is all but impossible for one party to win an outright majority in Parliament.

===Ordering premature parliamentary elections===
Upon the proposal of the prime minister, the president may, having consulted the parliamentary groups and while Parliament is in session, order the holding of premature parliamentary election. The new parliament is chosen for a normal four-year term. Parliament itself may decide when to end its session before the election day. From 1919 to 1991 the president&#x27;s power to order a premature election was unqualified and he could do so whenever considered necessary. Presidents have ordered premature parliamentary elections on seven occasions. The president declares each annual session of parliament open and closes the last Annual Session. This is done in a speech at each opening and closing ceremony.

===Appointing and discharging ministers===
The prime minister and other members of the Government are appointed and discharged by the president of the republic. After parliamentary elections or in any other situation where the government has resigned, the president, taking into account the result of consultations between the parliamentary groups and having heard the view of the speaker, submits a nominee for prime minister to Parliament. If confirmed by Parliament with a majority of the votes cast, the president then proceeds to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. The president is constitutionally required to dismiss a government or any minister as soon as that government has lost the confidence of Parliament.

===Appointing powers===

The president appoints:
*Governor, and other members of the board of the Bank of Finland
*Chancellor of justice and the vice-chancellor of justice
*Prosecutor-general and the vice prosecutor-general
*Ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions abroad
*Executive of Kela (Social Insurance Institution)
*Secretary general and presenters at Office of the President of the Republic

Most of the appointment process is conducted at the respective ministry: The Office of the President does not process preparations or presentations of the appointment. Nevertheless, presidents have used these powers publicly, even against the internal recommendation of the agency.

In addition, the president appoints or gives commission to:
*Officers of the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard
*Permanent judges, including presidents and members of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court, presidents and members of the courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal.

===International relations===
The president conducts Finland&#x27;s foreign policy in co-operation with the Finnish Government. The provisions of treaties and other international obligations that affect domestic legislation are implemented by acts of parliament. Otherwise, international obligations are implemented by a presidential decree. Decisions on war and peace are taken by the president with the assent of parliament.

===Legislation===
The president must sign and approve all bills adopted by Parliament before they become law. The president must decide on ratification within three months of receiving the bill and may request an opinion from the Supreme Court or the Supreme Administrative Court before giving assent. Should the president refuse assent or fail to decide on the matter in time, Parliament reconsiders the bill and can readopt it with a majority of votes cast. The bill will then enter into force without ratification. If Parliament fails to readopt the bill, it is deemed to have lapsed. Presidential vetoes are generally successful in preventing a bill from becoming law.

===Presidential pardon===
In single cases, the president has the power of pardon from any imprisonment, fine, or forfeiture. General pardon requires an act of parliament.

The power of pardon has effectively become the instrument to limit life imprisonment to 12 years or more, since successive presidents have eventually given pardon to all felons. The president, however, retains the power to deny pardon. In autumn 2006, the regular paroling of convicts serving a life sentence power was transferred to the Helsinki Court of Appeals, and the peculiar arrangement, where the president exercises judicial power, ended. The presidential power of giving pardon is, however, retained. Its use has diminished under president Sauli Niinistö, who exercised the power particularly sparingly.

===Commander-in-chief of the defence forces===
The president of the republic is the commander-in-chief of the Finnish Defence Forces, but may delegate this position to another Finnish citizen. Delegation of the position of commander-in-chief is an exception to the principle that the president cannot delegate functions to others. The last time this has occurred was in the Second World War (to Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim). The president commissions officers and decides on the mobilisation of the Defence Forces. If Parliament is not in session when a decision to mobilise is taken, it must be immediately convened. As commander-in-chief, the president has the power to issue military orders concerning general guidelines for military defence, significant changes in military preparedness and the principles according to which military defence is implemented.

Decisions concerning military orders are made by the president in conjunction with the prime minister, and the minister of defence. The president decides on military appointments in conjunction with the minister of defence.

===Emergency powers===
Under the Preparedness Act, in exceptional circumstances the president may issue a decree authorising the government to exercise emergency powers for up to one year at a time. The decree must be submitted to Parliament for its approval. Should the powers available under the Preparedness Act prove inadequate in an emergency, additional powers can be assumed under the State of Defence Act. The president may declare a state of defence by decree for a maximum of three months initially. If necessary, it can be extended for a maximum of one year at a time. A state of defence may also be declared in a region of the country. The decree must be submitted to parliament for approval.

===Decorations===


The president, as grand master, awards decorations and medals belonging to the Order of the White Rose of Finland, the Order of the Lion of Finland and the Order of the Cross of Liberty to Finnish and foreign citizens. Likewise, titles of honor are awarded by the president; these include, for example, &quot;professor&quot; and different &quot;counsellor&quot; titles. These titles are symbolic, carry no responsibilities and have a similar role as knighting in monarchies. The highest titles are &quot;valtioneuvos&quot; (statesman) and &quot;vuorineuvos&quot; (industrial).
===Speeches===

The president makes a number of important public speeches and statements each year. The most notable of these are the annual New Year&#x27;s Speech on 1 January, and the speech at the opening of each annual session of parliament.

==Compensation==
From 2012 to 2013, the president received an annual salary of 160,000 euros. The salary and other benefits are exempt from all taxes. In 2013, the salary was cut to 126,000 euros on the initiative of Sauli Niinistö. As of 1 March 2024, the salary was restored to its previous amount of 160,000 euros. In addition to the salary the president is entitled to an apartment as well as necessary staff. Any president who serves for six years or longer is entitled to a full pension at &quot;sixty percent of the currently valid remuneration of the president of the republic&quot; as well as living arrangements. The president&#x27;s salary and housing benefits are tax-free.

==Presidents of Finland==

==Official residences==

The president has the use of three properties for residential and hospitality purposes: the Presidential Palace and Mäntyniemi, both in Helsinki, and Kultaranta in Naantali on the west coast near Turku.

==Incapacity and succession==

The president of Finland does not have a vice president. If the president is temporarily prevented from performing his or her duties, the prime minister or the deputy prime minister serves as acting president until the president&#x27;s incapacity ceases. If the president dies in office or if the Government declares that the president is permanently unable to carry out the duties of office, a new election is triggered to determine a successor. If the president, the prime minister, and the deputy prime minister are all temporarily unavailable, the most senior minister of the government, in years of service, becomes the acting president. The parliament can override these rules by means of an emergency constitutional amendment passed by a majority of at least 5/6, and has done so on multiple occasions.

==Impeachment==
If the chancellor of justice, the parliamentary ombudsman or the Government deem that the president is guilty of treason or high treason, or crimes against humanity, the matter shall be communicated to Parliament. If Parliament, by three-fourths of the votes cast, decides that charges are to be brought, the Prosecutor-General prosecutes the president in the High Court of Impeachment and the president abstains from office for the duration of the proceedings. There is, however, no mechanism laid out in the Constitution or other laws for removing a president from office.

==Independence Day Reception==
The traditional Independence Day Reception (in Finnish: &quot;Linnanjuhlat&quot;, &quot;the Castle Ball&quot;) at the Presidential Palace on 6 December is one of the key annual events in the presidential calendar. It originated as a celebration of Finland&#x27;s national independence and pride, and although nowadays it is seen by some as a glorified social party, the reception is broadcast every year on Finnish television and has very high viewer ratings. The number of guests invited has varied from about 1,600 to 2,000. With the exception of ambassadors to Finland, only Finnish citizens are invited.

The history of the Independence Day reception stretches back to 1919, when the first afternoon reception was held at the Presidential Palace. In 1922, President Ståhlberg hosted the first evening reception at the palace, with the reception beginning at nine o&#x27; clock. Guests included the Government, diplomats, Members of Parliament, high-ranking officers, senior civil servants, artists and other prominent people. Music and dancing were on the programme and the reception lasted until late night. Similar receptions have been held ever since, though less regularly in the beginning.

Since 1946 the Independence Day reception has taken place at the Presidential Palace every year with six exceptions. In 1952 it was cancelled on account of President Paasikivi&#x27;s illness. In 1972 it was held at Finlandia Hall in connection with the Independence Day concert, with the Prime Minister as host, because the Presidential Palace was being renovated. In 1974 it was cancelled on account of the death of President Kekkonen&#x27;s wife only a few days prior to the reception. In 1981 it was held at Finlandia Hall after the Independence Day concert, with Deputy Prime Minister Eino Uusitalo as host, because President Kekkonen had resigned in October and Acting President Mauno Koivisto was campaigning for the presidency. In 2013, the reception was held at the Tampere Hall in central Tampere, because the Presidential Palace in Helsinki was undergoing repairs at the time. This was the first time during the era of independence that the reception was held outside Helsinki. In 2020, the reception was cancelled because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The president and president&#x27;s spouse greet the guests individually in the State Hall at the beginning of the evening. Later on there is dancing, music provided by the Guards Band, and a traditional buffet.

==History==

After Finland&#x27;s independence and the Civil War in Finland the matter of whether Finland should be a republic or a constitutional monarchy was much debated (see Frederick Charles of Hesse), and the outcome was a compromise: a rather monarchy-like, strong presidency with great powers over Finland&#x27;s foreign affairs, the appointment of the Government and the officers of the civil service. The Constitution was changed in 2000, to redistribute some of this power to Parliament and the Government. The Constitution specifies how the principles of parliamentarism are to be followed. Most significantly, the president can no longer nominate the prime minister or individual ministers independently. For example, this power was previously used to form governments where the party in plurality was excluded. Regarding the right to dissolve Parliament, consultation with the prime minister and heads of parliamentary groups was made mandatory before Parliament could be dissolved and new elections ordered. Furthermore, some appointing powers, such as appointment of provincial governors and department heads at ministries, were transferred to the Government.

===Pre-republican heads of state===
From the declaration of Finland&#x27;s independence on 6 December 1917 until the end of the Finnish Civil War in May 1918, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the head of state of White Finland in his capacity as chairman of the Senate. Between May 1918 and July 1919, Finland had two regents (, , lit. &quot;Care-taker of State&quot;) and, for a time, an elected king, although the latter renounced the throne:

*Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, Regent (18 May 1918 – 12 December 1918)
**Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, elected as King of Finland on 7 October 1918 but never took office and renounced the throne on 4 December after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War Ihe had not time enough to arrive in Finland before the political climate changed following the end of the war. It is said that his regnal name was to be &quot;Väinö I of Finland&quot; (&quot;Väinö&quot; obviously referring to Väinämöinen, one of the main characters in the Finnish national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;), but due to there not being contemporary records of this name it is widely considered a popular misbelief, probably created by columnist &quot;Väinö&quot; Nuorteva.
*Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Regent (12 December 1918 – 26 July 1919)

Both Svinhufvud and Mannerheim later served as president of Finland.

<text>Ecological classification or ecological typology is the classification of land or water into geographical units that represent variation in one or more ecological features. Traditional approaches focus on geology, topography, biogeography, soils, vegetation, climate conditions, living species, habitats, water resources, and sometimes also factors. Most approaches pursue the cartographical delineation or regionalisation of distinct areas for mapping and planning.

== Approaches to classifications==
Different approaches to ecological classifications have been developed in terrestrial, freshwater and marine disciplines. Traditionally these approaches have focused on biotic components (vegetation classification), abiotic components (environmental approaches) or implied ecological and evolutionary processes (biogeographical approaches). &quot;Ecosystem classifications&quot; are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and the physical space they occupy (ecotope).

===Vegetation classification===
Vegetation is often used to classify terrestrial ecological units. Vegetation classification can be based on vegetation structure and floristic composition. Classifications based entirely on vegetation structure overlap with land cover mapping categories.

Many schemes of vegetation classification are in use by the land, resource and environmental management agencies of different national and state jurisdictions. The International Vegetation Classification (IVC or EcoVeg) has been recently proposed but has not been yet widely adopted.

Vegetation classifications have limited use in aquatic systems, since only a handful of freshwater or marine habitats are dominated by plants (e.g. kelp forests or seagrass meadows). Also, some extreme terrestrial environments, like subterranean or cryogenic ecosystems, are not properly described in vegetation classifications.

===Biogeographical approach===
The disciplines of phytogeography and biogeography study the geographic distribution of plant communities and faunal communities. Common patterns of distribution of several taxonomic groups are generalised into bioregions, floristic provinces or zoogeographic regions.

===Environmental approach===
Climate classifications are used in terrestrial disciplines due to the major influence of climate on biological life in a region. The most popular classification scheme is probably the Köppen climate classification scheme. Similarly geological and soil properties can affect terrestrial vegetation.

In marine disciplines, the stratification of water layers discriminate types based on the availability of light and nutrient, or changes in biogeochemical properties.

===Ecosystem classifications===
American geographer Robert Bailey defined a hierarchy of ecosystem units ranging from micro-ecosystems (individual homogeneous sites, in the order of in area), through meso-ecosystems (landscape mosaics, in the order of ) to macro-ecosystems (ecoregions, in the order of ).

Bailey outlined five different methods for identifying ecosystems: &quot;gestalt&quot; (&quot;a whole that is not derived through considerable of its parts&quot;), in which regions are recognized and boundaries drawn intuitively; a map overlay system where different layers like geology, landforms and soil types are overlain to identify ecosystems; multivariate clustering of site attributes; digital image processing of remotely sensed data grouping areas based on their appearance or other spectral properties; or by a &quot;controlling factors method&quot; where a subset of factors (like soils, climate, vegetation physiognomy or the distribution of plant or animal species) are selected from a large array of possible ones are used to delineate ecosystems.

In contrast with Bailey&#x27;s methodology, Puerto Rico ecologist Ariel Lugo and coauthors identified ten characteristics of an effective classification system. For example that it be based on georeferenced, quantitative data; that it should minimize subjectivity and explicitly identify criteria and assumptions; that it should be structured around the factors that drive ecosystem processes; that it should reflect the hierarchical nature of ecosystems; that it should be flexible enough to conform to the various scales at which ecosystem management operates.

The International Union for The Conservation of Nature (IUCN) developed a global ecosystem typology that conforms to the definition of ecosystems as ecological units that comprise a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and occupy a finite physical space or ecotope. This typology is based on six design principles: representation of ecological processes, representation of biota, conceptual consistency throughout the biosphere, scalable structure, spatially explicit units, parsimony and utility. This approach has led to a dual representation of ecosystem functionality and composition within a flexible hierarchical structure that can be built from a top-down approach (subdivision of upper units by function) and a bottom-up approach (representation of compositional variation within functional units).

<text>A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages which can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. As a protective reflex, coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation, a forced exhalation against a closed glottis, and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.

Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Irregular coughing is usually caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking, smoking, air pollution, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, post-nasal drip, chronic bronchitis, lung tumors, heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta blockers.

Treatment should target the cause; for example, smoking cessation or discontinuing ACE inhibitors. Cough suppressants such as codeine or dextromethorphan are frequently prescribed, but are not recommended for children. Other treatment options may target airway inflammation or may promote mucus expectoration. As it is a natural protective reflex, suppressing the cough reflex might have damaging effects, especially if the cough is productive (producing phlegm).

==Presentation==
===Complications===
The complications of coughing can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute complications include cough syncope (fainting spells due to decreased blood flow to the brain when coughs are prolonged and forceful), insomnia, cough-induced vomiting, subconjunctival hemorrhage or &quot;red eye&quot;, coughing defecation and in women with a prolapsed uterus, cough urination. Chronic complications are common and include abdominal or pelvic hernias, fatigue fractures of lower ribs and costochondritis. Chronic or violent coughing can contribute to damage to the pelvic floor and a possible cystocele.

==Differential diagnosis==
A cough in children may be either a normal physiological reflex or due to an underlying cause. In healthy children it may be normal in the absence of any disease to cough ten times a day. The most common cause of an acute or subacute cough is a viral respiratory tract infection. A healthy adult also coughs 18.6 times a day on average, but in the population with respiratory disease the geometric mean frequency is 275 times a day. In adults with a chronic cough, i.e. a cough longer than 8 weeks, more than 90% of cases are due to post-nasal drip, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The causes of chronic cough are similar in children with the addition of bacterial bronchitis.

===Infections===
A cough can be the result of a respiratory tract infection such as the common cold, COVID-19, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, pertussis, or tuberculosis. In the vast majority of cases, acute coughs, i.e. coughs shorter than 3 weeks, are due to the common cold. In people with a normal chest X-ray, tuberculosis is a rare finding. Pertussis is increasingly being recognised as a cause of troublesome coughing in adults.

After a respiratory tract infection has cleared, the person may be left with a postinfectious cough. This typically is a dry, non-productive cough that produces no phlegm. Symptoms may include a tightness in the chest, and a tickle in the throat. This cough may often persist for weeks after an illness. The cause of the cough may be inflammation similar to that observed in repetitive stress disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome. The repetition of coughing produces inflammation which produces discomfort, which in turn produces more coughing. Postinfectious cough typically does not respond to conventional cough treatments. Medication used for postinfectious coughs may include ipratropium to treat the inflammation, as well as cough suppressants to reduce frequency of the cough until inflammation clears. Inflammation may increase sensitivity to other existing issues such as allergies, and treatment of other causes of coughs (such as use of an air purifier or allergy medicines) may help speed recovery.

===Reactive airway disease===
When coughing is the only complaint of a person who meets the criteria for asthma (bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversibility), this is termed cough-variant asthma. Atopic cough and eosinophilic bronchitis are related conditions. Atopic cough occurs in individuals with a family history of atopy (an allergic condition), abundant eosinophils in the sputum, but with normal airway function and responsiveness. Eosinophilic bronchitis is characterized by eosinophils in sputum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid without airway hyperresponsiveness or an atopic background. This condition responds to treatment with corticosteroids. Cough can also worsen in an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Asthma is a common cause of chronic cough in adults and children. Coughing may be the only symptom the person has from their asthma, or asthma symptoms may also include wheezing, shortness of breath, and a tight feeling in their chest. Depending on how severe the asthma is, it can be treated with bronchodilators (medicine which causes the airways to open up) or inhaled steroids. Treatment of the asthma should make the cough go away.

Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as a persistent cough that produces sputum (phlegm) and mucus, for at least three months in two consecutive years. Chronic bronchitis is often the cause of &quot;smoker&#x27;s cough&quot;. The tobacco smoke causes inflammation, secretion of mucus into the airway, and difficulty clearing that mucus out of the airways. Coughing helps clear those secretions out. May be treated by quitting smoking. May also be caused by pneumoconiosis and long-term fume inhalation.

===Gastroesophageal reflux===
In people with unexplained cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease should be considered. This occurs when acidic contents of the stomach come back up into the esophagus. Symptoms usually associated with GERD include heartburn, sour taste in the mouth, or a feeling of acid reflux in the chest, although, more than half of the people with cough from GERD do not have any other symptoms. An esophageal pH monitor can confirm the diagnosis of GERD. Sometimes GERD can complicate respiratory ailments related to cough, such as asthma or bronchitis. The treatment involves anti-acid medications and lifestyle changes with surgery indicated in cases not manageable with conservative measures.

===Air pollution===
Coughing may be caused by air pollution including tobacco smoke, particulate matter, irritant gases, and dampness in a home.
The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body&#x27;s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, the individual&#x27;s health status and genetics. People who exercise outdoors on hot, smoggy days, for example, increase their exposure to pollutants in the air.

===Foreign body===
A foreign body can sometimes be suspected, for example if the cough started suddenly when the patient was eating. Rarely, sutures left behind inside the airway branches can cause coughing. A cough can be triggered by dryness from mouth breathing or recurrent aspiration of food into the windpipe in people with swallowing difficulties.

===Drug-induced cough===
Drugs used for treatments other than coughs, such as ACE inhibitors which are often used to treat high blood pressure, can sometimes cause cough as a side effect, and stopping their use will stop the cough. Beta blockers similarly cause cough as an adverse event.

===Habit cough===
A habit cough is one that responds to behavioral or psychiatric therapy after organic causes have been excluded. Absence of the cough during sleep is common, but not diagnostic. A tic cough is thought to be more common in children than in adults.
===Neurogenic cough===
Some cases of chronic cough may be attributed to a sensory neuropathic disorder. Treatment for neurogenic cough may include the use of certain neuralgia medications. Coughing may occur in tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome, although it should be distinguished from throat-clearing in this disorder.

===Other===
Cough may also be caused by conditions affecting the lung tissue such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases and sarcoidosis. Coughing can also be triggered by benign or malignant lung tumors or mediastinal masses. Through irritation of the nerve, diseases of the external auditory canal (wax, for example) can also cause cough. Cardiovascular diseases associated with cough are heart failure, pulmonary infarction and aortic aneurysm. Nocturnal cough is associated with heart failure, as the left ventricle doesn&#x27;t effectively pump blood forward, resulting in blood being backed up in the pulmonary veins, which in turn causing pulmonary edema and resultant cough. Other causes of nocturnal cough include asthma, post-nasal drip and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Another cause of cough occurring preferentially in supine position is recurrent aspiration.

Given its irritant nature to mammal tissues, capsaicin is widely used to determine the cough threshold and as a tussive stimulant in clinical research of cough suppressants. Capsaicin is what makes chili peppers spicy, and might explain why workers in factories with these fruits can develop a cough.

Coughing may also be used for social reasons, and as such is not always involuntary. A voluntary cough, often written as &quot;ahem&quot;, can be used to attract attention or express displeasure, as a form of nonverbal, paralingual metacommunication.

===Airway clearance===

Coughing, and huffing are important ways of removing mucus as sputum in many conditions such as cystic fibrosis, and chronic bronchitis.

==Pathophysiology==

A cough is a protective reflex in healthy individuals which is influenced by psychological factors. The cough reflex is initiated by stimulation of two different classes of afferent nerves, namely the myelinated rapidly adapting receptors, and nonmyelinated C-fibers with endings in the lung.

==Diagnostic approach==
The type of cough may help in the diagnosis. For instance, an inspiratory &quot;whooping&quot; sound on coughing almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis.

Blood may occur in small amounts with severe cough of many causes, but larger amounts suggests bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, or primary lung cancer.

Further workup may include labs, x-rays, and spirometry.

===Classification===
A cough can be classified by its duration, character, quality, and timing. The duration can be either acute (of sudden onset) if it is present less than three weeks, subacute if it is present between three or eight weeks, and chronic when lasting longer than eight weeks. A cough can be non-productive (dry) or productive (when phlegm is produced that may be coughed up as sputum). It may occur only at night (then called &quot;nocturnal cough&quot;), during both night and day, or just during the day.

A number of characteristic coughs exist. While these have not been found to be diagnostically useful in adults, they are of use in children. A barky cough is part of the common presentation of croup. A staccato cough has been classically described with neonatal chlamydial pneumonia.

==Treatment==

The treatment of a cough in children is based on the underlying cause. In children half of cases go away without treatment in 10 days and 90% in 25 days.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics the use of cough medicine to relieve cough symptoms is supported by little evidence and thus not recommended for treating cough symptoms in children. There is tentative evidence that the use of honey is better than no treatment or diphenhydramine in decreasing coughing. It does not alleviate coughing to the same extent as dextromethorphan but it shortens the cough duration better than placebo and salbutamol. A trial of antibiotics or inhaled corticosteroids may be tried in children with a chronic cough in an attempt to treat protracted bacterial bronchitis or asthma respectively. There is insufficient evidence to recommend treating children who have a cough that is not related to a specific condition with inhaled anti-cholinergics.

Because coughing can spread disease through infectious aerosol droplets, it is recommended to cover one&#x27;s mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief while coughing.

==Traditional medicine==
One of the pharmaceutical dosage forms in traditional medicine for treatment of coughs was linctus. A linctus is a medicine in the form of a syrup, taken to relieve coughs and sore throats. The linctus is a syrup that helps relieve dry coughs.

==Epidemiology==
A cough is the most common reason for visiting a primary care physician in the United States.

==Other animals==
Marine mammals such as dolphins and whales cannot cough. Some invertebrates such as insects and spiders cannot cough or sneeze. Crocodiles can cough. Domestic animals and vertebrates such as dogs and cats can cough, because of diseases, allergies, dust or choking. In particular, cats are known for coughing before spitting up a hairball.

In other domestic animals, horses can cough because of infections, or due to poor ventilation and dust in enclosed spaces. Kennel cough in dogs can result from a viral or bacterial infection.

Deer can cough similarly to humans as a result of respiratory tract infections, such as parasitic bronchitis caused by a species of &quot;Dictyocaulus&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Tennessee&quot; (BB-43) was the lead ship of the of dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1910s. The &quot;Tennessee&quot; class was part of the standard series of twelve battleships built in the 1910s and 1920s, and were developments of the preceding . They were armed with a battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets. &quot;Tennessee&quot; served in the Pacific Fleet for duration of her peacetime career. She spent the 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises, including the annual Fleet Problems, and cruises around the Americas and further abroad, such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was moored in Battleship Row when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which brought the United States into World War II. She was not seriously damaged, and after being repaired she operated off the West Coast of the US in 1942. In 1943, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and many of the older battleships were thoroughly rebuilt to prepare them for operations in the Pacific War and in June–August, she took part in the Aleutian Islands Campaign, providing gunfire support to troops fighting to retake the islands. The Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign followed from November 1943 to February 1944, including the Battles of Tarawa, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok. In March, she raided Kavieng to distract Japanese forces during the landing on Emirau, and from June through September, she fought in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, bombarding Japanese forces during the Battles of Saipan, Guam, Tinian, and Anguar.

The Philippines campaign followed in September, during which the ship operated as part of the bombardment group at the Battle of Leyte. The Japanese launched a major naval counterattack that resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, a series of four naval engagements. During the Battle of Surigao Strait, &quot;Tennessee&quot; formed part of the US line of battle that defeated a Japanese squadron; this was the last battleship engagement in history. &quot;Tennessee&quot; shelled Japanese forces during the Battle of Iwo Jima in February 1945 and the Battle of Okinawa from March to June. During the latter action, she was hit by a kamikaze but was not seriously damaged. In the final months of the war, she operated primarily in the East China Sea, and after Japan&#x27;s surrender in August, she participated in the occupation of Japan before returning to the US late in the year. In the postwar reduction of naval forces, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was placed in the reserve fleet in 1946 and retained, out of service, until 1959, when the Navy decided to discard her. The ship was sold to Bethlehem Steel in July and broken up for scrap.

==Design==
The two &quot;Tennessee&quot;-class battleships were authorized on 3 March 1915, and they were in most respects repeats of the earlier s, the primary differences being enlarged bridges, greater elevation for the main battery turrets, and relocation of the secondary battery to the upper deck.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Westinghouse turbo-electric transmission and eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 57 officers and 1,026 enlisted men. As built, she was fitted with two lattice masts with spotting tops for the main gun battery. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was the first American battleship designed for electric drive.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve /50 caliber guns in four, three-gun turrets on the centerline, placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of the superstructure. Unlike earlier American battleships with triple turrets, these mounts allowed each barrel to elevate independently. Since &quot;Tennessee&quot; had been completed after the Battle of Jutland, which demonstrated the value of very long-range fire, her main battery turrets were modified while still under construction to allow elevation to 30 degrees. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /51 caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. Initially, the ship was to have been fitted with twenty-two of the guns, but experiences in the North Sea during World War I demonstrated that the additional guns, which would have been placed in the hull, would have been unusable in anything but calm seas. As a result, the casemates were plated over to prevent flooding. The secondary battery was augmented with four /50 caliber guns. In addition to her gun armament, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was also fitted with two torpedo tubes, mounted submerged in the hull, one on each broadside.

&quot;Tennessee&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. Her conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

===Construction – 1941 ===

The keel for &quot;Tennessee&quot; was laid down on 14 May 1917 at the New York Naval Shipyard; her completed hull was launched on 30 April 1919. Fitting-out work then commenced, and on 3 June 1920, the completed ship was commissioned into the fleet. Captain Richard H. Leigh served as the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. &quot;Tennessee&quot; then began sea trials in Long Island Sound, which lasted from 15 to 23 October. On 30 October, while moored in New York, one of her electric generators exploded and destroyed the turbine, wounding two men. Repair work was completed and problems with her propulsion system that were identified during trials were corrected, and on 26 February 1921, &quot;Tennessee&quot; got underway for further trials off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She then steamed north, headed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving on 19 March. She proceeded to Dahlgren, Virginia for shooting training to calibrate her guns. Maintenance in Boston followed, and two of her 5-inch guns were removed. before the ship moved to Rockland, Maine for full-power trials. With her working up now complete, she stopped in New York before steaming south, transiting the Panama Canal, and joining the Battleship Force, Pacific Fleet, in San Pedro, Los Angeles on 17 June.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the ships of the Pacific Fleet (re-designated as the Battle Fleet in 1922 and again as the Battle Force in 1931) conducted a routine of training exercises, the annual Fleet Problems, and periodic maintenance. The Fleet Problems began in 1923 and typically involved most major units of the US Navy and involved a variety of tactical and strategic war games, and they were conducted in many different locations, including in the Caribbean Sea, the area around the Panama Canal Zone, the Pacific, and the Atlantic. In early 1922, she took part in fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean that saw the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets combine for large-scale training exercises. The maneuvers included elements of the fleets simulating attacks and defenses of the Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, and Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The Pacific Fleet returned home in April. &quot;Tennessee&quot; placed first in 1922 and 1923 for accurate shooting among units of the Battle Fleet, and she earned the Battle &quot;E&quot; award in 1923 and 1924; during this period, her commander was Captain Luke McNamee.
The Fleet Problems laid the ground work for the US Navy&#x27;s campaigns during the Pacific War; among the lessons learned by the fleet&#x27;s officers was the importance of the developing aircraft carrier force, which proved to be more than a simple scouting element. Combined operations also revealed that the slow 21-knot battleships were a significant hindrance to the much faster carriers and led to the development of the fast battleships of the , , and es. The Battle Fleet conducted joint Army-Navy exercises to evaluate the defenses of Pearl Harbor in 1925 as part of Fleet Problem V, which also included maneuvers off the coast of California. Later that year the fleet steamed across the Pacific to visit Australia and New Zealand on a goodwill tour. The fleet returned to San Pedro in September. A three-month visit to Hawaii began in April 1927. In 1928, she had a crane and an aircraft catapult on her fantail to accommodate reconnaissance floatplanes.

Her original 3-inch antiaircraft (AA) battery was replaced by eight /25 caliber guns during 1929–1930. Fleet Problems X and XI were held together in the Caribbean in March and April 1930, and following their conclusion &quot;Tennessee&quot; visited New York for a month before departing for home on 19 May. In June, she embarked on a tour of the Hawaiian islands that lasted for fourteen months, finally returning to California in February 1932. She thereafter conducted routine operations off the west coast for the next year and a half until October 1934, when she crossed back to the Atlantic for further training there. The rest of the 1930s followed the usual routine. In around 1935, the ship received eight .50-cal. M2 Browning machine-guns. In 1940, two 3-inch guns were re-installed, one on either side of the forward superstructure.

Fleet Problem XXI, the last iteration of the series, was held in early 1940; afterward, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered that the Battle Force transfer its homeport from San Pedro to Pearl Harbor in response to rising tension with Japan over the latter&#x27;s waging of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Roosevelt hoped the move would deter further Japanese expansionism. &quot;Tennessee&quot; steamed to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs before moving to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 12 August. Fleet Problem XXII was scheduled for early 1941, but it was cancelled due to World War II. &quot;Tennessee&quot; spent the rest of 1941 with small-scale training operations in the Pacific; by December, she was at anchor in Pearl Harbor with the rest of the fleet.

=== World War II ===

==== Pearl Harbor ====

&quot;Tennessee&quot; was moored along Battleship Row, to the southeast of Ford Island, on the morning of 7 December when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The battleship was tied up alongside, was ahead with abreast, and was astern. The first Japanese attack arrived at about 07:55, prompting &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s crew to go to general quarters; it took some five minutes for the men to get the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns into action. The ship received orders to get underway to respond to the attack, but before the crew got steam up in her boilers, she was trapped as the other battleships around her received crippling damage. &quot;West Virginia&quot; was torpedoed and sunk and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; capsized after being torpedoed. Shortly thereafter, dive bombers arrived overhead and fighters strafed the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft batteries. &quot;Arizona&quot; exploded after being hit by an armor-piercing bomb that detonated her magazines, spilling burning fuel oil into the water. The explosion also showered burning oil over &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s stern, and she was quickly surrounded by fire, which was augmented by oil leaking from &quot;West Virginia&quot;.

At 08:20, Japanese bombers hit &quot;Tennessee&quot; twice; both bombs were converted large-caliber naval shells, the same type that had destroyed &quot;Arizona&quot;, but neither detonated properly. The first partially penetrated the roof of turret III, failing to explode but sending fragments into the turret that disabled one of the guns. The second bomb hit turret II&#x27;s center gun barrel and exploded, sending bomb fragments flying; one of these fragments killed the captain of &quot;West Virginia&quot;, Mervyn S. Bennion, who had walked out to the open bridge. The blast disabled all three guns of that turret. Neither bomb inflicted serious damage, but the ship&#x27;s magazines were flooded to avoid the risk of the fires raging aboard and around the vessel from spreading to them and igniting the propellant charges stored there. By 10:30 the crew had suppressed the fires aboard the ship, though oil still burned in the water around the ship for another two days. In an effort to push the burning oil away from the ship, she turned her screws at a speed of . In the course of the battle, &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners were credited with shooting down or assisting in the destruction of five Japanese aircraft.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; remained trapped by the sunken battleships around her until &quot;Maryland&quot; could be pulled free on 9 December; she had been wedged into the dock by &quot;Oklahoma&quot; when she capsized and sank. The quays to which &quot;Tennessee&quot; had been moored had to be demolished to allow her to be towed out, as the sunken &quot;West Virginia&quot; had similarly forced her into them. This work was completed by 16 December, allowing the ship to be pulled slowly out past &quot;West Virginia&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. She was then taken into the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for repairs. The fires had warped her hull plates, damaged seams, and loosened rivets, all of which needed to be repaired before she could get underway for permanent repairs. Once the hull was again watertight and her III turret received a patch cover, she got underway for Puget Sound for permanent repairs on 20 December, in company with &quot;Maryland&quot; and , both of which had also received only minimal damage in the attack. The three battleships were escorted by four destroyers.

==== Repairs, training, and modernization ====

While en route to the west coast, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; to head to Mare Island for repairs, while the other two vessels continued on to Puget Sound. They reached the naval yard of 29 December, where permanent repairs and a modernization began. The portions of &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s hull plating and electrical wiring that had been damaged by the fire were replaced, and her aft lattice mast was replaced with a small tower. In place of her .50-caliber machine guns, she received a battery of sixteen guns in quadruple mounts and fourteen Oerlikon autocannon. New Mark 11 versions of her 14-inch guns replaced the old Mark 4 barrels. The work was completed by late February 1942, and &quot;Tennessee&quot; got underway on 25 February with &quot;Maryland&quot; and the battleship . The three battleships steamed to San Francisco, where they joined Task Force 1, commanded by Rear Admiral William S. Pye. The ships then began a series of training maneuvers that lasted for several months to prepare for the coming campaigns in the central Pacific.

In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Midway on 5 June, Pye took his ships to sea to defend against a possible incursion by the Japanese fleet after its defeat in the battle. By 14 June, the anticipated attack did not materialize, and so Pye turned his task force back to San Francisco. Task Force 1 went to sea again on 1 August for further training, and later that month &quot;Tennessee&quot; escorted the carrier to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 14 August. &quot;Hornet&quot; was on her way to the Guadalcanal campaign; Admiral Chester Nimitz did not deploy &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the rest of Task Force 1 to the campaign owing to their heavy use of fuel oil; at that time in the war, the fleet had just seven tankers available for operations, not enough to operate both the fast carrier task force and Pye&#x27;s battleships. Instead, &quot;Tennessee&quot; then steamed back east to Puget Sound for a reconstruction; by this time, her sister had been brought to Puget Sound to be thoroughly rebuilt after the Pearl Harbor raid, and the navy decided that &quot;Tennessee&quot; should be similarly modernized.
The work on &quot;Tennessee&quot; lasted nearly a year, and saw the ship radically altered. New anti-torpedo bulges were installed and her internal compartmentalization was improved to strengthen her resistance to underwater damage. Her superstructure was completely revised, with the old heavily armored conning tower being removed and a smaller tower was erected in its place to reduce interference with the anti-aircraft guns&#x27; fields of fire. The new tower had been removed from one of the s that had recently been rebuilt. The foremast was replaced with a tower mast that housed the bridge and the main battery director, and her second funnel was removed, with those boilers being trunked into an enlarged forward funnel. Horizontal protection was considerably strengthened to improve her resistance to air attack; 3 inches of special treatment steel (STS) was added to the deck over the magazines and of STS was added elsewhere.

The ship&#x27;s weapons suite was also overhauled. She received air-search radar and fire-control radars for her main and secondary batteries, the latter seeing the mixed battery of 51-caliber and 25-caliber 5-inch guns replaced by a uniform battery of sixteen 5-inch/38 caliber guns in eight twin mounts. These were controlled by four Mk 37 directors. The light anti-aircraft battery was again revised, now consisting of ten quadruple Bofors guns and forty-three 20 mm Oerlikons. The changes doubled the ship&#x27;s crew, to a total of 114 officers and 2,129 enlisted men. With the reconstruction completed, &quot;Tennessee&quot; returned to service on 7 May 1943 with a crew composed primarily of recent enlistees and began trials off Puget Sound. On 22 May, she departed for San Pedro to re-join the fleet.

==== The Aleutian Islands ====

On 31 May, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the heavy cruiser steamed out of San Pedro, bound for Adak, Alaska, where they arrived on 9 June. On arrival, Rear Admiral Howard Kingman, the commander of Battleship Division Two, came aboard the ship. The ship joined Task Force 16, which had been organized to support the Aleutian Islands Campaign to recapture the islands of Attu and Kiska from the Japanese. By the time &quot;Tennessee&quot; arrived, the task force had already retaken Attu, so &quot;Tennessee&quot; was initially occupied with patrolling for Japanese forces that might launch a counter-attack. American radar operators, including those aboard &quot;Tennessee&quot;, who were not familiar with operating the new equipment repeatedly made false reports of enemy contacts in the fog that blanketed the area. The supposed enemy contacts were in fact distant land masses that appeared to be ships that were much closer on the radar sets. These false reports culminated in the Battle of the Pips in late July, though &quot;Tennessee&quot; was not involved in that incident.

On 1 August, &quot;Tennessee&quot; received orders to approach Kiska and join the pre-invasion bombardment. At 13:10, she steamed into range, along with the battleship and three destroyers. &quot;Tennessee&quot; slowed, deployed paravanes from her bow to cut the mooring cables for any naval mines that might be in the area, and launched her Vought OS2U Kingfisher scout planes to spot the fall of her shells. By 16:10, she had closed to a distance of about from the beach and she opened fire with her 5-inch guns. Poor visibility hampered the ability of the Kingfishers to observe the ship&#x27;s fire, but she nevertheless began firing with her 14-inch guns at 16:24. She fired sixty 14-inch shells at the area of what had been a Japanese submarine base before checking her fire at 16:45, by which time visibility had further diminished. After recovering her Kingfishers, she and the rest of the ships steamed back to Adak.

Two weeks later, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was again sent to shell Kiska early on the morning of 15 August, now to support the landing of ground forces. She opened fire at 05:00, targeting Japanese coastal artillery batteries on Little Kiska Island. She then shifted fire with her main battery to target anti-aircraft batteries on Kiska proper while her 5-inch guns set an artillery observation position on Little Kiska on fire. Following the bombardment, the soldiers were landed, only to discover that the Japanese had already withdrawn from the island in July. &quot;Tennessee&quot; thereafter left the Aleutians and returned to San Francisco on 31 August, where she conducted extensive training exercises. After replenishing her ammunition and stores, she departed for Hawaii for further battle training. From there, she steamed to the New Hebrides, where the invasion fleet was preparing for operations in the Gilbert Islands.

==== The Gilbert and Marshall Islands ====

=====Battle of Tarawa=====

The first target of the Gilbert and Marshall campaign was the island of Betio, the main Japanese position in the Tarawa Atoll. In the ensuing Battle of Tarawa that began on 20 November, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot; provided extensive fire support as the marines struggled to fight their way ashore; while the initial preparatory bombardment had destroyed many crew-served weapons, it had not been sufficient to destroy Japanese beach defenses, a critical lesson the battle taught US forces. The two battleships withdrew from the area at nightfall to reduce the risk of a Japanese submarine attack before returning the next morning. The ships provided anti-aircraft support for the invasion fleet and shelled Japanese positions as the marines called in fire support requests. Both vessels withdrew again for the night and returned early on 22 November, by which time the Japanese had been pushed back to a small defensive position on the eastern end of the island. At 09:07, &quot;Tennessee&quot; began a 17-minute bombardment that saw her fire seventy 14-inch shells and 322 rounds from her secondary guns.

Later that day, the destroyers and detected the Japanese submarine and forced her to surface with depth charges. &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s 5-inch guns joined those of the destroyers engaging the submarine, scoring several hits before &quot;Frazier&quot; rammed and sank &quot;I-35&quot;. Fighting ashore ended the next day, 23 November, but &quot;Tennessee&quot; remained in the area until 3 December to guard against a possible Japanese counter-thrust. That evening, she got underway for Hawaii, where on 15 December she joined &quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; for the voyage to San Francisco. There, she received a coat of dazzle camouflage and began extensive bombardment training on 29 December. On 13 January 1944, she departed for Hawaii as part of Task Unit 53.5.1, arriving off Maui on 21 January. James Forrestal, then the Undersecretary of the Navy, boarded &quot;Tennessee&quot; that day, and on 29 January the fleet got underway for the Marshall Islands.

=====Battle of Kwajalein=====
The next operation, the assault on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshalls, began on 31 January. &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, and two destroyers formed the bombardment group, with &quot;Tennessee&quot; still serving as Kingman&#x27;s flagship, and they moved into positions some from the atoll&#x27;s twin islands of Roi-Namur. &quot;Tennessee&quot; launched her Kingfishers at 06:25 and opened fire at 07:01, targeting pillboxes and other defenses. Her fire was interrupted by a flight of carrier aircraft, which were engaged by Japanese anti-aircraft guns; as soon as the American planes cleared the area, &quot;Tennessee&quot; shelled the guns and suppressed their fire. She kept up her fire until 12:00, at which point she turned away and recovered her floatplanes to refuel them. With that accomplished, she returned to her firing position and shelled Roi and Namur until 17:00, when she withdrew to cover the escort carriers of the invasion fleet for the night.

During the first day&#x27;s bombardment, marines went ashore onto five smaller islands to secure passage into the lagoon, and minesweepers ensured the entrance was clear for the invasion force. &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Colorado&quot;, and the cruisers and steamed into their bombardment positions east of Roi and Namur on 1 February and resumed firing at 07:08 before the marines landed later that morning. Ground forces hit the beaches at around 12:00, and &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the other ships continued firing to support their advance until 12:45. The marines quickly captured Roi, but the Japanese defenders on Namur put up a strong defense before being defeated the next day. &quot;Tennessee&quot; steamed into the lagoon later on 2 February, where Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance and Rear Admiral Richard Conolly came aboard to meet with Forrestal, who later went ashore to inspect the battlefield.

=====Battle of Eniwetok=====

US forces completed the conquest of the Kwajalein Atoll by 7 February, and preparations for the move to Eniwetok Atoll further west began immediately. That day, &quot;Tennessee&quot; steamed to Majuro, which had become the US fleet&#x27;s primary anchorage and staging area in the Marshalls. There, she replenished fuel and ammunition and then returned to Kwajalein, where the invasion fleet was assembling. On 15 February, &quot;Tennessee&quot;, joined by &quot;Colorado&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, sortied in company with the invasion transports, screened by the Fast Carrier Task Force. Cruisers and destroyers conducted the initial bombardment on 17 February while minesweepers cleared the channel into the lagoon. At 09:15, &quot;Tennessee&quot; led the troopships into the lagoon and approached the initial invasion target, the island of Engebi. Small elements seized nearby islets that would be used as fire bases for field artillery, and late in the day, &quot;Tennessee&quot; used her secondary battery to support a marine reconnaissance company that set marker buoys to guide the assault craft the next day.

The ship remained in the lagoon overnight and at 07:00, the preliminary bombardment of Engebi began; &quot;Tennessee&quot; opened fire at 7:33 and the first wave of marines landed at 08:44. The island was quickly secured and forces immediately began to prepare to land at the other islands in the lagoon, primarily the main islands of Eniwetok and Parry Island. Troops landed on the former island after a short preparatory bombardment, and &quot;Tennessee&quot; spent much of 18 February anchored some from the island, bombarding Japanese positions as the marines ground their way across Eniwetok. That night, she fired star shells to illuminate the battlefield and prevent Japanese infiltrators from breaking through American lines. With the fight still raging on Eniwetok, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was diverted to support the landing on Parry Island with &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; the next morning.

Anchored just from the beach, &quot;Tennessee&quot; opened up a barrage of fire at 12:04 that continued throughout the day and into the morning of 22 February, interrupted only by the need to cease fire during air attacks to avoid accidentally hitting American aircraft. The bombardment leveled the island, demolishing all of the structures and knocking down all of the trees on Parry Island. The ship was so close to the beach that her 40 mm anti-aircraft guns could be used to attack the Japanese defenses. At 08:52 on 22 February, &quot;Tennessee&quot; checked her fire as the landing craft made their way to the beach. After that interlude, she again provided fire support to the marines as they fought their way through Japanese defenses. The island&#x27;s garrison quickly fell and the island was pronounced secured that afternoon. As a result of the much heavier bombardments of the Eniwetok campaign, American casualties were significantly lighter than those of Tarawa. The next day, &quot;Tennessee&quot; departed for Majuro, where she joined the battleships , , and &quot;Idaho&quot; and began preparations for the next operation.

==== Bismarck Archipelago ====
&quot;Tennessee&quot; and the three &quot;New Mexico&quot;-class battleships departed on 15 March as part of a task group that included two escort carriers and fifteen destroyers. The group&#x27;s target was the Japanese base at Kavieng in northern New Ireland, part of the Bismarck Archipelago. The attack was part of the final phase of Operation Cartwheel, the plan to isolate and neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul; while &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s unit raided Kavieng as a diversion, a marine force would land on Emirau. An airfield would then be built to complete the encirclement of Rabaul.

The ships arrived off Kavieng on the morning of 20 March. Poor visibility from rain squalls and low clouds masked their approach, and at 07:00 &quot;Tennessee&quot; launched her Kingfishers. A little over two hours later, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the other ships had closed to about and at 09:05, they opened fire while steaming at a speed of . The ships fired slowly to avoid wasting ammunition, since spotting shots was difficult owing to the weather. A coastal artillery battery took &quot;Tennessee&quot; under fire once she had closed to about ; her secondary guns replied with rapid fire as the Japanese gunners worked to find the range. Shells splashed close to her starboard side and she was straddled several times, forcing her to increase speed to and turning away to open the range, though she was not hit. She briefly ceased firing before re-engaging the artillery battery for ten minutes, after which no further fire was received.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; and the other battleships and destroyers cruised off Kavieng for another three hours, bombarding Japanese installations and coastal batteries, but the visibility continued to hamper the gunners. At 12:35 the American guns fell silent and the ships withdrew. By that time, the marines had landed on Emirau, which had not been defended by Japanese forces. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was detached from the fleet to return to Pearl Harbor by way of Purvis Bay and Efate, arriving there on 16 April for periodic maintenance in anticipation of the next major offensive in the Pacific.

==== The Mariana and Palau Islands ====


=====Saipan=====
The Pacific Fleet began its next major offensive, code-named Operation Forager, the invasion of the Mariana Islands. The fleet was divided into two groups, Task Force 52, which was to attack Saipan and Tinian, and Task Force 53, which would be directed against Guam. &quot;Tennessee&quot; joined the bombardment group for the former, Task Group 52.17, under the command of Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf, which also included &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot;, and &quot;Colorado&quot;. Task Force 52 assembled at Hawaii in mid-May and conducted landing exercises off Maui and Kahoolawe and then steamed to the Marshalls. On 10 June, Task Force 52 sortied to begin the operation, arriving off Saipan three days later. At 04:00 on 14 June, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the rest of TG 52.17 began the approach to their bombardment positions off the island; the first ships opened fire at 05:39 and &quot;Tennessee&quot; joined them nine minutes later. She targeted beach defenses that were engaging minesweepers clearing lanes for the landing craft on the south-western end of the island. Later in the morning, &quot;Tennessee&quot; attempted to suppress Japanese artillery batteries on Tinian that engaged the bombardment group and had scored hits on &quot;California&quot; and the destroyer . She then shifted her attention back to the landing zone, finally ceasing fire at 13:31 and withdrawing from the area. She spent the night to the west of the island.

In the early hours of 15 June, the invasion fleet moved into position and at 04:30, TG 52.17 began the pre-landing bombardment. &quot;Tennessee&quot; held her fire until 05:40, when she unleashed a barrage of shells from her primary, secondary, and 40 mm batteries at a range of . All shooting ceased at 06:30 to allow the carrier aircraft to make their attacks for the next thirty minutes. TG 52.17 resumed firing at 07:00 and continued until 08:12, when the amtracs and Higgins boats began to make their way to shore. As the marines fought their way ashore, &quot;Tennessee&quot; remained off the southern end of the landing zone, applying enfilading fire to support their advance. A battery of Japanese field guns hidden in a cave on Tinian opened fire on &quot;Tennessee&quot; and scored three hits, one of which disabled one of her secondary turrets; the other two did minimal damage and started a small fire. Eight men were killed and another twenty-five were wounded. The ship remained on station supporting the marines on Saipan but that afternoon, withdrew to make temporary repairs and protect the troop transports from the expected Japanese counterattack. She engaged a group of four dive-bombers that attacked the fleet that evening but scored no hits on them.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; returned to the invasion beach the next morning to resume providing fire support, which she continued into 17 June, helping to clear the way for American advances and to break up Japanese counter-assaults. By this time, Spruance had been informed that the Japanese carrier fleet was approaching, so the fleet reoriented itself to face the threat; &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the other old battleships moved to protect the invasion fleet transports. The Japanese were defeated by Spruance&#x27;s carrier force in the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, in which &quot;Tennessee&quot; did not participate. She refueled east of Saipan on 20 June before returning to the island the next day to resume bombardment duties. &quot;Tennessee&quot; left the Marianas on 22 June and sailed to Eniwetok, where she met the repair ship for permanent repairs to the damage sustained off Saipan.

=====Guam and Tinian=====

The ship remained in Eniwetok until 16 July, when she got underway in company with &quot;California&quot;, now assigned to TG 53.5, the bombardment group for the invasion of Guam. The ships arrived off Guam three days later and on the morning of 20 July, they joined the bombardment of the island that had begun twelve days before. The ships of TG 53.5 pounded Japanese positions around the island throughout the day. The next morning, they continued the shelling as ground forces stormed the beaches. &quot;Tennessee&quot; withdrew later in the day and steamed to Saipan on 22 July to replenish her ammunition. Tinian was the next island to be attacked, and &quot;Tennessee&quot; arrived off that island early the next morning as part of a diversionary bombardment meant to deceive the Japanese defenders as to where the landing would take place. She shelled the southwest coast throughout the morning and afternoon before withdrawing for the night.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; returned to Tinian on 24 July, this time cruising off the island&#x27;s northwest coast in company with &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Louisville&quot;, and several destroyers. The bombardment group unleashed a flurry of shells from a range of around from 05:32 to 07:47, at which point the marines made their assault on the beach. The ships remained on station through 26 July, providing support to the marines as they battled the Japanese defenders. During the bombardment, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot; flattened Tinian Town with a barrage of 480 rounds from their main batteries and 800 shells from their 5 in guns. &quot;Tennessee&quot; rotated out to Saipan on 27 July to replenish fuel and ammunition before returning the next day. She once again left for more ammunition at Saipan on 29 July and resumed bombardment duties on the 30th. That morning, one of her Kingfishers accidentally collided with a Marine OY-1 spotting plane, causing both aircraft to crash and killing both aircrews. Fighting ashore continued until the morning of 31 July, and at 08:30, &quot;Tennessee&quot; ceased firing. After a stop at Saipan, she steamed to Guam, where the battle still raged, to provide fire support until 8 August.

=====Anguar=====

The ship then got underway with &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Louisville&quot;, headed for Eniwetok and then to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, arriving there on 24 August. From there, she moved to Tulagi, where she took part in amphibious assault training. The next major operation would be the reconquest of the Philippines, but to secure the southern flank and capture the Kossol Roads for use as a staging area, the high command decided that the islands of Peleliu and Anguar should be invaded next. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was assigned to the force tasked with landing at the latter island.

Early on 12 September, the ships of the bombardment group—&quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, four cruisers, and five destroyers—began the preparatory bombardment of Anguar. She first opened fire with her main and secondary guns at 06:32 at a range of , but as Japanese defenses were destroyed through the morning, she closed to within , at which point her 40 mm battery opened fire. The ship was ordered to destroy a large stone lighthouse to prevent the Japanese from using it as an observation post, but after hitting it three times, it remained standing, and so she shifted fire to other targets. Combined with repeated airstrikes from the carriers, the ships hammered Japanese positions around the island for five days. Minesweepers cleared channels to the landing beach on the western coast of the island.

During the bombardment on 15 September, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was detached to nearby Peleliu to contribute her fire to the landing there. The next day, she returned to Anguar and resumed the bombardment there. Intent on demolishing the lighthouse, &quot;Tennessee&quot; steamed into position, but while she was training her guns on the target, the light cruiser fired a barrage of shells that destroyed the lighthouse. On 17 September, the Army&#x27;s 81st Infantry Division stormed the beaches, and &quot;Tennessee&quot; remained offshore to provide fire support for the following two days. The American infantry encountered little serious resistance, and the Japanese garrison had been destroyed by 20 September, allowing &quot;Tennessee&quot; to steam to Kossol Roads, where she replenished fuel and ammunition. On 28 September, she departed for Manus in the Admiralty Islands to begin preparations for the Philippines operations. There, Rear Admiral Theodore E. Chandler replaced Kingman as the commander of Battleship Division Two.

==== Operations in the Philippines ====
===== Leyte =====
&quot;Tennessee&quot; began the voyage to the Philippines on 12 October as part of 7th Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Thomas Kinkaid. The fleet carried two Army corps that were to land on the eastern coast of Leyte. &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; were assigned to support the corps that was to land at Dulag; they formed part of the bombardment group that was still under Oldendorf&#x27;s command. Minesweeping operations to clear paths into Leyte Gulf began on 17 October, and early the next morning Oldendorf sent his force into the gulf shortly after 06:00. They steamed at slow speed, since the minesweepers had not yet completed their task. The ships reached their bombardment positions in the early hours of 19 October, and at 06:45, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the other vessels began the bombardment, which lasted throughout the day and prompted little Japanese response, apart from a single bomber that failed to hit any of the ships. At nightfall, the ships withdrew and took up their night stations outside the gulf.

Back in the gulf the next morning, &quot;Tennessee&quot; resumed firing at 06:00, initially targeting the beaches where the landing craft were to go ashore later that morning. Three and a half hours later, the Higgins boats began their run to the beach, and once they began disembarking troops at 10:00, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the other fire support vessels shifted fire further inland to disrupt Japanese counterattacks and prepare the way for the ground troops to advance. The landing triggered the Japanese high command to initiate Operation &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 1, a complicated counter-thrust that involved four separate fleets converging on the Allied invasion fleet to destroy it. While the Japanese forces made their way to the Philippines, &quot;Tennessee&quot; continued to operate off the beachhead; Japanese resistance ashore did not necessitate heavy fire support, but increased air attacks kept &quot;Tennessee&quot; occupied with providing anti-aircraft defense to the fleet. On the night of 21 October, the transport accidentally rammed &quot;Tennessee&quot; while the latter vessel lay inside a smoke screen. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was not damaged and there were no injuries. Operations continued uneventfully for the next several days, though on 24 October, the ship&#x27;s commander received word that the Japanese fleet was expected to attack that night.

===== Battle of Surigao Strait =====

On 24 October, reports of Japanese naval forces approaching the area led Oldendorf&#x27;s ships to prepare for action at the exit of the Surigao Strait. Oldendorf had at his disposal six battleships, eight cruisers, and twenty-eight destroyers. Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force steamed through the Surigao Strait to attack the invasion fleet in Leyte Gulf; his force comprised Battleship Division 2—the battleships and , the heavy cruiser , and four destroyers—and Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima&#x27;s Second Striking Force—the heavy cruisers and , the light cruiser , and four more destroyers. As Nishimura&#x27;s flotilla passed through the strait on the night of 24 October, they came under attack from American PT boats, followed by destroyers, initiating the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battleship engagement in history. One of these US destroyers torpedoed &quot;Fusō&quot; and disabled her, though Nishimura continued on toward his objective.

Observers aboard &quot;Tennessee&quot; spotted the flashes in the distance as the light American craft attacked Nishimura&#x27;s force, and at 03:02, her search radar picked up the enemy ships at a range of . Oldendorf gave the order to open fire at 03:51, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; opened fire first a minute later, followed by &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot;, concentrating their fire on &quot;Yamashiro&quot;; the other American battleships had trouble locating a target with their radars and held their fire. &quot;Tennessee&quot; fired six-gun salvos in an attempt to conserve her limited stock of armor-piercing shells. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; and &quot;Mogami&quot; were quickly hit several times by fire from the American battleships and cruisers, suffering severe damage. At about 04:00, &quot;Mogami&quot; and then &quot;Yamashiro&quot; turned to retreat, both burning; the destroyer fled with them, though she had not suffered any serious damage.

After the initial phase of the battle, the American battle line turned about, but &quot;California&quot; misinterpreted the vague order to &quot;turn one five&quot; (meaning to turn 150 degrees—&quot;California&quot;″s captain read it as an instruction to turn 15 degrees) and turned incorrectly, passing across &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s bow. By now realizing his mistake, Burnett ordered &quot;California&quot; to turn hard to starboard while &quot;Tennessee&quot; hauled out of line. The two ships narrowly avoided each other but in the confusion, &quot;California&quot; masked &quot;Tennessee&quot; and blocked her from firing for several minutes. At 04:08, &quot;Tennessee&quot; fired one last salvo at the fleeing Japanese ships. By this time, several torpedoes launched by the Japanese vessels approached the American line, but none of them struck the battleships. In the course of twelve minutes of shooting, &quot;Tennessee&quot; had fired 69 armor-piercing shells.

In the meantime, the main Japanese fleet, the Central Force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, had passed through the San Bernardino Strait under cover of darkness and arrived early on 25 October. The Japanese battleships and cruisers attacked Taffy 3, a force of escort carriers and destroyers guarding the invasion fleet in the Battle off Samar, prompting its commander, Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague to make urgent calls for help. Oldendorf immediately turned his ships northward to join the battle, and while en route the ships came under Japanese air attack. By the time the bombardment group arrived on the scene, Kurita had disengaged, having been convinced by Taffy 3&#x27;s heavy resistance that he was instead facing the far more powerful Fast Carrier Task Force. After the battle, Oldendorf was promoted to the rank of vice admiral and made the commander of Battleship Squadron One, with &quot;Tennessee&quot; still as his flagship.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; saw little activity over the next several days, apart from helping to fend off air strikes by Japanese land-based aircraft. The ship received orders on 29 October to leave the Philippines for a thorough overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. She departed that day with &quot;West Virginia&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot;, and four cruisers, bound for Puget Sound by way of Pearl Harbor. While in Hawaii, Nimitz visited the ship and congratulated the crew on their hard work in the preceding campaigns. She arrived there on 26 November and entered the dry-dock. In addition to periodic maintenance, she received updated fire control radars, including new versions of the Mark 8 radar for her main battery and Mark 12 and Mark 22 systems for her secondary battery. A new SP radar, capable of determining the height of aircraft, was installed to enhance her anti-aircraft capabilities, and her dazzle camouflage was painted over with a dark gray coat that was intended to make her less obvious to the kamikaze pilots who had started to appear over the Philippines. The work was completed by early 1945, and on 2 February, she got underway to rejoin the fleet.

==== Iwo Jima ====

En route to join the invasion fleet for the invasion of Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands, &quot;Tennessee&quot; stopped in Pearl Harbor and Saipan before joining the bombardment force, now under the command of Rear Admiral William Blandy. The ships reached Iwo Jima early on 16 February and dispersed around the island to their designated firing locations. Poor visibility from rain squalls hampered efforts to direct their fire, which began at 07:07 and continued intermittently through the day, as Blandy had ordered his ships to shoot only when their spotter aircraft could observe impacts to avoid wasting ammunition. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was tasked with shelling the southeastern corner of the island as well as Mount Suribachi, where the Japanese had installed a battery of four large-caliber guns that &quot;Tennessee&quot; was to neutralize. The weather had improved on 17 February, permitting the ships to more effectively target the Japanese defenses; &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Idaho&quot;, and the battleship opened fire at a range of before closing to , pouring crushing fire on various targets around the island for about two hours before breaking off at 10:25. Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) were sent in to clear beach obstacles and reconnoiter the landing zones, which the Japanese interpreted as the main landing. Dozens of artillery pieces came out of their protective caves and bunkers to engage the UDTs, forcing them to withdraw while the bombardment group resumed firing on the unmasked guns. &quot;Tennessee&quot; took on wounded men from three of the UDT gunboats to treat them in her sick bay.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; kept up the bombardment through 18 February; over the two days of shelling, she destroyed numerous pillboxes and an ammunition dump and set several fires around the island. The next morning, the troop transports arrived off the island and began preparations to send marines ashore. &quot;Tennessee&quot; and the rest of the bombardment group, reinforced by the fast battleships and and three cruisers, opened up with slow and deliberate fire on the landing beaches. The shooting was interrupted by a carrier strike, after which the ships took up a heavier pace of fire. Just as the marines were about to hit the beach at 09:00, the ships&#x27; main batteries ceased firing and their secondaries employed a rolling barrage to clear a path for the marines. As they probed the Japanese defenses and encountered strongpoints, the marines called on &quot;Tennessee&quot; and other ships to knock them out by way of shore fire control parties that were tied to individual ships.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; operated off the island for the next two weeks, providing fire as requested from the marines ashore and launching star shells at night to help repel Japanese counterattacks. She was frequently called on to suppress the hidden Japanese guns as they attempted to attack the various support ships around the invasion beach. The ships of the bombardment group experimented with using telescopic sights to aim guns individually, which proved to be particularly effective in destroying point targets such as the Japanese artillery. On 7 March, &quot;Tennessee&quot; withdrew from the area, having fired some 1,370 shells from her main battery, 6,380 secondary rounds, and 11,481 shells from her 40 mm guns. Fighting raged on Iwo Jima until 26 March, but the fleet needed to begin preparations for the next assault against the island of Okinawa, so &quot;Tennessee&quot; sailed to the major staging area at Ulithi to replenish ammunition and other supplies. There, she joined the invasion fleet for that operation, consisting of 600 American and British ships.

==== Okinawa ====

On arriving in Ulithi, Rear Admiral Morton Deyo, the new commander of the bombardment groupwhich was now designated as Task Force 54 (TF 54)came aboard &quot;Tennessee&quot; on 15 March. TF 54 got underway on 21 March and steamed to the Ryuku Islands. The Kerama Islands were their first target; the small group of islands was seized to provide an advanced staging area for the main assault on Okinawa. The bombardment group, which by now included &quot;Colorado&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot;, &quot;West Virginia&quot;, &quot;New Mexico&quot;, &quot;Idaho&quot;, &quot;Nevada&quot;, and the older battleships , , and , along with ten cruisers and thirty-two destroyers and destroyer escorts, arrived off the islands five days later. The battleships opened fire at long range, since the minesweepers had not yet cleared the area of mines. The next day, a group of kamikazes struck the fleet, damaging several ships, a harbinger of the steady waves of such attacks over the course of the Okinawa campaign. One plane crashed near &quot;Tennessee&quot; but did no damage.

After the routine pre-invasion bombardment, the main landing on Okinawa took place on 1 April. Unlike previous assaults, the marines faced no opposition early in the operation; Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima had withdrawn the bulk of his 100,000-strong army to the southern two-thirds of the island, where hilly terrain favored the defense. And rather than engage in artillery duels with the battleships, his artillery batteries held their fire until the marines had come further inland. His intention was to delay the invasion as long as possible, thereby keeping the invasion fleet pinned in place as long as possible for the kamikazes that had been massed in the Home Islands for this purpose. On 12 April, the Japanese launched a major strike on the fleet. &quot;Tennessee&quot; came under attack by five aircraft diving from high altitude; all were shot down before they could hit the ship, but they diverted attention skyward, which allowed an Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive-bomber to approach at lower altitude, heading straight for &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s bridge. The ship&#x27;s light anti-aircraft battery opened up on the D3A and damaged it, but not enough to prevent it from crashing into her signal bridge at about 14:50. The impact destroyed a 40 mm mount, fire directors for the 20 mm guns, and hurled burning avgas over the area. The plane carried a bomb that penetrated the deck and exploded. The kamikaze killed 22 and wounded another 107 according to the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot;, or killed 25 and wounded 104, according to William Cracknell.

Later that night, &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; came under submarine attack, but they narrowly evaded the torpedoes in the darkness. The evacuation transport took off &quot;Tennessee&quot;″s wounded, and the dead were buried at sea the next day. After completing emergency repairs, the ship returned to the firing line on 14 April, remaining there for the next two weeks. Deyo transferred to one of the cruisers on 1 May, allowing &quot;Tennessee&quot; to detach for repairs at Ulithi, which were carried out by the repair ship . Damaged plating in the superstructure was cut away and replaced and new anti-aircraft guns were installed in place of those that had been destroyed in the attack. Back underway again on 3 June, she returned to Okinawa, arriving six days later. By this time, the campaign was in its final stage; the kamikaze force had been expended and the marines and soldiers had begun the final push to conquer the southern part of the island where the last organized resistance held out. &quot;Tennessee&quot; added her firepower to the effort over the next several days, bombarding Japanese positions until 21 June when the island was declared secure.

Oldendorf, by now promoted to vice admiral, was placed in command of all naval forces in the area, and he made &quot;Tennessee&quot; his flagship. On 23 June, she embarked on a series of patrols in the East China Sea, searching for Japanese shipping in the area. From 26 to 28 July, she took part in a raid into the Yangtze estuary off Shanghai, China, while escort carriers launched strikes against Japanese positions in occupied China. Oldendorf&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Tennessee&quot;, launched a raid on Wake Island before returning to the East China Sea, where the ships remained until the war ended in August. By this time, the fleet had begun preparations for the planned invasion of Japan. 
With the war over, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was tasked with covering the landing of occupation troops at Wakayama, Japan, arriving there on 23 September. She then steamed to Yokosuka, where her crew inspected one of the Japanese fleet&#x27;s main naval bases. On 16 October, she departed for Singapore, where Oldendorf transferred to the cruiser ; from there, &quot;Tennessee&quot; crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and steamed up the Atlantic to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which she reached on 7 December. This route had been dictated by her 1943 rebuild, as the large anti-torpedo blisters had increased her beam too greatly to allow her to pass through the Panama Canal. In the course of the war, &quot;Tennessee&quot; had fired a total of 9,347 shells from her main battery, 46,341 shells from her 5-inch guns and more than 100,000 rounds from her antiaircraft battery. She received 10 battle stars for her service in the war.

=== Postwar fate ===
On 8 December, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was assigned to the Philadelphia Group of the Sixteenth Fleet, an inactive formation. Immediately after the war, the Navy began a major reduction in force to adjust back to a peacetime footing. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was by then nearing thirty years in age, but the Navy decided that she was still useful and so she was assigned to the reserve fleet in 1946. Accordingly, the ship needed to be preserved to remain in good condition while in reserve, and the large number of vessels that needed such work slowed the process, so &quot;Tennessee&quot; was not ready to be formally decommissioned until 14 February 1947. She remained laid up in reserve for twelve years, by which time the Navy decided that she no longer held value as a warship, and so on 1 March 1959, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold for scrap to Bethlehem Steel on 10 July, was towed to Baltimore, Maryland on 26 July, and was thereafter broken up. Her bell is preserved and on display on Huntsville at the Museum of Scott County.

<doc id="196977" wikidata="Q1475573" url="?curid=196977" title="Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)">
<text>Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Edgar Allan Poe) is the debut studio album by British rock band the Alan Parsons Project. It was released on 25 June 1976 in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Charisma Records and 20th Century Records in the rest of the world. The lyrical and musical themes of the album, which are retellings of horror stories and poetry by Edgar Allan Poe, attracted a cult audience. The title of the album is taken from the title of a collection of Poe&#x27;s macabre stories of the same name.

Musicians featured on the album include vocalists Arthur Brown of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown on &quot;The Tell Tale Heart&quot;, John Miles on &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; and &quot;(The System of) Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether&quot;, and Terry Sylvester of The Hollies on &quot;To One in Paradise&quot;. The complete line-up of bands Ambrosia and Pilot play on the record, along with keyboardist Francis Monkman of Curved Air and Sky.

&quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; peaked at No. 38 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Pop Albums chart. The song &quot;(The System Of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether&quot; peaked at No. 37 on the Pop Singles chart, and No. 62 in Canada.

==Composition==
&quot;The Raven&quot; features actor Leonard Whiting on lead vocals, with Alan Parsons performing vocals through an EMI vocoder, which was manufactured by EMI Central Research Laboratories and stored in Abbey Road Studios. The prelude section of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, although uncredited, is taken verbatim from the opera fragment &quot;La chute de la maison Usher&quot; by Claude Debussy which was composed between 1908 and 1917. &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is an instrumental suite that runs more than 15 minutes and takes up most of Side 2 of the recording.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover art was made by Hipgnosis. Storm Thorgerson said that Eric Woolfson and Parsons wanted a &quot;classy&quot; design, including a book of lyrics, lengthy credits, and a chronology of Poe&#x27;s life. He described the recurring image of the &quot;taped&quot; man:

Poe was preoccupied with entombment. Many of his characters have been incarcerated in some form or other – in coffins, brick walls, or under floorboards. We came up with the &#x27;taped&#x27; man – a mummy-like figure who is wrapped, not in bandages, but in 2&quot; recording tape. This motif is partially horror-like, as well as being &#x27;entombed&#x27;, and the 2&quot; tape appropriately suggests that the album is done by a producer in a studio, as opposed to a band recording material they will play on stage. Although the clients were intrigued by this idea they did not desire a pictorial cover but preferred instead a precise graphic representation. The narrow strip of illustration from George [Hardie] shows a long shadow of the taped man.

The booklet (attached to the inside of the cover) is composed of photos related to the songs, and line drawings that explore the taped man as he thrashes about in his restricted world and strives to unravel himself. The illustrated capital letters continue the idea. The layout and drawings are by Colin Elgie. The sleeve is one of our better attempts at combining photographs and illustration.
==Reception==

Critical reaction to the album was mixed: &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; Billy Altman concluded it did not completely accurately reproduce Poe&#x27;s tension and macabre fear, ending by saying &quot;devotees of Gothic literature will have to wait for someone with more of the macabre in their blood for a truer musical reading of Poe&#x27;s often terrifying works.&quot; Nonetheless, the album has still garnered somewhat of a cult status amongst Alan Parsons Project fans. In July 2010, the album was named as one of &quot;Classic Rock magazine&quot; &quot;50 Albums That Built Prog Rock&quot;.

==Reissues==
Originally simply called &quot;The Alan Parsons Project&quot;, the album was successful enough to achieve gold status. The identity of The Alan Parsons Project as a group was cemented on the second album, &quot;I Robot&quot;, in 1977.

In 1987, Parsons completely remixed the album, including additional keyboard and guitar passages and narration (by Orson Welles), as well as updating the production style to include heavy reverb and the gated reverb snare drum sound, which was popular in the 1980s. Parsons also made the end of side A segue into the start of side B due to the remix of the album being released when CD&#x27;s were commercially available, thus no need to stop playback to change sides. The CD notes that Welles never met Parsons or Eric Woolfson, but sent a tape to them of the performance shortly after the album was manufactured in 1976.

The first passage narrated by Welles on the 1987 remix (which comes before the first track, &quot;A Dream Within a Dream&quot;) is sourced from an obscure nonfiction piece by Poe – No XVI of his &quot;Marginalia&quot; (from 1845 to 1849 Edgar Allan Poe titled some of his reflections and fragmentary material &quot;Marginalia.&quot;) The second passage Welles reads (which comes before &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (Prelude), seems to be a partial paraphrase or composite from nonfiction by Poe, chiefly from a collection of poems titled &quot;Poems of Youth&quot; by Poe (contained in &quot;Introduction to Poems – 1831&quot; in a section titled &quot;Letter to Mr. B-----------&quot;; the &quot;Shadows of shadows passing&quot; part of the quote comes from the &quot;Marginalia&quot;.
In 1994, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) released the original 1976 version on CD (UDCD-606), making the original available digitally for the first time.

In 2007, a Deluxe Edition released by Universal Music included both the 1976 and the 1987 versions remastered by Alan Parsons during 2006 with eight additional bonus tracks.

In 2016, a 40th Anniversary Edition 3CD/1BD/2LP box set was released, featuring a book, both 2007 Deluxe Edition CDs, a third disc with demos, outtakes, and other tracks, a 45 RPM 2LP set of the original album with bonus tracks, and a Blu-ray featuring a 5.1 surround sound version of the album remixed by Alan Parsons in 2016.

== Covers ==

A variant of the song &quot;The Raven&quot; appears on the Eric Woolfson album &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (2009), which contains the complete music from Woolfson&#x27;s 2003 stage musical of the same name. The variant track does not appear on Woolfson&#x27;s 2003 CD &quot;&quot;, which was a highly abridged version of the stage musical. On the variant, the bass line and keyboard chords of the original &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; track are heard, but they are quieter, do not feature a vocoder, and instead of an abridged version of the Poe poem being sung, the Woolfson version features a fuller spoken dramatic reading of the poem. The Alan Parsons album &quot;A Valid Path&quot; includes &quot;A Recurring Dream Within a Dream&quot;, a composite of &quot;A Dream Within a Dream&quot; and &quot;The Raven&quot; incorporating electronic music influences.

Slough Feg covered &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; for their 2010 album &quot;The Animal Spirits&quot;.

==Track listing==
Orson Welles&#x27; narration does not appear on the original 1976 mix of the album. It does, however, on the 1987 remix: specifically on &quot;A Dream Within a Dream&quot;, and on the extended Prelude of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Tennessee&quot; class consisted of two dreadnought battleships— and —built for the United States Navy in the late 1910s, part of the &quot;standard&quot; series. The class was in most respects a repeat of the preceding , with the primary improvements being a significantly strengthened underwater protection system, and increased elevation of the main battery guns to allow them to fire at much greater ranges. They carried the same main battery of twelve guns in four triple turrets, and had the same top speed of . Both ships served in the Pacific Fleet for the duration of their careers, which included an extensive training program during the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s.

Both ships were present in Battleship Row in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on 7 December 1941; &quot;California&quot; was torpedoed and sunk but &quot;Tennessee&quot; was only minimally damaged. &quot;California&quot; was refloated and both ships were heavily rebuilt between 1942 and 1944. The pair thereafter saw extensive service as bombardment vessels supporting the island-hopping campaign across the central Pacific. &quot;Tennessee&quot; took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign in mid-1943, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in late 1943 and early 1944, and the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944, by which time &quot;California&quot; had returned to the fleet as well.

They both took part in the Philippines campaign in late 1944, and were present at the Battle of Surigao Strait on 24 October, the final battleship engagement in history. A refit for &quot;Tennessee&quot; kept her from participating in the Battle of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945, where &quot;California&quot; was hit by a kamikaze, which in turn kept her from supporting Marine Corps troops during the Battle of Iwo Jima. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was heavily engaged in the fighting there and the subsequent Battle of Okinawa, where she, too, was hit by a kamikaze. The two ships spent the rest of the war patrolling the East China Sea until the official Japanese surrender in September. After briefly participating in the occupation of Japan, they were recalled to the United States and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. They remained there until 1959, when they were sold for scrap.

==Design==
Design work on the &quot;Tennessee&quot; class, initially referred to as &quot;Battleship 1916&quot;, began on 14 January 1915; the design staff used the preceding as a starting point. The General Board wanted to build a battleship that departed from the standard-type battleship series, particularly in terms of armor protection against the latest guns being fielded by European navies. They were opposed to simply developing the standard series, which incorporated relatively minor incremental improvements, but Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, overruled them and ordered that &quot;Battleship 1916&quot; would effectively repeat the &quot;New Mexico&quot; design with limited improvements.

At the same time that European navies had begun to adopt larger guns, they also began to develop longer-ranged torpedoes that could reach well into the expected battle distances of the day, . Therefore, the new ship&#x27;s ability to resist underwater attack—naval mines in addition to torpedoes—became a chief concern of the designers. To ensure the ship could survive an underwater explosion, they decided to incorporate four torpedo bulkheads, which created four voids. Of these, the inner pair would be filled with either water or fuel oil, which would absorb the pressure and gas of the explosion. This system proved to be effective and it was used in many subsequent battleship designs.

The ships were authorized on 3 March 1915, while design work was still ongoing; tests on the torpedo bulkhead system were completed only in February 1916. In the meantime, work had already begun on the next class, initially designated &quot;Battleship 1917&quot;, which became the . This class was essentially a repeat of the &quot;Tennessee&quot; design, the only major change was the adoption of larger guns in place of the guns the &quot;Tennessee&quot;s carried. The turbo-electric drive propulsion system that was developed for the &quot;Colorado&quot;s was retroactively applied to &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot; in December 1915, before construction had begun on either vessel.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The &quot;Tennessee&quot;-class ships were long at the waterline, long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced standard, and at full combat load. Under emergency conditions, additional fuel and ammunition could be stored, which significantly increased displacement to , which accordingly deepened draft to . The ships&#x27; hulls featured a pronounced clipper bow to handle high seas and reduce spray. A double bottom extended for the full length of the ships, and their hulls featured extensive compartmentalization to reduce the risk of uncontrollable flooding; below the waterline, the hull had 768 compartments and another 180 above the line.

The main deck, the highest deck that extended for the entire length of the ship, contained much of the living space for their crews, which included 57 officers and 1,026 enlisted men. As built, they were fitted with two lattice masts with spotting tops for the main gun battery. Steering was controlled by a single balanced rudder.

The ships were powered by turbo-electric drive. Eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers generated steam that powered two Westinghouse turbo-electric generators that in turn provided power for four electric motors that drove four 3-bladed, screws. The turbines were in separate watertight compartments, arranged fore and aft, with four boilers apiece; each boiler had its own watertight boiler rooms, with two boilers on either side of the turbines. The motors were arranged in three rooms: a larger, central room for the two engines driving the inboard shafts, and one for each outboard shaft on either side. Each set of four boilers was ducted into its own funnel.

Their propulsion systems were rated at , generating a top speed of . On speed trials, &quot;Tennessee&quot; reached a maximum of from . Normal oil storage amounted to , but voids in the hull could be used to increase maximum emergency fuel capacity to . They had a cruising range of at a speed of , which fell to at normally; with full emergency oil their range more than doubled, to at 10 knots and at .

===Armament===

The ships were armed with a main battery of twelve /50 caliber Mark IV guns in four triple turrets, placed on the centerline in superfiring pairs forward and aft of the superstructure. Unlike earlier American battleships with triple turrets, these mounts allowed each barrel to elevate independently. Since &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot; were laid down after the Battle of Jutland of mid-year 1916, which demonstrated the value of very long-range plunging fire, their main battery turrets were modified while still under construction to allow elevation to 30 degrees. This provided a maximum range of with the standard armor-piercing shell, which was fired with a muzzle velocity of . With the lighter high-capacity shell, the muzzle velocity increased to for a correspondingly greater range of . The guns suffered from excessive dispersion of shot, which was eventually discovered to have been caused by overly lengthy chambers, which allowed a gap between the shell and the propellant charges. The problem was eventually corrected with the Mark VII gun.

The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /51 caliber guns, ten of which were mounted in individual casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships at 01 deck level, one deck higher than the main deck. Six of the guns were arranged to fire forward and four were pointed aft. The remaining four guns were placed in open pivot mounts another deck higher at 02 level; two were placed abreast the conning tower and the others placed on either side of the funnels. Initially, the ships were to have been fitted with twenty-two of the guns, but experiences in the North Sea during World War I demonstrated that the additional guns, which would have been placed in the hull, would have been unusable in anything but calm seas. As a result, the casemates were plated over to prevent flooding. The guns were the Mark VIII type, which had a muzzle velocity of firing a shell.

The battleships carried four /50 caliber Mark X guns for anti-aircraft defense. These guns were located on the 02 deck, with two on either side of the boat cranes and the other two abreast of the mainmast. The guns fired a shell at a velocity of . They also carried a variety of other guns, including four 6-pounder saluting guns and a 3-inch Mark XI field gun and several machine guns for use by landing parties.

In addition to their gun armament, the &quot;Tennessee&quot;-class ships were also fitted with a pair of torpedo tubes, with one mounted submerged in the hull on each broadside. They were supplied with Bliss-Leavitt torpedoes of the Mark VII type; these carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
Their main armored belt was thick and was approximately wide, half of which was above the waterline. The thicker armor protected the ships&#x27; vitals, including the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces, extending from the forwardmost barbette to the aftmost barbette; the stern received lighter armor plating. Both ends of the main belt were capped by armored transverse bulkheads that were 13.5 in thick. The main armored deck was up to thick, and it was connected to the top of the main belt, running between the transverse armored bulkheads. A second armor deck that was thick was placed below the main deck; further aft, where it constituted the only horizontal protection, it increased in thickness to 5 in. On the ships&#x27; bows, the lower armor deck was increased to 3 in.

The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, thick sides, rears, and roofs; teak backing was used to cushion the structures from shell impacts. The turrets were mounted atop barbettes. Their conning towers had thick sides with thick roofs. The armored coamings for the funnel uptakes were 9 in thick.

===Modifications===

The &quot;Tennessee&quot;s underwent a series of minor modifications to their secondary and anti-aircraft armament through the 1920s and 1930s. In 1922, &quot;Tennessee&quot; had the two 5-inch guns abreast the mainmast removed and four more 3-inch guns installed, two of which were placed where the 5-inch guns had been. The other two were placed behind the forward 5-inch mounts. All eight guns were removed in 1928 and replaced with eight 5-inch /25 caliber anti-aircraft guns. &quot;California&quot; was similarly rearmed during a refit in 1929–1930. Eight .50 caliber machine guns were added, six to the roofs of the spotting tops, two on the foremast and four on the mainmast. The other two guns were placed on pedestals on either side of the foremast. &quot;Tennessee&quot; had two of the 3-inch guns returned in 1940, placed on either side of the bridge wings.

Other changes included the installation of aircraft-handling equipment. &quot;California&quot; had an aircraft catapult installed on her aft superfiring turret and she received three Vought UO-1 seaplanes for reconnaissance and fire direction. Two years later, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was similarly modified, though her catapult was located on the fantail. In the early 1930s, she received a second catapult on her aft turret, and at some point &quot;California&quot; also had a catapult fitted to her fantail. During their 1943 reconstruction, the turret-mounted catapults were removed and both ships were fitted with just a catapult on the fantail.

Both ships were extensively reconstructed and modernized after being damaged during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. New anti-torpedo bulges were installed and their internal compartmentalization was improved to strengthen their resistance to underwater damage. The ships&#x27; superstructures were completely revised, with the old heavily armored conning tower being removed and a smaller tower was erected in its place to reduce interference with the anti-aircraft guns&#x27; fields of fire. The new towers had been removed from one of the s that had recently been rebuilt. The foremast was replaced with a tower mast that housed the bridge and the main battery director, and their second funnels were removed, with those boilers being trunked into an enlarged forward funnel. Horizontal protection was considerably strengthened to improve their resistance to air attack; 3 inches of special treatment steel (STS) was added to the deck over the magazines and of STS was added elsewhere.

Their weapons suite was also overhauled. Both ships received air-search radar and fire-control radars for their main and secondary batteries, the latter seeing the mixed battery of 51-caliber and 25-caliber 5-inch guns replaced by a uniform battery of sixteen 5-inch/38 caliber guns in eight twin mounts. These were controlled by four Mk 37 directors. The light anti-aircraft battery was again revised, now consisting of ten quadruple Bofors guns and forty-three 20 mm Oerlikons, all in single mounts. The changes doubled the ships&#x27; crew, to a total of 114 officers and 2,129 enlisted men. During her final refit in January 1945, &quot;Tennessee&quot; received an SP air search radar and a Mark 27 fire control radar.

==Service history==
===Prewar careers and Pearl Harbor===
&quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot; served in the Pacific Fleet, later renamed the Battle Fleet in 1922 and then the Battle Force in 1931, in the Pacific Ocean for duration of their peacetime careers, with &quot;California&quot; serving as the fleet flagship. She spent the 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises, including the annual Fleet Problems, and cruises around the Americas and further abroad, such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925. The fleet problems conducted in the 1920s and 1930s provided the basis for the US Navy&#x27;s operations in the Pacific War, and experience that demonstrated that the standard type battleships were too slow to operate with aircraft carriers led to the development of the fast battleships built in the 1930s. Joint training with the Marine Corps provided experience that proved to be useful during the island hopping campaign during the Pacific War. In November 1924, Lieutenant Dixie Kiefer took off from &quot;California&quot;, the first night aircraft launch in history. While in Long Beach, California, the ships sent crewmen ashore to assist with relief after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.

During a period of rising tensions with Japan over the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the Battle Force to relocate from its homeport in San Pedro, California, to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in an effort to deter further aggression. Modernization work for the ships that was scheduled for 1940 and 1941 was cancelled, as was the fleet problem for 1941, as the situation with Japan was approaching a crisis and the Navy determined that the fleet needed to be maintained at a high state of readiness. Nevertheless, when the Japanese attacked the fleet at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, they did so having achieved complete surprise. Totally unprepared for the surprise attack, both ships were anchored in Battleship Row, where &quot;California&quot; was sunk in shallow water. &quot;Tennessee&quot;, moored inboard of the battleship and thus protected from torpedo attacks, emerged relatively undamaged, though fires from other ships had warped some of her hull plates and necessitated repairs. She was also trapped when &quot;West Virginia&quot; sank and came to rest up against &quot;Tennessee&quot;, forcing her up against the concrete quay.

===World War II===

After being freed from Battleship Row, &quot;Tennessee&quot; steamed to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where the initial modernization program began. &quot;California&quot; was raised from the harbor bottom in mid-1942 and taken to Puget Sound as well, where she was rebuilt, beginning in October. By that time, &quot;Tennessee&quot; had returned to service with her upgraded light anti-aircraft battery, but she saw no active operations owing to the crippling fuel shortage in the Pacific at the time. The Navy decided that she should be rebuilt along the same lines as &quot;California&quot;, so she returned to Puget Sound to be reconstructed. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was completed first, returning to the fleet in May 1943 in time to participate in the Aleutian Islands campaign, thus beginning her career as a naval gunfire support vessel during the island-hopping campaign against Japan. In this role, she conducted preparatory bombardments to destroy Japanese defensive positions and provided support to marine and Army ground forces as they fought their way ashore, suppressing Japanese defenders and targeting defensive strongpoints.

&quot;Tennessee&quot; thereafter deployed to the central Pacific to take part in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, beginning with the Battle of Tarawa in November. The Battles of Kwajalein and Eniwetok followed in early 1944, by which time work on &quot;California&quot; had been completed. While &quot;California&quot; was still conducting sea trials, &quot;Tennessee&quot; next took part in the final stages of Operation Cartwheel by bombarding Kavieng as a diversionary attack. &quot;California&quot; was ready for service in time for the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944, and both ships shelled Japanese positions on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. The two ships collided while en route to the last target in the campaign, Peleliu, which prevented &quot;California&quot; from participating in the Battle of Peleliu, though &quot;Tennessee&quot; remained in action. During the fighting on Tinian, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was hit by Japanese field artillery and slightly damaged.

Both ships had been repaired in time to participate in the next major offensive, the Philippines campaign that began with the invasion of Leyte in October 1944. Both vessels supported the landing, which triggered the Japanese to launch Operation Shō-Gō 1, a major naval counterattack that resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 23–26 October. &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot;, as part of the bombardment group under Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, took part in one component of the complex battle, the action of Surigao Strait, on the night of 24/25 October. There, the Allied fleet destroyed the Japanese Southern Force consisting of a pair of old battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers; only one Japanese destroyer escaped the overwhelming Allied fleet. &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; fired only briefly during the engagement, as a miscommunication between their commanders almost led to another collision, which threw them out of firing position. They were nevertheless present for the last battleship engagement in history.

&quot;California&quot; continued operations off the Philippines, though &quot;Tennessee&quot; was recalled for a refit at Puget Sound. During the Battle of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945, &quot;California&quot; was hit by a kamikaze suicide plane, though she shot down a second attacker. She was not seriously damaged, but her crew suffered heavy casualties, with over 50 killed and more than 150 wounded. She returned to Puget Sound for repairs, by which time work on &quot;Tennessee&quot; was completed, allowing her to return to combat off Iwo Jima in early February. She provided heavy fire support, targeting Mount Suribachi before and during the Battle of Iwo Jima, before proceeding to Okinawa to conduct the preparatory bombardment of this island for the coming invasion. She operated off the island for the next month; during the Battle of Okinawa, where the Japanese made repeated and heavy kamikaze attacks on the Allied fleet, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was hit by one suicide aircraft on 12 April that did little damage but killed more than twenty and wounded more than a hundred. She was detached to Ulithi for repairs that were completed by early June, when she returned to the fighting off Okinawa. &quot;Tennessee&quot; was joined shortly thereafter by &quot;California&quot;, though by then the fighting ashore was in its final stages.

The two ships were then assigned to Task Force 95, which was charged with patrolling the East China Sea, with &quot;Tennessee&quot; as the flagship of its commander, Vice Admiral Oldendorf. They supported the initial occupation of Japan in September before being sent home to the United States later that month. Now too wide to fit through the Panama Canal as a result of their 1943 reconstructions, they were forced to return to the east coast of the United States by way of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. There, they were decommissioned and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, based in Philadelphia. Both battleships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1959, sold for scrap on 10 July, and thereafter broken up.

<doc id="196979" wikidata="Q750084" url="?curid=196979" title="Jagged Little Pill">
<text>Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album by Canadian-American singer Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick on June 13, 1995. Recorded in Hollywood at Westlake with production by Glen Ballard, it is Morissette&#x27;s first album to be released worldwide. It marks a significant stylistic departure from the dance-pop sound of her first two efforts, &quot;Alanis&quot; (1991) and &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; (1992). She began work on the album after moving from her hometown Ottawa to Los Angeles, where she met Ballard. The pair had an instant connection and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds. The experimentation resulted in an alternative rock album that takes influence from post-grunge and pop rock, and features guitars, bass, keyboards, drum machines, and harmonica. The lyrics touch upon themes of aggression and unsuccessful relationships, while Ballard introduced a pop sensibility to Morissette&#x27;s angst. The title of the album is taken from a line in the first verse of the song &quot;You Learn&quot;.

&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised its music and Morissette&#x27;s lyrics and vocals. It received nine Grammy Award nominations, of which it won five: Album of the Year, making her the youngest artist to win the award at the time; Best Rock Album; Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (&quot;You Oughta Know&quot;); Best Rock Song (&quot;You Oughta Know&quot;); and Best Long Form Music Video. It was certified ten times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), seventeen times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and double diamond by Music Canada, making Morissette the first Canadian artist to achieve double diamond. With combined sales of over 33 million copies worldwide, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has been included on several all-time lists, such as those of Apple Music, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

The album has been re-released twice: on October 30, 2015, in a two-disc deluxe edition and a four-disc collector&#x27;s edition commemorating its 20th anniversary; and on June 26, 2020, in a 25th anniversary deluxe edition. An acoustic re-recording of the album was released on June 13, 2005, to mark its 10th anniversary. It inspired a musical stage production, which premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge on May 5, 2018; it transferred to Broadway the following year, and was nominated for 15 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. A world tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; began in early 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Background==
In 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Alanis&quot;, which went Platinum in Canada. Her second album &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; sold a little more than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal complete, Morissette was left without a recording contract. In 1993, Morissette&#x27;s publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch. Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her &quot;spectacular voice&quot;, her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living with her parents in Ottawa. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people.

After graduating from high school, Morissette made the move. Her publisher funded part of her development and when she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, he believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio.

==Recording==
Morissette co-wrote the album solely with Glen Ballard, who also produced the album. The demo recording sessions started in 1994 at Ballard&#x27;s home studio, and included only Morissette and Ballard as the producer, who recorded the songs as they were being written. Ballard provided the rough tracks, playing the guitars, keyboards, and programming drum machines, and Morissette played harmonica. The duo sought to write and record one song a day, in twelve- or sixteen-hour shifts, with minimal overdubbing later. All of Morissette&#x27;s singing on the album respects that rule, each recorded in one or two takes. The tracks that were redone later in a professional studio used the original demo vocals.

Ballard met Morissette in 1994 when his publishing company matched them up. According to Ballard, the connection was &quot;instant&quot;, and within 30 minutes of meeting each other they had begun experimenting with different sounds in Ballard&#x27;s home studio in San Fernando Valley, California. Ballard also declared to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that, &quot;I just connected with her as a person, and, almost parenthetically, it was like &#x27;Wow, you&#x27;re 19?&#x27; She was so intelligent and ready to take a chance on doing something that might have no commercial application. Although there was some question about what she wanted to do musically, she knew what she didn&#x27;t want to do, which was anything that wasn&#x27;t authentic and from her heart.&quot; The first track the pair wrote was &quot;The Bottom Line&quot;, which was not included on the album&#x27;s initial release, but was included on the album&#x27;s 2015 re-release. The song was written in one hour, immediately after they met.

The album&#x27;s most successful single &quot;Ironic&quot; was the third track to be written for the album. In an interview with Christopher Walsh of &quot;Billboard&quot;, Ballard explained how he and Morissette met, and how &quot;Ironic&quot; was written. He commented: &quot;I&#x27;m telling you, within 15 minutes we were at it — just writing. &#x27;Ironic&#x27; was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were just having fun. I thought &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what this is — what genre it is — who knows? It&#x27;s just good″.&quot;

The lead single, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, has guitar by Dave Navarro and bass by Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers. The song was written with a different instrumentation; the pair were then asked to re-write the music – something Navarro described as being &quot;A lot like a remix ... The structure of the song was in place but there were no guide tracks, we just had the vocal to work from. It was just a good time and we basically jammed until we found something we were both happy with. Alanis was happy too.&quot;

The first song to be shown to A&amp;R and record company people was &quot;Perfect&quot;, with a simple arrangement containing only Morissette&#x27;s vocals and Ballard&#x27;s acoustic guitar. In December 1994, the duo took the demos to a studio and began working on full band arrangements for 5 songs: &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Right Through You&quot;, &quot;Forgiven&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot;. Los Angeles engineer Chris Fogel engineered the sessions. By January 1995, having been passed over by many labels, Ballard was considering an independent release before Morissette&#x27;s lawyer Ken Hertz arranged a meeting with Guy Oseary, who worked at A&amp;R for Maverick Records. Oseary said he got interested in working with Morisette right at the beginning of &quot;Perfect&quot;, which he would later describe as &quot;the first time I heard anyone tell stories that way and express themselves in such a manner&quot;, and within two days Morissette was signed with the label.

&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; departed from Morissette&#x27;s previous releases – &quot;Alanis&quot; and &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; – that predominantly featured dance-pop. To underscore this transformation and establish herself on the international stage, Morissette adopted her full name professionally, moving beyond her previous single-name moniker &quot;Alanis&quot;. This deliberate change in both musical direction and personal branding signaled a new chapter in her career, setting the stage for her breakthrough international debut. All of the lyrics were written by Morissette. Morissette stated that during the process of making the album, she was in a bad mental condition after being robbed at gunpoint, suffering from angst and daily panic attacks, and tried to overcome her troubled feelings by expressing her emotions in the lyrics. She said that her goal was &quot;doing work that is a completely truthful side of yourself&quot;, adding that &quot;I say things in my songs that I wouldn&#x27;t say in normal conversation or even the most serious talk.&quot;

The album opens with &quot;All I Really Want&quot;. It features harmonica, swirly guitars and canned drums, and is in a grunge-pop vein. The lyrics talk about &quot;intellectual intercourse&quot; and a mental connection with another angry, frustrated, frightened, uncomfortable soul. The lyrics of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; have been described as exploring themes of &quot;raw anger and frank portrayal of female sexuality&quot;.

&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; is a cataloging of contradictions set over fuzzy guitar and a &#x27;90s drum machine. It portrays a lighter side to Morissette, with lyrics that touch upon themes of her self-effacing and hopeful side. &quot;Right Through You&quot; is a grunge song with angry lyrics about sleazy record bosses who prey on female artists who they want to &quot;Wine dine and sixty-nine&quot; rather than actually supporting their musical careers.

&quot;Forgiven&quot; draws on Morissette&#x27;s Catholic upbringing. &quot;I was told,&quot; she recalled, &quot;that if I wasn&#x27;t a virgin when I was a teenager, I must be a real whore. I believed that if I had sex I would be damned in hell forever.&quot; &quot;You Learn&quot; is a mid-tempo self-help rock song, with Morissette giving out advice; &quot;Ditch the fear, open your heart, speak your mind, and when the going gets tough, walk around the house naked.&quot; It also is the source of the album title &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, which Morissette stated that reflected how “a lot of times when I’m immersed in something really difficult, I don’t realize that there’s a lesson in there somewhere and that it’s only in retrospect that I’ll realize why I went through it. So the lyric following it is ‘just swallow it down, it feels so good swimming in your stomach’ … so there’s some sort of a payoff, and it may not be right away.” &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; is a ballad that contains guitar and drum box backing, with plainspoken vocals. The lyrics talk about Morissette being a &quot;handful&quot;, and that she&#x27;s not the type to get emotional.

&quot;Perfect&quot; is thought to be about internalised negativity, the pressure to do well and approval. Meanwhile, &quot;Mary Jane&quot; is built over a ballad&#x27;s tense and ringing electric guitar. It addresses themes about depression and anorexia as it sees Morissette trying to reassure a friend who&#x27;s having a rough time. In 2010 a writer suggested it was an example of an anti-rhetorical argument about taking action. Though the name &quot;Mary Jane&quot; is another name for marijuana, the song seems not to be about the plant.

&quot;Ironic&quot; is a pop rock song, set in the time signature of common time, composed in a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. The song&#x27;s use of situational irony led to some fascination with whether it is a correct application of the term &quot;ironic&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; &quot;irony&quot; is &quot;a figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used&quot; making lyrics such as &quot;It&#x27;s like rain on your wedding day&quot; not ironic.

The closing &quot;Wake Up&quot; takes the shape of a cry for help to an apathetic world.

The album cover, featuring photography by John Patrick Salisbury and art direction by Thomas Recchion, combines a picture of Morissette crouched atop a cliff in Malibu, California and another of her face with various shades of red, blue and green, and typewriter-style fonts.

==Release and promotion==

Maverick Records released &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; internationally in 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation changed quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single. The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics, a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic in Canada, and the song rapidly ascended the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart peaking at No. 1 for five weeks, the most ever by a female artist to that date. Soon after US Top 40 and Album Rock radio stations began playing the song and it reached No. 7 and No. 3 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Album Rock Track charts, respectively.

After the success of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, the album&#x27;s other hits helped send &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; to the top of the Billboard Album Chart. &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; was the next track released; it topped the Modern Rock chart and reached No. 8 and No. 4 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Album Rock Track charts, respectively. While top 40 and album rock stations were still catching up to modern rock radio stations on playing the first two tracks, &quot;All I Really Want&quot; was promoted at modern rock stations and reached No. 14 on the Modern Rock chart. The fourth U.S. single, &quot;Ironic&quot;, became Morissette&#x27;s biggest hit, partly due to the unique music video featuring four identical but differently dressed Alanises driving around in the same car. The video was nominated for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996 winning three including &quot;Best Female Video&quot;. &quot;Ironic&quot;, which was released as a physical single, therefore, becoming the first track off &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; eligible for the Billboard Hot 100, peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100, while also hitting No. 1 on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Top 40 charts. &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Head over Feet&quot;, the fifth and sixth singles, also topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart, reached No. 7 and No. 25 on the Modern Rock chart, but were not picked up by Mainstream Rock stations, instead charting highly on the Adult Alternative (&quot;You Learn&quot; No. 2; &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; No. 11) and Adult Top 40 charts (&quot;Head Over Feet&quot; No. 1: &quot;You Learn&quot; No. 3), with a single of &quot;You Learn&quot; backed with Morissette&#x27;s Grammy Award performance of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; peaking at No. 6 on the Hot 100. The parade of singles kept &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995) in the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for 72 weeks.

Morissette toured &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; worldwide for 18 months, supported by Radiohead. She also opened for Neil Young and his band Crazy Horse for several European dates in summer 1996, together with Foo Fighters, Manic Street Preachers and Dodgy. A live video was released on VHS and DVD, &quot;Jagged Little Pill, Live&quot;, and won a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.

On the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 2005, Morissette released an acoustic version of the album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill Acoustic&quot;. This album was originally sold through Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music brand in an exclusive six-week deal that ended on July 26, 2005. For the duration of this partnership, music retailer HMV boycotted the sale of Morissette&#x27;s entire catalogue in Canada. The album was released on June 15, 2005, ten years to the day after the original United States release. The artwork of the acoustic version is similar to the original version, but is sepia-tinted instead. On October 30, 2015, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; was reissued by Rhino Records and Warner Music Group to mark its 20th anniversary. A two-disc deluxe edition contains a newly remastered version of the album, appended with ten demo recordings, two of which were previously released on the &quot;Joining You&quot; single in 1999. A limited four-disc collector&#x27;s edition also adds 2005&#x27;s &quot;Acoustic&quot; album and a full live concert recorded in London at Subterranea on September 28, 1995. As with the &quot;Acoustic&quot; release, this edition also updated the cover artwork; this time presented in white and gold and labeled as &quot;Jagged Little Pill • Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Steve Hochman found that few artists explored &quot;extreme emotional games&quot; as &quot;strikingly&quot; as Morissette, whom he viewed as &quot;a fresh talent—somewhere between, say, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Liz Phair—who&#x27;s determined to let her feelings out, whether with a snarl or a smile.&quot; Anne Ayers of &quot;USA Today&quot; said that Morissette &quot;compels with mature, assured songcraft and pointed writing&quot;, while &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; critic Tom Moon described her as &quot;wise beyond her years, determined to expose the hypocrisy she encounters at every turn.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau wrote that Morissette is &quot;happy to help 15 million girls of many ages stick a basic feminist truth in our faces: privileged phonies have identity problems too. Not to mention man problems.&quot; In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic highlighted the intensely personal nature of Morissette&#x27;s lyrics and found it &quot;remarkable&quot; that the album &quot;struck a sympathetic chord with millions of listeners, because it&#x27;s so doggedly, determinedly insular.&quot; Erlewine concludes, &quot;As slick as the music is, the lyrics are unvarnished and Morissette unflinchingly explores emotions so common, most people would be ashamed to articulate them.&quot;

Other critics were less favorable. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was intrigued by &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; but found the rest of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; &quot;much harder to swallow&quot;, continuing, &quot;What sounds arresting on a single grows wearing over a full album. Producer-co-songwriter Glen Ballard&#x27;s arrangements are clunky mixtures of alternative mood music and hammy arena rock, and the 21-year-old Morissette tends to wildly oversing every other line.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that Morissette &quot;strives for catharsis but often merely sounds histrionic&quot;.

When listing the album at 45 on the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Nineties&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented: &quot;&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is like a Nineties version of Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Tapestry&quot;: a woman using her plain soft-rock voice to sift through the emotional wreckage of her youth, with enough heart and songcraft to make countless listeners feel the earth move&quot;. &quot;Slant&quot; rated it the ninth-best album of 1995.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is one of the most successful albums of the 1990s. In the US, it debuted at No. 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaked at No. 1 in October 1995, almost four months after it was released, remaining in that position for twelve weeks in total. It was the first album to reach both 12 million (in February 1997) and 13 million (in August 1998) in sales in the US since 1991, when Nielsen SoundScan started tracking music sales. It was certified 16× Platinum for shipments of 16 million copies. Morissette held the record as the youngest artist—she was 21 at the time—to be certified diamond in the US, until Britney Spears claimed that title with her debut album &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; certified diamond in December 1999 as she turned 18. The album recorded a further 350,000 units sold through BMG Music Club. On the week ending June 21, 2015, the album sold 5,000 copies, bringing its sales to just over 15 million, making it one of only three albums to have sold at least 15 million copies in the United States since Nielsen Music began tracking data in 1991. It also peaked at No. 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was certified 2× Diamond for selling over 2 million copies.

It was certified 14× Platinum, selling over 980,000 copies there. The album debuted at No. 46 in New Zealand, then rose to No. 1, staying there for 11 non-consecutive weeks.

The album was certified 10× Platinum, shipping over 3 million copies.

With 18.7 million copies sold globally in 1996, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; was the best-selling album of that year. It sold 500,000 or more copies during more than 15 non-consecutive weeks. , it has sold 33 million copies worldwide. Overall, the album is one of the most successful albums in music history and one of the best-selling albums worldwide.

==Legacy==
The album received numerous awards and accolades. Morissette and the album won five Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year for &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, she won four awards: Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song (both for &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;), Best Rock Album and Album of the Year; Morissette consequently tied with Carole King and Bonnie Raitt for the record of most Grammys won by a woman at a single ceremony, at the time. Glen Ballard was nominated as Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for the album&#x27;s production. 
&quot;Ironic&quot; was nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards—Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form—and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where Morissette also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award. The video &quot;Jagged Little Pill, Live&quot;, which was co-directed by Morissette and chronicled the bulk of her tour, won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form.

In 2000, it was voted No. 51 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In October 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 31 on its &quot;Women In Rock – The 50 Essential Albums&quot; list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it No. 327 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; (while left out of the 2012 update, the album&#x27;s rank shot up to number 69 in the 2020 reboot of the list). The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album also appears on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and National Association of Recording Merchandisers&#x27; list of &quot;200 Definitive Albums&quot; at No. 26, and on Apple Music&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list at No. 31. The album ranked at No. 50 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 list of &quot;Women Who Rock: The 50 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The album peaked at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Morissette the first Canadian woman to top the chart. It also topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Best Selling Pop album of the 1990s&quot;.
Morissette&#x27;s success with &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; was credited with leading to the introduction of female singers such as Fiona Apple, Shakira, Tracy Bonham, Meredith Brooks, and in the early 2000s, Pink, Michelle Branch, and fellow Canadian Avril Lavigne. American singer Katy Perry cites &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; as a significant musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette&#x27;s frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, &quot;&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; was the most perfect female record ever made. There&#x27;s a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They&#x27;re still so timeless.&quot; Grammy Award winner Kelly Clarkson said of the album, &quot;It made me a better writer. It made me a better singer.&quot; Avril Lavigne cited &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; as one of her all-time favorite albums, stating: &quot;It is an album I can revisit over and over, belt every song, and never get sick of.&quot; In 2018, the album won the Polaris Heritage Prize Audience Award in the 1986–1995 category.
Benny Anderson of ABBA listed the album as one of the 6 soundtracks of his life: &quot;I listened to this a lot when it came out, at a time when I wasn&#x27;t writing pop songs any more. It was a remembrance of solid golden pop, from a fantastically talented woman with great writing and a great voice, and a very nicely produced album by Glen Ballard. It&#x27;s one of the top 10 albums in my life when it comes to pop records, alongside &quot;Rumours&quot; and &quot;Hotel California&quot;.&quot;

In August 2021, Morissette began a tour for the album&#x27;s 26th anniversary. The tour was scheduled to begin in 2020 for the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, but was postponed to summer 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and stretched until 2023. Garbage, Cat Power, Beth Orton, Aimee Mann and Feist were the supporting acts on the tour. 

In 2015, for its sixth and final season, American TV series &quot;Glee&quot; paid tribute to this album, alongside Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Tapestry&quot;, in its episode &quot;Jagged Little Tapestry&quot; airing January 16, 2015. Three songs from the album are performed in a mashup with one of the songs from &quot;Tapestry&quot;: &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; is mashed up with &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;, &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; with &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot;, and &quot;You Learn&quot; with &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. The episode was watched by 1.98 million viewers and received a 0.7/2 in the adult 18-49 demographic.

For herself, Morissette had hoped that the success of the album would give her a degree of acceptance from other artists in the late grunge movement. However she found that her contemporaries were &quot;all about aloofness and ennui and I am not aloof.&quot;

==Stage adaptation==

In November 2013, it was revealed that a theatre adaption of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; was being adapted for the stage with Tom Kitt attached to arrange the orchestrations. In May 2017, it was announced that the stage adaption would receive its world premiere in May 2018, 23 years after the album was released.

<text>Swallowing, also called deglutition or inglutition in scientific contexts, is the process in the body of a human that allows for a substance to pass from the mouth, to the pharynx, and into the esophagus, while shutting the epiglottis. Swallowing is an important part of eating and drinking. If the process fails and the material (such as food, drink, or medicine) goes through the trachea, then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur. In the human body the automatic temporary closing of the epiglottis is controlled by the swallowing reflex.

The portion of food, drink, or other material that will move through the neck in one swallow is called a bolus.

In colloquial English, the term &quot;swallowing&quot; is also used to describe the action of taking in a large mouthful of food without any biting.

==In humans==
Swallowing comes so easily to most people that the process rarely prompts much thought. However, from the viewpoints of physiology, of speech–language pathology, and of health care for people with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), it is an interesting topic with extensive scientific literature.

===Coordination and control===
Eating and swallowing are complex neuromuscular activities consisting essentially of three phases, an oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase. Each phase is controlled by a different neurological mechanism. The oral phase, which is entirely voluntary, is mainly controlled by the medial temporal lobes and limbic system of the cerebral cortex with contributions from the motor cortex and other cortical areas. The pharyngeal swallow is started by the oral phase and subsequently is coordinated by the swallowing center on the medulla oblongata and pons. The reflex is initiated by touch receptors in the pharynx as a bolus of food is pushed to the back of the mouth by the tongue, or by stimulation of the palate (palatal reflex).

Swallowing is a complex mechanism using both skeletal muscle (tongue) and smooth muscles of the pharynx and esophagus. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) coordinates this process in the pharyngeal and esophageal phases.


===Phases===
====Oral phase====
Prior to the following stages of the oral phase, the mandible depresses and the lips abduct to allow food or liquid to enter the oral cavity. Upon entering the oral cavity, the mandible elevates and the lips adduct to assist in oral containment of the food and liquid. The following stages describe the normal and necessary actions to form the bolus, which is defined as the state of the food in which it is ready to be swallowed.

1) Moistening

Food is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands (parasympathetic).

2) Mastication

Food is mechanically broken down by the action of the teeth controlled by the muscles of mastication (V3) acting on the temporomandibular joint. This results in a bolus which is moved from one side of the oral cavity to the other by the tongue. Buccinator (VII) helps to contain the food against the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. The bolus is ready for swallowing when it is held together by saliva (largely mucus), sensed by the lingual nerve of the tongue (VII—chorda tympani and IX—lesser petrosal) (V3). Any food that is too dry to form a bolus will not be swallowed.

3) Trough formation

A trough is then formed at the back of the tongue by the intrinsic muscles (XII). The trough obliterates against the hard palate from front to back, forcing the bolus to the back of the tongue.
The intrinsic muscles of the tongue (XII) contract to make a trough (a longitudinal concave fold) at the back of the tongue. The tongue is then elevated to the roof of the mouth (by the mylohyoid (mylohyoid nerve—V3), genioglossus, styloglossus and hyoglossus (the rest XII)) such that the tongue slopes downwards posteriorly. The contraction of the genioglossus and styloglossus (both XII) also contributes to the formation of the central trough.

4) Movement of the bolus posteriorly

At the end of the oral preparatory phase, the food bolus has been formed and is ready to be propelled posteriorly into the pharynx. In order for anterior to posterior transit of the bolus to occur, orbicularis oris contracts and adducts the lips to form a tight seal of the oral cavity. Next, the superior longitudinal muscle elevates the apex of the tongue to make contact with the hard palate and the bolus is propelled to the posterior portion of the oral cavity. Once the bolus reaches the palatoglossal arch of the oropharynx, the pharyngeal phase, which is reflex and involuntary, then begins. Receptors initiating this reflex are proprioceptive (afferent limb of reflex is IX and efferent limb is the pharyngeal plexus- IX and X). They are scattered over the base of the tongue, the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches, the tonsillar fossa, uvula and posterior pharyngeal wall. Stimuli from the receptors of this phase then provoke the pharyngeal phase. In fact, it has been shown that the swallowing reflex can be initiated entirely by peripheral stimulation of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. This phase is &quot;voluntary&quot; and involves important cranial nerves: V (trigeminal), VII (facial) and XII (hypoglossal).

====Pharyngeal phase====

For the pharyngeal phase to work properly all other egress from the pharynx must be occluded—this includes the nasopharynx and the larynx. When the pharyngeal phase begins, other activities such as chewing, breathing, coughing and vomiting are concomitantly inhibited.

5) Closure of the nasopharynx

The soft palate is tensed by tensor palatini (Vc), and then elevated by levator palatini (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) to close the nasopharynx. There is also the simultaneous approximation of the walls of the pharynx to the posterior free border of the soft palate, which is carried out by the palatopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and the upper part of the superior constrictor (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X).

6) The pharynx prepares to receive the bolus

The pharynx is pulled upwards and forwards by the suprahyoid and longitudinal pharyngeal muscles – stylopharyngeus (IX), salpingopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and palatopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) to receive the bolus. The palatopharyngeal folds on each side of the pharynx are brought close together through the superior constrictor muscles, so that only a small bolus can pass.

7) Opening of the auditory tube

The actions of the levator palatini (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), tensor palatini (Vc) and salpingopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) in the closure of the nasopharynx and elevation of the pharynx opens the auditory tube, which equalises the pressure between the nasopharynx and the middle ear. This does not contribute to swallowing, but happens as a consequence of it.

8) Closure of the oropharynx

The oropharynx is kept closed by palatoglossus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), the intrinsic muscles of tongue (XII) and styloglossus (XII).

9) Laryngeal closure

The primary laryngopharyngeal protective mechanism to prevent aspiration during swallowing is via the closure of the true vocal folds. The adduction of the vocal cords is affected by the contraction of the lateral cricoarytenoids and the oblique and transverse arytenoids (all recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus). Since the true vocal folds adduct during the swallow, a finite period of apnea (swallowing apnea) must necessarily take place with each swallow. When relating swallowing to respiration, it has been demonstrated that swallowing occurs most often during expiration, even at full expiration a fine air jet is expired probably to clear the upper larynx from food remnants or liquid. The clinical significance of this finding is that patients with a baseline of compromised lung function will, over a period of time, develop respiratory distress as a meal progresses.
Subsequently, false vocal fold adduction, adduction of the aryepiglottic folds and retroversion of the epiglottis take place. The aryepiglotticus (recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus) contracts, causing the arytenoids to appose each other (closes the laryngeal aditus by bringing the aryepiglottic folds together), and draws the epiglottis down to bring its lower half into contact with arytenoids, thus closing the aditus. Retroversion of the epiglottis, while not the primary mechanism of protecting the airway from laryngeal penetration and aspiration, acts to anatomically direct the food bolus laterally towards the piriform fossa.
Additionally, the larynx is pulled up with the pharynx under the tongue by stylopharyngeus (IX), salpingopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), palatopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and inferior constrictor (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X). This phase is &quot;passively&quot; controlled reflexively and involves cranial nerves V, X (vagus), XI (accessory) and XII (hypoglossal). The respiratory center of the medulla is directly inhibited by the swallowing center for the very brief time that it takes to swallow. This means that it is briefly impossible to breathe during this phase of swallowing and the moment where breathing is prevented is known as &quot;deglutition apnea&quot;.

10) Hyoid elevation

The hyoid is elevated by digastric (V &amp; VII) and stylohyoid (VII), lifting the pharynx and larynx up even further.

11) Bolus transits pharynx

The bolus moves down towards the esophagus by pharyngeal peristalsis which takes place by sequential contraction of the superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X). The lower part of the inferior constrictor (cricopharyngeus) is normally closed and only opens for the advancing bolus. Gravity plays only a small part in the upright position—in fact, it is possible to swallow solid food even when standing on one&#x27;s head. The velocity through the pharynx depends on a number of factors such as viscosity and volume of the bolus. In one study, bolus velocity in healthy adults was measured to be approximately 30–40 cm/s.

====Esophageal phase====

12) Esophageal peristalsis

Like the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, the esophageal phase of swallowing is under involuntary neuromuscular control. However, propagation of the food bolus is significantly slower than in the pharynx. The bolus enters the esophagus and is propelled downwards first by striated muscle (recurrent laryngeal, X) then by the smooth muscle (X) at a rate of 3–5 cm/s. The upper esophageal sphincter relaxes to let food pass, after which various striated constrictor muscles of the pharynx as well as peristalsis and relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter sequentially push the bolus of food through the esophagus into the stomach.

13) Relaxation phase

Finally the larynx and pharynx move down with the hyoid mostly by elastic recoil. Then the larynx and pharynx move down from the hyoid to their relaxed positions by elastic recoil.
Swallowing therefore depends on coordinated interplay between many various muscles, and although the initial part of swallowing is under voluntary control, once the deglutition process is started, it is quite hard to stop it.

====Clinical significance====
Swallowing becomes a great concern for the elderly since strokes and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease can interfere with the autonomic nervous system. Speech pathologists commonly diagnose and treat this condition since the speech process uses the same neuromuscular structures as swallowing. Diagnostic procedures commonly performed by a speech pathologist to evaluate dysphagia include Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing and Modified Barium Swallow Study. Occupational Therapists may also offer swallowing rehabilitation services as well as prescribing modified feeding techniques and utensils. Consultation with a dietician is essential, in order to ensure that the individual with dysphagia is able to consume sufficient calories and nutrients to maintain health. In terminally ill patients, a failure of the reflex to swallow leads to a build-up of mucus or saliva in the throat and airways, producing a noise known as a death rattle (not to be confused with agonal respiration, which is an abnormal pattern of breathing due to cerebral ischemia or hypoxia).

Abnormalities of the pharynx and/or oral cavity may lead to oropharyngeal dysphagia. Abnormalities of the esophagus may lead to esophageal dysphagia.
The failure of the lower esophagus sphincter to respond properly to swallowing is called achalasia.

M-Type Swallowing 

With practice, people can learn to swallow fluidly without closing the mouth by merely manipulating the tongue and jaw to drive fluids or foods down the esophagus. With a continuous motion, an individual forges breathing and priorities the swallowed matter. This intermediate level of muscle manipulation is similar to the techniques used by sword swallowers.

==In non-mammal animals==

In many birds, the esophagus is largely a mere gravity chute, and in such events as a seagull swallowing a fish or a stork swallowing a frog, swallowing consists largely of the bird lifting its head with its beak pointing up and guiding the prey with tongue and jaws so that the prey slides inside and down.

In fish, the tongue is largely bony and much less mobile and getting the food to the back of the pharynx is helped by pumping water in its mouth and out of its gills.

In snakes, the work of swallowing is done by raking with the lower jaw until the prey is far enough back to be helped down by body undulations.

<doc id="196991" wikidata="Q223591" url="?curid=196991" title="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">
<text>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a chronic upper gastrointestinal disease in which stomach content persistently and regularly flows up into the esophagus, resulting in symptoms and/or complications. Symptoms include dental corrosion, dysphagia, heartburn, odynophagia, regurgitation, non-cardiac chest pain, extraesophageal symptoms such as chronic cough, hoarseness, reflux-induced laryngitis, or asthma. In the long term, and when not treated, complications such as esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett&#x27;s esophagus may arise.
Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal hernia, and taking certain medications. Medications that may cause or worsen the disease include benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, NSAIDs, and certain asthma medicines. Acid reflux is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is at the junction between the stomach and the esophagus. Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry.
Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery for those who do not improve with the first two measures. Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, lying down on the left side, raising the pillow or bedhead height, losing weight, and stopping smoking. Foods that may precipitate GERD symptoms include coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods. Medications include antacids, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics.
In the Western world, between 10 and 20% of the population is affected by GERD. It is highly prevalent in North America with 18% to 28% of the population suffering from the condition. Occasional gastroesophageal reflux without troublesome symptoms or complications is even more common. The classic symptoms of GERD were first described in 1925, when Friedenwald and Feldman commented on heartburn and its possible relationship to a hiatal hernia. In 1934 gastroenterologist Asher Winkelstein described reflux and attributed the symptoms to stomach acid.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Adults ===
The most common symptoms of GERD in adults are an acidic taste in the mouth, regurgitation, and heartburn. Less common symptoms include pain with swallowing/sore throat, increased salivation (also known as water brash), nausea, chest pain, coughing, and globus sensation. The acid reflux can induce asthma attack symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing in those with underlying asthma.

GERD sometimes causes injury to the esophagus. These injuries may include one or more of the following:
* Reflux esophagitis – inflammation of esophageal epithelium which can cause ulcers near the junction of the stomach and esophagus
* Esophageal strictures – the persistent narrowing of the esophagus caused by reflux-induced inflammation
* Barrett&#x27;s esophagus – intestinal metaplasia (changes of the epithelial cells from squamous to intestinal columnar epithelium) of the distal esophagus
* Esophageal adenocarcinoma – a form of cancer

GERD sometimes causes injury of the larynx (LPR). Other complications can include aspiration pneumonia.

=== Children and babies ===
GERD may be difficult to detect in infants and children since they cannot describe what they are feeling and indicators must be observed. Symptoms may vary from typical adult symptoms. GERD in children may cause repeated vomiting, effortless spitting up, coughing, and other respiratory problems, such as wheezing. Inconsolable crying, refusing food, crying for food and then pulling off the bottle or breast only to cry for it again, failure to gain adequate weight, bad breath, and burping are also common. Children may have one symptom or many; no single symptom is universal in all children with GERD.

Of the estimated 4 million babies born in the US each year, up to 35% of them may have difficulties with reflux in the first few months of their lives, known as &#x27;spitting up&#x27;. About 90% of infants will outgrow their reflux by their first birthday.

=== Mouth ===


Acid reflux into the mouth can cause breakdown of the enamel, especially on the inside surface of the teeth. A dry mouth, acid or burning sensation in the mouth, bad breath and redness of the palate may occur. Less common symptoms of GERD include difficulty in swallowing, water brash, chronic cough, hoarse voice, nausea and vomiting.

Signs of enamel erosion are the appearance of a smooth, silky-glazed, sometimes dull, enamel surface with the absence of perikymata, together with intact enamel along the gum margin. It will be evident in people with restorations as tooth structure typically dissolves much faster than the restorative material, causing it to seem as if it &quot;stands above&quot; the surrounding tooth structure.

=== Barrett&#x27;s esophagus ===
GERD may lead to Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, a type of intestinal metaplasia, which is in turn a precursor condition for esophageal cancer. The risk of progression from Barrett&#x27;s to dysplasia is uncertain, but is estimated at 20% of cases. Due to the risk of chronic heartburn progressing to Barrett&#x27;s, EGD every five years is recommended for people with chronic heartburn, or who take drugs for chronic GERD.

== Causes ==

A small amount of acid reflux is typical even in healthy people (as with infrequent and minor heartburn), but gastroesophageal reflux becomes gastroesophageal reflux disease when signs and symptoms develop into a recurrent problem. Frequent acid reflux is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is at the junction between the stomach and the esophagus.

Factors that can contribute to GERD:
* Hiatal hernia, which increases the likelihood of GERD due to mechanical and motility factors.
* Obesity: increasing body mass index is associated with more severe GERD. In a large series of 2,000 patients with symptomatic reflux disease, it has been shown that 13% of changes in esophageal acid exposure is attributable to changes in body mass index.

Factors that have been linked with GERD, but not conclusively:
* Obstructive sleep apnea
* Gallstones, which can impede the flow of bile into the duodenum, which can affect the ability to neutralize gastric acid

In 1999, a review of existing studies found that, on average, 40% of GERD patients also had &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. The eradication of &quot;H. pylori&quot; can lead to an increase in acid secretion, leading to the question of whether &quot;H. pylori&quot;-infected GERD patients are any different from non-infected GERD patients. A double-blind study, reported in 2004, found no clinically significant difference between these two types of patients with regard to the subjective or objective measures of disease severity.

== Diagnosis ==

The diagnosis of GERD is usually made when typical symptoms are present. Reflux can be present in people without symptoms and the diagnosis requires both symptoms or complications and reflux of stomach content.

Other investigations may include esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Barium swallow X-rays should not be used for diagnosis. Esophageal manometry is not recommended for use in the diagnosis, being recommended only prior to surgery. Ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring may be useful in those who do not improve after PPIs and is not needed in those in whom Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is seen. Investigation for &quot;H. pylori&quot; is not usually needed.

The current gold standard for diagnosis of GERD is esophageal pH monitoring. It is the most objective test to diagnose the reflux disease and allows monitoring GERD patients in their response to medical or surgical treatment. One practice for diagnosis of GERD is a short-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors, with improvement in symptoms suggesting a positive diagnosis. Short-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors may help predict abnormal 24-hour pH monitoring results among patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD.

=== Endoscopy ===
Endoscopy, the examination of the stomach with a fibre-optic scope, is not routinely needed if the case is typical and responds to treatment. It is recommended when people either do not respond well to treatment or have alarm symptoms, including dysphagia, anemia, blood in the stool (detected chemically), wheezing, weight loss, or voice changes. Some physicians advocate either once-in-a-lifetime or 5- to 10-yearly endoscopy for people with longstanding GERD, to evaluate the possible presence of dysplasia or Barrett&#x27;s esophagus.

Biopsies performed during gastroscopy may show:
* Edema and basal hyperplasia (nonspecific inflammatory changes)
* Lymphocytic inflammation (nonspecific)
* Neutrophilic inflammation (usually due to reflux or &quot;Helicobacter&quot; gastritis)
* Eosinophilic inflammation (usually due to reflux): The presence of intraepithelial eosinophils may suggest a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) if eosinophils are present in high enough numbers. Less than 20 eosinophils per high-power microscopic field in the distal esophagus, in the presence of other histologic features of GERD, is more consistent with GERD than EE.
* Goblet cell intestinal metaplasia or Barrett&#x27;s esophagus
* Elongation of the papillae
* Thinning of the squamous cell layer
* Dysplasia
* Carcinoma

Reflux changes that are not erosive in nature lead to &quot;nonerosive reflux disease&quot;.

=== Severity ===
Severity may be documented with the Johnson-DeMeester&#x27;s scoring system:
0 – None
1 – Minimal – occasional episodes
2 – Moderate – medical therapy visits
3 – Severe – interference with daily activities

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Other causes of chest pain such as heart disease should be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Another kind of acid reflux, which causes respiratory and laryngeal signs and symptoms, is called laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) or extraesophageal reflux disease (EERD). Unlike GERD, LPR rarely produces heartburn, and is sometimes called &quot;silent reflux&quot;. Differential diagnosis of GERD can also include dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, esophageal and gastric cancer, and food allergies.

== Treatment ==
The treatments for GERD may include food choices, lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly surgery. Initial treatment is frequently with a proton-pump inhibitor such as omeprazole. In some cases, a person with GERD symptoms can manage them by taking over-the-counter drugs. This is often safer and less expensive than taking prescription drugs. Some guidelines recommend trying to treat symptoms with an H2 antagonist before using a proton-pump inhibitor because of cost and safety concerns.

=== Medical nutrition therapy and lifestyle changes ===
Medical nutrition therapy plays an essential role in managing the symptoms of the disease by preventing reflux, preventing pain and irritation, and decreasing gastric secretions.

Some foods such as chocolate, mint, high-fat food, and alcohol have been shown to relax the lower esophageal sphincter, increasing the risk of reflux. Weight loss is recommended for the overweight or obese, as well as avoidance of bedtime snacks or lying down immediately after meals (meals should occur at least 2–3 hours before bedtime), elevation of the head of the bed on 6-inch blocks, avoidance of smoking, and avoidance of tight clothing that increases pressure in the stomach. It may be beneficial to avoid spices, citrus juices, tomatoes and soft drinks, and to consume small frequent meals and drink liquids between meals. Some evidence suggests that reduced sugar intake and increased fiber intake can help. Although moderate exercise may improve symptoms in people with GERD, vigorous exercise may worsen them. Breathing exercises may relieve GERD symptoms.

=== Medications ===

The primary medications used for GERD are proton-pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers and antacids with or without alginic acid. The use of acid suppression therapy is a common response to GERD symptoms and many people get more of this kind of treatment than their case merits. The overuse of acid suppression is a problem because of the side effects and costs.

==== Proton-pump inhibitors ====
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole, are the most effective, followed by H2 receptor blockers, such as ranitidine. If a once-daily PPI is only partially effective they may be used twice a day. They should be taken one half to one hour before a meal. There is no significant difference between PPIs. When these medications are used long-term, the lowest effective dose should be taken. They may also be taken only when symptoms occur in those with frequent problems. H2 receptor blockers lead to roughly a 40% improvement.

==== Antacids ====
The evidence for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while a combination of an antacid and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may improve symptoms by 60% (NNT=4). Metoclopramide (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or in combination with other treatments due to concerns around adverse effects. The benefit of the prokinetic mosapride is modest.

==== Other agents ====
Sucralfate has similar effectiveness to H2 receptor blockers; however, sucralfate needs to be taken multiple times a day, thus limiting its use. Baclofen, an agonist of the GABAB receptor, while effective, has similar issues of needing frequent dosing in addition to greater adverse effects compared to other medications.

=== Surgery ===
The standard surgical treatment for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. In this procedure, the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia. It is recommended only for those who do not improve with PPIs. Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits of surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors. When comparing different fundoplication techniques, partial posterior fundoplication surgery is more effective than partial anterior fundoplication surgery, and partial fundoplication has better outcomes than total fundoplication.

Esophagogastric dissociation is an alternative procedure that is sometimes used to treat neurologically impaired children with GERD. Preliminary studies have shown it may have a lower failure rate and a lower incidence of recurrent reflux.

In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a device called the LINX, which consists of a series of metal beads with magnetic cores that are placed surgically around the lower esophageal sphincter, for those with severe symptoms that do not respond to other treatments. Improvement of GERD symptoms is similar to those of the Nissen fundoplication, although there is no data regarding long-term effects. Compared to Nissen fundoplication procedures, the procedure has shown a reduction in complications such as gas bloat syndrome that commonly occur. Adverse responses include difficulty swallowing, chest pain, vomiting, and nausea. Contraindications that would advise against use of the device are patients who are or may be allergic to titanium, stainless steel, nickel, or ferrous iron materials. A warning advises that the device should not be used by patients who could be exposed to, or undergo, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of serious injury to the patient and damage to the device.

Some patients who are at an increased surgical risk or do not tolerate PPIs may qualify for a more recently developed incisionless procedure known as a TIF transoral incisionless fundoplication. Benefits of this procedure may last for up to six years.

=== Special populations ===
==== Pregnancy ====
GERD is a common condition that develops during pregnancy, but usually resolves after delivery. The severity of symptoms tend to increase throughout the pregnancy. In pregnancy, dietary modifications and lifestyle changes may be attempted, but often have little effect. Some lifestyle changes that can be implemented are elevating the head of the bed, eating small portions of food at regularly scheduled intervals, reduce fluid intake with a meal, avoid eating three hours before bedtime, and refrain from lying down after eating. Calcium-based antacids are recommended if these changes are not effective; aluminum- and magnesium hydroxide-based antacids are also safe. Antacids that contain sodium bicarbonate or magnesium trisilicate should be avoided in pregnancy. Sucralfate has been studied in pregnancy and proven to be safe as is ranitidine and PPIs.

==== Babies ====
Babies may see relief with smaller, more frequent feedings, more frequent burping during feedings, holding the baby in an upright position 30 minutes after feeding, keeping the baby&#x27;s head elevated while laying on the back, removing milk and soy from the mother&#x27;s diet or feeding the baby milk protein-free formula. They may also be treated with medicines such as ranitidine or proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors, however, have not been found to be effective in this population and there is a lack of evidence for safety. The role of an occupational therapist with an infant with GERD includes positioning during and after feeding. One technique used is called the log-roll technique, which is practiced when changing an infant&#x27;s clothing or diapers. Placing an infant on their back while having their legs lifted is not recommended since it causes the acid to flow back up the esophagus. Instead, the occupational therapist would suggest rolling the child on the side, keeping the shoulders and hips aligned to avoid acid rising up the baby&#x27;s esophagus. Another technique used is feeding the baby on their side with an upright position instead of lying flat on their back. The final positioning technique used for infants is to keep them on their stomach or upright for 20 minutes after feeding.

== Epidemiology ==
In Western populations, GERD affects approximately 10% to 20% of the population and 0.4% newly develop the condition. For instance, an estimated 3.4 million to 6.8 million Canadians have GERD. The prevalence rate of GERD in developed nations is also tightly linked with age, with adults aged 60 to 70 being the most commonly affected. In the United States 20% of people have symptoms in a given week and 7% every day. No data supports sex predominance with regard to GERD.

== History ==
An obsolete treatment is vagotomy (&quot;highly selective vagotomy&quot;), the surgical removal of vagus nerve branches that innervate the stomach lining. This treatment has been largely replaced by medication. Vagotomy by itself tended to worsen contraction of the pyloric sphincter of the stomach, and delayed stomach emptying. Historically, vagotomy was combined with pyloroplasty or gastroenterostomy to counter this problem.

== Research ==
A number of endoscopic devices have been tested to treat chronic heartburn.
* Endocinch puts stitches in the lower esophogeal sphincter (LES) to create small pleats to help strengthen the muscle. However, long-term results were disappointing, and the device is no longer sold by Bard.
* The Stretta procedure uses electrodes to apply radio-frequency energy to the LES. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis in response to the systematic review (no meta-analysis) conducted by SAGES did not support the claims that Stretta was an effective treatment for GERD. A 2012 systematic review found that it improves GERD symptoms.
* NDO Surgical Plicator creates a plication, or fold, of tissue near the gastroesophageal junction, and fixates the plication with a suture-based implant. The company ceased operations in mid-2008, and the device is no longer on the market.
* Transoral incisionless fundoplication, which uses a device called Esophyx, may be effective.

<text>An esophageal motility study (EMS) or esophageal manometry is a test to assess motor function of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

==Indications==
An EMS is typically done to evaluate suspected disorders of motility or peristalsis of the esophagus. These include achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, nutcracker esophagus and hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter. These disorders typically present with dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, usually to both solids and liquids even initially. Other patients with spasm disorders may have the test done to diagnose chest pain thought not to be of cardiac cause.

The test is not useful for anatomical disorders of the esophagus (that is, disorders that distort the anatomy of the esophagus), such as peptic strictures and esophageal cancer.

==Procedure==
A technician places a catheter into the nose and then guides it into the stomach. Once placed in the stomach lining, the catheter is slowly withdrawn, allowing it to detect pressure changes and to record information for later review. The patient will be asked at times to take a deep breath or to take some swallows of water. The degree of discomfort varies among patients. Patients are not sedated because sedatives would alter the functioning of the esophageal muscles. Overall the procedure takes about 45 minutes. After the procedure is complete, patients can usually resume their normal daily activities.

==Other diagnostic tests for swallowing==
Upper gastrointestinal series and their fluoroscopic counterparts use x-rays to image the swallowing motions.

==Recent advances==
Recently, high resolution manometry (HRM) has been developed that significantly reduces the procedure time (10 minutes versus 45 minutes with conventional manometry) and provides enhanced patient comfort. Newer catheters incorporate concurrent impedance with HRM.

<text>The National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) was a not-for-profit, US-based organization, that described itself as a &quot;private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focuses upon health misinformation, fraud, and quackery as public health problems.&quot;

== History ==
According to archived website, the NCAHF evolved from three separate organizations. The Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, Inc. (LVCAHF, now called Quackwatch) was founded in 1969 by Stephen Barrett and H. William Gross, D.D.S. in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Southern California Council Against Health Fraud (SCCAHF) had its origin in 1976 at Loma Linda University with academic colleagues William T. Jarvis and Gordon Rick as co-founders. Thomas H. Jukes of University of California, Berkeley founded the third organization, an unnamed group in northern California.

For a time between 1998 and 2000, the NCAHF operated under the name National Council for Reliable Health Information (NCRHI). The organization became inactive in 2002, and its legal entity was formally dissolved in 2011.

== Mission statement ==

According to NCAHF&#x27;s mission statement, its activities and purposes included:
* Investigating and evaluating claims made for health products and services.
* Educating consumers, professionals, business people, legislators, law enforcement personnel, organizations and agencies about health fraud, misinformation, and quackery.
* Providing a center for communication between individuals and organizations concerned about health misinformation, fraud, and quackery.
* Supporting sound consumer health laws
* Opposing legislation that undermines consumer rights.
* Encouraging and aiding legal actions against those who violate consumer protection laws.
* Sponsoring a free weekly e-mail newsletter.

NCAHF&#x27;s positions on consumer health issues were based on what they considered ethical and scientific principles that underlie consumer protection law. Required were:
* Adequate disclosure in labeling and other warranties to enable consumers to make proper choices;
* Premarketing proof of safety and efficacy for products and services that claim to prevent, alleviate, or cure any disease or disorder; and
* Accountability for those who violate consumer laws.

NCAHF stated that its funding was primarily derived from membership dues, newsletter subscriptions, and consumer information services. Membership was open to everyone, with members and consultants located all over the world. NCAHF&#x27;s officers and board members served without compensation. NCAHF stated they united consumers with health professionals, educators, researchers, attorneys, and others.

== Position on health issues ==

=== Acupuncture ===

The NCAHF asserted that acupuncture is scientifically unproven as a modality of treatment. In 1990, it said that research during the past twenty years had failed to demonstrate that acupuncture was effective against any disease. Perceived effects of acupuncture are, argued the NCAHF, probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion and other psychological mechanisms. The NCAHF pointed out that acupuncture was banned in China in 1929 but underwent a resurgence in the 1960s. The organization also advocated that insurance companies should not be required to cover acupuncture treatment and that licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out.

=== Amalgam fillings ===

There has been some controversy regarding the use of amalgam fillings by dentists, because the amalgam contains mercury. Some forms of mercury are toxic to humans, but the NCAHF cites the CDC in stating that there is no evidence that &quot;the health of the vast majority of people with amalgam is compromised&quot; or that &quot;removing amalgam fillings has a beneficial effect on health&quot;. The NCAHF criticizes those who they believe exploit unfounded public fears for financial gain. NCAHF asserts that breath, urine and blood testing for mercury are inaccurate. Other tests for mercury exposure described by the NCAHF as invalid can include skin testing, stool testing, hair analysis and electrodermal testing.

=== Chiropractic ===

The NCAHF contended that chiropractic can be dangerous and lead to injury or permanent disability. However, the NCAHF did not categorically oppose the practice. It differentiated between chiropractors who promote what it considered good and bad chiropractic practices. The former promote methods of diagnosis and treatment which have a scientific basis. For example, NCAHF claims there is no scientific support for vertebral subluxation. Their view is that chiropractors should restrict their scope of practice to neuromusculoskeletal problems such as muscle spasms, strains, sprains, fatigue, imbalance of strength and flexibility, stretched or irritated nerve tissue, and so forth. Chiropractors should refer cases involving pathology to qualified medical practitioners.

In contrast, what the NCAHF considered bad are those chiropractors who believe the spinal adjustment will cure or alleviate a variety of diseases, such as infection, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies or excesses, appendicitis, blood disorders, or kidney disease. These practitioners may use unproven, disproven, or questionable methods, devices, and products such as adjusting machines, applied kinesiology, chelation therapy, colonic irrigation, computerized nutrition deficiency tests, cranial osteopathy, cytotoxic food allergy testing, DMSO, Gerovital, glandular therapy, hair analysis, herbal crystallization analyses, homeopathy, internal managements, iridology, laser beam acupuncture, laetrile, magnetic therapy, and so forth.

=== Diet advice ===

The NCAHF was opposed to dietary recommendations and practices not supported by scientific evidence, including behavior-related claims. Unverified assessment methods such as iridology, applied kinesiology, and routine hair analysis for assessment of nutritional status are criticized. NCAHF and some of its members have long opposed implementation of beliefs that they characterize as unfounded or unscientific.

NCAHF also questioned the health claims, marketing, safety, efficacy and labeling of many herbal supplements. Herbal preparations are regulated as foods, rather than as drugs, in the United States. The NCAHF advocates regulations for a special OTC category called &quot;Traditional Herbal Remedies&quot; (THRs) with an adverse reaction surveillance program, product batches marked for identification and tracking, package label warnings about proposed dangers of self-treatment, oversight requirements from outside of the herbal industry, and strong penalties for unapproved changes in herbal product formulations.

=== Diploma mills ===

The NCAHF asserted that many unqualified practitioners are able to mislead the public by using diploma mills or &quot;degree mills&quot; to get &quot;specious degrees&quot;. Diploma mills are not accredited, and frequently engage in &quot;pseudoscience and food faddism&quot;. NCAHF also noted that &quot;some of the &#x27;faculty&#x27; or &#x27;academic&#x27; advisors at several of these schools have criminal convictions in the area of health fraud&quot;. NCAHF considers diploma mills harmful to the students and to the public.

== Usefulness as a source ==

The National Council Against Health Fraud was mentioned as a useful source for information by
the United States Department of Agriculture, the 2003 edition of &quot;Cancer Medicine&quot;, published by the American Cancer Society, and many other organizations and libraries.

The journal &quot;Dynamic Chiropractic&quot;, while highly critical of NCAHFs views on chiropractic, has written: &quot;The National Council Against Health Fraud is considered a valuable information source for many agencies nationwide. They are well networked and, as demonstrated by their past history, are able to influence the efforts of various agencies and insurance carriers. The NCAHF&#x27;s ability to publish its opinions and hold these types of conferences does make them a substantial &quot;player&quot; in the area of health fraud.&quot;

In 1998, the AMA&#x27;s Council on Scientific Affairs used NCAHF board member John Renner as a contributing source for some of the content in their &quot;Report 12.&quot;

== Criticism from alternative medicine supporters ==
The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) criticised a 2002 PBS broadcast which included an episode about chiropractic in which the NCAHF was involved. ACA president Daryl D. Wills responded to PBS officials stating (in part): &quot;I find it ironic that a program titled &#x27;Scientific American Frontiers&#x27; would completely ignore the scientific foundation of the chiropractic profession. The chiropractic portion of the June 4 episode titled &#x27;A Different Way to Heal?&#x27; irresponsibly characterized chiropractic care -- a legitimate, research-based form of health care -- as a fraudulent hoax.&quot; and that &quot;[t]he producers of your program could not have expected objectivity&quot; from the NCAHF. The producer of the program replied in detail and explicitly denied these allegations: &quot;The segment did not claim that chiropractic is fraudulent and did not attempt to prove or disprove that chiropractic &#x27;works,&#x27; but it does state that chiropractic has no basis in science. This conclusion is entirely justified by both current research and generally accepted views of human anatomy.&quot;

<doc id="196998" wikidata="Q808892" url="?curid=196998" title="Barrett's esophagus">
<text>Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is a condition in which there is an abnormal (metaplastic) change in the mucosal cells lining the lower portion of the esophagus, from stratified squamous epithelium to simple columnar epithelium with interspersed goblet cells that are normally present only in the small intestine and large intestine. This change is considered to be a premalignant condition because of its potential to further transition to esophageal adenocarcinoma, an often-deadly cancer.

The main cause of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is thought to be an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis. Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy: observing the characteristic appearance of this condition by direct inspection of the lower esophagus; followed by microscopic examination of tissue from the affected area obtained from biopsy. The cells of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus are classified into four categories: nondysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. High-grade dysplasia and early stages of adenocarcinoma may be treated by endoscopic resection or radiofrequency ablation. Later stages of adenocarcinoma may be treated with surgical resection or palliation. Those with nondysplastic or low-grade dysplasia are managed by annual observation with endoscopy, or treatment with radiofrequency ablation. In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater.

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the Western world in recent years. The condition is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus are asymptomatic. The condition is named after surgeon Norman Barrett (1903–1979) even though the condition was originally described by Philip Rowland Allison in 1946.

==Signs and symptoms==
The change from normal to premalignant cells in Barrett&#x27;s esophagus typically does not cause specific symptoms. However, Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is often associated with the following symptoms, primarily due to underlying gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):
* frequent and longstanding heartburn
* trouble swallowing (dysphagia)
* vomiting blood (hematemesis)
* pain under the sternum where the esophagus meets the stomach
* pain when swallowing (odynophagia), which can lead to unintentional weight loss

The risk of developing Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is increased by central obesity (vs. peripheral obesity). The exact mechanism is unclear. The difference in distribution of fat among men (more central) and women (more peripheral) may explain the increased risk in males.

==Pathophysiology==

Barrett&#x27;s esophagus occurs due to chronic inflammation. The principal cause of chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to the cells of the lower esophagus. In turn, this provokes an advantage for cells more resistant to these noxious stimuli in particular HOXA13-expressing stem cells that are characterised by distal (intestinal) characteristics and outcompete the normal squamous cells.

This mechanism also explains the selection of HER2/neu (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction.

Researchers are unable to predict who with heartburn will develop Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. While no relationship exists between the severity of heartburn and the development of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, a relationship does exist between chronic heartburn and the development of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Sometimes, people with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus have no heartburn symptoms at all.

Some anecdotal evidence indicates those with the eating disorder bulimia are more likely to develop Barrett&#x27;s esophagus because bulimia can cause severe acid reflux, and because purging also floods the esophagus with acid. However, a link between bulimia and Barrett&#x27;s esophagus remains unproven.

During episodes of reflux, bile acids enter the esophagus, and this may be an important factor in carcinogenesis. Individuals with GERD and BE are exposed to high concentrations of deoxycholic acid that has cytotoxic effects and can cause DNA damage.

==Diagnosis==

Both macroscopic (from endoscopy) and microscopic positive findings are required to make a diagnosis. Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is marked by the presence of columnar epithelia in the lower esophagus, replacing the normal squamous cell epithelium—an example of metaplasia. The secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the erosive action of the gastric secretions; however, this metaplasia confers an increased risk of adenocarcinoma.

===Screening===

Screening endoscopy is recommended among males over the age of 60 who have reflux symptoms that are of long duration and not controllable with treatment. Among those not expected to live more than five years screening is not recommended.

The Seattle protocol is used commonly in endoscopy to obtain endoscopic biopsies for screening, taken every 1 to 2 cm from the gastroesophageal junction.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic In Scotland, the local NHS started using a swallowable sponge (Cytosponge) in hospitals to collect cell samples for diagnosis. Preliminary studies have shown this diagnostic test to be a useful tool for screening people with heartburn symptoms and improved diagnosis.

Other emerging technologies for screening and diagnosis include optical coherence tomography (OCT), which can generate high-resolution images of the esophagus with moderate sensitivity and specificity for detecting Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, though it may not yet be accurate enough to replace standard biopsies.

===Intestinal metaplasia===
The presence of goblet cells, called intestinal metaplasia, is necessary to make a diagnosis of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. This frequently occurs in the presence of other metaplastic columnar cells, but only the presence of goblet cells is diagnostic. The metaplasia is grossly visible through a gastroscope, but biopsy specimens must be examined under a microscope to determine whether cells are gastric or colonic in nature. Colonic metaplasia is usually identified by finding goblet cells in the epithelium and is necessary for the true diagnosis.

Many histologic mimics of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus are known (i.e. goblet cells occurring in the transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts, &quot;pseudogoblet cells&quot; in which abundant foveolar [gastric] type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells). Assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitional-type epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true Barrett&#x27;s esophagus (specialized columnar metaplasia). The histochemical stain Alcian blue pH 2.5 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinal-type mucins from their histologic mimics. Recently, immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to CDX-2 (specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation) has also been used to identify true intestinal-type metaplastic cells. The protein AGR2 is elevated in Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and can be used as a biomarker for distinguishing Barrett epithelium from normal esophageal epithelium.

The presence of intestinal metaplasia in Barrett&#x27;s esophagus represents a marker for the progression of metaplasia towards dysplasia and eventually adenocarcinoma. This factor combined with two different immunohistochemical expression of p53, Her2 and p16 leads to two different genetic pathways that likely progress to dysplasia in Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Also intestinal metaplastic cells can be positive for CK 7+/CK20−.

===Epithelial dysplasia===
After the initial diagnosis of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is rendered, affected persons undergo annual surveillance to detect changes that indicate higher risk to progression to cancer: development of epithelial dysplasia (or &quot;intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;).
Among all metaplastic lesions, around 8% were associated with dysplasia. particularly a recent study demonstrated that dysplastic lesions were located mainly in the posterior wall of the esophagus.

Considerable variability is seen in assessment for dysplasia among pathologists. Recently, gastroenterology and GI pathology societies have recommended that any diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett be confirmed by at least two fellowship-trained GI pathologists prior to definitive treatment for patients. For more accuracy and reproducibility, it is also recommended to follow international classification systems, such as the &quot;Vienna classification&quot; of gastrointestinal epithelial neoplasia (2000).

==Management==
Many people with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus do not have dysplasia. Medical societies recommend that if a patient has Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, and if the past two endoscopy and biopsy examinations have confirmed the absence of dysplasia, then the patient should not have another endoscopy within three years.

Endoscopic surveillance of people with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is often recommended, although little direct evidence supports this practice. Treatment options for high-grade dysplasia include surgical removal of the esophagus (esophagectomy) or endoscopic treatments such as endoscopic mucosal resection or ablation (destruction).

The risk of malignancy is highest in the United States in Caucasian men over fifty years of age with more than five years of symptoms. Current recommendations include routine endoscopy and biopsy (looking for dysplastic changes). Although in the past physicians have taken a watchful waiting approach, newly published research supports consideration of intervention for Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. Balloon-based radiofrequency ablation, invented by Ganz, Stern, and Zelickson in 1999, is a new treatment modality for the treatment of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and dysplasia and has been the subject of numerous published clinical trials. The findings demonstrate radiofrequency ablation is at least 90% effective to completely clear Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and dysplasia, with durability of up to five years and a favorable safety profile.

Anti-reflux surgery has not been proven to prevent esophageal cancer. However, the indication is that proton pump inhibitors are effective in limiting the progression of esophageal cancer. Laser treatment is used in severe dysplasia, while overt malignancy may require surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic chemotherapy. A recent five-year random-controlled trial has shown that photodynamic therapy using photofrin is statistically more effective in eliminating dysplastic growth areas than sole use of a proton pump inhibitor.

There is presently no reliable way to determine which patients with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus will go on to develop esophageal cancer, although a recent study found the detection of three different genetic abnormalities was associated with as much as a 79% chance of developing cancer in six years.

Endoscopic mucosal resection has also been evaluated as a management technique. Additionally an operation known as a Nissen fundoplication can reduce the reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.

In a variety of studies, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as low-dose aspirin (75–300 mg/day) have shown evidence of preventing esophageal cancer in people with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus.

==Prognosis==

Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is a &quot;pre&quot;-malignant condition, not a cancerous one.

A small subset of patients with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus will eventually develop malignant esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, which has a mortality rate of over 85%.

The risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma increases based on how severe the Barrett&#x27;s esophagus has become. Longer length of the Barrett&#x27;s esophagus region is also associated with increased risk of developing cancer.

Progression and severity of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is measured by amount of dysplasia the cells show. Dysplasia is scored on a five-tier system:
# negative for dysplasia (non-dysplastic Barrett&#x27;s esophagus or NDBE)
# indefinite for dysplasia (IND)
# low-grade dysplasia (LGD)
# high-grade dysplasia (HGD)
# carcinoma

A 2016 study found that the rate of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett&#x27;s esophagus patients with no dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade dysplasia are around 0.6%, 13.4%, and 25%, respectively.

However, for low-grade dysplasia, the true yearly rate of progression to cancer remains difficult to estimate, as results are highly variable from study to study, from 13.4% down to 0.84%. This is partly due to each study having a different mix of intermediate disease states being combined under the umbrella diagnosis of LGD. There is also some concern that risk may be slightly overestimated in the literature due to publication bias.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence in the United States among Caucasian men is eight times the rate among Caucasian women and five times greater than African American men. Overall, the male to female ratio of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is 10:1. Several studies have estimated the prevalence of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus in the general population to be 1.3% to 1.6% in two European populations (Italian and Swedish), and 3.6% in a Korean population.

==History==
The condition is named after Australian thoracic surgeon Norman Barrett (1903–1979), who in 1950 argued that &quot;ulcers are found below the squamocolumnar junction ... represent gastric ulcers within &#x27;a pouch of stomach ... drawn up by scar tissue into the mediastinum&#x27; ... representing an example of a &#x27;congenital short esophagus. In contrast, Philip Rowland Allison and Alan Johnstone argued that the condition related to the &quot;esophagus lined with gastric mucous membrane and not intra-thoracic stomach as Barrett mistakenly believed.&quot; Philip Allison, cardiothoracic surgeon and Chair of Surgery at the University of Oxford, suggested &quot;calling the chronic peptic ulcer crater of the esophagus a &#x27;Barrett&#x27;s ulcer, but added this name did not imply agreement with &quot;Barrett&#x27;s description of an esophagus lined with gastric mucous membrane as stomach.&quot; Bani-Hani KE and Bani-Hani KR argue that the terminology and definition of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is surrounded by extraordinary confusion unlike most other medical conditions and that &quot;[t]he use of the eponym &#x27;Barrett&#x27;s&#x27; to describe [the condition] is not justified from a historical point of view&quot;. Bani-Hani KE and Bani-Hani KR investigated the historical aspects of the condition and found they could establish &quot;how little Norman Barrett had contributed to the core concept of this condition in comparison to the contributions of other investigators, particularly the contribution of Philip Allison&quot;.

A further association was made with adenocarcinoma in 1975.

<text>Isidor Isaac Rabi (; born Israel Isaac Rabi; July 29, 1898 – January 11, 1988) was an American physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944 for his discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance, which is used in magnetic resonance imaging. He was also one of the first scientists in the United States to work on the cavity magnetron, which is used in microwave radar and microwave ovens.

Born into a traditional Polish-Jewish family in Rymanów, Galicia, Rabi came to the United States as an infant and was raised in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. He entered Cornell University as an electrical engineering student in 1916, but soon switched to chemistry. Later, he became interested in physics. He continued his studies at Columbia University, where he was awarded his doctorate for a thesis on the magnetic susceptibility of certain crystals. In 1927, he headed for Europe, where he met and worked with many of the finest physicists of the time.

In 1929, Rabi returned to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm the properties of the atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.

During World War II he worked on radar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Radiation Laboratory (RadLab) and on the Manhattan Project. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission, and was chairman from 1952 to 1956. He also served on the Science Advisory Committees (SACs) of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Army&#x27;s Ballistic Research Laboratory, and was Science Advisor to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was involved with the establishment of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1946, and later, as United States delegate to UNESCO, with the creation of CERN in 1952. When Columbia created the rank of university professor in 1964, Rabi was the first to receive that position. A special chair was named after him in 1985. He retired from teaching in 1967, but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus and Special Lecturer until his death.

==Early years==
Israel Isaac Rabi was born on July 29, 1898, into a Polish-Jewish Orthodox family in Rymanów, Galicia, in what was then part of Austria-Hungary but is now Poland. Soon after he was born, his father, David Rabi, emigrated to the United States. The younger Rabi and his mother, Sheindel, joined David there a few months later, and the family moved into a two-room apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At home the family spoke Yiddish. When Rabi was enrolled in school, Sheindel said his name was Izzy, and a school official, thinking it was short for Isidor, put that down as his name. Henceforth, that became his official name. Later, in response to anti-Semitism, he started writing his name as Isidor Isaac Rabi, and was known professionally as I.I. Rabi. To most of his friends and family, including his sister Gertrude, who was born in 1903, he was known simply by his last name. In 1907, the family moved to Brownsville, Brooklyn, where they ran a grocery store.

As a boy, Rabi was interested in science. He read science books borrowed from the public library and built his own radio set. His first scientific paper—written on the design of a radio condenser—was published in &quot;Modern Electrics&quot; when he was in elementary school. After reading about Copernican heliocentrism, he became an atheist. &quot;It&#x27;s all very simple&quot;, he told his parents, adding, &quot;Who needs God?&quot; As a compromise with his parents, for his Bar Mitzvah, which was held at home, he gave a speech in Yiddish about how an electric light works. He attended the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, from which he graduated in 1916. Later that year, he entered Cornell University as an electrical engineering student, but soon switched to chemistry. After the American entry into World War I in 1917, he joined the Student Army Training Corps at Cornell. For his senior thesis, he investigated the oxidation states of manganese. He was awarded his Bachelor of Science degree in June 1919, but since at the time Jews were largely excluded from employment in the chemical industry and academia, he did not receive any job offers. He worked briefly at the Lederle Laboratories, and then as a bookkeeper.

==Education==
In 1922 Rabi returned to Cornell as a graduate chemistry student, and began studying physics. In 1923 he met, and began courting, Helen Newmark, a summer-semester student at Hunter College. To be near her when she returned home, he continued his studies at Columbia University, where his supervisor was Albert Wills. In June 1924 Rabi landed a job as a part-time tutor at the City College of New York. Wills, whose specialty was magnetism, suggested that Rabi write his doctoral thesis on the magnetic susceptibility of sodium vapor. The topic did not appeal to Rabi, but after William Lawrence Bragg gave a seminar at Columbia about the electric susceptibility of certain crystals called Tutton&#x27;s salts, Rabi decided to research their magnetic susceptibility, and Wills agreed to be his supervisor.

Measuring the magnetic resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals then had to be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s 1873 &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled &quot;On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals&quot;, to &quot;Physical Review&quot; on July 16, 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded that he needed to promote his work as well as publish it.

Like many other young physicists, Rabi was closely following momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced him of the validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in Ludwig Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Einführung in die Theorie der Differentialgleichungen (Introduction to the theory of differential equations)&quot;, which describes a method originally developed by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to &quot;Physical Review&quot;, which published it in 1927.

==Europe==
In May 1927, Rabi was appointed a Barnard Fellow. This came with a stipend of $1,500 ($ in dollars) for the period from September 1927 to June 1928. He immediately applied for a year&#x27;s leave of absence from the City College of New York so he could study in Europe. When this was refused, he resigned. On reaching Zürich, where he hoped to work for Erwin Schrödinger, he met two fellow Americans, Julius Adams Stratton and Linus Pauling. They found that Schrödinger was leaving, as he had been appointed head of the Theoretical Institute at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. Rabi therefore decided to seek a position with Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich instead. In Munich, he found two more Americans, Howard Percy Robertson and Edward Condon. Sommerfeld accepted Rabi as a postdoctoral researcher. German physicists Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe were also working with Sommerfeld at the time, but the three Americans became especially close.

On Wills&#x27; advice, Rabi traveled to Leeds for the 97th annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where he heard Werner Heisenberg present a paper on quantum mechanics. Afterwards, Rabi moved to Copenhagen, where he volunteered to work for Niels Bohr. Bohr was on vacation, but Rabi went straight to work on calculating the magnetic susceptibility of molecular hydrogen. After Bohr returned in October, he arranged for Rabi and Yoshio Nishina to continue their work with Wolfgang Pauli at the University of Hamburg.

Although he came to Hamburg to work with Pauli, Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their molecular beam experiments, for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi devised a method of using a uniform field instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This would be easier to use, and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern&#x27;s advice, Rabi wrote a letter about his results to &quot;Nature&quot;, which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled &quot;Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen&quot; (&quot;On the method of deflection of molecular beams&quot;) to &quot;Zeitschrift für&quot; (&quot;Journal of Physics&quot;), where it was published in April.

By this time the Barnard Fellowship had expired, and Rabi and Helen were living on a $182 ($ in dollars) per month stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation. They left Hamburg for Leipzig, where he hoped to work with Heisenberg. In Leipzig, he found Robert Oppenheimer, a fellow New Yorker. It would be the start of a long friendship. Heisenberg departed for a tour of the United States in March 1929, so Rabi and Oppenheimer decided to go to the ETH Zurich, where Pauli was now the professor of physics. Rabi&#x27;s education in physics was enriched by the leaders in the field he met there, which included Paul Dirac, Walter Heitler, Fritz London, Francis Wheeler Loomis, John von Neumann, John Slater, Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner.

==Molecular Beam Laboratory==
On March 26, 1929, Rabi received an offer of a lectureship from Columbia, with an annual salary of $3,000. The dean of Columbia&#x27;s physics department, George B. Pegram, was looking for a theoretical physicist to teach statistical mechanics and an advanced course in the new subject of quantum mechanics, and Heisenberg had recommended Rabi. Helen was now pregnant, so Rabi needed a regular job, and this job was in New York. He accepted, and returned to the United States in August on the . Rabi became the only Jewish faculty member at Columbia at the time.

Rabi was a poor instructor. Leon Lederman recalled that after a lecture, students would head to the library to try to work out what Rabi had been talking about. Irving Kaplan rated Rabi and Harold Urey as &quot;the worst teachers I ever had&quot;. Norman Ramsey considered Rabi&#x27;s lectures &quot;pretty dreadful&quot;, while William Nierenberg felt that he was &quot;simply an awful lecturer&quot;. Despite his shortcomings as a lecturer, his influence was great. He inspired many of his students to pursue careers in physics, and some became famous.

Rabi&#x27;s first daughter, Helen Elizabeth, was born in September 1929. A second girl, Margaret Joella, followed in 1934. Between his teaching duties and his family, he had little time for research, and published no papers in his first year at Columbia, but was nonetheless promoted to assistant professor at its conclusion. He became a professor in 1937.

In 1931 Rabi returned to particle beam experiments. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit-Rabi equation, and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm the properties of the atomic nucleus. The next step was to do so. With the help of Victor W. Cohen, Rabi built a molecular beam apparatus at Columbia. Their idea was to employ a weak magnetic field instead of a strong one, with which they hoped to detect the nuclear spin of sodium. When the experiment was conducted, four beamlets were found, from which they deduced a nuclear spin of .

Rabi&#x27;s Molecular Beam Laboratory began to attract others, including Sidney Millman, a graduate student who studied lithium for his doctorate. Another was Jerrold Zacharias who, believing that the sodium nucleus would be too difficult to understand, proposed studying the simplest of the elements, hydrogen. Its deuterium isotope had only recently been discovered at Columbia in 1931 by Urey, who received the 1934 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Urey was able to supply them with both heavy water and gaseous deuterium for their experiments. Despite its simplicity, Stern&#x27;s group in Hamburg had observed that hydrogen did not behave as predicted. Urey also helped in another way; he gave Rabi half his prize money to fund the Molecular Beam Laboratory. Other scientists whose careers began at the Molecular Beam Laboratory included Norman Ramsey, Julian Schwinger, Jerome Kellogg and Polykarp Kusch. All were men; Rabi did not believe that women could be physicists. He never had a woman as a doctoral or postdoctoral student, and generally opposed women as candidates for faculty positions.

At the suggestion of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This became the basis for the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern&#x27;s team had found, and Rabi&#x27;s team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron&#x27;s magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the proton&#x27;s magnetic moment from the deuteron&#x27;s. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. 

==World War II==

In September 1940, Rabi became a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device promised to revolutionize radar, so Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.

Loomis and DuBridge recruited physicists for the new laboratory at an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret that it had to be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by January 6, 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150 cm to 10 cm, and then to 3 cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi&#x27;s instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.

In 1942 Robert Oppenheimer attempted to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher to work at the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.

==Later life==
In 1945, Rabi delivered the Richtmyer Memorial Lecture, held by the American Association of Physics Teachers in honor of Floyd K. Richtmyer, wherein he proposed that the magnetic resonance of atoms might be used as the basis of a clock. William L. Laurence wrote it up for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, under the headline &quot;&#x27;Cosmic pendulum&#x27; for clock planned&quot;. Before long Zacharias and Ramsey had built such atomic clocks. Rabi actively pursued his research into magnetic resonance until about 1960, but he continued to make appearances at conferences and seminars until his death.
Rabi chaired Columbia&#x27;s physics department from 1945 to 1949, during which time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa), a research scientist (Aage Bohr), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), a doctoral student (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (Leon Cooper). Martin L. Perl, a doctoral student of Rabi&#x27;s, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. Rabi was the Eugene Higgins professor of physics at Columbia but when Columbia created the rank of university professor in 1964, Rabi was the first to receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.

A legacy of the Manhattan Project was the network of national laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, he set up a rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on January 31, 1947, a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Rabi suggested to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven might be a model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science as a way of inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the &quot;Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire&quot; (CERN or European Organization for Nuclear Research). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the wall of his home office.

===Military matters===
The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that created the Atomic Energy Commission provided for a nine-man General Advisory Committee (GAC) to advise the commission on scientific and technical matters. Rabi was one of those appointed in December 1946. The GAC was enormously influential throughout the late 1940s, but in 1950 the GAC unanimously opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. Rabi went further than most of the other members, and joined Fermi in opposing the hydrogen bomb on moral as well as technical grounds. However, President Harry S. Truman overrode the GAC&#x27;s advice, and ordered development to proceed. Rabi later said:

Oppenheimer was not reappointed to the GAC when his term expired in 1952, and Rabi succeeded him as chairman, serving until 1956. Rabi later testified on Oppenheimer&#x27;s behalf at the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s controversial security hearing in 1954 that led to Oppenheimer being stripped of his security clearance. Many witnesses supported Oppenheimer, but none more forcefully than Rabi:

Rabi was appointed a member of the Science Advisory Committee (SAC) of the Office of Defense Mobilization in 1952, serving as its chairman from 1956 to 1957. This coincided with the Sputnik crisis. President Dwight Eisenhower met with the SAC on October 15, 1957, to seek advice on possible US responses to the Soviet satellite success. Rabi, who knew Eisenhower from the latter&#x27;s time as president of Columbia, was the first to speak, and put forward a series of proposals, one of which was to strengthen the committee so it could provide the President with timely advice. This was done, and the SAC became the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee a few weeks later. He also became Eisenhower&#x27;s Science Advisor. In 1956 Rabi attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. He served as the US Representative to the NATO Science Committee at the time that the term &quot;software engineering&quot; was coined. While serving in that capacity, he bemoaned the fact that many large software projects were delayed. This prompted discussions that led to the formation of a study group that organized the first conference on software engineering.

===Honors===
In the course of his life, Rabi received many honors in addition to the Nobel Prize. These included the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1942, the Medal for Merit and the King&#x27;s Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom from Great Britain in 1948, the officer in the French Legion of Honour in 1956, Columbia University&#x27;s Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1960, the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal and the Atoms for Peace Award in 1967, the Oersted Medal from the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1982, the Four Freedoms Award from the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute and the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1985, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and the Vannevar Bush Award from the National Science Foundation in 1986. He was a Fellow (elected 1931) of the American Physical Society, serving as its president in 1950, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was internationally recognized with membership in the Japan Academy and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, and in 1959 was appointed a member of the board of governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. The most valuable of Columbia University&#x27;s undergraduate research scholarships, designed to motivate and support promising young scientists, is named after him, so is the street, Route Rabi at CERN, on the Prévessin site in France.

Columbia University&#x27;s I. I. Rabi Scholars program assists &quot;some of Columbia College&#x27;s most promising science students at the point of admission into the College.&quot;

===Death===
Rabi died at his home on Riverside Drive in Manhattan from cancer on January 11, 1988. His wife, Helen, survived him and died at the age of 102 on June 18, 2005. In his last days, he was reminded of his greatest achievement when his physicians examined him using magnetic resonance imaging, a technology that had been developed from his ground-breaking research on magnetic resonance. The machine happened to have a reflective inner surface, and he remarked: &quot;I saw myself in that machine... I never thought my work would come to this.&quot;

<text>Geomancy translates literally to &quot;earth divination&quot;, and the term was originally used to mean methods of divination that interpret geographic features, markings on the ground, or the patterns formed by soil, rocks, or sand. Its definition has expanded over time (along with the recognized definition of the suffix &quot;-mancy&quot;), to include any spiritual, metaphysical, or pseudoscientific practice that is related to the Earth. In recent times the term has been applied to a wide range of other occult and fringe activities, including Earth mysteries and the introduction of ley lines and .

Geomancy was one of the forms of divination throughout Africa and Europe in premodern times, but was considered a forbidden practice by Christians in medieval Europe. In other regions and cultures, geomancy practices include &quot;Sikidy&quot; and &quot;Ifá&quot; (found in Africa), I Ching and Feng shui (found in China), Kumalak (found in parts of Central Asia), Vastu shastra (in India), Kahuna kuhikuhipu&#x27;uone (in Ancient Hawai&#x27;i).

==Etymology and history==
The word &quot;geomancy&quot;, from Late Greek , translates literally to . In Latin it becomes . Earlier Greek renditions of this word borrowed the Arabic word () directly, rendering it as or . Other Arabic names for geomancy include , , and , (literally ). The origins of geomancy are Arabic and the original geomantic figures were created by &quot;making lines of random numbers of dots in the sand&quot;. 

Geomancy was one of the forms of divination throughout Africa and Europe, particularly during the Middle Ages. However it was classified by Christians as one of the seven &quot;forbidden arts&quot;, along with black magic, hydromancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and scapulimancy.

==Forms==
===Arabic geomancy===

The Arabic tradition consists of sketching sixteen random lines of dots in sand. This same process survived virtually unchanged through its introduction to Europe in the medieval era, and survives to this day in various Arabic countries.
===African geomancy===

Like Arabic geomancy, &quot;Sikidy&quot; and other forms of African divination follow techniques that have remained virtually unchanged.
As an example, Sikidy is the most important method of divination for the Malagasy peoples of Madagascar. The process involves a mathematical grid of disk-shaped seeds in sixteen figures arranged in rows which the sorcerer uses to divine the future.

One traditional form of geomancy in Africa consists of throwing handfuls of dirt in the air and observing how the dirt falls. It can also involve a mouse as the agent of the earth spirit. Ifá, one of the oldest forms of geomancy, originated in West Africa, and uses the same sixteen geomantic figures as in Arabic and Western geomancy with different meanings and names; the process is shortened to using only two figures.

===Chinese geomancy===
In China, the diviner may enter a trance and make markings on the ground that are interpreted by an associate (often a young or illiterate boy). Similar forms of geomancy include scrying involving the patterns seen in rocks or soil.

====I Ching====

The Chinese divination practice of the I Ching has several striking similarities to geomancy. It includes a series of binary trigrams (as opposed to tetragrams used in geomancy) that are generated at random, the resulting figures of which are taken in combination. However, the figures are not added or reorganized as in geomancy, but are instead taken to form a single hexagram. While there are 23, or eight, trigrams, there are 26, or 64, hexagrams. This yields a smaller set of resulting charts than geomancy.

====Feng shui====

In the 19th century, Christian missionaries in China translated &quot;feng shui&quot; as &quot;geomancy&quot; due to their observations of local shamans and priests manipulating the flow and direction of energy based on aesthetics, location, and position of objects and buildings. Although it stems from a distinct tradition, the term &quot;geomancy&quot; now commonly includes feng shui. Similarly, the introduction of a similar Indian system of aesthetics and positioning to harmonize the local energies, &quot;vastu shastra&quot;, has come under the name &quot;geomancy&quot;. 

===Indian Vastu shastra===
Vastu shastra is a traditional Indian system of architecture which literally translates to &quot;science of architecture&quot;. These are texts found on the Indian subcontinent that describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry. Vastu Shastras incorporate traditional Hindu and in some cases Buddhist beliefs. The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns (yantra), symmetry, and directional alignments.

Vastu Shastra are the textual part of &quot;Vastu Vidya&quot;, the latter being the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India. Vastu Vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams. These ideas and concepts do not follow rigid rules but rather are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and to the overall fabric of the Vastu. Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of &quot;Mandir&quot; (Hindu temples), and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.

===Central Asian Kumalak===

Kumalak is a type of geomancy practiced in Kazakhstan, Tuva, and other parts of Central Asia. Kumalak makes use of a three by three grid, wherein a shaman will ritually place up to 41 beads. These shamans use kumalak more to connect with their ancestors and spiritual guides than to obtain information through divination. Further, shamans who use kumalak must be initiated and taught how to perform the rituals of kumalak correctly. According to them, kumalak is an ancient system of knowledge reaching back to the roots of their civilization.

===Korean geomancy===
 (which like &quot;feng shui&quot; literally means ), is the Korean word for geomancy. As a method of divination it seeks to locate favorable sites for cities, residences and burial.

This tradition was popularized in Korea in the ninth century by the Buddhist monk Toson (Doseon), who studied and adapted the ideas and practices of the different Chinese Daoist schools of Feng-shui to the Korean landscape situation and cultural traditions.

In Korea, geomancy takes the form of interpreting the topography of the land to determine future events and or the strength of a dynasty or particular family. Therefore, not only were location and land forms important, but the topography could shift causing disfavor and the need to relocate. The idea is still accepted in many South East Asian societies today, although with reduced force.

<doc id="197002" wikidata="Q212809" url="?curid=197002" title="Endoscopy">
<text>An endoscopy is a procedure used in medicine to look inside the body. The endoscopy procedure uses an endoscope to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body. Unlike many other medical imaging techniques, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ.

There are many types of endoscopies. Depending on the site in the body and type of procedure, an endoscopy may be performed by a doctor or a surgeon. During the procedure, a patient may be fully conscious or anaesthetised. Most often, the term &quot;endoscopy&quot; is used to refer to an examination of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, known as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

Similar instruments are called borescopes for nonmedical use.

==History==
Adolf Kussmaul was fascinated by sword swallowers who would insert a sword down their throat without gagging. This drew inspiration to insert a hollow tube for observation; the next problem to solve was how to shine light through the tube, as they were still relying on candles and oil lamps as light sources.

The term &quot;endoscope&quot; was first used on February 7, 1855, by engineer-optician Charles Chevalier, about the &quot;uréthroscope&quot; of Désormeaux, who himself began using the former term a month later. The self-illuminated endoscope was developed at Glasgow Royal Infirmary in Scotland (one of the first hospitals to have mains electricity) in 1894/5 by John Macintyre as part of his specialization in the investigation of the larynx.

==Medical uses==
Endoscopy may be used to investigate symptoms in the digestive system including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also used in diagnosis, most commonly by performing a biopsy to check for conditions such as anemia, bleeding, inflammation, and cancers of the digestive system. The procedure may also be used for treatment such as cauterization of a bleeding vessel, widening a narrow esophagus, clipping off a polyp, or removing a foreign object.

Specialty professional organizations that specialize in digestive problems advise that many patients with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus receive endoscopies too frequently. Such societies recommend that patients with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and no cancer symptoms after two biopsies receive biopsies as indicated and no more often than the recommended rate.

===Applications===

Health care providers can use endoscopy to review any of the following body parts:
* The gastrointestinal tract (GI tract):
** oesophagus, stomach and duodenum (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)
** small intestine (enteroscopy)
** large intestine/colon (colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy)
** Magnification endoscopy
** bile duct
*** endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), duodenoscope-assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy, intraoperative cholangioscopy
** rectum (rectoscopy) and anus (anoscopy), both also referred to as (proctoscopy)
* The respiratory tract
** The nose (rhinoscopy)
** The upper respiratory tract (laryngoscopy)
** The lower respiratory tract (bronchoscopy)
* The ear (otoscope)
* The Urinary bladder (cystoscopy)
** The Ureter (ureteroscopy)
* The female reproductive system (gynoscopy)
** The cervix (colposcopy)
** The uterus (hysteroscopy)
** The fallopian tubes (falloposcopy)
* Normally closed body cavities (through a small incision):
** The abdominal or pelvic cavity (laparoscopy)
** The interior of a joint (arthroscopy)
** Organs of the chest (thoracoscopy and mediastinoscopy)

Endoscopy is used for many procedures:
* During pregnancy
** The amnion (amnioscopy)
** The fetus (fetoscopy)
* Plastic surgery
* Panendoscopy (or triple endoscopy)
** Combines laryngoscopy, esophagoscopy, and bronchoscopy
* Orthopedic surgery
** Hand surgery, such as endoscopic carpal tunnel release
** Knee surgery, such as anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
** Epidural space (epiduroscopy)
** Bursae (bursectomy)
* Endodontic surgery
** Maxillary sinus surgery
** Apicoectomy
* Endoscopic endonasal surgery
* Endoscopic spinal surgery
* Endoscopic nerve decompression for peripheral nerves

An endoscopy is a simple procedure that allows a doctor to look inside human bodies using an instrument called an endoscope. A cutting tool can be attached to the end of the endoscope, and the apparatus can then be used to perform minor procedures such as tissue biopsies, banding of oesophageal varices, or removal of polyps.

==Application in other fields==
* For non-medical use, such as internal inspection of complex technical systems, borescopes are used. These are similar to endoscopes.
* The planning and architectural community use architectural endoscopy for pre-visualization of scale models of proposed buildings and cities
* Endoscopes are also a tool helpful in the examination of improvised explosive devices by bomb disposal personnel.
* Law enforcement uses endoscopes for conducting surveillance via tight spaces.

==Risks==
The main risks are infection, over-sedation, perforation, or a tear of the stomach or esophagus lining and bleeding. Although perforation generally requires surgery, certain cases may be treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or polyp removal. Such typically minor bleeding may simply stop on its own or be controlled by cauterisation. Surgery became necessary. Perforation and bleeding are rare during gastroscopy. Other minor risks include drug reactions and complications related to other diseases the patient may have. Consequently, patients should inform their doctor of all allergic tendencies and medical problems. Occasionally, the site of the sedative injection may become inflamed and tender for a short time. This is usually not serious, and warm compresses for a few days are usually helpful. While any of these complications may occur, each of them occurs quite infrequently. A doctor can further discuss risks with the patient about the particular need for gastroscopy.

==After the endoscopy==
After the procedure, the patient will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until a significant portion of the medication has worn off. Occasionally, the patient is left with a mild sore throat, which may respond to saline gargles or chamomile tea. It may last for weeks or not happen at all. The patient may have a feeling of distention from the insufflated air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and fleeting. When fully recovered, the patient will be instructed when to resume their usual diet (probably within a few hours) and will be allowed to be taken home. Where sedation has been used, most facilities mandate that the patient be taken home by another person and that they not drive or handle machinery for the remainder of the day. Patients who have had an endoscopy without sedation can leave unassisted.

<text>Christopher Ofili, (born 10 October 1968) is a British painter who is best known for his paintings incorporating elephant dung. He was Turner Prize-winner and one of the Young British Artists. Since 2005, Ofili has been living and working in Trinidad and Tobago, where he currently resides in the city of Port of Spain. He also has lived and worked in London and Brooklyn.

Ofili has utilized resin, beads, oil paint, glitter, lumps of elephant dung and cut-outs from pornographic magazines as painting elements. His work has been classified as punk art.

==Early life and education==
Ofili was born in Manchester, England, to parents May and Michael Ofili of Nigerian descent. When he was eleven, his father left the family and moved back to Nigeria. Ofili was for some years educated at St. Pius X High School for Boys, and then at Xaverian College in Victoria Park, Manchester. Ofili completed a foundation course in art at Tameside College in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester and then studied in London, at the Chelsea School of Art from 1988 to 1991 and at the Royal College of Art from 1991 to 1993. In the autumn of 1992, he got a one-year exchange scholarship to Universität der Künste Berlin.

Ofili visited Trinidad for the first time in 2000, when he was invited by an international art trust to attend a painting workshop in Port of Spain. He permanently moved to Trinidad in 2005. In 2002, he married Roba El-Essawy, former singer with trip-hop band Attica Blues. They divorced in 2019. He maintains a studio in Port of Spain, Trinidad.

==Career==
Ofili&#x27;s early work was heavily influenced by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Georg Baselitz, Philip Guston, and George Condo. Peter Doig was doing graduate work at the Chelsea College of Arts when Ofili was an undergraduate, and they soon became friends. In 2014, art critic Roberta Smith held that Ofili has much in common with painters like Mickalene Thomas, Kerry James Marshall, Robert Colescott and Ellen Gallagher, and with more distant precedents such as Bob Thompson, Beauford Delaney and William H. Johnson.

Ofili was established through exhibitions by Charles Saatchi at his gallery in north London and the travelling exhibition &quot;Sensation&quot; (1997), becoming recognised as one of the few British artists of African / Caribbean descent to break through as a member of the Young British Artists group. Ofili has also had numerous solo shows since the early 1990s, including at Southampton City Art Gallery]. In 1998, Ofili won the Turner Prize, and in 2003 he was selected to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale of that year, where his work for the British Pavilion was done in collaboration with the architect David Adjaye.

In 1992 he won a scholarship that allowed him to travel to Zimbabwe. Ofili studied cave paintings there, which had some effect on his style.

Between 1995 and 2005, Ofili focused on a series of watercolors, each about 9½ by 6½ inches and produced in a single sitting. They predominantly feature heads of men and women, as well as some studies of flowers and birds. Ofili&#x27;s paintings also make reference to blaxploitation films and gangsta rap, seeking to question racial and sexual stereotypes in a humorous way. In a series of faces that Ofili called &quot;Harems&quot;, each arrangement consists of one man with as many as four women on each side of him.

Ofili&#x27;s work is often built up in layers of paint, resin, glitter, dung (mainly elephant) and other materials to create a collage. Though Ofili&#x27;s detractors often state that he &quot;splatters&quot; elephant dung on his pictures, this is inaccurate: he sometimes applies it directly to the canvas in the form of dried spherical lumps, and sometimes, in the same form, uses it as varnished foot-like supports on which the paintings stand.

Ofili has been founder and prime mover behind the short-lived &quot;Freeness Project&quot;. This project involved the coming together of artists, producers and musicians of minority ethnic groups (Asian and African) in an attempt to expose the music that may be unheard in other spaces. Freeness allowed the creativity of unsigned contemporary British ethnic minority artists to be heard. The result of months of tours to 10 cities in the UK resulted in &quot;Freeness Volume 1&quot; – a compilation of works that were shown during the tour.

After relocating to Trinidad in 2005, Ofili began a series of blue paintings inspired by the &quot;Jab Jab&quot; or &quot;blue devils&quot; who participate in the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, and the Expressionist group of German and Russian artists, &quot;Der Blaue Reiter.&quot; These paintings often employed the use of a silver, acrylic background with layers of dark oil pigment on top. Later iterations of these works were shown at Ofili&#x27;s solo show &quot;Chris Ofili: Day and Night&quot; at The New Museum of New York which were installed in a very dimly lit room, causing viewers to adjust their eyes to the darkness in order to see the paintings.

Ofili was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to art. Ofili was included in the 2019 edition of the Powerlist, ranking the 100 most influential Black Britons.
==Exhibitions==
Ofili&#x27;s work was featured in a museum in the 1995 exhibition &quot;Brilliant! New Art from London&quot; at the Walker Art Center. Significant solo exhibitions include the Arts Club of Chicago (2010), Kestnergesellschaft, Hanover (2006), the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2005), and Southampton City Art Gallery (1998). In 2010, Tate Britain presented the most extensive exhibition of his work to date. In 2014, The New Museum in New York presented the first, major solo show of Ofili&#x27;s work in the U.S. titled &quot;Chris Ofili: Night and Day&quot;.

==Controversy==

===&quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot;===
One of his paintings, &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, a depiction of the Virgin Mary, was at issue in a lawsuit between the mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art when it was exhibited there in 1999 as a part of the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition. The painting depicted a Black Madonna surrounded by images from blaxploitation movies and close-ups of female genitalia cut from pornographic magazines, and elephant dung. These were formed into shapes reminiscent of the cherubim and seraphim commonly depicted in images of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary. Following the scandal surrounding this painting, Bernard Goldberg ranked Ofili No. 86 in &quot;100 People Who Are Screwing Up America&quot;. Red Grooms showed his support of the artist by purchasing one of Ofili&#x27;s paintings in 1999, even after Giuliani famously exclaimed, &quot;There’s nothing in the First Amendment that supports horrible and disgusting projects!&quot; The painting was owned by David Walsh and was on display at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania. Steven A. Cohen then owned it for three years and donated the painting to the Museum of Modern Art.

===&quot;The Upper Room&quot; and the Tate Gallery===
&quot;The Upper Room&quot; is an installation of 13 paintings of rhesus macaque monkeys by Ofili in a specially designed room. It was bought by the Tate Gallery in 2005 and caused controversy as Ofili was on the board of the Tate Trustees at the time of the purchase. In 2006 the Charity Commission censured the Tate for this purchase.

==Art market==
His &quot;Orgena&quot;, a glittery portrait of a black woman created by the artist for his Turner Prize-winning exhibit at the Tate in 1998 was sold to an American collector for a record GBP 1.8 million, over its GBP 1 million high estimate, at Christie&#x27;s London in 2010. In 2015, art collector David Walsh sold Ofili&#x27;s 8-foot-tall &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot; for 2.9 million pounds at Christie&#x27;s.

<text>California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt or Humboldt) is a public university in Arcata, California. It is one of three polytechnic universities in the California State University (CSU) system and the northernmost campus in the system.

The main campus, situated hillside at the edge of a coast redwood forest, overlooks Arcata, much of Humboldt Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. The college town setting on the California North Coast, north of Eureka, north of San Francisco, and 654 miles (1053 km) north of Los Angeles is notable for its natural beauty. It is the most westerly four-year university in the contiguous United States. Humboldt is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI).

The university is divided into three colleges: the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; the College of Natural Resources and Sciences; and the College of Professional Studies. It offers 58 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 14 master&#x27;s degree programs, 76 minors, and 4 credential programs. Cal Poly Humboldt does not offer doctoral degrees.

== History ==

Humboldt State Normal School was established as a teacher&#x27;s college on June 16, 1913, by California governor Hiram Johnson. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. The cities of Arcata and Eureka (and to a lesser extent Fortuna) competed with one another to host the new campus. Arcata eventually won the university when William Preston, and the Union Water company, donated 55-acres. It opened on April 6, 1914, in the former Arcata Grammar School building with 78 students and 5 faculty. On May 26, 1915, the first commencement of the first graduating class occurred, a class of 15 women.

The school was put under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Education, renamed Humboldt State Teacher&#x27;s College and Junior College, and moved to its current location in 1921. In 1924, during the presidency of Ralph Waldo Swetman, the Associated Students and the Alumni Association were organized and &quot;The Foghorn&quot;, the first student newspaper, was published. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees began being offered in 1927. The school was renamed Humboldt State College in 1935 and the next year the Lumberjack was adopted as its mascot. In 1937, the students opened a cooperative bookstore and soda fountain, which would exist for the next 40 years as the center of student life.

During World War II, Arcata&#x27;s city defense council suggested camouflaging Founder&#x27;s Hall, which is visible from the Pacific Ocean, so it would not be a target for Japanese submarines. The council made its request in 1942, but Founder&#x27;s Hall was not painted until the spring of 1944. The building remained camouflage green until 1948. During WWII, President Arthur Gist corresponded back and forth with the hundreds of students who left Humboldt State College to serve in the war. Available for viewing in the Arthur Gist Letters at HSU Special Collections, there are over 1,000 letters from 365 servicemen and women writing to Gist for the duration of the war.

Graduate programs were first offered in 1947. Under President Cornelius H. Siemens in 1952, HSU continued expanding by accepting students from abroad, including some from Yugoslavia, Germany, the Near East as well as US territories such as American Samoa, Guam and Hawaii. KHSC, later KHSU, the first state college radio station in California, was established. In 1960, the college joined the newly formed California State College system. The junior college program, terminated at HSU in 1962, was re-established in 1964 at College of the Redwoods (CR) located at the southern edge of Eureka. CR is located only seventeen miles south of HSU, and the two institutions maintain a close working relationship, with many students transferring to HSU following graduation from CR.

Student activism on campus rose through the 1960s and early 1970s, peaking in a protest against the Vietnam War with about 800 students (out of 3,600) participating in demonstrations on October 15, 1969. This was followed by another protest with nearly 3,000 students who planned a strike after the Cambodian Incursion. With similar events across the state, Governor Ronald Reagan shut down the CSC system in May 1970 for five days. The 1970s also saw the rise of feminist, cultural, and LGBT groups, and though the Women&#x27;s Center was the only one to survive through the 1980s, most groups reappeared by the mid-1990s.

Alumnus David Philips established the Humboldt Film Festival in 1967. It is now one of the oldest student-run festivals in the world. In 1996 the annual Explorations in Afro-Cuban Dance and Drum workshop began being held on the campus every July. The workshop is the largest assemblage of Afro-Cuban folkloric masters in the United States, drawing students from across the country and around the world.

In 1972, the college was renamed California State University, Humboldt. However, it still continued to be popularly called &quot;Humboldt State.&quot; Reflecting this, its name was simplified to Humboldt State University in 1974. Enrollment first reached 7,500 in 1974, and the university remains one of the smallest in the CSU system. Through the 1980s, mature students became a large part of Humboldt State&#x27;s student body, and in 1986 40% of the students were over the age of 25. The number has since decreased to 30%.

In 1987 students and activists founded the optional Graduation Pledge of Social and Environmental Responsibility. The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be mindful of the social and environmental impacts of their employment as they enter the workforce or continue their education. Today over one hundred Universities and colleges worldwide use the Pledge to some extent.

On April 22, 2024, dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters occupied Siemens Hall as part of a wider movement of occupation protests against the Israel–Hamas war. Protesters renamed the building to &quot;Intifada Hall&quot; and managed to repel an initial police incursion. At some point protesters occupied a second building, Nelson Hall. On April 30, a large law enforcement task force stormed both occupied buildings and arrested at least 35 people, bringing the occupation to an end.

=== Name ===
The university, founded as Humboldt State Normal College in 1913, took the name of the county and nearby bay, which was originally named after the famous German scientist Alexander von Humboldt.

On May 23, 1972, fourteen of the nineteen CSU campuses were renamed to &quot;California State University,&quot; followed by a comma and then their geographic designation. The five campuses exempted from renaming were the five newest state colleges created during the 1960s. The new names were very unpopular at certain campuses. Over the objections of CSU Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke, state Assemblyman Alfred E. Alquist proposed a bill that would rename the San Jose campus back to San Jose State. A few years later, some other CSU campuses, alongside the Humboldt campus, also secured passage of similar legislation, and California State University, Humboldt was renamed Humboldt State University from 1974 until 2022.

On January 26, 2022, the university was officially renamed from Humboldt State University to California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, becoming the third polytechnic university in the state. The change is backed by a $458 million investment from the state of California.

== Academics ==
The university is divided into three colleges: the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; the College of Natural Resources and Sciences; and the College of Professional Studies. There are 48 undergraduate majors and 69 minors. The two largest majors are biology and art, both with over 20 faculty members and extensive facilities on- and off-campus. This CSU campus offers a wildlife undergraduate degree. There are several credential programs and fourteen master&#x27;s programs, of which natural resources and social work are the largest. The new Energy, Environment, and Society graduate program is unique to the CSU, and provides graduates with interdisciplinary training in engineering, economics, and climate policy.

The University Library supports students and faculty from all three academic colleges. Humboldt State University Press (now called the Press at Cal Poly Humboldt) was launched in 1991 to showcase research and scholarship across the campus. The Forestry department building&#x27;s walls are completely paneled with different species of wood. The building was rebuilt in October 1980 after the original building was burned down. The original building stood for 17 years before an arsonist, whose identity is still unknown today, set the building on fire in 1979.

Cal Poly Humboldt is one of only two universities in California to offer a major in botany; the other is California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Its botany program is the nation&#x27;s largest undergraduate program. Cal Poly Humboldt is the only university in California to offer a degree in rangeland resources and wildland soil science. The Native American Studies major and the Oceanography major are also unique to the California State University system. The university offers unique minors including multicultural queer studies, scientific diving, and appropriate technology.

The university&#x27;s location on the North Coast provides access to the Pacific Ocean, lagoons, marshes, estuaries, and the Fred Telonicher Marine Laboratory, which provides opportunities for &quot;hands-on&quot; experiences and research for the sciences. The Marine Lab was opened in 1966, the lab is open during the academic school year (mid August-mid May).

Cal Poly Humboldt&#x27;s fire science program teaches modern techniques for managing wildfire, and an advanced training program is offered for Forest Service employees and similar professionals.

The International English Language Institute has worked alongside HSU for 22 years to help international students gain academic English language skills to further their academic pursuits and business careers.

The college of eLearning &amp; Extended Ed (CEEE) is a self-supporting outreach department of Cal Poly Humboldt that provides a variety of academic, professional development and personal enrichment opportunities. While the CEEE programs are open to almost everyone, there is an emphasis on providing access to those community members who are not matriculated students at the university. Non-matriculated students may take some regular university courses through the CEEE Open University program. High school students may take regular university courses through the CEEE High School Concurrent Enrollment Program. Also, those aged 60 and over may take regular classes through the Over 60 Program. There are also a variety of online degree programs offered through the college. The CEEE also offers a wide range of diverse and eclectic programs. Examples include music and art programs for children, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute for those aged 50 and over, foreign language classes, travel-study programs, continuing education for teachers, MFT/LCSW, nurses, and law enforcement. In 1998 Humboldt State University opened the HSU First Street Gallery in Old Town Eureka, expanding community access to the university&#x27;s cultural and fine arts programs. In 2007, the university further expanded its presence in Eureka with the opening of the HSU Humboldt Bay Aquatic Center, a $4.5 million aquatic facility on the bay in Old Town Eureka. Future plans include a new HSU Bay and Estuarine Studies Center. This new facility will be closer to the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; (in 2012 docked at Woodley Island, Eureka), the only vessel in a U.S. educational institution solely dedicated to undergraduate research. The new facility would be considerably larger than the other existing facility, the Fred Telonicher Marine Laboratory in Trinidad, north.

Cal Poly Humboldt Professor Steve Sillett has conducted groundbreaking research on redwood forest canopies and was featured in a 2009 cover story in &quot;National Geographic&quot;. He holds the Kenneth L. Fisher Chair in Redwood Forest Ecology, the only endowed chair in the world dedicated to a single tree species.

== Student life ==

The Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF) is unique to the CSU, and uses student fee money to fund renewable energy and energy efficiency projects on campus. HEIF provides a rare opportunity for students, faculty, and plant operations staff to work together collaboratively towards a goal of a lower-carbon and energy-independent future. Compost and recycling bins are more common on campus than trash cans and many events are encouraged to be zero waste, all coordinated through the student-run Waste Reduction and Resource Awareness Program (WRRAP). The Associated Students fund WRRAP, the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology, and the Sustainable Living Arts and Music Festival (SLAM fest).

Cal Poly Humboldt built the first building in the CSU system to be LEED-gold certified for its eco-friendly features. The Behavioral and Social Sciences Building has facilities for rainwater collection and sustainably harvested wood native-plant landscaping, among others.

The university&#x27;s location affords students the potential for outside activities in local parks and public lands, which include miles of accessible, undeveloped coastline. Rivers, streams, mountains, coastal redwood forests, and extraordinary terrain surround the university.

There are over 200 clubs on campus; these include a variety of options that range from social interests, academic, Greek life and sports.

=== Student media ===
The university has multiple publications. &quot;The Lumberjack&quot; is the university&#x27;s only student-run weekly newspaper&quot;.&quot;

The university also has a monthly student-run newspaper, &quot;El Leñador&quot;, which is bilingual and produced by students with minority backgrounds. &quot;El Leñador&quot; received first place in competing against other monthly and bi-weekly papers from four- and two-year colleges and universities across California.

&quot;Osprey&quot; is the university&#x27;s student-run magazine, published twice annually. It has won first-place awards in major regional competitions, including the Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; &quot;Mark of Excellence&quot; Awards and the California Intercollegiate Press Association awards.

Cal Poly Humboldt is also the only university in the CSU system to have a university press. The Press at Cal Poly Humboldt publishes high-quality scholarly, intellectual, and creative works by or in support of the campus community.

=== On-campus housing ===
As of 2022, 2,069 beds were available on campus. As Cal Poly Humboldt enrolls nearly 6,000 students and as there is an acute housing shortage in Arcata, homelessness is prevalent among the student population. The university has sought to restrict and penalize students who are forced to live in cars, RVs or vans on campus. A 2018 study concluded that almost 20% of Cal Poly Humboldt students had experienced recent homelessness, double the rate of the CSU system as a whole.

University housing consists of six living areas: The Hill, Cypress, and Canyon for first-year students, and the College Creek Apartments, Campus Apartments, Creekview, and Cypress for other students. To address a housing shortage, Cal Poly Humboldt contracted with four local hotels—the Motel 6, Super 8, Ramada Inn, and Comfort Inn—to provide approximately 350 beds of &quot;bridge housing&quot; to students. By 2023, however, the university eliminated three of the four options, leaving only the Comfort Inn as the only motel option. A new off-campus housing complex, Craftsman Mall, will house a thousand residents and is projected to open in fall 2025; new on-campus housing for an additional 600 to 700 students is projected to open in summer 2027. Cal Poly Humboldt announced it was closing the Campus Apartments in late January 2025 on the recommendations of a consultant after mold tests conducted in a recently vacated room. The apartments are expected to be demolished after the new Hinarr Hu Moulik housing complex opens.

=== Klamath Connection Program ===
The Klamath River is the focus of the Klamath Connection, which is designed to help freshmen learn important skills for future science careers.

=== Y.E.S. House ===
The Y.E.S. House (Youth Educational Services) programs are created by students and led by student volunteer programs. The Y.E.S. House serves the community. There are currently 17 programs running. Students can volunteer for these programs, and may also become directors.

<doc id="197010" wikidata="Q298230" url="?curid=197010" title="Esophagitis">
<text>Esophagitis, also spelled oesophagitis, is a disease characterized by inflammation of the esophagus. The esophagus is a tube composed of a mucosal lining, and longitudinal and circular smooth muscle fibers. It connects the pharynx to the stomach; swallowed food and liquids normally pass through it.

Esophagitis can be asymptomatic; or can cause epigastric and/or substernal burning pain, especially when lying down or straining; and can make swallowing difficult (dysphagia). The most common cause of esophagitis is the reverse flow of acid from the stomach into the lower esophagus: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
== Signs and symptoms ==
The symptoms of esophagitis include:
* Heartburn – a burning sensation in the lower mid-chest
* Nausea
* Dysphagia – swallowing is painful, with difficulty passing or inability to pass food through the esophagus
* Vomiting (emesis)
* Abdominal pain
* Cough

===Complications===
If the disease remains untreated, it can cause scarring and discomfort in the esophagus. If the irritation is not allowed to heal, esophagitis can result in esophageal ulcers. Esophagitis can develop into Barrett&#x27;s esophagus and can increase the risk of esophageal cancer.

==Causes==
Infectious esophagitis cannot be spread. However, infections can be spread by those who have infectious esophagitis. Esophagitis can develop due to many causes. GERD is the most common cause of esophagitis because of the backflow of acid from the stomach, which can irritate the lining of the esophagus.

Other causes include:

* Medicines – Can cause esophageal damage that can lead to esophageal ulcers
** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) – aspirin, naproxen sodium, and ibuprofen. Known to irritate the GI tract.
** Antibiotics – doxycycline and tetracycline
** Quinidine
** Bisphosphonates – used to treat osteoporosis
** Steroids
** Potassium chloride
** Vitamins and supplements (iron, vitamin C, and potassium) – Supplements and minerals can be hard on the GI tract. 
* Chemical injury by alkaline or acidic solutions
* Physical injury resulting from nasogastric tubes.
* Alcohol use disorder – Can wear down the lining of the esophagus.
* Crohn&#x27;s disease – a type of IBD that can cause esophagitis if it attacks the esophagus.
* Stress – Can cause higher levels of acid reflux
* Radiation therapy – Can affect the immune system.
* Allergies (food, inhalants) – Allergies can stimulate eosinophilic esophagitis.
* Infection – People with immunodeficiencies have a higher chance of developing esophagitis.

* Vomiting – Acid can irritate esophagus. 
* Hernias – A hernia can poke through the diaphragm muscle and can inhibit stomach acid and food from draining quickly.
* Surgery
* Eosinophilic esophagitis, a more chronic condition with a theorized autoimmune component

== Mechanism ==
The esophagus is a muscular tube made of both voluntary and involuntary muscles. It is responsible for peristalsis of food. It is about 8 inches long and passes through the diaphragm before entering the stomach. The esophagus is made up of three layers: from the inside out, they are the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa. The mucosa, the inner most layer and lining of the esophagus, is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae. At the end of the esophagus is the lower esophageal sphincter, which normally prevents stomach acid from entering the esophagus.

If the sphincter is not sufficiently tight, it may allow acid to enter the esophagus, causing inflammation of one or more layers. Esophagitis may also occur if an infection is present, which may be due to bacteria, viruses, or fungi; or by diseases that affect the immune system.

Irritation can be caused by GERD, vomiting, surgery, medications, hernias, and radiation injury. Inflammation can cause the esophagus to narrow, which makes swallowing food difficult and may result in food bolus impaction.

== Diagnosis ==
Esophagitis can be diagnosed by upper endoscopy, biopsy, upper GI series (or barium swallow), and laboratory tests.

An upper endoscopy is a procedure to look at the esophagus by using an endoscope. While looking at the esophagus, the doctor is able to take a small biopsy. The biopsy can be used to confirm inflammation of the esophagus.

An upper GI series uses a barium contrast, fluoroscopy, and an X-ray. During a barium X-ray, a solution with barium or pill is taken before getting an X-ray. The barium makes the organs more visible and can detect if there is any narrowing, inflammation, or other abnormalities that can be causing the disease. The upper GI series can be used to find the cause of GI symptoms. An esophagram is if only the throat and esophagus are looked at.

Laboratory tests can be done on biopsies removed from the esophagus and can help determine the cause of the esophagitis. Laboratory tests can help diagnose a fungal, viral, or bacterial infection. Scanning for white blood cells can help diagnose eosinophil esophagitis.

Some lifestyle indicators for this disease include stress, unhealthy eating, smoking, drinking, family history, allergies, and immunodeficiency.

===Types===
Reflux esophagitis

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is usually assumed to be caused by inflammation from gastric acid reflux which irritates the mucosa. One study suggests that the pathogenesis of may be cytokine-mediated.

Infectious esophagitis

Esophagitis happens due to a viral, fungal, parasitic or bacterial infection. More likely to happen to people who have an immunodeficiency. Types include:

Fungal
* Candida (Esophageal candidiasis)

Viral
* Herpes simplex (Herpes esophagitis)
* Cytomegalovirus
Drug-induced esophagitis

Damage to the esophagus due to medications. If the esophagus is not coated or if the medicine is not taken with enough liquid, it can damage the tissues.

Eosinophilic esophagitis

Eosinophilic esophagitis is caused by a high concentration of eosinophils in the esophagus. The presence of eosinophils in the esophagus may be due to an allergen and is often correlated with GERD. The direction of cause and effect between inflammation and acid reflux is poorly established, with recent studies (in 2016) hinting that reflux does not cause inflammation. This esophagitis can be triggered by allergies to food or to inhaled allergens. This type is still poorly understood.

Lymphocytic esophagitis

Lymphocytic esophagitis is a rare and poorly understood entity associated with an increased amount of lymphocytes in the lining of the esophagus. It was first described in 2006. Disease associations may include Crohn&#x27;s disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease and coeliac disease. It causes similar changes on endoscopy as eosinophilic esophagitis including esophageal rings, narrow-lumen esophagus, and linear furrows.

Caustic esophagitis

Caustic esophagitis is the damage of tissue via chemical origin. This occasionally occurs through occupational exposure (via breathing of fumes that mix into the saliva which is then swallowed) or through pica.

===By severity===
The severity of reflux esophagitis is commonly classified into four grades according to the &quot;Los Angeles Classification&quot;:

==Prevention==
Since there can be many causes underlying esophagitis, it is important to try to find the cause to help to prevent esophagitis. To prevent reflux esophagitis, avoid acidic foods, caffeine, eating before going to bed, alcohol, fatty meals, and smoking. To prevent drug-induced esophagitis, drink plenty of liquids when taking medicines, take an alternative drug, and do not take medicines while lying down, before sleeping, or too many at one time. Esophagitis is more prevalent in adults and does not discriminate.

==Treatment==
===Lifestyle changes===
Losing weight, stop smoking and alcohol, lowering stress, avoid sleeping/lying down after eating, raising the head of the bed, taking medicines correctly, avoiding certain medications, and avoiding foods that cause the reflux that might be causing the esophagitis.

===Medications===
====Antacids====
To treat reflux esophagitis, over the counter antacids, medications that reduce acid production (H-2 receptor blockers), and proton pump inhibitors are recommended to help block acid production and to let the esophagus heal. Some prescription medications to treat reflux esophagitis include higher dose H-2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics, which help with the emptying of the stomach. However prokinetics are no longer licensed for GERD because their evidence of efficacy is poor, and following a safety review, licensed use of domperidone and metoclopramide is now restricted to short-term use in nausea and vomiting only.

====For subtypes====
To treat eosinophilic esophagitis, avoiding any allergens that may be stimulating the eosinophils is recommended. As for medications, proton pump inhibitors and steroids can be prescribed. Steroids that are used to treat asthma can be swallowed to treat eosinophil esophagitis due to nonfood allergens. The removal of food allergens from the diet is included to help treat eosinophilic esophagitis.

For infectious esophagitis, medicine is prescribed based on what type of infection is causing the esophagitis. These medicines are prescribed to treat bacterial, fungal, viral, and/or parasitic infections.

===Procedures===
* An endoscopy can be used to remove ill fragments.
* Surgery can be done to remove the damaged part of the esophagus.
* For reflux esophagitis, a fundooplication can be done to help strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter from allowing backflow of the stomach into the esophagus.
* For esophageal stricture, a gastroenterologist can perform a dilation of the esophagus.

As of 2020 evidence for magnetic sphincter augmentation is poor.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for a person with esophagitis depends on the underlying causes and conditions. If a patient has a more serious underlying cause such as a digestive system or immune system issue, it may be more difficult to treat. Normally, the prognosis would be good with no serious illnesses. If there are more causes than one, the prognosis could move to fair.

==Terminology==
The term is from Greek οἰσοφάγος &quot;gullet&quot; and -itis &quot;inflammation&quot;.

<doc id="197015" wikidata="Q1260006" url="?curid=197015" title="Drug cartel">
<text>A drug cartel is a criminal organization composed of independent drug lords who collude with each other in order to improve their profits and dominate the illegal drug trade. Drug cartels form with the purpose of controlling the supply of the illegal drug trade and maintaining prices at a high level. The formations of drug cartels are common in Latin American countries. Rivalries between multiple drug cartels cause them to wage turf wars against each other.

The basic structure of a drug cartel is as follows:
* Falcons: Considered as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the streets, the &quot;falcons&quot; are the lowest rank in any drug cartel. They are scouts, who are responsible for conducting reconnaissance, such as reporting the activities of the police, the military and rival groups.
* Hitmen: The armed group within the drug cartel, responsible for carrying out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts and extortions, operating protection rackets, as well as from rival groups and the military.
* Lieutenants: The second highest position in the drug cartel organization, responsible for supervising the hitmen and falcons within their own territory. They are allowed to carry out low-profile murders without permission from their bosses.
* Drug lords: The highest position in any drug cartel, responsible for supervising the entire drug industry, appointing territorial leaders, making alliances, in addition to planning high-profile murders.

There are other operating groups within the drug cartels. For example, the drug producers and suppliers, although not considered in the basic structure, are critical operators of any drug cartel, along with the smugglers, distributors, sales representatives, accountants and money launderers. Furthermore, the arms suppliers operate in a completely different circle; they are technically not considered part of the cartel&#x27;s logistics.

The U.S. State Department has designated Mexican drug cartels as well as MS-13 and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.

====Mexico====

Mexican cartels (also known in Mexico as: &quot;la Mafia&quot; (the mafia or the mob), &quot;La Maña&quot; (the skill / the bad manners), &quot;narcotraficantes&quot; (narco-traffickers), or simply as &quot;narcos&quot; usually refers to several, rival, criminal organizations that are combated by the Mexican government in the Mexican War on Drugs (List sorted by branches and heritage):

Mexican academic Oswaldo Zavala, in his book &quot;Drug Cartels Do Not Exist&quot;, argues that academics, officials, journalists and writers are mistaken to label the criminal gangs as cartels, noting that they do not meet the definition due to the competitive nature of the drugs trade, and the lack of hierarchal structure. He states that the Mexican state perpetuates the label to justify their militarised response.

According to some observers in 2010, Los Zetas instituted social media demonstrations of torture and sadism in their reprisals which changed the rules of the game among the Mexican cartels. The level of violence and social instability greatly increased during the presidency of Felipe Calderon. The Calderon and Foxe administrations worked closer with American law enforcement and utilized the military forces which led to some confusion among local law enforcement in public security and a variety of human rights abuses and corruption.
The former head of Mexican law enforcement, Genaro García Luna, was sentenced in the Eastern District of New York on October 16, 2024 for his role in Sinaloa Cartel associated drug trafficking in the United States.

Note: As of 2020 the DEA considered the cartels of Sinaloa-Beltran, Juarez-Linea, Jalisco, Golfo-Noreste-Zetas, La Familia and Rojos-Guerreros to be the most influential cartels in Mexico.

=====American Mafia=====
Italian immigrants to the United States in the early 19th century formed various small-time gangs which gradually evolved into sophisticated crime syndicates which dominated organized crime in America for several decades. Although government crackdowns and a less-tightly knit Italian-American community have largely reduced their power, they remain an active force in the underworld.

====Venezuela====
Historically Venezuela has been a path to the United States for illegal drugs originating in Colombia, through Central America and Mexico and Caribbean countries such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.

According to the United Nations, there has been an increase of cocaine trafficking through Venezuela since 2002. In 2005, Venezuela severed ties with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), accusing its representatives of spying. Following the departure of the DEA from Venezuela and the expansion of DEA&#x27;s partnership with Colombia in 2005, Venezuela became more attractive to drug traffickers. Between 2008 and 2012, Venezuela&#x27;s cocaine seizure ranking among other countries declined, going from being ranked fourth in the world for cocaine seizures in 2008 to sixth in the world in 2012.
The cartel groups involved include:

* The Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan moved to Venezuela, which became an important hideout as the clan bought hotels and founded various businesses in Caracas and Valencia, as well as an extended ranch in Barinas, near the Colombian border. &quot;Venezuela has its own Cosa Nostra family as if it is Sicilian territory,&quot; according to the Italian police. &quot;The structure and hierarchy of the Mafia has been entirely reproduced in Venezuela.&quot; The Cuntrera-Caruana clan had direct links with the ruling Commission of the Sicilian Mafia, and are acknowledged by the American Cosa Nostra.

Pasquale, Paolo and Gaspare Cuntrera were expelled from Venezuela in 1992, &quot;almost secretly smuggled out of the country, as if it concerned one of their own drug transports. It was
imperative they could not contact people on the outside who could have used their political connections to stop the expulsion.&quot; Their expulsion was ordered by a commission of the Venezuelan Senate headed by Senator Cristobal Fernandez Dalo and his money laundering investigator, Thor Halvorssen Hellum. They were arrested in September 1992 at Fiumicino airport (Rome), and in 1996 were sentenced to 13–20 years.

* Norte del Valle Cartel : In 2008 the leader of the Colombian Norte del Valle Cartel, Wilber Varela, was found murdered in a hotel in Mérida in Venezuela.
* The Cartel of the Suns According to Jackson Diehl. Deputy Editorial Page Editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the Bolivarian government of Venezuela shelters &quot;one of the world&#x27;s biggest drug cartels&quot;. There have also been allegations that former president Hugo Chávez and Diosdado Cabello being involved with drug trafficking.

In May 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported from United States officials that drug trafficking in Venezuela increased significantly with Colombian drug traffickers moving from Colombia to Venezuela due to pressure from law enforcement. One United States Department of Justice official described the higher ranks of the Venezuelan government and military as &quot;a criminal organization&quot;, with high ranking Venezuelan officials, such as National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, being accused of drug trafficking. Those involved with investigations stated that Venezuelan government defectors and former traffickers had given information to investigators and that details of those involved in government drug trafficking were increasing.

=====Japanese criminal organizations=====
The yakuza of Japan are similar to the Italian mafias in that they originated centuries ago and follow a rigid set of traditions, but have several aspects that make them unique, such as their full-body tattoos and their fairly open place in Japanese society. Many yakuza groups are umbrella organizations, smaller gangs reporting to a larger crime syndicate.

===Russia===
Although organized crime existed in the Soviet era, the gangs really gained in power and international reach during the transition to capitalism. The term Russian Mafia, &#x27;mafiya&#x27; or mob is a blanket (and somewhat inaccurate) term for the various organized crime groups that emerged in this period from the 15 former republics of the USSR and unlike their Italian counterparts does not mean members are necessarily of Russian ethnicity or uphold any ancient criminal traditions, although this is the case for some members.

<doc id="197019" wikidata="Q271787" url="?curid=197019" title="Paranoid (album)">
<text>Paranoid is the second studio album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released on 18 September 1970, by Vertigo Records in the United Kingdom and on 7 January 1971, by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album contains several of the band&#x27;s signature songs, including &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot; and the title track, which was the band&#x27;s only Top 20 hit, reaching number 4 on the UK charts.

&quot;Paranoid&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time, often cited as a key influence for the development of the genre as well as one of its earliest albums. &quot;Paranoid&quot; was ranked number one on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;‘s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; in 2017 and number 139 on its list of the “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” in 2020. &quot;Paranoid&quot; was the band&#x27;s only album to top the UK Albums Chart until the release of &quot;13&quot; in 2013.

==Recording==
In an effort to capitalise on the recent UK chart success of their eponymous debut album, Black Sabbath returned to the studio with producer Rodger Bain in June 1970, just four months after the album was released. &quot;Paranoid&quot; was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England.

The album&#x27;s title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have enough songs for the album, and Tony [Iommi] just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.&quot; In the liner notes to the 1998 live album &quot;Reunion&quot;, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song &quot;in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.&quot; According to Alexander, &quot;Paranoid&quot; &quot;crystallized the band&#x27;s writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy [Osbourne] working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler&#x27;s bass rumble.&quot; The single was released in August 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath&#x27;s only top ten hit.

Most of the songs on &quot;Paranoid&quot; evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary on the making of &quot;Paranoid&quot;, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that &quot;War Pigs&quot; came from &quot;one of the clubs&quot; with Butler adding, &quot;During the song &quot;Warning&quot; we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went &quot;da-dum!&quot;&quot; In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that &quot;I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.&quot; On &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2010, &quot;Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it – whatever that is. It looks like a fridge with a knob on.&quot;

==Composition==

The album&#x27;s opening track &quot;War Pigs&quot; was originally intended to be called &quot;Walpurgis&quot;. It was then changed to &quot;War Pigs&quot;, which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to &quot;Paranoid&quot; after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single. Butler explained his intentions to &quot;Classic Albums&quot;: &quot;I wanted to write a song called &#x27;Walpurgis&#x27; – you know, the Satanic version of Christmas – write it about that Satan isn&#x27;t a spiritual thing, it&#x27;s warmongers. That&#x27;s who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, &#x27;No, we&#x27;re not going to call it that. Too Satanic!&#x27; So I changed it to &#x27;War Pigs&#x27;.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, &quot;It was originally going to be called &#x27;Walpurgis&#x27;... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to &#x27;War Pigs&#x27;, and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn&#x27;t interested in your average &#x27;I love you&#x27; pop song... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.&quot;

The song &quot;Iron Man&quot; was originally entitled &quot;Iron Bloke&quot;. Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded &quot;like a big iron bloke walking around&quot;. The title was later changed to &quot;Iron Man&quot; as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. The riff to &quot;Iron Man&quot; is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that &quot;...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we&#x27;d challenge him to beat his last riff – and he&#x27;d come up with something like &#x27;Iron Man&#x27; and blow everyone away.&quot; Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In &quot;The Last Supper&quot; concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands &quot;it was all the &#x27;flowers in your hair&#x27; and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.&quot;

In the 1992 documentary &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; Osbourne said: &quot;It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about &#x27;If you&#x27;re going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair&#x27;. And we&#x27;re thinking, (contemptuously) &#x27;What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? &quot;What&#x27;s all this flower shit?&quot; I&#x27;ve got no shoes on my feet. &quot;You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,&quot; Butler recalled to &quot;Classic Albums&quot; in 2010, &quot;and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin&#x27; about the things that I wanted to talk about – political stuff – so that&#x27;s what inspired me.&quot;

In 2013, Butler told &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine that the song &quot;Paranoid&quot; was &quot;about depression, because I didn&#x27;t really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It&#x27;s a drug thing; when you&#x27;re smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can&#x27;t relate to people. There&#x27;s that crossover between the paranoia you get when you&#x27;re smoking dope and the depression afterwards.&quot; In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of &quot;Classic Rock&quot;: &quot;I used to be a cutter. I&#x27;d cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. I used to get really depressed and it was the only thing that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn&#x27;t made it, I&#x27;d have been long dead. I&#x27;d have killed myself.&quot; According to Mick Wall&#x27;s book &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot;, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, with the bassist admitting, &quot;I thought it was so much like that we couldn&#x27;t possibly get away with it... They were our favourite band by that time&quot;.

&quot;Planet Caravan&quot; was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling &quot;Classic Albums&quot;, &quot;It was almost one of those &#x27;Should we do this? with Butler adding, &quot;We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn&#x27;t want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of &#x27;Let&#x27;s go down to the pub and have some chips&#x27;, or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend.&quot; Django Reinhardt&#x27;s jazz influence is apparent on Iommi&#x27;s guitar playing. &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was &quot;nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in my head and when we got to &quot;Hand of Doom&quot;, that&#x27;s what I wrote it about&quot;.

According to Butler, Ward&#x27;s drum solo &quot;Rat Salad&quot; resulted from the band having to play 8 and 3/4-hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. &quot;Bill used to fill out a whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to get rid of that 45 minutes,&quot; he revealed to &quot;Classic Albums&quot;. &quot;I have no idea where the title came from, though.&quot; While Butler may have now forgotten where the title of &quot;Rat Salad&quot; came from, in 1971 he was on record stating it came from a joke about Ward&#x27;s hair having not been combed. In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;, as a &quot;hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody&quot; with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads.

==Packaging==
&quot;Paranoid&quot; was originally titled &quot;War Pigs&quot;, but the record company allegedly changed it out of fear of a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. Additionally, the band&#x27;s label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot; that the name change had nothing to do with the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told &quot;Classic Albums&quot; that the rest of Warner Bros. didn&#x27;t want anything to do with them: &quot;We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not that important to me. I knew we weren&#x27;t going to call it &#x27;War Pigs&#x27;.&quot; Regarding the song &quot;Paranoid&quot;, Smith recalls, &quot;It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building... I said &#x27;I think that&#x27;s the breakthrough album. I don&#x27;t understand it but that &#x27;Paranoid&#x27; sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single. &quot;That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve,&quot; Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998. &quot;What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don&#x27;t know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork.&quot;

The cover, with the original &quot;War Pigs&quot; title in mind, was designed and shot by Keith McMillan (credited as Keef) in Black Park. His assistant, Roger Brown, was the model. The original UK vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve featuring a black-and-white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill. Also shot by Keith McMillan, it was the band&#x27;s first appearance on album artwork.

==Release, reception and legacy==

The album was issued in the United Kingdom in September 1970, where its sales were enhanced by the success of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; single. &quot;That single attracted screaming kids&quot;, Iommi recalled in the liner notes to &quot;Reunion&quot; in 1998. &quot;We saw people dancing when we played it and we decided that we shouldn&#x27;t do singles for a long while after that to stay true to the fans who&#x27;d liked us before we&#x27;d become popular.&quot; &quot;Paranoid&quot; US release was delayed until January 1971, as the &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; album was still on the charts at the time of its UK release. &quot;Paranoid&quot; reached No.12 in the US in March 1971 with virtually no radio airplay. From contemporary reviews, an uncredited writer in &quot;Disc&quot; praised the album, declaring the group&#x27;s music as &quot;tight, loud, simple and exciting&quot; with material based on &quot;simple, catchy riffs [...] with lyrics that don&#x27;t put them in the Dylan class.&quot;

Many publications now cite Paranoid is as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said the album &quot;defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history&quot;. Jenna Scaramanga of &quot;Guitar World&quot; called the album &quot;the definitive choice for guitarists who recognize that rhythm parts are more important than solos.&quot; Ben Mitchell from &quot;Blender&quot; also expressed his belief that it was the greatest metal release of all time. 

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Joe Levy, &quot;Sabbath ruled for bummed-out kids in the Seventies&quot; and &quot;nearly every heavy-metal and extreme rock band of the last three decades&quot;, including Metallica, Nirvana and Slipknot, &quot;owes a debt of worship&quot; to Iommi&#x27;s &quot;crushing&quot; guitar riffs, Ward and Butler&#x27;s &quot;Visigoth rhythm section&quot; and Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;agonized bray&quot; on tracks such as &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;War Pigs&quot;. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), feeling he could not take the band&#x27;s horror-themed music seriously enough to appreciate it as anything other than &quot;camp&quot;, noting that the title cut is especially &quot;screamworthy&quot;. However, he did note that the band does take musical heaviness to &quot;undreamt-of extremes&quot;.

Geezer Butler cited &quot;Paranoid&quot; as the one that stood out to him the most. He explained, &quot;It was a totally complete album. It wasn&#x27;t forced, and the chemistry between the four of us was so fluid. I remember getting together to do that record, and we wrote literally everything immediately. Each song came together so easily and had such fire. And each time we would go into rehearsal, we&#x27;d come out with a completed song. I think that&#x27;s why that album is special, because of how naturally things came together. It was the most organic record that Sabbath – in any era – ever made. It was completely natural, as it should have been.&quot;

The album is currently ranked at No.139 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Paranoid&quot; chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Although it failed to reach the top 40, &quot;Iron Man&quot; remains one of Black Sabbath&#x27;s most popular songs, as well as the band&#x27;s highest charting US single. As of 2014, &quot;Paranoid&quot; is Black Sabbath&#x27;s best-selling album, having sold 1.6 million copies in the US since the beginning of the SoundScan era.
==Controversy==
In 1974, nurse Hillary Pollard from Rawcliffe, North Yorkshire was found dead between a pair of speakers with the &quot;Paranoid&quot; album on her turntable. She had overdosed on sleeping tablets, with a small enough dosage to make suicide inconclusive. However, the album&#x27;s possible influence in her potential suicide was still mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately it was decided that Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. &quot;A lot of the words in the songs – a lot of the moods of the songs – are aggressive,&quot; Iommi acknowledged. &quot;Especially in the early days – Satanic, if you like... That was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With &quot;Paranoid&quot; in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead – a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that it was because of the album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think.&quot;

In a 1982 interview with &quot;The New Music&quot;, Butler claimed, &quot;If the moral majority don&#x27;t understand it they&#x27;ll try to put it down, or get other people to read all sorts of things into it... The moral majority sort of people picked up on the Satanic part of it. I mean, most of it was about stopping wars and that side of it, and some science fiction stuff. There wasn&#x27;t that much Satanic stuff, and what there was it wasn&#x27;t exactly &quot;for the devil&quot; or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we just brought it to people&#x27;s attention.&quot; In the documentary &quot;The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1&quot;, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band&#x27;s lyrics, stating that, &quot;For instance, on &#x27;Hand of Doom&#x27; they&#x27;ll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we&#x27;re telling everyone to go and shoot smack, where the whole song […] is &quot;against&quot; drugs.&quot;
