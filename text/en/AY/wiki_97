<text>G4S Secure Solutions (USA) is an American/British-based security services company, and a subsidiary of G4S plc. It was founded as The Wackenhut Corporation in 1954, in Coral Gables, Florida, by George Wackenhut and three partners (all former FBI agents). In 2002, the company was acquired for $570 million by Danish corporation Group 4 Falck (itself then merged to form British company G4S in 2004). In 2010, G4S Wackenhut changed its name to G4S Secure Solutions (USA) to reflect the new business model. The G4S Americas Region headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida.

==Background==
In 1966, George Wackenhut took his company public.

In the mid-1960s, Florida Governor Claude Kirk commissioned the Wackenhut Corporation to help fight a &quot;war on organized crime&quot;, awarding the company a $500,000 contract. The commission lasted about a year but led to more than 80 criminal indictments, including many for local politicians and government employees. Following the murder of a British tourist at a rest stop in 1993, Florida contracted with Wackenhut to provide security at all state rest stops.

== Relationship with the US government ==
Wackenhut was founded in 1954 by former FBI agent George Wackenhut and three partners as &quot;Special Agent Investigators Inc.&quot;. Early board members included individuals with ties to the anti-communist John Birch Society. Wackenhut had good contacts in politics, including Florida Governor Claude Kirk and Senator George Smathers, a friend of John F. Kennedy. Soon after its founding, Wackenhut received lucrative contracts to guard Cape Canaveral and nuclear weapons testing sites in Nevada.

Wackenhut has a long history of working with the U.S. government and military. The company recruited extensively from the military and intelligence communities. Many former CIA, FBI and other government officials have served on the company&#x27;s upper levels over the years. For example, former FBI Director Clarence Kelley and Deputy CIA Director and Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci served on Wackenhut&#x27;s board of directors. William Casey, President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s CIA director, was Wackenhut&#x27;s attorney before joining the Reagan administration.

=== Alleged CIA ties ===
Wackenhut was alleged to be a CIA front company during the cold war. CIA analyst William Corbett stated: “For years, Wackenhut has been working with the CIA and other agencies, including the DEA. Wackenhut has allowed the CIA to occupy positions within the company to carry out covert operations.” Wackenhut provided the CIA and DEA with information and was rewarded with government contracts in return. As a partner of the US government, Wackenhut received contracts in sensitive areas of national security, such as embassies and nuclear power plants. Under the Reagan administration, there was a significant increase in contracts.

== Mass surveillance of US citizens in the cold war era ==
During the McCarthy era, the right-wing George Wackenhut began compiling files with information on politically suspect individuals, accusing them of communist activities. In 1965, Wackenhut told potential investors that the company had files on 2.5 million suspicious individuals, one in every 46 American adults. By 1966, Wackenhut had collected over 4 million names.

== Activities in Latin America ==
In Nicaragua, Wackenhut was said to have worked with the Contras and to have maintained contacts with right-wing death squads in Latin America during the Cold War. The then-director of international operations, Ernesto Bermudez, admitted that he had 1,500 men in El Salvador who “do things you don&#x27;t want your mother to know about.” 

== Activities in Belgium ==
In Belgium, Wackenhut is said to have worked with right-wing extremists in the 1980s, who in turn had contacts with security services. Wackenhut left Belgium in the early 1980s after allegations that security guards lured immigrant children into basements and beat them.

== Support for Saddam Hussein ==
The company was accused of participating in arming Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq with chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq War.

==Security services==
G4S provides security to specific government and corporate sectors: energy, utilities, and chemical/petrochemical, financial institutions, hospitals and healthcare facilities, major corporations and the construction industry, ports and airports, residential communities, retail and commercial real estate and transit systems.

Clients included GlaxoSmithKline and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

==Nuclear services at Peach Bottom (2008)==
The Wackenhut Corporation provided armed security services for many nuclear power plants. In September 2007, its employees Kerry Beal and Paul A. Kennedy videotaped their fellow security guards at the Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station sleeping while on duty. Beal had previously tried to notify supervisors at Wackenhut and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the breaches of security. Wackenhut&#x27;s contract was terminated, ending its role guarding Peach Bottom and nine other nuclear plants.

==Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC)==
In 2003, the management of WCC, the wholly owned subsidiary of Wackenhut&#x27;s prison business, raised funds to repurchase all common stock held by G4S since 2002, changing its name to The GEO Group, Inc. The GEO Group, Inc. now operates former Wackenhut facilities in 14 states, as well as in South Africa and Australia. Some facilities, such as the Wackenhut Corrections Centers in New York, retain the Wackenhut name despite no longer having any actual connection with the company.

==Wackenhut and Miami-Dade==
A dispute between the Wackenhut corporation and Miami-Dade Transit arose from allegations made by a former employee. Michelle Trimble claimed that G4S Wackenhut over-billed Miami-Dade County for work that had not been performed. As a result of the allegations of that lawsuit, the County ordered an audit of the contract in 2005. That audit was completed in 2009 and came up with an amount of estimated overbillings. In response, G4S Wackenhut filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging, among other things, that the audit&#x27;s findings were erroneous.

In February 2010, the issue was resolved, and Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a $7.5 million settlement agreement with Wackenhut to resolve the dispute. The settlement deal had $3 million going to the county, $1.25 million for whistle-blower Trimble, whose lawsuit led the county to launch its own audit, and $3.25 million going to Trimble&#x27;s attorneys. As part of the deal, Wackenhut was allowed to bid on future contracts and the county agreed not to use this case against it when considering Wackenhut&#x27;s bids.

== &quot;Chandler v. Wackenhut Corporations&quot; ==
In 1979 employees of Wackenhut Corporations gang-raped and murdered Janet Chandler. Her body was found in a snowbank near the time of her death but her accusers were not found until three decades later when a student documentary on Janet Chandler prompted the police to re-open the case. Eventually, the police showed this to Robert Lynch who confessed to being a participant and named his co-conspirators.

Wackenhut Corporations obtained a security contract in Holland, Michigan in the fall of 1978, and approximately seventy of defendant&#x27;s out-of-town security guards took up temporary residence at the Blue Mill Inn where plaintiff&#x27;s daughter, Janet Chandler, worked as the overnight front desk clerk. Plaintiff alleges that some of the guards and motel staff had sexual relationships with each other, relationships that &quot;bred jealousy and anger, much of it directed at Janet Chandler,&quot; for reasons not clear from the pleadings. Plaintiff alleges that several of the guards and motel employees conspired to &quot;teach Janet Chandler a lesson&quot; by beating, sexually assaulting, and killing her). They acted on their plans sometime after midnight on January 31, 1979. The conspirators did not discuss the crimes over the years.

Following the February 7, 2006 arrest of Wackenhut employee Robert Lynch, six people were charged with first-degree murder arising from Janet Chandler&#x27;s death, five of whom were Wackenhut employees in 1979. Two persons pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to terms of years in prison. The other four persons were convicted by a jury of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.&quot;

In 2010 the parents of Janet Chandler contended that Wackenhut did not thoroughly check the employees&#x27; backgrounds and then failed to properly supervise them, ignoring problems that arose with the workers.

The suit also alleged that the company helped conceal the involvement of their employees, who swore to a vow of secrecy, according to testimony in a 2007 trial.

==Anti-nuclear protests==
Fingers were pointed at Wackenhut when it was revealed that anti-nuclear protesters, including an 82-year-old nun, had managed to cut through fences of one of the United States’ most protected nuclear facilities at Oak Ridge in Tennessee in July 2012. Three activists broke into the US Government&#x27;s only weapons grade storage facility to paint graffiti and throw what they claimed was human blood on the walls. The breach and lack of security at the site at the time was blamed upon the absence of key Wackenhut personnel in the previous few weeks; the plant manager and chief operating officer had retired 12 days prior to the incident.

==Omar Mateen==
On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, who worked at G4S from 2007 until his death, committed one of the largest mass shootings in United States history. Though Mateen&#x27;s employment as an armed guard only slightly facilitated his access to firearms, and the firearms refresher courses he took each four years at G4S suggested more substantial training on his own, the company&#x27;s inability to detect prior warning signals brought it under widespread scrutiny.

=== Screening issues ===
Under Florida state law, for him to work as an armed guard the company was required either to make a full psychiatric evaluation of Mateen, or to administer a &quot;validated written psychological test&quot;. The test administered was the updated Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), a test used for job screenings and court cases requiring those subjected to it to agree or disagree with statements such as &quot;My soul sometimes leaves my body&quot; and &quot;Once in a while I think of things too bad to talk about.&quot; Carol Nudelman, the psychologist listed on the character certification submitted by G4S to the state said she stopped working for the company in 2005 and denies ever having met him. G4S said Mateen was not interviewed by a psychologist, but rather, a psychologist evaluated the results of a standard test used in job screenings, and his test was evaluated by the firm that bought Nudelman&#x27;s practice: Headquarters for Psychological Evaluation, owned by Dr Joanne Bauling. G4S said this was a &quot;clerical error.&quot; On September 10, 2016, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services fined G4S $151,400 for providing inaccurate psychological testing information after it found the psychologist whose opinion was necessary to permit Mateen to carry a weapon was not practicing as a screener. Between 2006 and 2016, 1,514 forms were submitted erroneously listing Nudelman&#x27;s name. Mateen&#x27;s form was among those investigated.

The company was unaware of Mateen&#x27;s sealed and expunged juvenile arrest record for misdemeanor battery. Although they verified his employment they took Mateen at his word that he was fired as a Florida corrections trainee for failing to report due to a fever. He was actually dismissed for skipping classes, falling asleep in class, and asking two days after the Virginia Tech shooting if a classmate would tell if he brought a gun to class. Also during his time as a trainee, a fellow trainee said he threatened to kill everyone at a barbecue after his hamburger touched a piece of pork, and he was escorted from the property.

In 2010, Mateen was videotaped while working security for G4S at a site related to the BP oil spill. His cynical description of the work situation was included in the 2012 documentary, &quot;The Big Fix&quot;.

Working with Mateen at the St. Lucie County Courthouse in 2013, a co-worker said he had complained to superiors at G4S about Mateen&#x27;s frequent violent, racist and homophobic tirades, but that the company ignored him. G4S denied having a record of those complaints. After Mateen claimed to his co-workers a family connection to Al Qaeda and said he was a member of Hezbollah, the county sheriff&#x27;s office called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The St Lucie Sheriff&#x27;s office &quot;demanded&quot; Mateen no longer provide security for the Courthouse. When G4S became aware the FBI was investigating Mateen, they did not dismiss Mateen but transferred him to the south guardhouse of the PGA Village, a gated community in Palm Beach County.

=== Contract reviews ===
Judges at two Treasure Coast courthouses that had been guarded by Mateen requested that G4S be replaced by sheriff&#x27;s deputies. At $377,000 and $86,000 respectively, the G4S contracts for St. Lucie and Indian River were cheaper by margins of $200,000 and $60,000 than the deputies.

The PGA Village board voted unanimously to review a $1 million annual contract with G4S and consider other vendors after the sale of a resident&#x27;s home was cancelled by a purchaser who learned that Mateen had patrolled the community.

On June 22, Massachusetts Senator Kathleen O&#x27;Connor Ives called it &quot;crazy and beyond ironic&quot; in light of Mateen and other scandals to replace members of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority police union with G4S to guard the transit agency&#x27;s money room. The $400,000 contract with G4S was just more than half the cost of MBTA Transit Police, who had been replaced June 6 after security lapses were reported by outside experts.

<doc id="198156" wikidata="Q1900936" url="?curid=198156" title="Markov algorithm">
<text>In theoretical computer science, a Markov algorithm is a string rewriting system that uses grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols. Markov algorithms have been shown to be Turing-complete, which means that they are suitable as a general model of computation and can represent any mathematical expression from its simple notation. Markov algorithms are named after the Soviet mathematician Andrey Markov, Jr.

Refal is a programming language based on Markov algorithms.

==Description==

Normal algorithms are verbal, that is, intended to be applied to strings in different alphabets.

The definition of any normal algorithm consists of two parts: an &quot;alphabet&quot;, which is a set of symbols, and a &quot;scheme&quot;. The algorithm is applied to strings of symbols of the alphabet. The scheme is a finite ordered set of &quot;substitution formulas&quot;. Each formula can be either &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;final&quot;. Simple substitution formulas are represented by strings of the form formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 are two arbitrary strings in the alphabet. Similarly, final substitution formulas are represented by strings of the form formula_4.

Here is an example of a normal algorithm scheme in the five-letter alphabet formula_5:

: formula_6

The process of applying the normal algorithm to an arbitrary string formula_7 in the alphabet of this algorithm is a discrete sequence of elementary steps, consisting of the following. Let’s assume that formula_8 is the word obtained in the previous step of the algorithm (or the original word formula_7, if the current step is the first). If of the substitution formulas there is no left-hand side which is included in the formula_8, then the algorithm terminates, and the result of its work is considered to be the string formula_8. Otherwise, the first of the substitution formulae whose left sides are included in formula_8 is selected. If the substitution formula is of the form formula_4, then out of all of possible representations of the string formula_8 of the form formula_15 (where formula_16 and formula_17 are arbitrary strings) the one with the shortest formula_16 is chosen. Then the algorithm terminates and the result of its work is considered to be formula_19. However, if this substitution formula is of the form formula_1, then out of all of the possible representations of the string formula_8 of the form of formula_15 the one with the shortest formula_16 is chosen, after which the string formula_19 is considered to be the result of the current step, subject to further processing in the next step.

For example, the process of applying the algorithm described above to the word formula_25 results in the sequence of words formula_26, formula_27, formula_28, formula_29, formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, formula_35 and formula_36, after which the algorithm stops with the result formula_37. 

For other examples, see below.

Any normal algorithm is equivalent to some Turing machine, and vice versaany Turing machine is equivalent to some normal algorithm. A version of the Church–Turing thesis formulated in relation to the normal algorithm is called the &quot;principle of normalization.&quot;

Normal algorithms have proved to be a convenient means for the construction of many sections of constructive mathematics. Moreover, inherent in the definition of a normal algorithm are a number of ideas used in programming languages aimed at handling symbolic informationfor example, in Refal.

==Algorithm==

The &quot;Rules&quot; are a sequence of pairs of strings, usually presented in the form of &quot;pattern&quot; → &quot;replacement&quot;. Each rule may be either ordinary or terminating.

Given an &quot;input&quot; string: 

#Check the Rules in order from top to bottom to see whether any of the &quot;patterns&quot; can be found in the &quot;input&quot; string.
#If none is found, the algorithm stops.
#If one (or more) is found, use the first of them to replace the leftmost occurrence of matched text in the &quot;input&quot; string with its &quot;replacement&quot;.
#If the rule just applied was a terminating one, the algorithm stops.
#Go to step 1.

Note that after each rule application the search starts over from the first rule.

==Example==
The following example shows the basic operation of a Markov algorithm.

===Rules===
#&quot;A&quot; -&gt; &quot;apple&quot;
#&quot;B&quot; -&gt; &quot;bag&quot;
#&quot;S&quot; -&gt; &quot;shop&quot;
#&quot;T&quot; -&gt; &quot;the&quot;
#&quot;the shop&quot; -&gt; &quot;my brother&quot;
#&quot;a never used&quot; -&gt; .&quot;terminating rule&quot;

===Symbol string===
&quot;I bought a B of As from T S.&quot;

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, the Symbol string will change in the following manner.

#&quot;I bought a B of As from T S.&quot;
#&quot;I bought a B of apples from T S.&quot;
#&quot;I bought a bag of apples from T S.&quot;
#&quot;I bought a bag of apples from T shop.&quot;
#&quot;I bought a bag of apples from the shop.&quot;
#&quot;I bought a bag of apples from my brother.&quot;

The algorithm will then terminate.

==Another example==

These rules give a more interesting example. They rewrite binary numbers to their unary counterparts. For example, 101 will be rewritten to a string of 5 consecutive bars.

===Rules===

#&quot;|0&quot; -&gt; &quot;0||&quot;
#&quot;1&quot; -&gt; &quot;0|&quot;
#&quot;0&quot; -&gt; &quot;&quot;

===Symbol string===
&quot;101&quot;

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, it will terminate after the following steps.

#&quot;101&quot;
#&quot;0|01&quot;
#&quot;00||1&quot;
#&quot;00||0|&quot;
#&quot;00|0|||&quot;
#&quot;000|||||&quot;
#&quot;00|||||&quot;
#&quot;0|||||&quot;

<text>USNS &quot;Watertown&quot; (T-AGM-6) was a &quot;Watertown&quot;-class missile range instrumentation ship acquired by the United States Navy in 1960 and converted from her SS &quot;Niantic Victory&quot; Victory ship cargo configuration to a missile tracking ship, a role she retained for eleven years before being placed out of service in 1971.

==Victory ship constructed in Oregon==
&quot;Niantic Victory&quot; was laid down on 12 February 1944 at Portland, Oregon, by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCV hull 100); launched on 25 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Marvin Owen; and delivered to the Maritime Commission on 18 May 1944. She was built in just 96 days under the Emergency Shipbuilding program by the War Shipping Administration.

==Maritime service==
=== World War II===
From 1944 until 1957, &quot;Niantic Victory&quot; was operated for the U.S. Maritime Commission by a succession of contractor firms. Her first operator was the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company for service during World War II starting on 18 May 1944. She supplied cargo in the Pacific Ocean for the Pacific War.
After the war on 6 November 1946 she was operated by Waterman SS Corporation as part of the Marshall Plan. On 30 May 1948 after completing her relief efforts she was removed from service and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Wilmington, N.C. She was laid up till 24 August 1950, but with a new war starting in the Far East she was remove cleaned up and chartered to Union Sulphur and Oil Company.

===Korean War===
During the Korean War she was operated by the Union Sulphur and Oil Company. SS &quot;Niantic Victory&quot; served as merchant marine naval supplying goods for the Korean War. About 75 percent of the personnel taking to Korean from the Korean War came by the merchant marine. SS &quot;Niantic Victory&quot; transported goods, mail, food and other supplies. About 90 percent of the cargo was moved by merchant marine naval to the war zone. SS &quot;Niantic Victory&quot; made trip between 18 November 1950 and 23 December 1952 helping American forces engaged against Communist aggression in South Korea. At the end of the war on 8 April 1955 her operator was changed to Pope and Talbot SS Company. On 11 December 1956 operator was changed to Isbrandtsen Company till 1957. She was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay, Benicia, Calif., on 24 January 1958.

==US Navy==
On 11 August 1960 she was transferred to the US Navy. She was reassigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) for conversion to a Missile Range Instrumentation Ship. Conversion was completed 27 November 1960 and she was renamed the USNS &quot;Watertown&quot; (T-AGM-6). She was lead ship of three ships in her class.

==Missile tracking service==
&quot;Niantic Victory&quot; was now the Navy Department Military Sea Transportation Service range instrumentation ship, USNS &quot;Watertown&quot; (T-AGM-6). For the next 11 years, she served in the Pacific Ocean in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Air Force on the latter service&#x27;s Western Missile Test Range. She operated as a mobile tracking station, recording test data from missiles and satellites out of range of land-based stations.

&quot;Watertown&quot; carried instrumentation to track and record flight events for military missile and NASA crewed spacecraft, extending the coverage of the tracking network over the Pacific Ocean. She was slated at one time to be part of the Apollo 8 recovery team but was dropped from the program. In 1969, she called at Pitcairn Island.

Two other ships were reconfigured in to this new class, &quot;Watertown-class missile range instrumentation ship&quot;, the &quot;USNS Huntsville (T-AGM-7)&quot; and the &quot;USNS Wheeling (T-AGM-8)&quot;.

==Inactivation==
In February 1971, the Air Force decided that it no longer required &quot;Watertown&quot;″s services and she was removed from service. Her name was struck from the Navy Directory on 16 February 1972, and she was returned to the Maritime Administration at its berthing facility at Suisun Bay, California, on 23 May 1974. She was sold to Dongkuk Steel Mill Co., Ltd on 23 May 1974 and scrapped in Pusan, South Korea. She arrived in South Korea on 16 July 1974.

<doc id="198175" wikidata="Q217691" url="?curid=198175" title="Provinces of Finland">
<text>Between 1634 and 2009, Finland was administered as several provinces (, ). Finland had always been a unitary state: the provincial authorities were part of the central government&#x27;s executive branch and apart from Åland, the provinces had little autonomy. There were never any elected provincial parliaments in continental Finland. The system was initially created in 1634. Its makeup was changed drastically on 1 September 1997, when the number of the provinces was reduced from twelve to six. This effectively made them purely administrative units, as linguistic and cultural boundaries no longer followed the borders of the provinces. The provinces were eventually abolished at the end of 2009. Consequently, different ministries may subdivide their areal organization differently. Besides the former provinces, the municipalities of Finland form the fundamental subdivisions of the country. In current use are the regions of Finland, a smaller subdivision where some pre-1997 s are split into multiple regions. Åland retains its special autonomous status and its own regional parliament.

== Duties ==
Each province was led by a governor (Finnish &quot;maaherra&quot;, Swedish &quot;landshövding&quot;) appointed by the president on the recommendation of the cabinet. The governor was the head of the State Provincial Office (Finnish &quot;lääninhallitus&quot;, Swedish &quot;länsstyrelse&quot;), which acted as the joint regional authority for seven ministries in the following domains:

*social services and health care
*education and culture
*police administration
*rescue services
*traffic administration
*competition and consumer affairs
*judicial administration

The official administrative subentities under the Provincial Office authorities were the Registry Offices (Finnish &quot;maistraatti&quot;, Swedish &quot;magistrat&quot;). Formerly there was also a division to state local districts (Finnish &quot;kihlakunta&quot;, Swedish &quot;härad&quot;), which were districts for police, prosecution, and bailiff services, but there was reorganization such that 24 police districts were founded. These usually encompass multiple municipalities.

Provinces governed only state offices, such as the police. Most services, such as healthcare and maintenance of local streets, were and remain today the responsibility of municipalities of Finland. Many municipalities are too small for a hospital and some other services, so they cooperate in municipality groups, e.g. health care districts, using borders that vary depending on the type of service. Often Swedish-language municipalities cooperate even if they do not share a border.

== List of all provinces that ever existed ==

In 1634, administratives provinces were formed in Sweden, and therefore in Finland, which was a part of Sweden until 1809. Five of the provinces covered what is now Finland; some of these also covered parts of what are now Russia. The exact division of the country into provinces has fluctuated over time.

The boundaries of the old provinces partly survive in telephone area codes and electoral districts. The exception is Helsinki: there is a telephone numbering area that comprises Greater Helsinki (code 09), while only the city of Helsinki proper comprises the electoral district of Helsinki, the rest of Greater Helsinki belonging to the Uusimaa electoral district.

== Geographical evolution of Finnish provincial administration 1634-2009==

=== Swedish rule ===

=== Russian rule ===

=== Independent Finland ===

== Provinces of Finland at abolition ==

==After abolition==
The provinces were abolished altogether effective 1 January 2010. Since then, the regional administration of the Finnish state has two parallel top-level organs in the hierarchy: the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment on the one hand, and the Regional State Administrative Agencies on the other.

Six Regional State Administrative Agencies (&quot;aluehallintovirasto, regionförvaltningsverk&quot;, abbr. &quot;avi&quot;) – in addition to the State Department of Åland – are primarily responsible for law enforcement. Among these, South-Western Finland and Western and Central Finland cover the former province of Western Finland, and the former province of Oulu was revamped as Northern Finland; other old provincial boundaries remain much the same in the new disposition.

In parallel, there are 15 Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (Finnish: &quot;elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus&quot;, usually abbreviated &quot;ely-keskus&quot;), which are responsible for other state administration: employment, road and transport infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. They are each responsible for one or more of regions of Finland, and include offices of the Ministries of Employment and the Economy, Transport and Communications and Environment.

<doc id="198179" wikidata="Q2364733" url="?curid=198179" title="USS Massachusetts (BB-59)">
<text>USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (BB-59) is the third of four fast battleships built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s. The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to guns, but refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of . A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships, a problem that was exacerbated by wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries and significantly increased their crews.

On completion, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was sent to support Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, in November 1942. There, she engaged in an artillery duel with the incomplete French battleship and neutralized her. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; thereafter transferred to the Pacific War for operations against Japan; she spent the war primarily as an escort for the fast carrier task force to protect the aircraft carriers from surface and air attacks. In this capacity, she took part in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in 1943 and early 1944 and the Philippines campaign in late 1944 and early 1945. Later in 1945, the ship supported Allied forces during the Battle of Okinawa and thereafter participated in attacks on Japan, including bombarding industrial targets on Honshu in July and August.

After the war, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; returned to the United States and was decommissioned and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Norfolk in 1947. She remained out of service until 1962, when she was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot;. Three years later, she was transferred to the Massachusetts Memorial Committee and preserved as a museum ship at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts. Some material was removed in the 1980s to reactivate the s, but the ship otherwise remains in her wartime configuration.

==Design==

The was ordered in the context of global naval rearmament during the breakdown of the Washington treaty system that had controlled battleship construction during the 1920s and early 1930s. Under the Washington and London treaties, so-called treaty battleships were limited to a standard displacement of and a main battery of guns. In 1936, following Japan&#x27;s decision to abandon the treaty system, the United States Navy decided to invoke the &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the Second London treaty that allowed displacements to rise to and armament to increase to guns. Congressional objections to increasing the size of the new ships forced the design staff to keep displacement as close to 35,000 LT as possible while incorporating the larger guns and armor sufficient to defeat guns of the same caliber.
&quot;Massachusetts&quot; is long overall and has a beam of and a draft of . She displaces as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried three Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her peace time crew numbered 1,793 officers and enlisted men, but during the war the crew swelled to 2,500 officers and enlisted.

The ship is armed with a main battery of nine 16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 guns guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which are placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The secondary battery consisted of twenty 5-inch /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on either side. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of twelve guns and twelve .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, but she was completed with a battery of six quadruple Bofors guns in place of the 1.1 in guns and thirty-five Oerlikon autocannon instead of the .50-cal. guns.

The main armored belt is thick, while the main armored deck is up to thick. The main battery gun turrets have thick faces, and they were mounted atop barbettes that were thick. The conning tower had thick sides.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; received a series of modifications through her wartime career, consisting primarily of additions to anti-aircraft battery and various types of radar sets. The first addition was the installation of SC air search radar in 1941, fitted in the foremast, which was later replaced with an SK type set. At the same time, an SG surface search radar was installed on the forward superstructure; a second SG set was added to the main mast after experiences during the Guadalcanal Campaign in 1942. While still under construction, she received a Mark 8 fire-control radar, mounted on her conning tower to assist in the direction of her main battery guns and Mark 4 radars for the secondary battery guns. She later received Mark 12/22 sets in place of the Mark 4s. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; also received a TDY jammer. In 1945, her traditional spotting scopes were replaced with Mark 27 microwave radar sets.

The ship&#x27;s light anti-aircraft battery was gradually expanded. Four more 40 mm quad mounts were added in late 1942, and in February 1943, two more quads were added, one each to the roofs of turrets 2 and 3. By this time, she had another twenty-four 20 mm guns installed, bringing the total to sixty-one of the guns. Two more 40 mm quadruple mounts were added in February, and another seven 20 mm guns were added later that year for a total battery of sixty barrels. By early 1944, the Navy had begun to realize that the 20 mm guns were less effective and had made plans to reduce the number of those guns to 33 barrels in favor of more 40 mm guns. By October, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; had thirty-two of the guns, six of which were in experimental quad and twin mounts. She received six more quadruple 40 mm guns, bringing the total to seventy-two barrels. Two of these new quads were mounted in the forecastle, which proved to be of limited use as they were unusable in all but the calmest seas, and they were removed in the ship&#x27;s postwar refit, as was the mount atop the number 2 turret.

==Service history==
===Construction and Atlantic operations===
&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was laid down at Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard on 20 July 1939. She was launched on 23 September 1941, and after completing fitting-out work, was commissioned into the fleet on 12 May 1942. She then conducted her shakedown cruise before moving to Casco Bay, Maine; from there, she was assigned to the Western Naval Task Force, which was to support Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; got underway on 24 October to join the rest of the unit, which she met at sea four days later. She became the flagship of Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, part of Task Group (TG) 34.1, which also included the heavy cruisers and and four destroyers. The ships rendezvoused with the rest of the invasion fleet on 28 October some southeast of Cape Race and proceeded across the Atlantic.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; participated in the Naval Battle of Casablanca, which began early on the morning of 8 November. The ships were tasked with neutralizing the primary French defenses, which included coastal guns on El Hank, several submarines, and the incomplete battleship which lay at anchor in the harbor with only half of its main battery installed. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; began firing at 07:04 at a range of and shortly thereafter came under fire from &quot;Jean Bart&quot; that morning, and she returned fire at 07:40. &quot;Wichita&quot; and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; initially engaged the French batteries on El Hank and the French submarine pens, while &quot;Massachusetts&quot; attacked &quot;Jean Bart&quot;. French naval forces, led by the cruiser , put up a stubborn defense. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the American cruisers broke up attempts by French destroyers to attack the fleet before returning to shelling &quot;Jean Bart&quot;; in the course of the action, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; scored five hits on &quot;Jean Bart&quot; and disabled her main battery turret.

With &quot;Jean Bart&quot; out of action, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the other ships then shifted fire to destroy coastal artillery batteries, an ammunition dump, and merchant ships in the harbor. One of her 16-inch shells also struck the floating dry-dock that held the submarine ; the dry dock sank, but &quot;Le Conquérant&quot; was not damaged and was able to get underway, only to be sunk by a PBY Catalina at sea. The French defenders agreed to a cease-fire on 11 November, which allowed the ships of TG 34.1 to be detached for other operations. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; got underway for the United States on 12 November to begin preparations for operations in the Pacific Theater.

===Pacific war===
====Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign====

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; reached Noumea in New Caledonia on 4 March 1943 and spent the next several months escorting convoys to the Solomon Islands in support of operations during the Solomon Islands campaign. On 30 June, she provided cover for an amphibious assault on New Georgia, part of Operation Cartwheel; at the time, she was assigned to the battleship group for TF 36.3, which included her sister ship and . Over the next week, the Japanese launched several naval and aerial attacks on American forces involved in the campaign, but none attacked the battleship force.

She departed the area on 19 November to take part in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, escorting the carrier task group TG 50.2, again in company with &quot;Indiana&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot;, that carried out a series of air attacks on Makin, Tarawa, and Abemama in the Gilbert Islands. These operations were in support of the landings at Tarawa and Makin, both to weaken Japanese defenses on the islands and also isolate the Japanese garrisons from forces on nearby islands that might be able to reinforce them or launch counterattacks. On 8 December, she took part in a bombardment of Japanese positions at Nauru. For the operation, she was detached to form TG 50.8 under the command of Rear Admiral Willis Lee, along with &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, , and and several escorting destroyers.

Operations during the campaign continued into January 1944, with the invasion of Kwajalein; by this time, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; had been transferred to TG 58.1, under the command of Fifth Fleet. For much of the Pacific War, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; served with the fast carrier task force, at that time designated TF 58, screening the carriers from surface attacks and contributing her heavy anti-aircraft battery against Japanese air attacks. The carriers struck numerous targets in the Marshalls, again to isolate the garrison on Kwajalein. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; bombarded the island on 30 January in company with &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and &quot;Indiana&quot;, the day before marines went ashore.
&quot;Massachusetts&quot; continued in her role as an escort for the fast carrier task force during Operation Hailstone on 17 February, a major carrier raid on the island of Truk, which had been the primary staging area for the Japanese fleet in the central Pacific. The ship was now part of TG 58.3 for the attack. The fleet continued on to conduct a series of strikes on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, which provoked heavy Japanese air attacks in response. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; contributed her heavy anti-aircraft battery to the fleet&#x27;s defense. The American fleet then moved to the Caroline Islands, striking several islands in the area.

On 22 April, the fleet supported the landing at Hollandia in western New Guinea. On the way back from the area, the fleet struck Truk again. On 1 May, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; joined a bombardment group designated TG 58.7 that attacked Pohnpei in the Senyavin Islands, again under Lee&#x27;s command. After the attack, fleet withdrew to Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands. From there, the ship was detached for an overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, which included having her guns re-lined, as they had been worn out by that time. As a result, she was unavailable for the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign that was waged in June and July. She departed the west coast in July and stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way, departing there on 1 August to rejoin the fleet in the Marshall Islands.

By this time, the Third Fleet had taken command of the fast carrier task force and all subordinate units were renumbered from the 50s series to the 30s series. Accordingly, she joined TG 38.3 on reaching the fleet and escorted carriers that made a series of strikes in late August and early September in preparation of the landings at Morotai and Peleliu. These included strikes on 9 and 10 September on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines to neutralize Japanese-held airfields that could interfere with the landings. From 12 to 14 September, the fleet moved to strike targets in the Visayas. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; escorted the carriers for further strikes on Luzon, particularly around the capital at Manila, and the Visayas from 21 to 22 September. The month-long campaign destroyed some 1,000 Japanese aircraft and sank or otherwise neutralized 150 ships.

====Philippines campaign====

On 6 October, she sortied with the rest of the fleet to begin preparations for the invasion of the Philippines, still as part of TG 38.3. The first operation was a major strike on Japanese air bases on the island of Okinawa on 10 October, part of an effort to reduce Japan&#x27;s ability to interfere with the landings from airbases in the region. From 12 to 14 October, the fast carrier task force struck bases on Formosa (Taiwan), before returning to the invasion fleet off Leyte, the initial target. Over the course of the strikes on Okinawa and Formosa, the fleet came under heavy air attacks, but &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was not engaged, as the Japanese attacks concentrated on task groups 38.1 and 38.4. On 16 October, a group of Japanese cruisers and destroyers sortied to attack American vessels that had been damaged in the attacks, prompting &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the rest of TG 38.3 and 38.2 to return north to engage them, but they failed to locate the Japanese before they returned to port at Amami Ōshima.

The next day, the carrier task force returned to strike Luzon, the same day that elements of Sixth Army went ashore at Leyte; the raids on Luzon continued into 19 October. The landing on Leyte led to the activation of Operation Shō-Gō 1, the Japanese navy&#x27;s planned riposte to an Allied landing in the Philippines. The plan was a complicated operation with three separate fleets: The 1st Mobile Fleet, now labeled the Northern Force under Jisaburō Ozawa, the Center Force under Takeo Kurita, and the Southern Force under Shōji Nishimura. Ozawa&#x27;s carriers, by now depleted of most of their aircraft, were to serve as a decoy for Kurita&#x27;s and Nishimura&#x27;s battleships, which were to use the distraction to attack the invasion fleet directly.

Kurita&#x27;s ships were detected in the San Bernardino Strait on 24 October, and in the ensuing Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, American carrier aircraft sank the powerful battleship , causing Kurita to temporarily reverse course. This convinced Admiral William F. Halsey, the commander of Third Fleet, to send the fast carrier task force to destroy the 1st Mobile Fleet, which had by then been detected. Later that evening, Commodore Arleigh Burke, Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s Chief of Staff, suggested that Mitscher detach &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot; (along with a pair of light cruisers and a destroyer screen) to send them ahead of the carriers to fight a night action with the Northern Force. Mitscher agreed, and at 17:12 ordered Rear Admiral Forrest Sherman to put the plan into action. Halsey intervened before Sherman could send the ships north and overruled Mitscher, ordering them to keep the battleships with the main fleet. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; steamed north with the carriers, and on the way Halsey established TF 34, consisting of &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and five other fast battleships, seven cruisers, and eighteen destroyers, commanded by now-Vice Admiral Willis Lee.

TF 34 was arrayed ahead of the carriers, serving as their screen. On the morning of 25 October, Mitscher began his first attack on the Northern Force, initiating the Battle off Cape Engaño; over the course of six strikes on the Japanese fleet, the Americans sank all four carriers and damaged two old battleships that had been converted into hybrid carriers. Unknown to Halsey and Mitscher, Kurita had resumed his approach through the San Bernardino Strait late on 24 October and passed into Leyte Gulf the next morning. While Mitscher was occupied with the decoy Northern Force, Kurita moved in to attack the invasion fleet; in the Battle off Samar, he was held off by a group of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts, TU 77.4.3, known as Taffy 3. Frantic calls for help later that morning led Halsey to detach Lee&#x27;s battleships to head south and intervene.

However, Halsey waited more than an hour after receiving orders from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, to detach TF 34; still steaming north during this interval, the delay added two hours to the battleships&#x27; voyage south. A need to refuel destroyers further slowed TF 34&#x27;s progress south. Heavy resistance from Taffy 3 threw Kurita&#x27;s battleships and cruisers into disarray and led him to break off the attack before &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the rest of TF 34 could arrive. Halsey detached the battleships and as TG 34.5 to pursue Kurita through the San Bernardino Strait while Lee took the rest of his ships further southwest to try to cut off his escape, but both groups arrived too late. The historian H. P. Wilmott speculated that had Halsey detached TF 34 promptly and not delayed the battleships by refueling the destroyers, the ships could have easily arrived in the strait ahead of Center Force and, owing to the marked superiority of their radar-directed main guns, destroyed Kurita&#x27;s ships.

The fleet withdrew to Ulithi to replenish fuel and ammunition before embarking on a series of raids on Japanese airfields and other facilities on Luzon as the amphibious force prepared for its next landing on the island of Mindoro in the western Philippines. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was now a member of TG 38.1. The carriers struck Manila on 14 December and after the fleet withdrew on 17 December, Typhoon Cobra swept through the area, battering the fleet and sinking three destroyers, though &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was not significantly damaged in the incident. She reported one injury among her crew and the loss of two of her reconnaissance aircraft. From 30 December to 23 January 1945, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; operated with the carriers of TF 38, which made a series of raids on Formosa and Okinawa, to support the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in the northern Philippines. The carriers of TG 38.1 concentrated their attacks on Formosa.

====Operations off Japan and later career====
By February, the fast carrier task force had reverted to Fifth Fleet command, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was now part of TG 58.1. The ship carried on in her role as an escort for the fleet carriers during a series of strikes on Honshu; these were made to support the upcoming invasion of Iwo Jima. The task force departed Ulithi on 10 February, and after conducting exercises off Tinian on 12 February and refueling on the 14th, began the attacks on Honshu on 16 February. Further raids are carried out the next day and on 18 February, the ships of TG 58.1 withdrew to refuel at sea. The carriers also raided Iwo Jima during battle there, with TG 58.1 contributing its firepower beginning on 20 February. TF 58 withdrew to refuel on 24 February and then made additional strikes on the Tokyo area over the course of 25 and 26 February. They then steamed south to raid Okinawa on 1 March before withdrawing the next day to Ulithi, which they reached on 4 March.

TF 58 sortied again on 14 March for another raid on Japan; &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was again assigned to TG 58.1. The ships refueled on the way on 16 March. Two days later, the carriers began another series of attacks on mainland Japan, starting with targets on the island of Kyushu to weaken Japanese forces before the invasion of Okinawa in April. A large counter-attack consisting of 48 kamikazes hit the fleet, but the attacks were concentrated on TG 58.4 and as a result &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was not heavily engaged. The next day, during raids on the Kure area, Japanese bombers attacked the fleet and badly damaged the carrier , part of TG 58.1, though &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was not hit. Heavy damage inflicted on other units by bombers and kamikazes prompted Mitscher, the commander of TF 58, to withdraw his fleet and reorganize it. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; remained in TG 58.1, but two cruisers were detached to escort &quot;Wasp&quot; back to Ulithi.

On 23 March, TF 58 steamed southwest to begin preparatory attacks on Okinawa in advance of the landing on the island. The next day, the carriers of TG 58.1 destroyed a convoy of eight transports off Kyushu and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was detached in company with the battleships &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, and as TF 59 to shell Okinawa, thereafter returning to their carrier groups. The ship spent much of April operating off the island, helping to fend off heavy Japanese air attacks. Throughout this period, the carrier task groups rotated through the station, with two groups in action at any given time. Heavy and repeated kamikaze attacks hit numerous vessels over the course of the campaign, but &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was not targeted by the suicide craft. In late May, Third Fleet resumed command of the task force, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;&#x27; unit was accordingly re-numbered TG 38.1. On 5 June, the ship passed through another typhoon that did not inflict serious damage to &quot;Massachusetts&quot;. Five days later, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; steamed to shell Japanese facilities on the island of Minami Daito Jima in the Ryukyus. Following this bombardment, TF 38 withdrew to Leyte Gulf after three months of continuous operations.
The fleet thereafter returned to Leyte Gulf to prepare for the next major operation off Japan. The fast carrier task force sortied on 1 July for attacks on Honshu, initially concentrating on the area around Tokyo. On 14 July, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was detached to form TG 34.8.1. with &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, two heavy cruisers and nine destroyers. The ships were sent to bombard an industrial complex in Kamaishi that included the Japan Iron Co. and the Kamaishi Steel Works; this complex was Japan&#x27;s second-largest iron and steel manufacturing center, and this was the first bombardment operation conducted against the Japanese Home Islands. Two weeks later, she repeated the bombardment, this time targeting industrial facilities at Hamamatsu. For this operation, they were joined by the battleship and three destroyers of the British Pacific Fleet. Another attack on Kamaishi followed on 9 August, this time TG 34.8 was reinforced by the battleship .

Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; departed the region on 1 September, bound for Puget Sound for an overhaul. The work lasted until 28 January 1946, when she sailed south to San Francisco, California before proceeding on to Hampton Roads, Virginia, which she reached on 22 April. She was decommissioned on 27 March 1947 at Norfolk, Virginia, and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Plans were drawn up during the period she was in reserve to modernize &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the other ships of her class should they be needed for future active service. In March 1954, a program to equip the four ships with secondary batteries consisting of ten twin guns were proposed, but the plan came to nothing. Another plan to convert the ship into a guided missile battleship arose in 1956–1957, but the cost of the conversion proved to be prohibitive. She would have had all three main battery turrets removed and replaced with a twin RIM-8 Talos missile launcher forward, two RIM-24 Tartar launchers aft, anti-submarine weapons, and equipment to handle helicopters. The cost of the project amounted to $120 million. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; remained out of service until 1 June 1962, when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. While she was in reserve, the Navy removed approximately 5,000 tons of equipment for use on other naval vessels, including both of the explosive-driven catapults used to launch float planes.

==Museum ship==

After &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was stricken and slated for disposal, a group of her former crew lobbied to have the battleship preserved as a museum ship. The Massachusetts Memorial Committee successfully raised enough money to purchase the vessel from the Navy, including through a donation campaign for children in the state, and on 8 June 1965, the Navy transferred ownership of the vessel to the state. Two months later, on 14 August, she was anchored in Fall River, Massachusetts, at Battleship Cove. The museum also includes the destroyer , the submarine , a pair of PT boats, and numerous other exhibits.

In the early 1980s, when the Navy reactivated the four s, parts were cannibalized from preserved battleships, including &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, to restore the &quot;Iowa&quot;s to service. Engine room components that were no longer available in the Navy&#x27;s inventory accounted for most of the material removed from the ships. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places on 14 January 1986. Apart from the material removed in the 1980s and her aircraft catapults, which were taken for use in other vessels while still in the Navy&#x27;s possession, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; is still largely in her wartime configuration.

In November 1998, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was closed to the public in advance of her planned departure for Boston, where she was scheduled to undergo an overhaul. She departed on her trip to the capital at 06:30 4 November 1998 with a tug boat moving her under the Braga, Mt. Hope and Newport Bridges, then up the coast to Boston. She arrived 7 November and entered Boston&#x27;s Drydock Number 3, where an inspection determined the battleship was in need of additional steel plating along her hull at the water line to protect against sea water corrosion. In addition, the survey also located leaking rivets and identified a need to remove two of the battleship&#x27;s propellers for repair purposes. For the next four months &quot;Massachusetts&quot; underwent repairs to correct these problems, including the addition of nearly of steel to her hull and the addition of a compound known as Red Hand Epoxy to encase and protect the hull against further deterioration. In March 1999 &quot;Massachusetts&quot; emerged from her dry docking period and returned under tow to Battleship Cove, arriving at her berth at 15:30 13 March 1999 to a crowd of citizens, dignitaries, veterans, and civic officials.

<text>Potassium tartrate, dipotassium tartrate or argol has formula K2C4H4O6. It is the potassium salt of tartaric acid. It is often confused with potassium bitartrate, also known as cream of tartar. As a food additive, it shares the E number E336 with potassium bitartrate.

Potassium bitartrate, also referred to as potassium acid tartrate or cream of tartar, is the potassium acid salt of l-( + )-tartaric acid. It is obtained as a byproduct of wine manufacture during the fermentation process. Approved by the FDA as a direct food substance, potassium bitartrate is used as an additive, stabilizer, pH control agent, antimicrobial agent, processing aid, or thickener in various food products. Potassium bitartrate has a long history of medical use as a laxative administered as a rectal suppository and is an approved third-class OTC drug in Japan.

Potassium bitartrate was one of active ingredients in Phexxi, a non-hormonal contraceptive agent that was approved by the FDA in May 2020.

==Manufacturing==
Potassium tartrate is produced by the reaction of tartaric acid with potassium sodium tartrate (rochelle salt), and potassium sulfate, followed by filtration, purification, precipitation and drying.

==Other compounds==
Tartar emetic is produced when potassium tartrate is heated with antimony trioxide. Tartar emetic causes intense nausea, prostration and vomiting by irritating the gastrointestinal mucosa.https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11107

<doc id="198188" wikidata="Q727153" url="?curid=198188" title="Hiatal hernia">
<text>A hiatal hernia or hiatus hernia is a type of hernia in which abdominal organs (typically the stomach) slip through the diaphragm into the middle compartment of the chest. This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with symptoms such as a taste of acid in the back of the mouth or heartburn. Other symptoms may include trouble swallowing and chest pains. Complications may include iron deficiency anemia, volvulus, or bowel obstruction.
The most common risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors include major trauma, scoliosis, and certain types of surgery. There are two main types: sliding hernia, in which the body of the stomach moves up; and paraesophageal hernia, in which an abdominal organ moves beside the esophagus. The diagnosis may be confirmed with endoscopy or medical imaging. Endoscopy is typically only required when concerning symptoms are present, symptoms are resistant to treatment, or the person is over 50 years of age.
Symptoms from a hiatal hernia may be improved by changes such as raising the head of the bed, weight loss, and adjusting eating habits. Medications that reduce gastric acid such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may also help with the symptoms. If the condition does not improve with medications, a surgery to carry out a laparoscopic fundoplication may be an option. Between 10% and 80% of adults in North America are affected.

==Signs and symptoms==
Hiatal hernia has often been called the &quot;great mimic&quot; because its symptoms can resemble many disorders. Among them, a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest, shortness of breath (caused by the hernia&#x27;s effect on the diaphragm), heart palpitations (due to irritation of the vagus nerve), and swallowed food &quot;balling up&quot; and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach. In addition, hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.

In most cases, however, a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms. The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of acid reflux, it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.

In newborns, the presence of Bochdalek hernia can be recognised from symptoms such as difficulty breathing, fast respiration, and increased heart rate.

==Causes==
The following are potential causes of a hiatal hernia.
* Increased pressure within the abdomen caused by:
** Heavy lifting or bending over
** Frequent or hard coughing
** Hard sneezing
** Violent vomiting
** Straining during defecation (i.e., the Valsalva maneuver)

Obesity and age-related changes to the diaphragm are also general risk factors.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of a hiatal hernia is typically made through an upper GI series, endoscopy, high resolution manometry, esophageal pH monitoring, and computed tomography (CT). Barium swallow as in upper GI series allows the size, location, stricture, stenosis of oesophagus to be seen. It can also evaluate the oesophageal movements. Endoscopy can analyse the esophageal internal surface for erosions, ulcers, and tumours.

Meanwhile, manometry can determine the integrity of esophageal movements, and the presence of esophageal achalasia. pH testings allows the quantitative analysis of acid reflux episodes. CT scan is useful in diagnosing complications of hiatal hernia such as gastric volvulus, perforation, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumomediastinum.

===Classification===
Four types of esophageal hiatal hernia are identified:

Type I: A type I hernia, also known as a sliding hiatal hernia, occurs when part of the stomach slides up through the hiatal opening in the diaphragm. There is a widening of the muscular hiatal tunnel and circumferential laxity of the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing a portion of the gastric cardia to herniate upward into the posterior mediastinum. The clinical significance of type I hernias is in their association with reflux disease. Sliding hernias are the most common type and account for 95% of all hiatal hernias. (C)

Type II: A type II hernia, also known as a paraesophageal or rolling hernia, occurs when the fundus and greater curvature of the stomach roll up through the diaphragm, forming a pocket alongside the esophagus. It results from a localized defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament while the gastroesophageal junction remains fixed to the pre aortic fascia and the median arcuate ligament. The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. (D)

Type III: Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.

Type IV: Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.

The end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180° around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.

==Treatment==

In the great majority of cases, people experience no significant discomfort, and no treatment is required. People with symptoms should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals. If the condition has been brought on by stress, stress reduction techniques may be prescribed, or if overweight, weight loss may be indicated.

===Medications===
Antisecretory drugs such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion. Medications that reduce the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure should be avoided.

===Procedures===
There is tentative evidence from non-controlled trials that oral neuromuscular training may improve symptoms. This has been approved by the UK National Health Service for supply on prescription from 1 May 2022.

===Surgery===
In some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause esophageal stricture or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the esophagus or is causing Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, surgery is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery. Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include gas bloat syndrome, dysphagia (trouble swallowing), dumping syndrome, excessive scarring, and rarely, achalasia. Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.

One surgical procedure used is called Nissen fundoplication. In fundoplication, the gastric fundus (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of gastric acid. The procedure is now commonly performed laparoscopically. With proper patient selection, laparoscopic fundoplication studies in the 21st century have indicated relatively low complication rates, quick recovery, and relatively good long term results.
Regarding the discussion of partial versus complete fundoplication procedures, significant variations in the postoperative outcome emphasize the increased prevalence of dysphagia after Nissen. The statistics given support the superiority of laparoscopic over traditional surgery, owing to the greater aesthetic result, shorter admission time – with lower costs – and faster social reintegration.

==Epidemiology==
Incidence of hiatal hernias increases with age; approximately 60% of individuals aged 50 or older have a hiatal hernia. Of these, 9% are symptomatic, depending on the competence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). 95% of these are &quot;sliding&quot; hiatal hernias, in which the LES protrudes above the diaphragm along with the stomach, and only 5% are the &quot;rolling&quot; type (paraesophageal), in which the LES remains stationary, but the stomach protrudes above the diaphragm. 

Hiatal hernias are most common in North America and Western Europe and rare in rural African communities. Some have proposed that insufficient dietary fiber and the use of a high sitting position for defecation may increase the risk.

==Veterinary==
Hiatal hernia has been described in s since 1974, with the first case being in two dogs. It has since been reported in cats too. Type I is the most common and Type II is also common, but III and IV are rare with scarce reports in the literature.

In dogs it is estimated 60% of cases are congenital with brachycephalic breeds being the most affected due to the oesophageal hiatus&#x27; cross-sectional area being larger than and doliocephalic dogs. The diaphragm failing to fuse during development of the embryo is believed to be the cause of congenital hiatal hernia.

The Shar-pei and Bulldog are most commonly affected, however no mutation or heritability has been identified as of 2023. Other risk factors for the condition include: nasal masses, laryngeal paralysis, and a narrowed intrapharyngeal opening.

Tetanus has been identified as a cause in dogs; these cases can be resolved via treating the tetanus.

Treatment of airway obstructions and feeding low-fat more digestible food can alleviate any need for invasive procedures.

<doc id="198193" wikidata="Q428649" url="?curid=198193" title="Project for the New American Century">
<text>The Project for the New American Century (PNAC) was a neoconservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., that focused on United States foreign policy. It was established as a non-profit educational organization in 1997, and founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. PNAC&#x27;s stated goal was &quot;to promote American global leadership&quot;. The organization stated that &quot;American leadership is good both for America and for the world&quot;, and sought to build support for &quot;a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity&quot;.

Of the twenty-five people who signed PNAC&#x27;s founding statement of principles, ten went on to serve in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush, including Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz. Observers such as Irwin Stelzer and Dave Grondin have suggested that the PNAC played a key role in shaping the foreign policy of the Bush Administration, particularly in building support for the Iraq War. Academics such as Inderjeet Parmar, Phillip Hammond, and Donald E. Abelson have said PNAC&#x27;s influence on the George W. Bush administration has been exaggerated.

The Project for the New American Century ceased to function in 2006; it was replaced by a new think-tank named the Foreign Policy Initiative, co-founded by Kristol and Kagan in 2009. The Foreign Policy Initiative was dissolved in 2017.

==Origins and operation==
The Project for the New American Century developed from Kristol and Kagan&#x27;s belief that the Republican Party lacked a &quot;compelling vision for American foreign policy&quot;, which would allow Republican leaders to effectively criticize President Bill Clinton&#x27;s foreign policy record.

During mid-1996, Kristol and Kagan co-authored an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; titled &quot;Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy&quot; – referring to the foreign policy of President Ronald Reagan. In the article, they argued that American conservatives were &quot;adrift&quot; in the area of foreign policy, advocated a &quot;more elevated vision of America&#x27;s international role&quot;, and suggested that the United States&#x27; should adopt a stance of &quot;benevolent global hegemony.&quot; In June 1997, Kristol and Kagan founded the PNAC in order to advance the goals they had first laid out in &quot;Foreign Affairs,&quot; echoing the article&#x27;s statements and goals in PNAC&#x27;s founding &quot;Statement of Principles.&quot;

According to Maria Ryan, the individuals who signed the PNAC&#x27;s statements and letters were not employees or members of the group, and &quot;supporters of PNAC&#x27;s initiatives differed from case to case.&quot; While its permanent staff was relatively small, the organization was &quot;especially well connected&quot;, with some of its statements and letters attracting the support of prominent conservatives and neoconservatives.

In this regard, Stuart Elden has stated that &quot;The influence that PNAC had was astonishing&quot;, and noted thatThe number of figures associated with PNAC that had been members of the Reagan or the first Bush administration and the number that would take up office with the administration of the second President Bush demonstrate that it is not merely a question of employees and budgets.

==Statement of Principles==
PNAC&#x27;s first public act was to release a &quot;Statement of Principles&quot; on June 3, 1997. The statement had 25 signers, including project members and outside supporters (see Signatories to Statement of Principles). It described the United States as the &quot;world&#x27;s pre-eminent power&quot;, and said that the nation faced a challenge to &quot;shape a new century favorable to American principles and interests&quot;. To this goal, the statement&#x27;s signers called for significant increases in defense spending, and for the promotion of &quot;political and economic freedom abroad&quot;. It said the United States should strengthen ties with its democratic allies, &quot;challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values&quot;, and preserve and extend &quot;an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles&quot;. Calling for a &quot;Reaganite&quot; policy of &quot;military strength and moral clarity&quot;, it concluded that PNAC&#x27;s principles were necessary &quot;if the United States is to build on the successes of this past century and to ensure our security and our greatness in the next&quot;.

In September 2000 PNAC released &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; a report that promotes &quot;the belief that America should seek to preserve and extend its position of global leadership by maintaining the preeminence of U.S. military forces&quot;. The report states, &quot;advanced forms of biological warfare that can &#x27;target&#x27; specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool&quot;.

==Calls for regime change in Iraq==
In 1998, Kristol and Kagan advocated regime change in Iraq throughout the Iraq disarmament process through articles that were published in the New York Times. Following perceived Iraqi unwillingness to co-operate with UN weapons inspections, core members of the PNAC including Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, R. James Woolsey, Elliott Abrams, Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Zoellick, and John Bolton were among the signatories of an open letter initiated by the PNAC to President Bill Clinton calling for the removal of Saddam Hussein. Portraying Saddam Hussein as a threat to the United States, its Middle East allies, and oil resources in the region, and emphasizing the potential danger of any weapons of mass destruction under Iraq&#x27;s control, the letter asserted that the United States could &quot;no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish Saddam when he blocks or evades UN inspections&quot;. Stating that American policy &quot;cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council&quot;, the letter&#x27;s signatories asserted that &quot;the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolutions to take the necessary steps, including military steps, to protect our vital interests in the Gulf&quot;. Believing that UN sanctions against Iraq would be an ineffective means of disarming Iraq, PNAC members also wrote a letter to Republican members of the U.S. Congress Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, urging Congress to act, and supported the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (H.R. 4655) which President Clinton signed into law in October 1998.

In February 1998, some of the same individuals who had signed the PNAC letter in January also signed a similar letter to Clinton, from the bipartisan Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf.

In January 1999, the PNAC circulated a memo that criticized the December 1998 bombing of Iraq in Operation Desert Fox as ineffective. The memo questioned the viability of Iraqi democratic opposition, which the U.S. was supporting through the Iraq Liberation Act, and referred to any &quot;containment&quot; policy as an illusion.

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the PNAC sent a letter to President George W. Bush, specifically advocating regime change through &quot;a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq&quot;. The letter suggested that &quot;any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq&quot;, even if no evidence linked Iraq to the September 11 attacks. The letter warned that allowing Hussein to remain in power would be &quot;an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism.&quot; From 2001 through the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the PNAC and many of its members voiced active support for military action against Iraq, and asserted leaving Saddam Hussein in power would be &quot;surrender to terrorism&quot;.

Some have regarded the PNAC&#x27;s January 16, 1998, letter to President Clinton urging &quot;the removal of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime from power&quot;, and the involvement of multiple PNAC members in the Bush Administration as evidence that the PNAC had a significant influence on the Bush Administration&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq, or even argued that the invasion was a foregone conclusion. Writing in Der Spiegel in 2003, for example, Jochen Bölsche specifically referred to PNAC when he claimed that &quot;ultra-rightwing US think-tanks&quot; had been &quot;drawing up plans for an era of American global domination, for the emasculation of the UN, and an aggressive war against Iraq&quot; in &quot;broad daylight&quot; since 1998. Similarly, BBC journalist Paul Reynolds portrayed PNAC&#x27;s activities and goals as key to understanding the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration after September 11, 2001, suggesting that Bush&#x27;s &quot;dominant&quot; foreign policy was at least partly inspired by the PNAC&#x27;s ideas.

Some political scientists, historians, and other academics have been critical of many of these claims. Donald E. Abelson has written that scholars studying &quot;PNAC&#x27;s ascendancy&quot; in the political arena &quot;cannot possibly overlook the fact&quot; that several of the signatories to PNAC&#x27;s &quot;Statement of Purposes&quot; &quot;received high level positions in the Bush administration&quot;, but that acknowledging these facts &quot;is a far cry from making the claim that the institute was the architect of Bush&#x27;s foreign policy&quot;.

==&quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot;==
One of the PNAC&#x27;s most influential publications was a 90-page report titled &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century.&quot; Citing the PNAC&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Statement of Principles,&quot; &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; asserted that the United States should &quot;seek to preserve and extend its position of global leadership&quot; by &quot;maintaining the preeminence of U.S. military forces.&quot; The report&#x27;s primary author was Giselle Donnelly, then going by the first name Thomas. Donald Kagan and Gary Schmitt are credited as project chairmen. It also lists the names of 27 other participants who contributed papers or attended meetings related to the production of the report, six of whom subsequently assumed key defense and foreign policy positions in the Bush administration. It suggested that the preceding decade had been a time of peace and stability, which had provided &quot;the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth&quot; and &quot;the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy&quot;. The report warned that &quot;no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global Pax Americana will not preserve itself.

According to the report, current levels of defense spending were insufficient, forcing policymakers &quot;to try ineffectually to &#x27;manage&#x27; increasingly large risks&quot;. The result, it suggested, was a form &quot;paying for today&#x27;s needs by shortchanging tomorrow&#x27;s; withdrawing from constabulary missions to retain strength for large-scale wars; &#x27;choosing&#x27; between presence in Europe or presence in Asia; and so on&quot;. The report asserted that ll of these were &quot;bad choices&quot; and &quot;false economies&quot;, which did little to promote long-term American interests. &quot;The true cost of not meeting our defense requirements&quot;, the report argued, &quot;will be a lessened capacity for American global leadership and, ultimately, the loss of a global security order that is uniquely friendly to American principles and prosperity&quot;.

&quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; recommended establishing four core missions for US military forces: the defense of the &quot;American homeland&quot;, the fighting and winning of &quot;multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars&quot;, the performance of &quot;&#x27;constabular&#x27; duties associated with shaping the security environment&quot; in key regions, and the transformation of US forces &quot;to exploit the &#x27;revolution in military affairs&#x27;&quot;. Its specific recommendations included the maintenance of US nuclear superiority, an increase of the active personnel strength of the military from 1.4 to 1.6 million people, the redeployment of US forces to Southeast Europe and Asia, and the &quot;selective&quot; modernization of US forces. The report advocated the cancellation of &quot;roadblock&quot; programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter (which it argued would absorb &quot;exorbitant&quot; amounts of Pentagon funding while providing limited gains), but favored the development of &quot;global missile defenses&quot; and the control of &quot;space and cyberspace&quot;, including the creation of a new military service with the mission of &quot;space control&quot;. To help achieve these aims, &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; advocated a gradual increase in military and defense spending &quot;to a minimum level of 3.5 to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product, adding $15 billion to $20 billion to total defense spending annually. That amount is at least 17% to 19% or $355 billion to $386 billion of the US federal tax revenue in 2000 with annual increases of 4–6%.

Written before the September 11 attacks and during political debates of the Iraq War, a section of &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; titled &quot;Creating Tomorrow&#x27;s Dominant Force&quot; became the subject of considerable controversy: &quot;Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot; Journalist John Pilger pointed to this passage when he argued that the Bush administration had used the events of September 11 as an opportunity to capitalize on long-desired plans.

Some critics went further, asserting that &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; should be viewed as a program for global American hegemony. Writing in Der Spiegel in 2003, Jochen Bölsche claimed that &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; &quot;had been developed by PNAC for Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, and Libby&quot; and was &quot;devoted to matters of &#x27;maintaining US pre-eminence, thwarting rival powers and shaping the global security system according to US interests&#x27;&quot;. British MP Michael Meacher made similar allegations in 2003, stating that the document was &quot;a blueprint for the creation of a global Pax Americana&quot;, which had been &quot;drawn up for&quot; key members of the Bush administration. Academic Peter Dale Scott subsequently wrote&quot;[PNAC&#x27;s] ideology was summarized in a major position paper, &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot;, in 2000. This document advocated a global Pax Americana unrestrained by international law ...&quot;

Other academics, such as Donald E. Abelson and Phillip Hammond, have suggested that many of these criticisms were overblown, while noting that similar statements about PNAC&#x27;s origins, goals, and influence &quot;continue to make their way into the academic literature on the neo-conservative network in the United States&quot;. Hammond, for example, notes that though &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot; &quot;is often cited as evidence that a blueprint for American domination of the world was implemented under cover of the war on terrorism&quot;, it was actually &quot;unexceptional&quot;. According to Hammond, the report&#x27;s recommendations were &quot;exactly what one would generally expect neoconservatives to say, and it is no great revelation that they said it in publicly available documents prior to September 2001&quot;. Similarly, Abelson has written that &quot;evaluating the extent of PNAC&#x27;s influence is not as straightforward&quot; as Meacher and others maintain&quot; as &quot;we know very little about the inner workings of this think tank and whether it has lived up to its billing as the architect of Bush&#x27;s foreign policy&quot;.

===Focus on military strategies, versus diplomatic strategies===
PNAC fellow Reuel Marc Gerecht stated: &quot;We have no choice but to re-instill in our foes and friends the fear that attaches to any great power. ... Only a war against Saddam Hussein will decisively restore the awe that protects American interests abroad and citizens at home&quot;.

Professor Emeritus Jeffrey Record of the Strategic Studies Institute, in his monograph, &quot;Bounding the Global War on Terrorism&quot; and William Rivers Pitt, in &quot;Truthout&quot; argued that PNAC&#x27;s goals of military hegemony were overly ambitious given what the military can accomplish, that they failed to recognize &quot;the limits of US power&quot;, and that favoring the pre-emptive exercise of military force instead of diplomacy could have &quot;adverse side effects.&quot; Paul Reynolds made similar observations.

==End of the organization==
By the end of 2006, PNAC was &quot;reduced to a voice-mail box and a ghostly website [with a] single employee ... left to wrap things up&quot;, according to a correspondent at the BBC News. In 2006 former executive director of the PNAC Gary Schmitt said PNAC had never been intended to &quot;go on forever&quot;, and had &quot;already done its job&quot;, suggesting that &quot;our view has been adopted&quot;. In 2009 Robert Kagan and William Kristol created a new think tank, the Foreign Policy Initiative, which scholars Stephen M. Walt and Don Abelson have characterized as a successor to PNAC. From September 5, 2018, till January 13, 2019, the PNAC homepage went back online without any further explanation.

<text>The Victory ship was a class of cargo ship produced in large numbers by American shipyards during World War II to replace losses caused by German submarines. They were a more modern design compared to the earlier Liberty ship, were slightly larger and had more powerful steam turbine engines, giving higher speed to allow participation in high-speed convoys and make them more difficult targets for German U-boats. A total of 531 Victory ships were built in between 1944 and 1946.

== VC2 design ==

One of the first acts of the United States War Shipping Administration upon its formation in February 1942 was to commission the design of what came to be known as the Victory class. Initially designated EC2-S-AP1, where EC2 = Emergency Cargo, type 2 (Load Waterline Length between ), S = steam propulsion with AP1 = one aft propeller (EC2-S-C1 had been the designation of the Liberty ship design), it was changed to VC2-S-AP1 before the name &quot;Victory Ship&quot; was officially adopted on 28 April 1943. The ships were built under the Emergency Shipbuilding program.

The design was an enhancement of the Liberty ship, which had been successfully produced in extraordinary numbers. Victory ships were slightly larger than Liberty ships, longer at , wider at , and drawing one foot more at loaded. Displacement was up just under 1,000 tons, to 15,200. With a raised forecastle and a more sophisticated hull shape to help achieve the higher speed, they had a quite different appearance from Liberty ships.

To make them less vulnerable to U-boat attacks, Victory ships made , faster than the Libertys, and had longer range. The extra speed was achieved through more modern, efficient engines. Rather than the Libertys&#x27; triple expansion steam engines, Victory ships were designed to use either Lentz type reciprocating steam engines (one ship only, oil fired), Diesel engines (one ship) or steam turbines (the rest, all oil fired) (variously putting out between ). Another improvement was electrically powered auxiliary equipment, rather than steam-driven machinery.

To prevent the hull cracks that many Liberty ships developed—making some break in half—the spacing between frames was widened from to , making the ships less stiff and more able to flex. Like Liberty ships, the hull was welded rather than riveted.

The VC2-S-AP2, VC2-S-AP3, and VC2-M-AP4 were armed with a /38 caliber stern gun for use against submarines and surface ships, and a bow-mounted /50 caliber gun and eight 20 mm cannon for use against aircraft. These were manned by United States Navy Armed Guard personnel. The VC2-S-AP5 s were armed with the 5-inch stern gun, one quad 40 mm Bofors cannon, four dual 40 mm Bofors cannon, and ten single 20 mm cannon. The &quot;Haskell&quot;s were operated and crewed exclusively by U.S. Navy personnel.

The Victory ship was noted for good proportion of cubic between holds for a cargo ship of its day. A Victory ship&#x27;s cargo hold one, two and five hatches are single rigged with a capacity of 70,400, 76,700, and 69,500 bale cubic feet respectively. Victory ships hold three and four hatches are double rigged with a capacity of 136,100 and 100,300 bale cubic feet respectively.
Victory ships have built-in mast, booms and derrick cranes and can load and unload their own cargo without dock side cranes or gantry if needed.

== Construction ==
The first vessel was launched at Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation on 12 January 1944 and completed on 28 February 1944, making her maiden voyage a month later. American vessels frequently had a name incorporating the word &quot;Victory&quot;. After &quot;United Victory&quot;, the next 34 vessels were named after allied countries, the following 218 after American cities, the next 150 after educational institutions and the remainder given miscellaneous names. The AP5 type attack transports were named after United States counties, without &quot;Victory&quot; in their name, with the exception of , which was named after President Roosevelt&#x27;s late personal secretary.

Although initial deliveries were slow—only 15 had been delivered by May 1944—by the end of the war 531 had been constructed. The Commission cancelled orders for a further 132 vessels, although three were completed in 1946 for the Alcoa Steamship Company, making a total built in the United States of 534, made up of:



Of the wartime construction, 414 were of the standard cargo variant and 117 were attack transports. Because the Atlantic battle had been won by the time the first of the Victory ships appeared none were sunk by U-boats. Three were sunk by Japanese kamikaze attack in April 1945.

Many Victory ships were converted to troopships to bring US soldiers home at the end of World War II as part of Operation Magic Carpet. A total of 97 Victory ships were converted to carry up to 1,600 soldiers. To convert the ships the cargo holds were converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. Mess halls and exercise places were also added. Some examples of Victory troopship are: , , , , , , , , and .

Some 184 Victory ships served in the Korean War and a 100 Victory ships served in the Vietnam War. Many were sold and became commercial cargo ships and a few commercial passenger ships. Some were laid up in the United States Navy reserve fleets and then scrapped or reused. Many saw postwar conversion and various uses for years afterward. The single VC2-M-AP4 Diesel-powered MV &quot;Emory Victory&quot; operated in Alaskan waters for the Bureau of Indian Affairs as &quot;North Star III&quot;. AP3 types &quot;South Bend Victory&quot; and &quot;Tuskegee Victory&quot; were converted in 1957–58 to ocean hydrographic surveying ships USNS and , respectively. &quot;Dutton&quot; aided in locating the lost hydrogen bomb following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash.

Starting in 1959, several were removed from the reserve fleet and refitted for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. One such ship was , which was renamed and converted into the world&#x27;s first satellite communications ship. Another was the former &quot;Haiti Victory&quot;, which recovered the first man-made object to return from orbit, the nose cone of Discoverer 13, on 11 August 1960. was converted in 1969–1970 to the range instrumentation ship for downrange tracking of ballistic missile tests.

Four Victory ships became fleet ballistic missile cargo ships transporting torpedoes, Poseidon missiles, packaged petroleum, and spare parts to deployed submarine tenders:

* , built as

In the 1960s two Victory ships were reactivated and converted to technical research ships by the U.S. Navy with the hull type AGTR. became and SS &quot;Simmons Victory&quot; became . &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked and severely damaged by Israeli forces in June 1967 and subsequently decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register. &quot;Belmont&quot; was decommissioned and stricken in 1970. &quot;Baton Rouge Victory&quot; was sunk in the Mekong delta by a Viet Cong mine in August 1966 and temporarily blocked the channel to Saigon.

=== Cost ===
According to the War Production Board minutes in 1943, the Victory Ship had a relative cost of $238 per deadweight ton (10,500 deadweight tonnage) for $2,522,800, .

=== Shipyards ===
Most Victory ships were constructed in six West Coast and one Baltimore emergency shipyards that were set up in World War II to build Liberty, Victory, and other ships. The Victory ship was designed to be able to be assembled by the smallest capacity crane at these shipyards.

<text>Liberty ships were a class of cargo ship built in the United States during World War II under the Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Although British in concept, the design was adopted by the United States for its simple, low-cost construction. Mass-produced on an unprecedented scale, the Liberty ship came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output.

The class was developed to meet British orders for transports to replace ships that had been lost. Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945 (an average of three ships every two days), easily the largest number of ships ever produced to a single design.

Their production mirrored (albeit on a much larger scale) the manufacture of &quot;Hog Islander&quot; and similar standardized ship types during World War I. The immensity of the effort, the number of ships built, the role of female workers in their construction, and the survival of some far longer than their original five-year design life combine to make them the subject of much continued interest.

==History==

===Design===
In 1936, the American Merchant Marine Act was passed to subsidize the annual construction of 50 commercial merchant vessels which could be used in wartime by the United States Navy as naval auxiliaries, crewed by U.S. Merchant Mariners. The number was doubled in 1939 and again in 1940 to 200 ships a year. Ship types included two tankers and three types of merchant vessel, all to be powered by steam turbines. Limited industrial capacity, especially for reduction gears, meant that relatively few of these designs of ships were built.

However, in 1940, the British government ordered 60 Ocean-class freighters from American yards to replace war losses and boost the merchant fleet. These were simple but fairly large (for the time) with a single compound steam engine of outdated but reliable design. Britain specified coal-fired plants, because it then had extensive coal mines and no significant domestic oil production.

The predecessor designs, which included the &quot;Northeast Coast, Open Shelter Deck Steamer&quot;, were based on a simple ship originally produced in Sunderland by J.L. Thompson &amp; Sons based on a 1939 design for a simple tramp steamer, which was cheap to build and cheap to run (see Silver Line). Examples include SS &quot;Dorington Court&quot; built in 1939. The order specified an increase in draft to boost displacement by to . The accommodation, bridge, and main engine were located amidships, with a tunnel connecting the main engine shaft to the propeller via a long aft extension. The first Ocean-class ship, SS &quot;Ocean Vanguard&quot;, was launched on 16 August 1941.
The design was modified by the United States Maritime Commission, in part to increase conformity to American construction practices, but more importantly to make it even quicker and cheaper to build. The US version was designated &#x27;EC2-S-C1&#x27;: &#x27;EC&#x27; for Emergency Cargo, &#x27;2&#x27; for a ship between long (Load Waterline Length), &#x27;S&#x27; for steam engines, and &#x27;C1&#x27; for design C1. The new design replaced much riveting, which accounted for one-third of the labor costs, with welding, and had oil-fired boilers. It was adopted as a Merchant Marine Act design, and production awarded to a conglomerate of West Coast engineering and construction companies headed by Henry J. Kaiser known as the Six Companies. Liberty ships were designed to carry of cargo, usually one type per ship, but, during wartime, generally carried loads far exceeding this.

On 27 March 1941, the number of lend-lease ships was increased to 200 by the Defense Aid Supplemental Appropriations Act and increased again in April to 306, of which 117 would be Liberty ships.

===Variants===
The basic EC2-S-C1 cargo design was modified during construction into three major variants with the same basic dimensions and slight variance in tonnage. One variant, with basically the same features but different type numbers, had four rather than five holds served by large hatches and kingpost with large capacity booms. Those four hold ships were designated for transport of tanks and boxed aircraft.

In the detailed Federal Register publication of the post war prices of Maritime Commission types the Liberty variants are noted as:
; EC2-S-AW1
: Collier (All given names of coal seams as &quot;SS Banner Seam&quot;, &quot;Beckley Seam&quot; and &quot;Bon Air Seam&quot;)
;Z-EC2-S-C2
: Tank carrier (four holds, kingposts) – example 
;Z-ET1-S-C3
: T1 tanker – example SS &quot;Carl R. Gray&quot;. Eighteen were commissioned into USN in 1943 as the 
;Z-EC2-S-C5
: Boxed aircraft transport (four holds, kingposts) – example . Post war 16 of these Liberty ships were converted 1954–1958 into 

In preparation for the Normandy landings and afterward to support the rapid expansion of logistical transport ashore a modification was made to make standard Liberty vessels more suitable for mass transport of vehicles and in records are seen as &quot;MT&quot; for Motor Transport vessels. As MTs four holds were loaded with vehicles while the fifth was modified to house the drivers and assistants.

The modifications into troop transports also were not given special type designations.

===Propulsion===
By 1941, the steam turbine was the preferred marine steam engine because of its greater efficiency compared to earlier reciprocating compound steam engines. Steam turbine engines however, required very precise manufacturing techniques to machine their complicated double helical reduction gears, and the companies capable of producing them were already committed to the large construction program for warships. Therefore, a vertical triple expansion steam engine, of obsolete design, was selected to power Liberty ships because it was cheaper and easier to build in the numbers required for the Liberty ship program, and because more companies could manufacture it. Eighteen different companies eventually built the engine. It had the additional advantage of ruggedness, simplicity and familiarity to seamen. Parts manufactured by one company were interchangeable with those made by another, and the openness of its design made most of its moving parts easy to see, access, and oil. The engine— long and tall—was designed to operate at 76 rpm and propel a Liberty ship at about .

===Construction===
The ships were constructed of sections that were welded together. This is similar to the technique used by Palmer&#x27;s at Jarrow, northeast England, but substituted welding for riveting. Riveted ships took several months to construct. The work force was newly trained as the yards responsible had not previously built welded ships. As America entered the war, the shipbuilding yards employed women, to replace men who were enlisting in the armed forces.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The ships initially had a poor public image owing to their appearance. In a speech announcing the emergency shipbuilding program President Franklin D. Roosevelt had referred to the ship as &quot;a dreadful looking object&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; called it an &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;. 27 September 1941 was dubbed Liberty Fleet Day to try to assuage public opinion, since the first 14 &quot;Emergency&quot; vessels were launched that day. The first of these was , launched by President Roosevelt. In remarks at the launch ceremony FDR cited Patrick Henry&#x27;s 1775 speech that finished &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot;. Roosevelt said that this new class of ship would bring liberty to Europe, which gave rise to the name Liberty ship.

The first ships required about 230 days to build (&quot;Patrick Henry&quot; took 244 days), but the median production time per ship dropped to 39 days by 1943. The record was set by , which was launched 4 days and 15 hours after the keel had been laid, although this publicity stunt was not repeated: in fact much fitting-out and other work remained to be done after the &quot;Peary&quot; was launched. The ships were made assembly-line style, from prefabricated sections. In 1943 three Liberty ships were completed daily. They were usually named after famous Americans, starting with the signatories of the Declaration of Independence. 17 of the Liberty ships were named in honor of outstanding African-Americans. The first, in honor of Booker T. Washington, was christened by Marian Anderson in 1942, and the , recognizing the only woman on the list, was christened on 3 June 1944.

Any group that raised war bonds worth $2 million could propose a name. Most bore the names of deceased people. The only living namesake was Francis J. O&#x27;Gara, the purser of , who was thought to have been killed in a submarine attack, but in fact survived the war in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Not named after people were: , named after the USO club in New York; and , named after the United Service Organizations (USO).

Another notable Liberty ship was , which sank the German commerce raider in a ship-to-ship gun battle in 1942 and became the first American ship to sink a German surface combatant.

The wreck of lies off the coast of Kent with of explosives still on board, enough to match a very small yield nuclear weapon should they ever go off. detonated with the energy of in July 1944 as it was being loaded, killing 320 sailors and civilians in what was called the Port Chicago disaster. Another Liberty ship that exploded was the rechristened , which caused the Texas City Disaster on 16 April 1947, killing at least 581 people.

Six Liberty ships were converted at Point Clear, Alabama, by the United States Army Air Force, into floating aircraft repair depots, operated by the Army Transport Service, starting in April 1944. The secret project, dubbed &quot;Project Ivory Soap&quot;, provided mobile depot support for B-29 Superfortress bombers and P-51 Mustang fighters based on Guam, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa beginning in December 1944. The six ARU(F)s (Aircraft Repair Unit, Floating), however, were also fitted with landing platforms to accommodate four Sikorsky R-4 helicopters, where they provided medical evacuation of combat casualties in both the Philippine Islands and Okinawa.

The last new-build Liberty ship constructed was , launched on 26 September 1945 and delivered on 30 October 1945. She was named after the chief engineer of a United States Army freighter who had stayed below decks to shut down his engines after a 13 April 1945 explosion, an act that won him a posthumous Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal. In 1950, a &quot;new&quot; liberty ship was constructed by Industriale Maritime SpA, Genoa, Italy by using the bow section of and the stern section of , both of which had been wrecked. The new ship was named , and served until scrapped in 1962.

Several designs of mass-produced petroleum tanker were also produced, the most numerous being the T2 tanker series, with about 490 built between 1942 and the end of 1945.

===Problems===
====Hull cracks====

Early Liberty ships suffered hull and deck cracks, and a few were lost due to such structural defects. During World War II there were nearly 1,500 instances of significant brittle fractures. Twelve ships, including three of the 2,710 Liberty ships built, broke in half without warning, including , which sank on 24 November 1943 with the loss of 10 lives. Suspicion fell on the shipyards, which had often used inexperienced workers and new welding techniques to produce large numbers of ships in great haste.

The Ministry of War Transport borrowed the British-built for testing purposes. Constance Tipper of Cambridge University demonstrated that the fractures did not start in the welds, but were due to the embrittlement of the steel used. When used in riveted construction, however, the same steel did not have this problem. Tipper discovered that at a certain temperature, the steel the ships were made of changed from being ductile to brittle, allowing cracks to form and propagate. This temperature is known as the critical ductile-brittle transition temperature. Ships in the North Atlantic were exposed to temperatures that could fall below this critical point. The predominantly welded hull construction, effectively a continuous sheet of steel, allowed small cracks to propagate unimpeded, unlike in a hull made of separate plates riveted together. One common type of crack nucleated at the square corner of a hatch which coincided with a welded seam, both the corner and the weld acting as stress concentrators. Furthermore, the ships were frequently grossly overloaded, greatly increasing stress, and some of the structural problems occurred during or after severe storms that would have further increased stress. Minor revisions to the hatches and various reinforcements were applied to the Liberty ships to arrest the cracking problem. These are some of the first structural tests that gave birth to the study of materials. The successor Victory ships used the same steel, also welded rather than riveted, but spacing between frames was widened from to , making the ships less stiff and more able to flex.

==== Consequences and results ====
The sinking of the Liberty ships led to a new way of thinking about ship design and manufacturing. Ships today avoid the use of rectangular corners to avoid stress concentration. New types of steel were developed that have higher fracture toughness, especially at lower temperatures. In addition, more talented and educated welders can produce welds without, or at least with fewer, flaws. While the context and time in which Liberty ships were constructed resulted in many failures, the lessons learned led to new innovations that allow for more efficient and safer shipbuilding today.

== Service ==

===Use as troopships===

In September 1943 strategic plans and shortage of more suitable hulls required that Liberty ships be pressed into emergency use as troop transports with about 225 eventually converted for this purpose. The first general conversions were hastily undertaken by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) so that the ships could join convoys on the way to North Africa for Operation Torch. Even earlier the Southwest Pacific Area command&#x27;s U.S. Army Services of Supply had converted at least one, , in Australia into an assault troop carrier with landing craft (LCIs and LCVs) and troops with the ship being reconverted for cargo after the Navy was given exclusive responsibility for amphibious assault operations. Others in the Southwest Pacific were turned into makeshift troop transports for New Guinea operations by installing field kitchens on deck, latrines aft between #4 and #5 hatches flushed by hoses attached to fire hydrants and about 900 troops sleeping on deck or in &#x27;tween deck spaces. While most of the Liberty ships converted were intended to carry no more than 550 troops, thirty-three were converted to transport 1,600 on shorter voyages from mainland U.S. ports to Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean.

The problem of hull cracks caused concern with the United States Coast Guard, which recommended that Liberty ships be withdrawn from troop carrying in February 1944 although military commitments required their continued use. The more direct problem was the general unsuitability of the ships as troop transports, particularly with the hasty conversions in 1943, that generated considerable complaints regarding poor mess, food and water storage, sanitation, heating / ventilation and a lack of medical facilities. After the Allied victory in North Africa, about 250 Liberty ships were engaged in transporting prisoners of war to the United States. By November 1943 the Army&#x27;s Chief of Transportation, Maj. Gen. Charles P. Gross, and WSA, whose agents operated the ships, reached agreement on improvements, but operational requirements forced an increase of the maximum number of troops transported in a Liberty from 350 to 500. The increase in production of more suitable vessels did allow for returning the hastily converted Liberty ships to cargo-only operations by May 1944. Despite complaints, reservations, Navy requesting its personnel not travel aboard Liberty troopers and even Senate comment, the military necessities required use of the ships. The number of troops was increased to 550 on 200 Liberty ships for redeployment to the Pacific. The need for the troopship conversions persisted into the immediate postwar period in order to return troops from overseas as quickly as possible.

===Combat===

On 27 September 1942 the was the only US merchant ship to sink a German surface combatant during the war. Ordered to stop, &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; refused to surrender, so the heavily armed German commerce raider and her tender with one machine gun opened fire. Although greatly outgunned, the crew of &quot;Stephen Hopkins&quot; fought back, replacing the Armed Guard crew of the ship&#x27;s single gun with volunteers as they fell. The fight was short, and both ships were wrecks.

On 10 March 1943 became the only ship to survive an attack by the . The following year from 22 to 30 January 1944, &quot;Lawton B. Evans&quot; was involved in the Battle of Anzio in Italy. It was under repeated bombardment from shore batteries and aircraft for eight days. It endured a prolonged barrage of shelling, machine-gun fire and bombs. The ship shot down five German planes.

===After the war===

More than 2,400 Liberty ships survived the war. Of these, 835 made up the postwar cargo fleet. Greek entrepreneurs bought 526 ships and Italians bought 98. Shipping magnates including John Fredriksen, John Theodoracopoulos, Aristotle Onassis, Stavros Niarchos, Stavros George Livanos, the Goulandris brothers, and the Andreadis, Tsavliris, Achille Lauro, Grimaldi and Bottiglieri families were known to have started their fleets by buying Liberty ships. Andrea Corrado, the dominant Italian shipping magnate at the time, and leader of the Italian shipping delegation, rebuilt his fleet under the programme. Weyerhaeuser operated a fleet of six Liberty Ships (which were later extensively refurbished and modernized) carrying lumber, newsprint, and general cargo for years after the end of the war.

Some Liberty ships were lost after the war to naval mines that were inadequately cleared. &quot;Pierre Gibault&quot; was scrapped after hitting a mine in a previously cleared area off the Greek island of Kythira in June 1945, and the same month saw &quot;Colin P. Kelly Jnr&quot; take mortal damage from a mine hit off the Belgian port of Ostend. In August 1945, &quot;William J. Palmer&quot; was carrying horses from New York to Trieste when she rolled over and sank 15 minutes after hitting a mine a few miles from destination. All crew members, and six horses were saved. &quot;Nathaniel Bacon&quot; ran into a minefield off Civitavecchia, Italy in December 1945, caught fire, was beached, and broke in two; the larger section was welded onto another Liberty half hull to make a new ship 30 feet longer, named &quot;Boccadasse&quot;.

As late as December 1947, &quot;Robert Dale Owen&quot;, renamed &quot;Kalliopi&quot; and sailing under the Greek flag, broke in three and sank in the northern Adriatic Sea after hitting a mine. Other Liberty ships lost to mines after the end of the war include &quot;John Woolman&quot;, &quot;Calvin Coolidge&quot;, &quot;Cyrus Adler&quot;, and &quot;Lord Delaware&quot;.

On April 16, 1947, a Liberty ship owned by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique called the &quot;Grandcamp&quot; (originally built as the SS Benjamin R. Curtis) docked in Texas City, Texas to load a cargo of 2,300 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. A fire broke out on board which eventually caused the entire ammonium nitrate cargo to explode. The massive explosion levelled Texas City and caused fires which detonated more ammonium nitrate in a nearby ship and warehouse. It was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in US history. This incident is known as the Texas City disaster today.
On December 21, 1952, the SS &quot;Quartette&quot;, a Liberty Ship of 7,198 gross register tons, struck the eastern reef of the Pearl and Hermes atoll at a speed of . The ship was driven further onto the reef by rough waves and winds, which collapsed the forward bow and damaged two forward holds. The crew was evacuated by the SS &quot;Frontenac Victory&quot; the following day. The salvage tug &quot;Ono&quot; arrived on December 25 to attempt to tow the ship clear, but persistent stormy weather forced a delay of the rescue attempt. On January 3, before another rescue attempt could be made, the ship&#x27;s anchors tore loose and the &quot;Quartette&quot; was blown onto the reef, and deemed a total loss. Several weeks later, it snapped in half at the keel and the two pieces sank. The wreck site now serves as an artificial reef which provides a habitat for many fish species.

In 1953, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), began storing surplus grain in Liberty ships located in the Hudson River, James River, Olympia, and Astoria National Defense Reserve Fleets. In 1955, 22 ships in the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet were withdrawn to be loaded with grain and were then transferred to the Olympia Fleet. In 1956, four ships were withdrawn from the Wilmington Fleet and transferred, loaded with grain, to the Hudson River Fleet.

Between 1955 and 1959, 16 former Liberty ships were repurchased by the United States Navy and converted to the s for the Atlantic and Pacific Barrier.

In the 1960s, three Liberty ships and two Victory ships were reactivated and converted to technical research ships with the hull classification symbol AGTR (auxiliary, technical research) and used to gather electronic intelligence and for radar picket duties by the United States Navy. The Liberty ships SS &quot;Samuel R. Aitken&quot; became , SS &quot;Robert W. Hart&quot; became , SS &quot;J. Howland Gardner&quot; became with the Victory ships being which became and becoming . All of these ships were decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1969 and 1970.


From 1946 to 1963, the Pacific Ready Reserve Fleet – Columbia River Group, retained as many as 500 Liberty ships.

In 1946, Liberty ships were mothballed in the Hudson River Reserve Fleet near Tarrytown, New York. At its peak in 1965, 189 hulls were stored there. The last two were sold for scrap to Spain in 1971 and the reserve permanently shut down.
Only two operational Liberty ships, and , remain. &quot;John W. Brown&quot; has had a long career as a school ship and many internal modifications, while &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; remains largely in her original condition. Both are museum ships that still put out to sea regularly. In 1994, &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; steamed from San Francisco to England and France for the 50th anniversary of D-Day, the only large ship from the original Operation Overlord fleet to participate in the anniversary. In 2008, , a ship converted in 1944 into a pipe transport to support Operation Pluto, was transferred to Greece and converted to a floating museum dedicated to the history of the Greek merchant marine; although missing major components were restored this ship is no longer operational.

Liberty ships continue to serve in a &quot;less than whole&quot; function many decades after their launching. In Portland, Oregon, the hulls of &quot;Richard Henry Dana&quot; and &quot;Jane Addams&quot; serve as the basis of floating docks. survives as the &quot;Star of Kodiak&quot;, a landlocked cannery, in Kodiak Harbor at .

 was converted into &quot;MH-1A&quot; (otherwise known as USS &quot;Sturgis&quot;). &quot;MH-1A&quot; was a floating nuclear power plant and the first ever built. &quot;MH-1A&quot; was used to generate electricity at the Panama Canal Zone from 1968 to 1975. She was also used as a fresh water generating plant. She is anchored in the James River Reserve Fleet. The ship was dismantled in 2019 in Brownsville, Texas.

Fifty-eight Liberty ships were lengthened by starting in 1958, giving them additional carrying capacity at a small additional cost. The bridges of most of these were also enclosed in the mid-1960s in accordance with a design by naval architect Ion Livas.

In the 1950s, the Maritime Administration instituted the Liberty Ship Conversion and Engine Improvement Program, which had a goal to increase the speed of Liberty ships to , making them competitive with more modern designs, as well as gaining experience with alternate propulsion systems. Four ships were converted in the $11 million program. SS &quot;Benjamin Chew&quot; had its existing condensers modified and a new superheater and geared turbine installed to give the ship 6,000 shp, up from 2,500. SS &quot;Thomas Nelson&quot; had its bow lengthened, diesel engines installed in place of the original steam engine, and movable cranes outfitted in place of the original cargo handling gear. The GTS (Gas Turbine Ship) &quot;John Sergeant&quot; had its bow extended, and its steam engine replaced with a General Electric gas turbine of 6,600 shp, connected to a reversible pitch propeller via reduction gearing. &quot;John Sergeant&quot; was considered overall to be a success, but problems with the reversible pitch propeller ended its trial after three years. GTS &quot;William Patterson&quot; had its bow extended and its steam engine replaced with 6 General Electric GE-14 free-piston gas generators, connected to two reversible turbines and capable of 6,000 shp total. &quot;William Patterson&quot; was considered to be a failure as reliability was poor and the scalability of the design was poor. All four vessels were fueled with Bunker C fuel oil, though &quot;John Sergeant&quot; required a quality of fuel available at limited ports and also required further treatment to reduce contaminants. Three were scrapped in 1971 or 1972 and the diesel-equipped &quot;Thomas Nelson&quot; was scrapped in 1981.

In 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp featuring the Liberty ship as part of a set on the U.S. Merchant Marine.

<text>Aušra Augustinavičiūtė (April 4, 1927 – August 19, 2005) was a Lithuanian psychologist, economist and dean of the Vilnius Pedagogical University&#x27;s department of family science. Founder of socionics, the theory of information processing and personality types.

Augustinavičiūtė was born not far from the city of Kaunas, in Lithuania. In 1956 she graduated from the economic faculty of Vilnius University as a financier. She worked at the Ministry of Finance of Lithuania and later as a teacher of political economics and sociology in different educational institutions in Vilnius.

Her works on socionics, with the exception of few, were not published during the period of Soviet power, but became more and more popular during the 1990s. The current structure of her theory was standardized by Alexander Bukalov, Victor Gulenko, and Gregory Reinin after the founding of the International Institute of Socionics in Kyiv, Ukraine.

The non-governmental organization Russian Academy of Natural Sciences recognized socionics as a discovery and awarded Augustinavičiūtė a diploma and the Pyotr Kapitsa medal in 1995 (not to be confused with the Kapitsa Gold Medal awarded by the Russian Academy of Sciences).

<text>In crystallography, the tetragonal crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems. Tetragonal crystal lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along one of its lattice vectors, so that the cube becomes a rectangular prism with a square base (&quot;a&quot; by &quot;a&quot;) and height (&quot;c&quot;, which is different from &quot;a&quot;).

== Bravais lattices ==
There are two tetragonal Bravais lattices: the primitive tetragonal and the body-centered tetragonal.

The body-centered tetragonal lattice is equivalent to the primitive tetragonal lattice with a smaller unit cell, while the face-centered tetragonal lattice is equivalent to the body-centered tetragonal lattice with a smaller unit cell.

==Crystal classes==

The point groups that fall under this crystal system are listed below, followed by their representations in international notation, Schoenflies notation, orbifold notation, Coxeter notation and mineral examples.

== In two dimensions ==

There is only one tetragonal Bravais lattice in two dimensions: the square lattice.

<doc id="198206" wikidata="Q1987739" url="?curid=198206" title="Herman Dooyeweerd">
<text>Herman Dooyeweerd, also spelled Herman Dooijeweerd (7 October 1894, Amsterdam – 12 February 1977, Amsterdam), was a professor of law and jurisprudence at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam from 1926 to 1965. He was also a philosopher and principal founder of Reformational philosophy with Dirk Vollenhoven, a significant development within the Neo-Calvinist (or Kuyperian) school of thought. Dooyeweerd made several contributions to philosophy and other academic disciplines concerning the nature of diversity and coherence in everyday experience, the transcendental conditions for theoretical thought, the relationship between religion, philosophy, and scientific theory, and an understanding of meaning, being, time and self.

Dooyeweerd is most famous for his suite of fifteen aspects (or &#x27;modalities&#x27;, &#x27;modal aspects&#x27;, or &#x27;modal law-spheres&#x27;), which are distinct ways in which reality exists, has meaning, is experienced, and occurs. This suite of aspects is finding application in practical analysis, research and teaching in such diverse fields as built environment, sustainability, agriculture, business, information systems and development. Danie Strauss, the editor of Dooyeweerd&#x27;s Collected Works, has provided a systematic look at Dooyeweerd&#x27;s philosophy here.

==Dooyeweerd’s critiques of philosophy==
Dooyeweerd made both immanent and transcendental critiques of Western philosophy, following the traditions of Continental philosophy.

In his immanent critique, he sought to understand each philosophic thinker&#x27;s work or each tradition from the inside, and uncover, in its own terms, its basic presuppositions, to reveal deep problems. By such immanent critique of philosophic thinkers from the pre-Socratic Greeks onwards through to the middle of the twentieth century (including mediaeval period, into the modern periods), Dooyeweerd claimed to have demonstrated that theoretical thinking has always been based on presuppositions of a religious nature, which he called &quot;ground motives&quot;. A ground motive is a spiritual driving force that impels each thinker to interpret reality under its influence. Dooyeweerd identified four major ground-motives of Western thought, three of them dualistic in nature:
# the Form-Matter divide of Greek thought
# the Creation-Fall-Redemption motive of Biblical (Hebrew, Semitic) thought
# the Nature-Grace divide of mediaeval, Scholastic thought
# the Nature-Freedom divide of humanistic, Enlightenment thought

This means that theoretical thought &quot;has never been&quot; neutral or autonomous of the thinker.

However, Dooyeweerd remained unsatisfied &quot;with an argument that shows that in fact philosophy always has been influenced by religious convictions&quot;. Rather, he &quot;wants to show that it cannot be otherwise, because it is part of the nature of philosophy or theoretical thought.&quot;

This led Dooyeweerd to undertake a transcendental critique of theoretical thought, of the kind Immanuel Kant pioneered. Whereas Kant and Husserl sought the conditions that make theoretical &quot;thinking&quot; possible, they still presupposed that a theoretical &quot;attitude&quot; is possible. Dooyeweerd sought to understand the conditions that make a &quot;theoretical attitude&quot; possible, and argued that all theoretical thought takes place with reference to an &quot;Origin of Meaning&quot;, which is a ground-motive to which we adhere extra-rationally. This means that theoretical thought &quot;never can be&quot; neutral or autonomous of the thinker.

From this, Dooyeweerd argued that all &quot;good&quot; philosophy addresses three fundamental parts to an idea: 
# world
# coherence of rationalities
# origin of meaning

This, he proposed, can enable disparate theoretical and philosophical approaches to enter into discourse with each other, as long as each thinker openly admits their own ground-motive. Dooyeweerd, accordingly, made very explicit his own grounding in Creation-Fall-Redemption, with a Neo-Calvinist flavour and a debt to Abraham Kuyper.

==Dooyeweerd&#x27;s cosmonomic philosophy==
Dooyeweerd&#x27;s cosmonomic philosophy is different from most extant philosophy in at least three ways, which intertwine:

First, it takes seriously the pre-theoretical attitude of thought, as a starting point from which to begin to understand what makes theoretical thought possible. Most other philosophical thinking begins by presupposing a theoretical attitude and either ignores everyday experience or attempts to explain it theoretically, either way presupposing the possibility of theoretical thought as a way to knowledge. In making the possibility of theoretical thought a philosophical problem to address, Dooyeweerd went deeper and further than Kant, Husserl and Heidegger and others.(too rhetorical of a statement)

Second, it is rooted in different presuppositions (&#x27;ground motives&#x27;) about the nature of reality, which are religious in nature. Whereas Greek philosophy is rooted in the Form/Matter divide, Scholastic thinking of medieval Christianity in the Nature/Grace divide, and Humanistic philosophy in the Nature/Freedom divide, Dooyeweerd began from the Biblical idea of Creation Fall and Redemption. He may be said to have explored the philosophical (rather than theological) implications of this idea. He called his philosophy &#x27;Christian philosophy&#x27;, though what usually claims that label is of a Scholastic nature and very different.

Third, it posits that &quot;Meaning&quot; is more fundamental than Being or Process. Dooyeweerd expressed it:
Meaningfulness originates from the Creator (God) rather than from sovereign human attribution. All things, not just those linked with humanity, are meaningful. Strictly, Dooyeweerd says, things &quot;are&quot;, rather than &quot;have&quot;, Meaning. Thus, Meaning is like an ocean in which we swim, an enabler of all our existence and functioning, rather than a property we attribute to things or words.

===Diversity of science===
This has implications for science. Science – whether mathematical, natural, human or social sciences - is seen as the abstracting of certain aspects for study. For example, even though a lawyer and a biologist might study the same things – for example, fingerprints – they are interested in different aspects. They are looking at the meaning of a thing with different focus, though equally concerned with what is real. Perceptions of reality through this kind of scientific attitude, selecting one aspect as distinct from others for study, will necessarily be governed by fundamental assumptions about how these various kinds of meaning are related to one another in a coherent whole, belonging within the total range of all experiences.

Likewise, in everyday life, we can be aware of distinct aspects, though most of the time we function in them tacitly.

===Aspects===
The positing of meaning as fundamental, and the priority given to our pre-theoretical experience of diverse meaning, prompts the thinker to ask, what ways are there of being meaningful, which cannot be reduced to each other? What different aspects are there of things? He delineated fifteen, which are not mere categories, but modalities (ways of being, functioning, etc.):
* Quantitative aspect: amount
* Spatial aspect: continuous extension
* Kinematic aspect: flowing movement
* Physical aspect: energy, matter
* Biotic/Organic aspect: life functions, self-maintenance
* Sensitive/Psychic aspect: feeling and response
* Analytical aspect: distinction, conceptualization
* Formative aspect: formative power, achievement, technology, technique
* Lingual aspect: symbolic communication
* Social aspect: social interaction
* Economic aspect: frugal use of resources
* Aesthetic aspect: harmony, surprise, fun
* Juridical aspect: due (rights, responsibility)
* Ethical aspect: self-giving love
* Pistic aspect: faith, vision, commitment, belief

Dooyeweerd claimed that since the discovery of these is addressed by our theoretical functioning, which is fallible, no suite of aspects, including his own, can &quot;lay claim to material completion&quot;.

===Implications of the aspects===
Briefly, aspects are ways of being meaningful and are the &#x27;law side&#x27; of created reality. All that occurs does so by &#x27;answering to&#x27; the laws of each aspect (i.e. being subject to their laws). e.g. physical waves or particles occur by the laws of the physical aspect, poetry occurs by the laws of the aesthetic aspect. Thus, each aspect or &#x27;law sphere&#x27; may be seen as defining a distinct kind of possibility.

Earlier aspects are determinative; later ones are normative. Human beings function as subject in or to all aspects, animals as subject up to the sensitive aspect, plants up to the biotic, and non-living things up to the physical. As you are reading this, you are functioning lingually by understanding it, analytically by conceptualizing, sensitively by seeing or hearing, etc. In fact, all our functioning is multi-aspectual, though some aspects might be latent.

Things exist by reference to each aspect. For example, a car exists physically as a load of steel, plastic, etc., kinematically as a mode of transport, socially as a status symbol, economically as a dent in our finances, aesthetically as a thing of beauty, biotically as a polluter, pistically as an idol, and so on. The being of things is multi-aspectual in principle.

Knowledge may be seen as multi-aspectual knowing. For example, analytical knowing gives categories and theories, formative knowing gives skills, lingual knowing gives &#x27;bodies of knowledge&#x27; as found in libraries, and so on.

Each aspect defines a different rationality. In this way, Dooyeweerd echoes Winch and Habermas, though with more precision.

== Works and legacy ==
Dooyeweerd attempted to provide a philosophy which accounted for not only the differences in non-human reality, but also, between one thinker and another. Following Abraham Kuyper, and other, earlier Neo-Calvinists, Dooyeweerd attempted to describe reality as a creation of God, which has its meaning from God. This God-given meaning is displayed in all of the aspects of temporal reality – which has implications for science.

For example, even though a lawyer and a biologist might study the same things – say, fingerprints – they are interested in different aspects. They are looking at the meaning of a thing with different focus, though equally concerned with what is real. Perceptions of reality through this kind of scientific attitude, selecting one aspect as distinct from others for study, will necessarily be governed by fundamental assumptions about how these various kinds of meaning are related to one another in a coherent whole, belonging within the total range of all experiences. Dooyeweerd argued that this showed the need for a consistent and radically Christian philosophy which he sought to provide. Furthermore, he attempted to show that even the imaginations of men are part of that same created reality, and even where misguided they cannot escape being subject to the rule of God exposed by the Christian revelation.

Dooyeweerd self-consciously allowed his Christian perspective to guide his understanding, but in a philosophical rather than a theological mode of thought. He believed that this permitted the philosopher to gain insight into the principle by which diversity of meaning is held together as a unity, as he directs his thought toward the origin of things, which is God, and God&#x27;s purpose for making things, which is found in Christ. This basic religious orientation should affect the way that the Christian understands things. In contrast to a dualistic type of religious ground motive, Dooyeweerd suggested that the Christian&#x27;s basic orientation to the world ought to be derived not from human speculation, but from God&#x27;s revealed purposes: Creation, the Fall into sin, and Redemption in Christ. This Christian &quot;religious ground motive&quot; is a fundamentally different posture toward things, compared to say, the &quot;Form/Matter&quot; scheme of the Greeks, the &quot;Nature/Grace&quot; synthesis of Medieval Christianity, or the &quot;Nature/Freedom&quot; approach of the Enlightenment, all of which are orientations divided against themselves by their reliance upon two contradictory principles. While the Christian religious view of things as Created, Fallen and being Redeemed has often been blended with speculative and dualistic schemes, it has never really become fully identified with them, so that there is historical continuity in Christian thought despite the fact that it has undergone numerous significant shifts, in Dooyeweerd&#x27;s view. But the fact that they are capable of being blended convincingly exposes the transcendental rules to which both false and true theories are subject.

A religious ground motive is a spiritual driving force that impels each thinker to interpret reality under its influence. Dooyeweerd wrote that, in the case of thinkers who presume that human thought is autonomous, who operate by the dictum that it does not matter whether God exists or not, such a thinker&#x27;s basic commitment to autonomous thought forces him to pick out some aspect of the creation as the origin of all meaning. In doing so, the supposedly autonomous thinker is made captive to a kind of idol of his own making, which bends his understanding to conform to its dictates, according to Dooyeweerd.

Although he self-consciously exposes the religious nature of his philosophy, Dooyeweerd suggests that in fact, all thought is inescapably religious in character. This religious stamp is disguised when the supposed origin of meaning, toward which various thinkers direct their thought, is not called God, but is rather said to be some aspect of creation. This, he suggests, explains why humanistic science will produce bitterly conflicting ideologies. It helps to locate the &quot;antithesis&quot;, the source of irreducible differences, between various perspectives. The &quot;antithesis&quot; must be accounted for as a foundational issue, in any complete philosophy, and this antithesis is religious in nature, according to Dooyeweerd.

Borrowing language and concepts from a wide variety of philosophical schools, especially Edmund Husserl, the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism, Ernst Cassirer&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Symbolic Forms&quot;—and, as some contend, Franz Xaver von Baader, Dooyeweerd builds on this foundation of a supposed &quot;antithesis&quot; to make distinctions between one kind of thinking and another, theorizing that diverse kinds of thinking disclose diverse kinds of meaning, and that this meaning corresponds in some way to the actual state of affairs.

Dooyeweerd developed an anti-reductionist ontology of &quot;modal aspects&quot;, concerning diverse kinds of meaning which are disclosed in the analysis of every existent thing. He considered such modes to be irreducible to each other and yet indissolubly linked. Dooyeweerd at first suggested that there were 14 modes but later postulated 15. The indissoluble coherence of these modal aspects is evinced through their analogical relationship to one another, and finally in their concentration in the central religious selfhood which has a direct relationship to its origin: God.

The majority of Dooyeweerd&#x27;s published articles and multi-volume works originally appeared only in Dutch. During his lifetime efforts were already underway to make his work available to English-speakers. Translation of Dooyeweerd&#x27;s writing has continued since 1994 under the oversight of the Dooyeweerd Centre (see link below). To date, thirteen books have been published in English, including his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;De Wijsbegeerte der Wetsidee&quot; (1935–1936), which was revised and expanded in English as &quot;A New Critique of Theoretical Thought&quot; (1953–1958).

Dooyeweerd&#x27;s influence has continued through the Association for Reformational Philosophy and its journal &quot;Philosophia Reformata&quot; which he and Vollenhoven founded in 1932. The title of the journal is something of an arcane philosophical joke, which repristinates and shifts the meaning of the title from a 1622 book, authored by Johann Daniel Mylius, &quot;Philosophia Reformata&quot;, a compendium of alchemy, then regarded by some as a science. There are also a number of institutions around the world that draw their inspiration from Dooyeweerd&#x27;s philosophy. (such as? - name at least some)

Dooyeweerd became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948.

In a commemoration editorial appearing in the newspaper &quot;Trouw&quot; on 6 October 1964 upon the occasion of Dooyeweerd&#x27;s 70th birthday, G.E. Langemeijer, chairman of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, professor at the University of Leiden, and appellate attorney general, lauded Dooyeweerd as &quot;... the most original philosopher Holland has ever produced, even Spinoza not excepted.&quot;

=== Influences and Development ===
* 
**One of the most controversial articles in the literature on Dooyeweerd&#x27;s intellectual development, Friesen argues that twenty-five key ideas in Dooyeweerd&#x27;s writings &quot;can already be found in the nineteenth century German philosopher, Franz von Baader&quot;.
* 
* . 
**One of the first responses to Friesen (2003), Strauss argues that the idea &quot;there is any &quot;direct&quot; influence on his [Dooyeweerd&#x27;s] thought from Von Baader can not be substantiated on the basis of the available sources even though it is not unlikely that he might have been aware of the existence of Von Baader&quot;.

<doc id="198207" wikidata="Q1499047" url="?curid=198207" title="Rec. 601">
<text>[[ITU-R]] Recommendation BT.601, more commonly known by the abbreviations Rec. 601 or BT.601 (or its former name CCIR 601), is a standard originally issued in 1982 by the CCIR (an organization, which has since been renamed as the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication sector) for encoding interlaced analog video signals in digital video form. It includes methods of encoding 525-line 60 Hz and 625-line 50 Hz signals, both with an active region covering 720 luminance samples and 360 chrominance samples per line. The color encoding system is known as YCbCr 4:2:2.

The Rec. 601 video raster format has been re-used in a number of later standards, including the ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T H.26x compressed formats, although compressed formats for consumer applications usually use chroma subsampling reduced from the 4:2:2 sampling specified in Rec. 601 to 4:2:0.

The standard has been revised several times in its history. Its seventh edition, referred to as BT.601-7, was approved in March 2011 and was formally published in October 2011.

==Background and history==
In the early 1980s, digital television equipment was beginning to emerge, but each manufacturer was developing their own proprietary digital versions of existing analog standards like PAL, SECAM, and NTSC.

At an ITU meeting in autumn 1981, CCIR Study Group 11 approved document 11/1027 describing the parameter values for a unified digital video format. This was adopted as Draft Rec. AA/11 &quot;Encoding Parameters for Digital Television for Studios&quot; by the CCIR Plenary Assembly in February 1982, later becoming ITU-R Rec. 601.

The key feature allowing a globally accepted digital standard were the use of component coding and choosing a luminance sampling frequency that was a common multiple of the line frequencies used in analog standards. This &quot;orthogonal&quot; sampling approach originated from Stanley Baron of NBC.

Preparation preceded the CCIR approval, including laboratory testing around the world to validate the proposed parameter values. International negotiations and efforts to build consensus were led by figures like Mark Krivosheev, Richard Green, and representatives from Japan and Europe.

==Signal format==
The Rec. 601 signal can be regarded as if it is a digitally encoded analog component video signal, and thus the sampling includes data for the horizontal and vertical sync and blanking intervals. Regardless of the frame rate, the luminance sampling frequency is 13.5 MHz. The samples are uniformly quantized using 8- or 10-bit PCM codes in the YCbCr domain.

For each 8-bit luminance sample, the nominal value to represent black is 16, and the value for white is 235. Eight-bit code values from 1 through 15 provide footroom and can be used to accommodate transient signal content such as filter undershoots. Similarly, code values 236 through 254 provide headroom and can be used to accommodate transient signal content such as filter overshoots. The values 0 and 255 are used to encode the sync pulses and are forbidden within the visible picture area. The Cb and Cr samples are unsigned and use the value 128 to encode the neutral color difference value, as used when encoding a white, grey or black area.

==Primary chromaticities==
Slightly different primaries are specified for the 625-line (PAL and SECAM) and 525-line (NTSC SMPTE C primaries) systems. Earlier versions of the standard (prior to BT.601-6, approved in January 2007) did not contain an explicit definition of the color primaries.

==Transfer characteristics==
Rec. 601 defines a nonlinear transfer function which is linear near 0 and then transfers to a gamma curve for the rest of the luminance range:

: formula_1

== Awards ==
The CCIR received a 1982–83 Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for its development of the Rec. 601 standard.

<text>Wesel () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Borken, Recklinghausen, district-free cities Bottrop, Oberhausen, Duisburg and Krefeld, districts Viersen, Cleves.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 by merging former districts Dinslaken, Moers and Rees, which were all created in 1816 when the area became part of Prussia. Its capital is Wesel, its most populated city is Moers.

==Geography==
The main river through the district is the Rhine.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show a willow tree with 13 branches representing the 13 municipalities and cities in the district. The green color as well as the tree was chosen to show that the city is surrounded by a green belt. The coat of arms was granted in 1978.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album is an award presented to recording artists for quality albums in the alternative genre at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;. In 2023, it was joined by a companion category, Best Alternative Music Performance.

==Criteria==
While the definition of &quot;alternative&quot; has been debated, the award was first presented in 1991 to recognize non-mainstream rock albums &quot;heavily played on college radio stations&quot;. After several updates of the category description, the Grammy organisation issued the following statement for the 2019 Grammy season:

&quot;Alternative is defined as a genre of music that embraces attributes of progression and innovation in both the music and attitudes associated with it. It is often a less intense version of rock or a more intense version of pop and is typically regarded as more original, eclectic, or musically challenging. It may embrace a variety of subgenres or any hybrids thereof and may include recordings that don&#x27;t fit into other genre categories.&quot;

==History==
In 1991, and from 1994 to 1999, the award was known as Best Alternative Music Performance. The award goes to the artist, producer and engineer/mixer, provided they are credited with more than 50% of playing time on the album. The lead performing artist is the only one who receives an official nomination. A producer or engineer with &quot;less&quot; than 50% of playing time, as well as the mastering engineer, can apply for a Winners Certificate. Before 2001, only the performing artist received a nomination and an award.

As of 2025, Radiohead, The White Stripes, Beck, and St. Vincent share the record for the most wins in this category, having won three times each, with St. Vincent being the first solo female to win the award thrice. Three female solo artists have won the award, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Fiona Apple; two bands with female members, The White Stripes and Alabama Shakes, have also won the award, as well as two all-female bands, Wet Leg and Boygenius. With nine nominations to date, Björk holds the record for the most nominations in this category; Radiohead singer Thom Yorke was nominated for the 2007 and 2020 awards for his solo albums, making him the most nominated person in this category with 10 total nominations. Björk holds the record for the most nominations for a solo artist, as well as the record for the most nominations without a win. Vampire Weekend and Coldplay have each received the award twice, and Coldplay are the only group to win two years consecutively. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups from the United Kingdom five times, from Ireland twice, and from France and Australia once each. Artists from Canada, Iceland, and Sweden have been nominated for the award, but none have won.

<doc id="198231" wikidata="Q2239423" url="?curid=198231" title="Desmond MacCarthy">
<text>Sir Charles Otto Desmond MacCarthy (20 May 1877 – 7 June 1952) was a British writer and literary and dramatic critic. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, the intellectual secret society, from 1896.

==Early life and education==
The son of Charles Desmond MacCarthy, M.A., and a descendant of the last MacCarthy Chief of the Name and King of Desmond, MacCarthy was born on 20 May 1877 in Plymouth, Devon, and educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he got to know Lytton Strachey, Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore.

==Career==
A member of the Bloomsbury Group, MacCarthy also had a wider circle of friends, including Logan Pearsall Smith.

In 1903 he became a journalist, with moderate success.

For part of the First World War he worked in Naval Intelligence.

In 1917 he joined the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as a drama critic, and in 1920 became its literary editor. He wrote a weekly column under the pen-name &quot;The Affable Hawk&quot;. During this time he recruited Cyril Connolly to the paper.

By 1928 he was losing interest in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and became the first editor of &quot;Life and Letters&quot;. Other periodicals he was associated with were &quot;New Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Eye Witness&quot;. MacCarthy became a literary critic for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and several volumes of his collected criticism were published.

He was the author of the short ghost story &quot;Pargiton and Harby&quot;, reprinted in the &quot;Fourth Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot;.

He was knighted in the 1951 New Year&#x27;s Honours.

==Personal life==

In 1906, MacCarthy married Mary &quot;Mollie&quot; Warre-Cornish, daughter of Francis Warre Warre-Cornish. She was a respected literary figure in her own right. Her sister Cecilia married William Wordsworth Fisher. They had two sons, Michael and Dermod, and a daughter, Rachel, who married the literary historian Lord David Cecil; their son was the actor Jonathan Cecil. 

He is buried with his wife at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.

<doc id="198232" wikidata="Q157009" url="?curid=198232" title="Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn">
<text>Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (Edward Augustus; 2 November 1767 – 23 January 1820) was the fourth son and fifth child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. His only child, Victoria, became Queen of the United Kingdom 17 years after his death.

Prince Edward was created Duke of Kent and Strathearn and Earl of Dublin on 23 April 1799 and, a few weeks later, appointed a General and commander-in-chief of British forces in the Maritime Provinces of North America. On 23 March 1802, he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar and nominally retained that post until his death. The Duke was appointed Field-Marshal of the Forces on 3 September 1805.

Edward lived in Lower Canada and Nova Scotia from 1791 to 1800. He is credited with the first use of the term &quot;Canadian&quot; to mean both French and English settlers in the Canadas, using the term to quell a riot between the two groups at a polling station in Charlesbourg on 27 June 1792. In the 21st century, he has been styled the &quot;Father of the Canadian Crown&quot; for his contribution to the development of Canada. Edward was also the first British prince to enter the United States since the recognition of American independence in 1783, travelling to Boston on foot from Lower Canada in 1794. 

== Early life ==
Prince Edward was born on 2 November 1767 to King George III and Queen Charlotte. He was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne. He was named after his uncle Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, who had died several weeks earlier and was buried at Westminster Abbey the day before Edward&#x27;s birth.

Edward was baptised on 30 November 1767; his godparents were the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg (his paternal uncle by marriage, for whom the Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain, stood proxy), Duke Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (his maternal uncle, for whom the Earl of Huntingdon, Groom of the Stole, stood proxy), the Hereditary Princess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (his paternal aunt, who was represented by a proxy) and the Landgravine of Hesse-Kassel (his paternal grandfather&#x27;s sister, for whom Elizabeth, Marchioness of Lorne, Lady of the Bedchamber to the Queen, stood proxy).

== Military career ==

=== Army ===
The Prince began his military training in the Electorate of Hanover in 1785. King George III intended to send him to the University of Göttingen, but decided against it upon the advice of the Duke of York. Instead, Edward went to Lüneburg and later Hanover, accompanied by his German tutor, Lieutenant Colonel George von Wangenheim, Baron Wangenheim. On 30 May 1786, he was appointed a brevet colonel in the British Army. From 1788 to 1789, he completed his education in Geneva. On 5 August 1789, aged 22, he became a mason in &quot;L&#x27;Union&quot;, the most important Genevan masonic lodge in the 19th century.

In 1789, he was appointed colonel of the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers). In 1790, he returned home without leave and, in disgrace, was sent off to Gibraltar as an ordinary officer. He was joined from Marseilles by his mistress Madame de Saint-Laurent.

==== Quebec ====
Due to the extreme Mediterranean heat, Edward requested to be transferred to present-day Canada, specifically Quebec, in 1791. Edward arrived in Canada in time to witness the proclamation of the Constitutional Act of 1791, became the first member of the Royal Family to tour Upper Canada, and became a fixture of British North American society. Edward and his mistress, Julie St. Laurent, became close friends with the French Canadian family of Ignace-Michel-Louis-Antoine d&#x27;Irumberry de Salaberry; the Prince mentored all of the family&#x27;s sons throughout their military careers. Edward guided Charles de Salaberry throughout his career, and made sure that the famous commander was duly honoured after his leadership during the Battle of Chateauguay.

The prince was promoted to the rank of major-general in October 1793. He served successfully in the West Indies campaign the following year, and was commander of the British camp at La Coste during the Battle of Martinique, for which he was mentioned in dispatches by General Charles Grey for his &quot;great Spirit and Activity&quot;. He subsequently received the thanks of Parliament.

==== Nova Scotia ====
After 1794, Prince Edward lived at the headquarters of the Royal Navy&#x27;s North American Station located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was instrumental in shaping that settlement&#x27;s military defences, protecting its important Royal Navy base, as well as influencing the city&#x27;s and colony&#x27;s socio-political and economic institutions. Edward was responsible for the construction of Halifax&#x27;s iconic Garrison Clock, as well as numerous other civic projects such as St. George&#x27;s Round Church. Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth and Lady Francis Wentworth provided their country residence for the use of Prince Edward and Julie St. Laurent. Extensively renovated, the estate became known as &quot;Prince&#x27;s Lodge&quot; as the couple hosted numerous dignitaries, including Louis-Phillippe of Orléans (the future King of the French). All that remains of the residence is a small rotunda built by Edward for his regimental band to play music.

After suffering a fall from his horse in late 1798, he was allowed to return to England. On 24 April 1799, Prince Edward was created Duke of Kent and Strathearn and Earl of Dublin, and received the thanks of parliament and an income of £12,000 (£ in ). In May that same year, the Duke was promoted to the rank of general and appointed Commander-in-Chief of British forces in North America. He took leave of his parents on 22 July 1799 and sailed to Halifax. Just over twelve months later he left Halifax and arrived in England on 31 August 1800 where it was confidently expected his next appointment would be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

==== Gibraltar ====

Appointed Governor of Gibraltar by the War Office, gazetted 23 March 1802, the Duke took up his post on 24 May with express orders from the government to restore discipline among the drunken troops. The Duke&#x27;s harsh discipline precipitated a mutiny by soldiers in his own and the 25th Regiment on Christmas Eve. His brother Frederick, the Duke of York, then Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, recalled him in May 1803 after receiving reports of the mutiny, but despite this direct order he refused to return to England until his successor arrived. He was refused permission to return to Gibraltar for an inquiry and, although allowed to continue to hold the governorship of Gibraltar until his death, he was forbidden to return.

As a consolation for the ending of his active military career when he was 35, he was promoted to the rank of field marshal and appointed Ranger of Hampton Court Park on 5 September 1805. This office provided him with a residence now known as The Pavilion. (His sailor brother, William, with children to provide for, had been made Ranger of Bushy Park in 1797.) The Duke continued to serve as honorary colonel of the 1st Regiment of Foot (the Royal Scots) until his death.

Though it was a tendency shared to some extent with his brothers, the Duke&#x27;s excesses as a military disciplinarian may have been due less to natural disposition and more to what he had learned from his tutor Baron Wangenheim. Certainly Wangenheim, by keeping his allowance very small, accustomed Edward to borrowing at an early age. The Duke applied the same military discipline to his own duties that he demanded of others. Though it seems inconsistent with his unpopularity among the army&#x27;s rank and file, his friendliness toward others and popularity with servants has been emphasized. He also introduced the first regimental school. The Duke of Wellington considered him a first-class speaker. He took a continuing interest in the social experiments of Robert Owen, voted for Catholic emancipation, and supported literary, Bible, and abolitionist societies.

His daughter, Victoria, after hearing Lord Melbourne&#x27;s opinions, was able to add to her private journal of 1 August 1838 &quot;from all what I heard, he was the best of all&quot;.

== Personal life and interests ==

=== Marriage ===

==== Role in the royal succession ====
Following the death of Princess Charlotte of Wales in November 1817, the only legitimate grandchild of George III at the time, the royal succession began to look uncertain. The Prince Regent (later King George IV) and his younger brother Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, though married, were estranged from their wives and had no surviving legitimate children. The King&#x27;s fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, was already married but had no living children at that time, whilst the marriage of the sixth son, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, was void because he had married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The king&#x27;s surviving daughters were all childless and past likely childbearing age. The King&#x27;s unmarried sons, the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV), Edward, Duke of Kent, and Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, all rushed to contract lawful marriages and provide an heir to the throne.

==== Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld ====

For his part the Duke of Kent, aged 50, was already considering marriage, and he became engaged to Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who had been the sister-in-law of his now-deceased niece Princess Charlotte. They were married on 29 May 1818 at Schloss Ehrenburg, Coburg, in a Lutheran rite, and again on 11 July 1818 at Kew Palace, Kew, Surrey.

Princess Victoria was the daughter of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and the sister of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, husband of the recently deceased Princess Charlotte. She was a widow: her first husband had been Emich Karl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen, with whom she had had two children: a son, Karl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen, and a daughter, Princess Feodora of Leiningen.

==== Issue ====
They had one child, Alexandrina Victoria, born 24 May 1819. He was 51 years old at the time of her birth. The Duke took great pride in his daughter, telling his friends to look at her well, for she would be Queen of the United Kingdom.

=== Mistresses ===

Various sources report that the Duke of Kent had mistresses. In Geneva, he had two mistresses, Adelaide Dubus and Anne Moré. Dubus died at the birth of her daughter Adelaide Dubus (1789in or after 1832). Anne Gabrielle Alexandrine Moré was the mother of Edward Schenker Scheener (1789–1853). Brought up in Geneva as the ostensible son of Thimothée Schencker, his father promised to find him a post in the UK civil service and in 1809 he was appointed a clerk in the Foreign Office, being retired with a pension in 1826. When his half-sister Victoria became Queen in 1837, with his English wife Harriet Boyn (1781-1852) he returned to Geneva, where he died in 1853. He had no children.

In 1790, while still in Geneva, the Duke took up with &quot;Madame de Saint-Laurent&quot; (born Thérèse-Bernardine Montgenet), the wife of a French colonel. She went with him to Canada in 1791, where she was known as &quot;Julie de Saint-Laurent&quot;. She accompanied the Duke for the next 28 years, until his marriage in 1818. The portrait of the Duke by Beechey was hers.

Mollie Gillen, who was granted access to the Royal Archive at Windsor Castle, established that no children were born of the 27-year relationship between Edward Augustus and Madame de Saint-Laurent; although many Canadian families and individuals (including the Nova Scotian soldier Sir William Fenwick Williams, 1st Baronet), have claimed descent from them. Such claims can now be discounted in light of this research.

== Canadian Confederation ==
While Prince Edward lived in Quebec (1791–93) he met with Jonathan Sewell, an immigrant American Loyalist who played trumpet in the Prince&#x27;s regimental band. Sewell would rise in Lower Canadian government to hold such offices as Attorney General, Chief Justice, and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. In 1814, Sewell forwarded to the Duke a copy of his report &quot;A plan for the federal union of British provinces in North America.&quot; The Duke supported Sewell&#x27;s plan to unify the colonies, offering comments and critiques that would later be cited by Lord Durham (1839) and participants of the Charlottetown and Quebec Conferences (1864).

Edward&#x27;s 1814 letter to Sewell:
My dear Sewell,

I have had this day the pleasure of receiving your note of yesterday with its interesting enclosure. Nothing can be better arranged than the whole thing is or more perfectly, and when I see an opening it is fully my intention to point the matter out to Lord Bathurst and put the paper in his hands, without however telling him from whom I have it, though I shall urge him to have some conversation with you relative to it. Permit me, however, just to ask you whether it was not an oversight in you to state that there are five Houses of Assembly in the British Colonies in North America. If I am not under an error there are six, viz., Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the islands of Prince Edward and Cape Breton.

Allow me to beg of you to put down the proportions in which you think the thirty members of the Representatives Assembly ought to be furnished by each Province, and to suggest whether you would not think two Lieutenant-Governors with two Executive Councils sufficient for an executive government of the whole, namely one for the two Canadas, and one for New Brunswick and the two small dependencies of Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island, the former to reside in Montreal, and the latter at whichever of the two (following) situations may be considered most central for the two provinces whether Annapolis Royal or Windsor.

But, at all events, should you consider in your Executive Councils requisite I presume there cannot be a question of the expediency of comprehending the two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with Nova Scotia.

Believe me ever to remain,

With the most friendly regard,

My dear Sewell,

Yours faithfully,

EDWARD

== Freemasonry - United Grand Lodge of England ==

In January 1813, Prince Edward&#x27;s brother, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex (sixth son of King George III), became Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England (aka &quot;The Moderns&quot;) on the resignation of his brother, the Prince Regent; and, in December of that year, Prince Edward became Grand Master of the Antient Grand Lodge of England (aka &quot;The Ancients&quot;). In 1811, both Grand Lodges had appointed Commissioners; and over the ensuing two years, articles of Union were negotiated and agreed upon. On 27 December 1813, the United Grand Lodge of England, formed as a result of these negotiations, was constituted at Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London with the younger Duke of Sussex as Grand Master. A Lodge of Reconciliation was formed a few weeks prior to reconcile the rituals worked under the two former Grand Lodges.

== Later life ==

The Duke of Kent purchased a house of his own from Maria Fitzherbert in 1801. Castle Hill Lodge on Castlebar Hill, Ealing (West London), was then placed in the hands of architect James Wyatt and more than £100,000 spent (£ in ). Near neighbours from 1815 to 1817 at Little Boston House were US envoy and future US President John Quincy Adams and his English wife Louisa. &quot;We all went to church and heard a charity sermon preached by a Dr Crane before the Duke of Kent&quot;, wrote Adams in a diary entry from August 1815.

Following the birth of Princess Victoria in May 1819, the Duke and Duchess, concerned to manage the Duke&#x27;s great debts, sought to find a place where they could live inexpensively. After the coast of Devon was recommended to them they leased from a General Baynes, intending to remain &quot;incognito&quot;, Woolbrook Cottage on the seaside by Sidmouth.

=== Death ===
The Duke of Kent died of pneumonia on 23 January 1820 at Woolbrook Cottage, Sidmouth, and was interred in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. He died six days before his father, George III, and less than a year after his daughter&#x27;s birth.

He predeceased his father and his three elder brothers but, as none of his elder brothers had any surviving legitimate children, his daughter Victoria succeeded to the throne on the death of her uncle King William IV in 1837, and reigned until 1901.

In 1829, the Duke&#x27;s former aide-de-camp purchased the unoccupied Castle Hill Lodge from the Duchess in an attempt to reduce her debts; the debts were finally discharged after Victoria took the throne and paid them over time from her income.

== Legacy ==

There is a bronze statue of the prince in Park Crescent, London. Sculpted by Sebastian Gahagan and installed in January 1824, the statue is tall and represents the Duke in his Field Marshal&#x27;s uniform, over which he wears his ducal dress and the regalia of the Order of the Garter. He is the namesake of Prince Edward Island; the Prince Edward Islands; Prince Edward County, Ontario; and Duke Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia.

== Honours and arms ==
=== Honours ===
* Knight Founder of St. Patrick, &quot;11 March 1783&quot;
* Royal Knight of the Garter, &quot;2 June 1786&quot;
* Privy Councilor of the United Kingdom, &quot;5 September 1799&quot;
* Knight Grand Cross of the Bath (military), &quot;2 January 1815&quot;
* Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (military), &quot;12 April 1815&quot;

=== Arms ===
As a son of the sovereign, the Duke of Kent had use of the arms of the kingdom from 1801 to his death, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a cross gules, the outer points each bearing a fleur-de-lys azure&quot;.

<doc id="198234" wikidata="Q930337" url="?curid=198234" title="Digital8">
<text>Digital8 (or D8) is a consumer digital recording videocassette for camcorders developed by Sony, and introduced in 1999.

The Digital8 format is a combination of the earlier analog Hi8 tape transport with the digital DV codec. Digital8 equipment uses the same videocassettes as analog recording Hi8 equipment, but the signal is encoded &quot;digitally&quot; using the industry-standard DV codec, which means it has identical digital audio and digital video specifications compared with DV.

To facilitate digital recording on existing Hi8 video cassettes the helical scan video head drum spins 2.5× faster. For both NTSC and PAL Digital8 equipment, a standard-length 120-minute NTSC/90-minute PAL Hi8 magnetic tape cassette will store 60 minutes of Digital8 video (Standard Play) or 90 minutes (Long Play). There are 90-minute versions marketed specifically for Digital8, but these use thinner tape than the 60-minute ones. LP is model specific, such as the TRV-30, TRV-40, and others. Digital8 recordings can be made on standard-grade Video8 cassettes, but this practice is discouraged in the Sony user manuals, and Hi8 metal-particle cassettes are the recommended type for Digital8 recording. Most Hi8 tapes sold after the introduction of D8 are marked for both Hi8 and Digital8 usage.

== Digital8 vs. DV ==
The Digital8 format is identical to baseline DV at the bitstream level. A Digital8 camcorder appears and behaves exactly like a DV camcorder when connected via a 1394/iLink/FireWire link.

Digital8 cassettes are identical to Video8/Hi8 cassettes and have dimensions of 95 mm × 62.5 mm × 15 mm. They are similar in size to medium-sized DV cassettes known as DVCPRO cassettes, which have dimensions 97.5 × 64.5 × 14.6 mm. Tape size is different too, 8 mm for Digital8 vs. 6.35 mm for DV. The cassettes are not interchangeable, and there is no adapter from one format to another. 

Digital8 machines run tape at 29 mm per second, faster than baseline DV (19 mm/s) and comparable to professional DV formats like DVCAM (28 mm/s) and DVCPRO (34 mm/s). A 120-minute 8-mm cassette holds 106 m of tape and can store 60 minutes of digital video. A standard DVCPRO cassette holds 137 m of tape, good for 66 minutes of video.

== Market segment ==

Analog Hi8 video enjoyed widespread use in the amateur home video market, current affairs TV programs, and some professional news organizations. Digital8 remained largely a consumer or amateur product (Among the exceptions was the 2001 film &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot;.) This is likely a reflection of Sony&#x27;s design and market objectives for Digital8 format: to serve as a lower cost upgrade path for current customers (from analog 8 mm), by leveraging existing manufacturing infrastructure of 8 mm video equipment, and offering a familiar media format but with digital capabilities. Furthermore, Digital8 was released some time after MiniDV, giving the rival DV format a lead in the professional market.

Digital8 is an obsolete format. By 2004 Sony, the format&#x27;s original backer, was the only company still producing Digital8 equipment, and had no plans to develop new Digital 8 cameras. Hitachi marketed a few Digital8 camcorders at the time as well. By 2005, the Digital8 product line catered purely to entry-level consumers. This is most likely because the larger, bulkier Digital8 cassette was perceived as an inferior technology, even though the Digital8 and DV formats offer indistinguishable A/V performance. The larger 8mm format is more robust, laying down wider tracks. Most, though not all, Digital8 camcorders can play back analogue Video8 and Hi8 tapes. As well as camcorders, Sony also released Digital8 Video Walkman portables, the GV-D200 and GV-D800.

== Camera model variations ==
In the early years after Digital8&#x27;s introduction, Sony sold a product line with coverage from entry level to high-end consumer. The more consumer oriented line uses a 1/6&quot; CCD image sensor and the more prosumer line uses a 1/4&quot; one. Both existed from the beginning, but the 1/4&quot; CCD models were discontinued.

1998-1999 models only support Digital8 recording and playback at SP speed. 2000 and newer models added LP speed Digital8 recording (only supported on Hi8 tapes, not Video8 tapes). All models with analog playback can play Video8/Hi8 recordings made at either SP or LP speed. 2000 and newer models with analog playback also support DV Passthrough mode for capturing an analog video source directly into a computer without needing to record it to Digital8 tape first.

Later Digital8 Handycams shared the same chassis, optics, and owner&#x27;s manual with a range of analog Hi8 Handycams, although the CCD image sensor pixel count varied between the Digital8 (460K) and the Hi8 (320K) models.

Although the 1/4&quot; CCD models are fully capable of taking a still photo, that is a secondary function and they lack the Sony Memory Stick feature to off-load the JPEG images. Most of the entry level and later models focused on features such as better quality still pictures (see below), off-loading the same via Sony Memory Sticks, and more programming selections. The combining of still image and video capture is now common, however a good still image CCD has different qualities from a good video CCD. The cameras also lost features generally appealing to a prosumer level customer. The 1999 TRV-310, for instance, has the 1/4&quot; CCD, a 3.5&quot; LCD screen, an f1.4 lens, variable shutter speed settings, manual focus, and other professional controls. The lens on a typical 1/6&quot; CCD is f1.8, about 60% as fast as an f1.4. The TRV-310, has a 1/4&quot; CCD with a pixel count of 460K and &quot;effective count&quot; of 290K. The larger CCD with fewer pixels allows a smaller depth of field for intentional blurred backgrounds in some situations unattainable with the 1/6&quot; CCD. It also has greater light sensitivity, 1 lux vs. 7 lux for the 1/6&quot; CCD (without Night Shot), and less sensor noise in low light conditions.

Another example of these capabilities changing with pixel count may be seen in the TRV-150, 250, 350, and 351 Digital8 models and their TRV-118, 318, and 418 Hi8 cousins. Despite having the same size CCD and the same f1.6 lens, the lower pixel count Hi8 models permit a 1 lux low light rating as compared to the 4 lux of the Digital8 models. The Sony DCR-TRV730/828/830 (and the later DCR-TRV740/840), were the only Digital8 camcorders to be built with a 1/4.7-inch (4.5 mm) with advanced HAD (Hole Accumulation Diode) CCD. HAD is useful on smaller, high-megapixel-count CCDs and CMOSs. The pixel count for the TRV-730 is 1,070,000 pixels (690,000 in camera mode.)

== Analog recordings ==
Higher-end Digital8 equipment may minimize analog generation loss by offering the ability to playback and digitize legacy analog 8 mm Video8/Hi8 format recordings, but none will record in analog. There are limitations, audio playback is limited to the Video8/Hi8 analog FM soundtrack, not any PCM digital audio track. Some models will play both NTSC and PAL recordings, others will only play their own native television standard. Analog recordings also lack timecode, so batch captures will not work. The digitized video signal can be transferred in the same way as native digital recordings, through the camcorder&#x27;s FireWire cable port, thus simplifying video file creation on computers equipped with a FireWire port and video capturing software, or FireWire equipped DVD recorders. The advantage of creating digital files using the camera&#x27;s digital stream conversion is that the resulting files on the computer can be burned to DVDs as well as facilitating computerized digital editing and storage as video files. Lossless digital editing can be achieved when utilizing the FireWire port between two similar Digital8 cameras. Digitizing legacy signals does not improve image quality, but the resulting files have highly accurate sampling of the source audio and video quality of the Video8/Hi8 original.

The models of Digital8 camcorders that are capable or not capable of playing back analog recordings are listed below.

<text>Musophilus is a long poem by Samuel Daniel, first published in 1599 in his &quot;Poetical Essays&quot;.

Among Daniel&#x27;s most characteristic works, it is a dialogue between a courtier and a man of letters, and is a general defence of learning, and in particular of poetic learning as an instrument in the education of the perfect courtier or man of action. It is addressed to Fulke Greville.

==Textual history==

Daniel first published &quot;Musophilus&quot; in his &quot;Poeticall Essayes&quot; of 1599. The poem was published again in 1601/1602, largely unchanged except in accidentals such as punctuation, and in the deletion of the final three stanzas, reducing the poem from 1002 to 984 lines. However, the text published in 1607 witnessed not only frequent revisions affecting diction and rhythm, but also extensive cuts, deleting nearly 200 lines. A few further alterations were made for the 1611 edition, including a new dedicatory poem to Fulke Greville, replacing the dedicatory sonnet to him in all other editions. Modern editors tend to be critical of these revisions, referring to them as &quot;mutilations&quot; that &quot;all but ruined&quot; the poem, or, more diplomatically, &quot;not always to the poem&#x27;s advantage&quot;. The posthumous &quot;Whole Works&quot; of 1623 returned to the 1601 version as its basis.

All modern editions use either the 1599 text (Sprague; Hiller &amp; Groves) or the 1623 text (Grosart; Himelick) as their copy-texts.

==Versification==

The poem is introduced by a dedicatory Spenserian sonnet: 14 lines of iambic pentameter rhyming ABAB BCBC CDCD EE.

The poem proper is written entirely in iambic pentameter with rimes forming a variety of stanzas. 118 stanzas (over 2/3 of the poem) are 6-line stanzas riming ABABAB. Interspersed with these are 14 ottava rima stanzas riming ABABABCC, 4 &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; stanzas riming ABABCC, and a single heroic quatrain riming ABAB. These rime schemes might be thought of as the first 4, first 6, last 6, and all 8 lines of an ottava rima stanza.

Finally, lines 727-880 form an unbroken series of 51 tercets of terza rima (riming ABA BCB CDC...) with 1 final line to complete the central rime of the final tercet (...YZY Z). Even this quite different structure can be seen as corresponding with the other stanzas: if conceptualized as 6-line stanzas (as modern editions do), the resulting rime scheme ABABCB is only 1 rime removed from the main stanza of the poem, the interloping C providing the rime that links to the next stanza.

The relations of these rime schemes are tabulated below as Philocosmus (Musophilus&#x27;s skeptical interlocutor) begins their dialogue by challenging him as to the practical value of poetry.

<text>Jessica Whitney Dubroff (May 5, 1988 – April 11, 1996) was a seven-year-old American trainee pilot who died while attempting to become the youngest person to fly a light aircraft across the United States. On day two of her quest, the Cessna 177B Cardinal single-engine aircraft, piloted by her flight instructor, Joe Reid, crashed during a rainstorm immediately after takeoff from Cheyenne Regional Airport in Cheyenne, Wyoming, killing Dubroff, her 57-year-old father Lloyd Dubroff, and Reid.

Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff was not legally able to be a pilot because of her age. She did not possess a medical certificate or a student pilot certificate, since a medical certificate requires a minimum age of 16 and a pilot certificate requires a minimum age of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. At the time of her trip, there was no record-keeping body that recognized any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized Dubroff&#x27;s story, and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash and concluded that the fatality was caused by Reid&#x27;s improper decision to take off in poor weather conditions, his overloading the aircraft, and his failure to maintain airspeed. The three factors resulted in a stall and subsequent fatal crash in a residential neighborhood. The NTSB also determined that &quot;contributing to the [instructor&#x27;s] decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary, in part, because of media commitments.&quot;

== Early life ==
Jessica Whitney Dubroff was born on May 5, 1988, to Lloyd Dubrooff and Lisa Blair Hathaway, in Falmouth, Massachusetts, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when she was four. She was of Ukrainian and Polish descent on her paternal side, with the Dubroff surname being an anglicization of Dubrovsky that was adopted when her paternal ancestors came to the United States. Dubroff grew up in an unconventional lifestyle, with her not owning toys, being allowed TV, or enrolling in school.

== &quot;Sea to Shining Sea&quot; flight ==
Jessica Dubroff began taking flight lessons from flight instructor Joe Reid on her sixth birthday and became enthusiastic about flying. Lloyd Dubroff suggested the idea of a coast-to-coast flight, which his daughter readily accepted, and Reid agreed to provide flight instruction and his aircraft for the endeavor. They decided to name their flight &quot;Sea to Shining Sea&quot;; Lloyd ordered custom-made caps and T-shirts with that logo to distribute as souvenirs during their stops.

Although she had received over 33 hours of flight training, seven-year-old Dubroff did not hold a medical certificate from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), nor any pilot or student certificate. In the U.S., a person must be at least 16 years of age to be eligible for a student pilot certificate, and 17 for a pilot certificate. Since Dubroff was not certified to fly the plane, a rated pilot (normally her flight instructor Reid) had to be at the controls during all flight operations. While the coast-to-coast flight was promoted as a &quot;record&quot; attempt because of Dubroff&#x27;s young age, there was no known body recognizing record flights by underage &quot;pilots&quot; at the time of her flight (&quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; had officially discontinued its &quot;youngest pilot&quot; categories seven years earlier, because of the risk of accidents).
The flight would be made in Reid&#x27;s Cessna 177B Cardinal, a four-seat single-engine propeller aircraft manufactured in 1975, registered N35207, which like most aircraft had dual flight controls in the front. Dubroff would sit in the front left seat, Reid in the front right, and Lloyd in the back. It was agreed that Reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates, plus compensation for the layover time. Reid reportedly told his wife that he considered the flight a &quot;non-event for aviation&quot;, simply &quot;flying cross country with a 7-year-old sitting next to you and the parents paying for it.&quot;

Nevertheless, Dubroff became an instant media celebrity. ABC News gave Lloyd a video camera and blank cassettes to tape the flight; once the journey began, it was vigorously followed by supporters, media outlets, and others who monitored its progress, reporting each time Dubroff landed or took off. Dubroff slept during one of the flight segments en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and was assisted by Reid in one of the landings due to high winds.

== Final flight segment ==
After a long day of flying from their Half Moon Bay, California departure point, Dubroff, Lloyd, and Reid arrived in Cheyenne the evening before their ill-fated flight. They were welcomed in Wyoming&#x27;s capital city by Mayor Leo Pando. After some media interviews, they were driven to their hotel in the car of a local radio station program director, who recalled them discussing the forecast weather conditions for the next day.
As forecast, the weather on the morning of the scheduled flight consisted of an area of heavy precipitation over and to the north and west of Cheyenne, with better conditions to the east, where the flight was headed. As the group was about to board their aircraft, the program director who had taken them to their hotel the previous evening interviewed Dubroff by telephone. When rain began to fall at Cheyenne Regional Airport and the weather seemed to be deteriorating, the director invited her to stay in Cheyenne, but Dubroff&#x27;s father declined, explaining that they wanted to &quot;beat the storm&quot; that was approaching.

After a telephone discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid decided to take off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, and to try to escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.

As the aircraft began taxiing to the departure runway, the rain intensified and visibility at the airport fell below the three mile minimum required for VFR flight. Cheyenne&#x27;s control tower advised the Cessna about the reduced visibility and that the &quot;field is IFR&quot;. In general, when an airport is officially IFR (normally because of reduced visibility or low cloud ceiling), only IFR or Special VFR operations are allowed. Reid then requested and received from the control tower a Special VFR clearance to allow him to exit the airport&#x27;s control zone visually, despite the reduced visibility.

== Crash ==
At 8:24 a.m. MDT, Reid&#x27;s aircraft began its takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right turn, and after reaching an altitude of a few hundred feet, the plane rolled out of its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.

==Investigation==

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident and published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who was the only one on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.

Several experienced pilots who were at Cheyenne Regional Airport at the time of the accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the airfield. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight (MTOW) by 96 lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.

Like most flight instructors giving dual instruction, Reid was seated on the right side, while the aircraft&#x27;s primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated that because of the heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid&#x27;s forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, he would have had to turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.

===Probable cause===
The NTSB concluded that the probable cause of the accident was Reid&#x27;s &quot;improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions (including turbulence, gusty winds, and an advancing thunderstorm and associated precipitation) when the airplane was overweight and when the density altitude was higher than he was accustomed to, resulting in a stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed.&quot; The NTSB further determined that &quot;contributing to the pilot in command&#x27;s decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary, in part, because of media commitments.&quot;

==Aftermath==

===Child Pilot Safety Act===
The accident and its associated publicity led to federal legislation to prevent similar &quot;record&quot; attempts by underage pilots from taking place in the future. The legislation passed the House of Representatives on September 11, 1996, and the Senate on September 18. On September 27, differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill were resolved. On October 9, President Bill Clinton signed the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, including the Child Pilot Safety Act, into law. The statute prohibits anyone who does not hold at least a private pilot certificate and a current medical certificate from manipulating the controls of an aircraft, if that individual &quot;is attempting to set a record or engage in an aeronautical competition or aeronautical feat.&quot;

Since a medical certificate and a private pilot&#x27;s license have a minimum age requirement of 16 and 17 respectively, the new rule prohibits &quot;child pilots&quot; such as Dubroff and Vicki Van Meter from manipulating the flight controls if they are pursuing a record, and the pilot in command&#x27;s pilot certificate may be revoked for allowing such activity.

===Media responsibility===

After the crash, there were claims that the media frenzy around the &quot;bogus&quot; record attempt contributed to the accident by helping promote the flight and pressuring its schedule. This was supported by the NTSB, which determined that the pressure induced by the intense media attention was a &quot;contributing factor&quot; in the accident. ABC&#x27;s Ted Koppel reflected on the media&#x27;s role in the tragedy on &quot;Nightline&quot;: &quot;We need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution...We feed one another: those of you looking for publicity and those of us looking for stories.&quot; Koppel ended by asking &quot;whether we in the media...by our ravenous attention contribute to this phenomenon&quot;, and answered: &quot;We did.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine featured Dubroff&#x27;s portrait on its front cover, in which she is seen wearing a gray cap with the inscription, &quot;Women Fly&quot;. Dubroff was also featured on the cover of &quot;People&quot;.

===Civil litigation===
Lloyd Dubroff was Lisa Blair Hathaway&#x27;s common-law husband when Jessica and her brother were born. In 1990, Lloyd Dubroff and Hathaway were separated; in 1991, Dubroff, aged 52, married 19-year-old Melinda Anne Hurst, with whom he had a child the following year. In December 1992, Hathaway gave birth to Dubroff&#x27;s full sister, Jasmine, who was conceived while she lived for a time with Lloyd and Hurst in California.

Before his death in the crash, Lloyd bought four separate life insurance policies, each for $750,000. Two of the policies named Hathaway as beneficiary and two named Hurst, so that each was to receive $1.5 million in the event of his death, ensuring adequate child support for his underage children living with the two women. Lloyd&#x27;s grown son and daughter (both in their 30s) from a previous marriage were not addressed by these policies.

After the crash, Hurst sued Hathaway for Hathaway&#x27;s $1.5 million: Hurst&#x27;s attorney Roy Litherland said in a San Mateo County court that the $1.5 million Hathaway was designated was &quot;in excess of any reasonable level of child support.&quot; In December 1996, Hathaway filed a counter-suit against Hurst and Lloyd&#x27;s estate for $1.5 million, the exact amount of money Lloyd intended, saying Lloyd &quot;gave his word he would care for and support [her] for the rest and remainder of her natural life.&quot;

On December 18, 1997, San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Judith Kozloski ruled that the $3 million insurance benefits should be equally split between the two women; all other claims were dismissed.

===Burial===
Dubroff was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Pescadero, California.

== Dramatization ==
Jessica Dubroff&#x27;s crash is featured in season 2, episode 4, of the television show &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Small Planes, Big Problem&quot;.

<text>In German orthography, the letter ß, called &#x27; (, S-Z) or &#x27; (, &quot;sharp S&quot;), represents the phoneme in Standard German when following long vowels and diphthongs. The letter-name combines the names of the letters of () and () in German. The character&#x27;s Unicode names in English are double s, sharp s and eszett. The &quot;Eszett&quot; letter is currently used only in German, and can be typographically replaced with the double-s digraph , if the ß-character is unavailable. In the 20th century, the ß-character was replaced with &quot;ss&quot; in the spelling of Swiss Standard German (Switzerland and Liechtenstein), while remaining Standard German spelling in other varieties of the German language.

The letter originates as the digraph as used in late medieval and early modern German orthography, represented as a ligature of (long s) and (tailed z) in blackletter typefaces, yielding . This developed from an earlier usage of in Old and Middle High German to represent a separate sibilant sound from ; when the difference between the two sounds was lost in the 13th century, the two symbols came to be combined as in some situations.

Traditionally, did not have a capital form, although some type designers introduced &quot;de facto&quot; capitalized variants. In 2017, the Council for German Orthography officially adopted a capital, , as an acceptable variant in German orthography, ending a long orthographic debate.
Since 2024 the capital (ligature) has been preferred over (two letters).

Lowercase was encoded by ECMA-94 (1985) at position 223 (hexadecimal DF), inherited by Latin-1 and Unicode ().
The HTML entity codice_1 was introduced with HTML 2.0 (1995). The capital was encoded by Unicode in 2008 at ().

== Usage ==
===Current usage===
In standard German, three letters or combinations of letters commonly represent (the voiceless alveolar fricative) depending on its position in a word: , , and . According to current German orthography, represents the sound :
#when it is written after a diphthong or long vowel and is not followed by another consonant in the word stem: , , , [Exceptions: and words with final devoicing (e.g., )]; and
#when a word stem ending with takes an inflectional ending beginning with a consonant: , .

In verbs with roots where the vowel changes length, this means that some forms may be written with , others with : , , .

The use of distinguishes minimal pairs such as (, to rip) and (, to travel) on the one hand ( vs. ), and (, penance) and (, buses) on the other (long vowel before , short vowel before ).

Some proper names may use after a short vowel, following the old orthography; this is also true of some words derived from proper names (e.g., , named after Ernst Litfaß).

If no is available in a font, then the official orthography calls for to be replaced with . Since 2024, when writing in capital letters has been preferred, but may be used instead. Previously, was the preferred form.

===In pre-1996 orthography===

According to the orthography in use in German prior to the German orthography reform of 1996, was written to represent :
#word internally following a long vowel or diphthong: , ; and
#at the end of a syllable or before a consonant, so long as is the end of the word stem: , , .
In the old orthography, word stems spelled internally could thus be written in certain instances, without this reflecting a change in vowel length: (from ), (from ), and (from ), (comparative: ). In rare occasions, the difference between and could help differentiate words: (expiration of a pass) and (appropriate).
As in the new orthography, it was possible to write for if the character was not available. When using all capital letters, the pre-1996 rules called for rendering as except when there was ambiguity, in which case it should be rendered as . The common example for such a case is ( &quot;in moderate amounts&quot;) vs. ( &quot;in massive amounts&quot;); in this example the spelling difference between vs. produces completely different meanings.

=== Switzerland and Liechtenstein ===
In Swiss Standard German, usually replaces every . This is officially sanctioned by the reformed German orthography rules, which state in §25 E: &quot;&quot; (&quot;In Switzerland, one may always write &#x27;ss&#x27;&quot;). Liechtenstein follows the same practice. There are very few instances where the difference between spelling and affects the meaning of a word, and these can usually be told apart by context.

=== Other uses ===

Occasionally, has been used in unusual ways:
* As the Greek lowercase (beta). The original IBM PC CP437 contains a glyph that minimizes their differences placed between (alpha) and (gamma) but named &quot;Sharp s Small&quot;. Substitution was also done using other character sets such as ISO/IEC 8859-1 even though they contain no other Greek letters. The lowercase eszett has also been misused as in scientific writing and vice versa.
* In Prussian Lithuanian, as in the first book published in Lithuanian, Martynas Mažvydas&#x27; &quot;Simple Words of Catechism&quot;, as well as in Sorbian (see example on the left).
* For sadhe in Akkadian glosses, in place of the standard , when that character is unavailable due to limitations of HTML.
* The letter appeared in the alphabet made by Jan Kochanowski for the Polish language, that was used from the 16th until the 18th century. It represented the voiceless postalveolar fricative () sound. It was for example used in the &quot;Jakub Wujek Bible&quot;.
* Some authors have used it in German at the beginning of words to transcribe the voiceless s of certain accents.

== History ==
===Origin and development===
As a result of the High German consonant shift, Old High German developed a sound generally spelled or that was probably pronounced and was contrasted with a sound, probably pronounced (voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant) or (voiced alveolar retracted sibilant), depending on the place in the word, and spelled . Given that could also represent the affricate , some attempts were made to differentiate the sounds by spelling as or : (), (), (). In Middle High German, simplified to at the end of a word or after a long vowel, but was retained word internally after a short vowel: () vs. () and ().

In the thirteenth century, the phonetic difference between and was lost at the beginning and end of words in all dialects except for Gottscheerish. Word-internally, Old and Middle High German came to be pronounced (the voiced alveolar sibilant), while Old and Middle High German continued to be pronounced . This produces the contrast between modern standard German and . The former is pronounced and comes from , while the latter is pronounced and comes from .

In the late medieval and early modern periods, was frequently spelled or . The earliest appearance of ligature resembling the modern is in a fragment of a manuscript of the poem &quot;Wolfdietrich&quot; from around 1300. In the Gothic book hands and bastarda scripts of the late medieval period, is written with long s and the Blackletter &quot;tailed z&quot;, as . A recognizable ligature representing the digraph develops in handwriting in the early 14th century.

By the late 1400s, the choice of spelling between and was usually based on the sound&#x27;s position in the word rather than etymology: () tended to be used in word final position: (, ), (, ); () tended to be used when the sound occurred between vowels: (, ). While Martin Luther&#x27;s early 16th-century printings also contain spellings such as (), early modern printers mostly changed these to : . Around the same time, printers began to systematically distinguish between (the, that [pronoun]) and (that [conjunction]).

In modern German, the Old and Middle High German is now represented by either , , or, if there are no related forms in which occurs intervocalically, with : (), (), and ().

=== Standardization of use ===
The pre-1996 German use of was codified by the eighteenth-century grammarians Johann Christoph Gottsched (1748) and Johann Christoph Adelung (1793) and made official for all German-speaking countries by the German Orthographic Conference of 1901. In this orthography, the use of was modeled after the use of long and &quot;round&quot;-s in Fraktur. appeared both word internally after long vowels and also in those positions where Fraktur required the second s to be a &quot;round&quot; or &quot;final&quot; s, namely the ends of syllables or the ends of words. In his &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot; (1854) Jacob Grimm called for or to be written for all instances of Middle and Old High German etymological (e.g., instead of from ); however, his etymological proposal could not overcome established usage.

In Austria-Hungary prior to the German Orthographic Conference of 1902, an alternative rule formulated by Johann Christian August Heyse in 1829 had been officially taught in the schools since 1879, although this spelling was not widely used. Heyse&#x27;s rule matches current usage after the German orthography reform of 1996 in that was only used after long vowels.

===Use in Roman type===


In early modern Latin type (antiqua), a ligature similar to modern developed out of a long s followed by a round s (), and as such was used in languages such as Italian in alternation with , usually based on requirements of space on the page. However, despite its resemblance to the modern , this ligature was not commonly used as an equivalent to the Fraktur in German. This ligature generally fell out of use in the eighteenth century, together with the use of long s in antiqua. German works printed in Roman type in the late 18th and early 19th centuries such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte&#x27;s did not provide any equivalent to the .

Jacob Grimm began using in his (1819); however, it varied with word internally. Grimm eventually rejected the use of the character; in their (1838), the Brothers Grimm favored writing it as . The First Orthographic Conference in Berlin (1876) recommended that &quot;ß&quot; be represented as – however, both suggestions were ultimately rejected. In 1879, a proposal for various letter forms was published in the &quot;Journal für Buchdruckerkunst&quot;. A committee of the Typographic Society of Leipzig chose the &quot;Sulzbacher form&quot;. In 1903, it was proclaimed as the new standard for the Eszett in Roman type.

Until the abolition of Fraktur in 1941, it was common for family names to be written with in Fraktur and in Roman type. The formal abolition resulted in inconsistencies in how names are written in modern German (such as between Heuss and Heuß).

===Abolition and attempted abolitions===
The Swiss and Liechtensteiners ceased to use in the twentieth century. This has been explained variously by the early adoption of Roman type in Switzerland, the use of typewriters in Switzerland that did not include in favor of French and Italian characters, and peculiarities of Swiss German that cause words spelled with or to be pronounced with gemination. The Education Council of Zürich had decided to stop teaching the letter in 1935, whereas the Neue Zürcher Zeitung continued to write until 1971. Swiss newspapers continued to print in Fraktur until the end of the 1940s, and the abandonment of ß by most newspapers corresponded to them switching to Roman typesetting. 

When the Nazi German government abolished the use of blackletter typesetting in 1941, it was originally planned to also abolish the use of . However, Hitler intervened to retain , while deciding against the creation of a capital form. In 1954, a group of reformers in West Germany similarly proposed, among other changes to German spelling, the abolition of ; their proposals were publicly opposed by German-language writers Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, and Friedrich Dürrenmatt and were never implemented. Although the German Orthography Reform of 1996 reduced the use of in standard German, Adrienne Walder writes that an abolition outside of Switzerland appears unlikely.

===Development of a capital form===
 
Because had been treated as a ligature, rather than as a full letter of the German alphabet, it had no capital form in early modern typesetting. Moreover, allcaps was not normally used in Fraktur printing. There were, however, proposals to introduce capital forms of for use in allcaps writing (where would otherwise usually be represented as either or ). A capital was first seriously proposed in 1879, but did not enter official or widespread use. The Orthographic Conference of 1903 called for the use of in allcaps until a capital letter could be proposed. Historical typefaces offering a capitalized mostly date to the time between 1905 and 1930. The first known typefaces to include capital were produced by the foundry in Leipzig, in 1905/06. at the time widely advocated the use of this type, but its use nevertheless remained very limited.

The preface to the 1925 edition of the dictionary expressed the desirability of a separate glyph for capital :

The was edited separately in East and West Germany during the 1950s to 1980s. The East German of 1957 (15th ed.) introduced a capital in its typesetting without revising the rule for capitalization. The 16th edition of 1969 still announced that an uppercase was in development and would be introduced in the future. The 1984 edition again removed this announcement and simply stated that there is no capital version of .

In the 2000s, there were renewed efforts on the part of certain typographers to introduce a capital, . A proposal to include a corresponding character in the Unicode set submitted in 2004 was rejected. A second proposal submitted in 2007 was successful, and the character was included in Unicode version 5.1.0 in April 2008 (). The international standard associated with Unicode (UCS), ISO/IEC 10646, was updated to reflect the addition on 24 June 2008. The capital letter was finally adopted as an option in standard German orthography in 2017. As of 2024, is now the preferred option for depicting the character in capital letters, with as a second option.

== Representation ==
===Graphical variants===

The recommendation of the Sulzbacher form (1903) was not followed universally in 20th-century printing. There were four distinct variants of in use in Antiqua fonts:

# without ligature, but as a single type, with reduced spacing between the two letters;
#the ligature of and inherited from the 16th-century Antiqua typefaces;
#a ligature of and , adapting the blackletter ligature to Antiqua; and
#the Sulzbacher form.

The first variant (no ligature) has become practically obsolete. Most modern typefaces follow either 2 or 4, with 3 retained in occasional usage, notably in street signs in Bonn and Berlin. The design of modern tends to follow either the Sulzbacher form, in which (tailed z) is clearly visible, or else be made up of a clear ligature of and .
Use of typographic variants in street signs:

The inclusion of a capital in Unicode in 2008 revived the century-old debate among font designers as to how such a character should be represented. The main difference in the shapes of in contemporary fonts is the depiction with a diagonal straight line vs. a curved line in its upper right part, reminiscent of the ligature of tailed z or of round s, respectively. The code chart published by the Unicode Consortium favours the former possibility, which has been adopted by Unicode capable fonts including Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Courier New, Dejavu Serif, Liberation Sans, Liberation Mono, Linux Libertine and Times New Roman; the second possibility is more rare, adopted by Dejavu Sans. Some fonts adopt a third possibility in representing following the Sulzbacher form of , reminiscent of the Greek (beta); such a shape has been adopted by FreeSans and FreeSerif, Liberation Serif and Verdana.

=== Typing the character ===
In Germany and Austria, a &#x27;ß&#x27; key is present on computer and typewriter keyboards, normally to the right-hand end on the number row. 
The German typewriter keyboard layout was defined in DIN 2112, first issued in 1928.

In other countries, the letter is not marked on the keyboard, but a combination of other keys can produce it. Often, the letter is input using a modifier and the &#x27;s&#x27; key. The details of the keyboard layout depend on the input language and operating system: on some keyboards with US-International (or local &#x27;extended&#x27;) setting, the symbol is created using (or ) in Microsoft Windows, Linux and ChromeOS; in MacOS, one uses on the US, US-Extended, and UK keyboards. In Windows, one can use . On Linux works, and for uppercase. Some modern virtual keyboards show ß when the user presses and holds the &#x27;s&#x27; key.

The HTML entity (for the lowercase form) is codice_1. In TeX and LaTeX, codice_3 produces ß. A German language support package for LaTeX exists in which ß is produced by codice_4 (similar to umlauts, which are produced by codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7 with this package).

Additionally, there are keyboard layouts that accommodate , such as DIN 2137-2 ().

=== Unicode ===

There are two code points in Unicode:
* 

In modern browsers, lowercase &quot;ß&quot; will be converted to &quot;SS&quot; when the element containing it is set to uppercase using codice_8 in Cascading Style Sheets. The JavaScript in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox will convert &quot;ß&quot; to &quot;SS&quot; when converted to uppercase (e.g., codice_9).

The lower-case letter exists in many earlier encodings that covered European languages. In several ISO 8859 and Windows encodings it is at , the value inherited by Unicode. In DOS code pages it is at . Mac OS encodings put it at . Some EBCDIC codes put it at . The upper-case form was rarely, if ever, encoded in single-byte encodings.

<text>Chinchilla refers to either of two species (&quot;Chinchilla chinchilla&quot; and &quot;Chinchilla lanigera&quot;) of crepuscular rodents of the parvorder Caviomorpha, and are native to the Andes mountains in South America. They live in colonies called &quot;herds&quot; at high elevations up to . Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru and Chile, but today, colonies in the wild are known only in Chile. Along with their relatives, viscachas, they make up the family Chinchillidae. They are also related to the chinchilla rat.

The chinchilla has the densest fur of all extant terrestrial mammals, with around 20,000 hairs per square centimeter and 50 hairs growing from each follicle. The chinchilla is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who once wore its dense, velvet-like fur and ate their meat. By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare after being hunted for their notably soft fur. Most chinchillas currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessories are farm-raised. Domestic chinchillas descended from &quot;C. lanigera&quot; are sometimes kept as pets, and may be considered a type of pocket pet.

==Species==

The two living species of chinchilla are &quot;Chinchilla chinchilla&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Chinchilla brevicaudata&quot;) and &quot;Chinchilla lanigera&quot;. &quot;C. chinchilla&quot; has a shorter tail, a thicker neck and shoulders, and shorter ears than &quot;C. lanigera&quot;. The former species is currently facing extinction; the latter, though rare, can be found in the wild. Domesticated chinchillas are thought to be of the &quot;C. lanigera&quot; species.

==Distribution and habitat==

Chinchillas formerly occupied the coastal regions, hills, and mountains of Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Bolivia. Overexploitation caused the downturn of these populations and, as early as 1914, one scientist claimed that the species was headed for extinction. Five years of fieldwork (published in 2007) in Jujuy Province, Argentina, failed to find a single specimen. Populations in Chile were thought extinct by 1953, but the animal was found to inhabit an area in the Antofagasta Region in the late 1900s and early 2000s. The animal may be extinct in Bolivia and Peru, though one specimen found (in a restaurant in Cerro de Pasco) may hail from a native population.

In their native habitats, chinchillas live in burrows or crevices in rocks. They are agile jumpers and can jump up to . Predators in the wild include birds of prey, skunks, felines, snakes and canines. Chinchillas have a variety of defensive tactics, including spraying urine and releasing fur if bitten. In the wild, chinchillas have been observed eating plant leaves, fruits, seeds, and small insects.
In nature, chinchillas live in social groups that resemble colonies, but are properly called herds. Herd sizes can range from 14 members up to 100, and herding behavior is thought to promote both social interaction and protection from predators. They can breed any time of the year, though breeding season typically falls between May and November. They are typically monogamous. Their gestation period is 111 days, longer than most rodents. Due to this long pregnancy, chinchillas are born fully furred and with eyes open. Litters are usually small in number, predominantly two.

==Conservation==

Both species of chinchilla are currently listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to a severe population loss approximated at a 90% global population loss since 2001. The severe population decline has been caused by chinchilla hunting by humans. The long tailed-species was listed on the IUCN Red List as &quot;Very rare and believed to be decreasing in numbers&quot; in 1965. From 1982 to 1996, both species were listed as Indeterminate. In 2006, the long-tailed species was listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; while the short-tailed species was listed as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;. By 2008, both were listed as &quot;Critically Endangered&quot;, and in 2016 they were reclassified as &quot;Endangered&quot; due to limited recovery in some areas.

==Relationship with humans==
===Fur industry===
Chinchilla fur trade on an international level goes back to the 16th century. Their fur is popular due to its extremely soft feel, which is caused by the sprouting of 25 hairs (on average) from each hair follicle. The color is usually very even, which makes it ideal for small garments or the lining of larger ones, though some large pieces can be made entirely from the fur. A single, full-length coat made from chinchilla fur may require as many as 150 pelts, as chinchillas are relatively small. Their use for fur led to the near extinction of one species(C.chinchilla), and put serious pressure on the other(C. lanigera). Though it is illegal to hunt wild chinchillas, they are now on the verge of becoming extinct because of continued poaching. Domesticated chinchillas are still bred for fur.

===As pets===

The domestic chinchilla is descended from &quot;Chinchilla lanigera,&quot; the long-tailed Chinchilla. They are the more common one in the wild, as the other species, &quot;Chinchilla chinchilla&quot;, or short-tailed Chinchilla, has been hunted nearly to extinction. Therefore, domestic chinchillas have thinner bodies, longer tails and larger ears. In the wild, the average life-span of a chinchilla is ten years; however, they could live up to 20 years in human care.

Chinchillas are popular pets, though they require extensive exercise and dental care, due to their teeth continually growing throughout their life span, and since they lack the ability to sweat, they require a temperature-controlled environment.

The animals instinctively clean their fur by taking dust baths, in which they roll around in special dust made of fine pumice, a few times a week; they should not bathe in water, as mold and matting can build up from that. Their thick fur resists parasites, such as fleas, and reduces loose dander.

Pet chinchillas require easy access to food, water, and hiding places, where they can sleep undisturbed for extended periods of time. Chinchillas are typically highly social creatures, so owners should interact often with their pets. They also have sensitive hearing and are easily startled by loud, unexpected noises.

===In scientific research===
Chinchillas have been used in research since the 1950s. Since the 1970s, the prime interest in chinchillas by researchers is their auditory system. Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of &quot;Yersinia&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; infections.

==Veterinary medicine==

===Fractures===
Chinchillas live active lives and can recover well from minor physical injury. Fractures may be problematic, because chinchillas sit on their hind legs and eat with their front paws, so many types of injuries will disturb their natural eating behavior.

===Convulsions===
Chinchilla breeders sometimes report seeing their animals have convulsions. Typically this happens only irregularly and then only for a few seconds, and not more than a few minutes at the most. Convulsions are a symptom that can have many causes, including a brain problem such as hemorrhaging, a vitamin or dietary element deficiency in the diet, or some kind of nervous system injury. If convulsions are observed after chinchillas mate then it is likely related to a circulatory problem. Some chinchillas who are kept in groups have stress convulsions during feeding if they see other chinchillas getting food first. Vitamin B, cardiac medication, or a calcium injection may be used to prevent convulsions.

===Infectious diseases===
Listeriosis is not a typical chinchilla disease, but rats in group housing conditions it can spread as a digestive tract disease in a community. &quot;Pasteurella&quot; can be contracted from food and then transmitted among a group of chinchillas. Symptoms include apathy, digestive disorder, and fever. &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; infections are widely distributed in nature and can affect chinchillas like many other animals. They can cause wide deaths in populations of chinchillas and spontaneous abortion in pregnant chinchillas.

Respiratory tract infections can be caused by many pathogens, but, regardless of cause, usually result in difficult breathing and a nasal discharge. Young chinchilla are more likely to be affected and these infections are unlikely to result in an epidemic, even if transmissible.

Gastrointestinal disorders are observed as either constipation or diarrhea. These are almost always the result of a problem with the diet, but if the diet is optimal, they could be the symptom of an infectious disease. Constipation in chinchillas is difficult to observe in groups because it may not be obvious that an animal is not contributing to the population&#x27;s waste. If it is identified, mild treatments include feeding paraffin to soften the feces.

===Mental health===
Chinchillas are easily distressed, and when they are unhappy, they may exhibit physical symptoms. A common indicator of stress in pet chinchillas is fur-chewing (or fur barbering), an excessive grooming behavior that results in uneven patches of fur; chinchillas may chew their own fur or that of their cagemates. Fur-chewing can sometimes be alleviated through changes in living environment, but is regarded by some experts to be passed genetically from parents to offspring. Usually, fur-chewing itself is a benign symptom that does not cause physiological distress.

Sick chinchillas may stop eating if they are stressed, which can make them even weaker. Chinchillas that live in communities are especially sensitive in their breeding seasons of February to March and August to September. Chinchillas are social animals and are likely to be upset to have their breeding mate changed in breeding season. They are known to be disturbed by a change of diet in these times.

===Pharmaceutical treatment===
Chinchillas may be treated with chloramphenicol, neomycin, or spectinomycin for digestive problems. Sulfonamides dissolved in drinking water may be used. Colistin can be an effective antibiotic.

<text>William Kristol (; born December 23, 1952) is an American neoconservative writer. A frequent commentator on several networks including CNN, he was the founder and editor-at-large of the political magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. Kristol is now editor-at-large of the center-right publication &quot;The Bulwark&quot; and has been the host of &quot;Conversations with Bill Kristol&quot;, an interview web program, since 2014.

Kristol played a leading role in the defeat of the Clinton health care plan of 1993, as well as for advocating the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He has been associated with a number of conservative think tanks. He was chairman of the New Citizenship Project from 1997 to 2005. In 1997, he co-founded the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) with Robert Kagan. He is a member of the board of trustees for the free-market Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a member of the Policy Advisory Board for the Ethics and Public Policy Center, and a director of the Foreign Policy Initiative. He is also one of the three board members of Keep America Safe, a national-security think tank co-founded by Liz Cheney and Debra Burlingame, and serves on the boards of the Emergency Committee for Israel and of the Susan B. Anthony List (as of 2010).

Kristol is a critic of president Donald Trump, a supporter of the Never Trump movement, and a founder and director of Defending Democracy Together, an advocacy organization responsible for such projects as Republicans for the Rule of Law and the Republican Accountability Project.

==Early life and education==
William Kristol was born on December 23, 1952, in New York City into a Jewish family, the son of Irving Kristol and Gertrude Himmelfarb. Irving Kristol was an editor and publisher who served as the managing editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, founded the magazine &quot;The Public Interest,&quot; and was described by Jonah Goldberg as the &quot;godfather of neoconservatism&quot;. Gertrude Himmelfarb was a prominent conservative historian, especially of intellectual history in the U.S. and Great Britain. Kristol attended Collegiate School for Boys in Manhattan. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Harvard University and also a Ph.D. in political science in 1979.

==Career==
In the summer of 1970, Kristol was an intern at the White House. In 1976, Kristol worked for Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#x27;s United States Senate campaign, serving as deputy issues director during the Democratic primary. In 1988, he was the campaign manager for Alan Keyes&#x27;s unsuccessful Maryland Senatorial campaign against Paul Sarbanes. After teaching political philosophy and U.S. politics at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government, Kristol went to work in government in 1985, serving as chief of staff to United States secretary of education William Bennett during the Reagan administration, and later, as chief of staff to the vice president under Dan Quayle in the George H. W. Bush administration. &quot;The New Republic&quot; dubbed Kristol &quot;Dan Quayle&#x27;s brain&quot; when he was appointed the vice president&#x27;s chief of staff.

Kristol served as chairman of the Project for the Republican Future from 1993 to 1994, and as the director of the Bradley Project at the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee in 1993. In 1993, he led conservative opposition to the Clinton health care plan of 1993. In 2003, Kristol and Lawrence F. Kaplan wrote &quot;The War Over Iraq: America&#x27;s Mission and Saddam&#x27;s Tyranny&quot;, in which the authors analyzed the Bush Doctrine and the history of Iraqi-U.S. relations. In the book, Kristol and Kaplan provided support and justifications for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also served as a foreign policy advisor for Senator John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===Media commentator===
After the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress in 1994, Kristol established, along with John Podhoretz, the conservative news magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and managing director of News Corp., financed its creation. Beginning in 1996, Kristol was a panelist on the ABC Sunday news program &quot;This Week&quot;. Following declining ratings, his contract was not renewed three years later.

Kristol was a columnist for &quot;Time&quot; in 2007. The following year, he joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a columnist. Several days after he did so, &quot;Times&quot; public editor Clark Hoyt called his hiring &quot;a mistake,&quot; due to Kristol&#x27;s assertion in 2006 that the &quot;Times&quot; should potentially be prosecuted for having revealed information about the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. Kristol wrote a weekly opinion column for &quot;The New York Times&quot; from January 7, 2008, to January 26, 2009.

For ten years, Kristol was a regular panelist on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; and often contributed to the nightly program &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot;. In 2013, his contract with Fox News expired, and he became a much sought after commentator on several networks. It was announced on &quot;This Week&quot; with George Stephanopoulos on February 2, 2014, that Kristol would be a contributor for ABC News and to that program.

=== Podcast ===
Since the summer of 2014, Kristol has also hosted an online interview program, &quot;Conversations with Bill Kristol&quot;, featuring guests from academic and public life. &quot;Conversations with Bill Kristol&quot; is an American interview program hosted by political analyst and commentator Bill Kristol. The series features in-depth discussions with leading figures in public life, and spans topics from politics and political philosophy to history, foreign policy, economics, and culture. The show aims to foster substantive and thoughtful discourse on pivotal issues facing the nation.

The series debuted in 2014. It is programming of the Foundation for Constitutional Government, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting the study of politics and political philosophy. Bill Kristol, the host, has long been recognized as a leading participant in and analyst of American politics. He was a founder of The Weekly Standard and is a founding director of Defending Democracy Together. Kristol has been a significant voice in American politics for decades.

Each episode of &quot;Conversations with Bill Kristol&quot; features an interview. The program is longform, often more than an hour, which allows guests to share expertise and experiences, and to participate in thoughtful, reflective dialogue. The series has hosted a diverse roster of guests, from scholars and journalists to political strategists and public intellectuals. Notable regular guests including Garry Kasparov, Anne Applebaum, Harvey Mansfield, and Larry Summers have been featured to provide insights into their respective fields and to share their perspectives on a range issues. The program is produced by Kristol and Andy Zwick. Episodes are released biweekly.

== Political views ==

Kristol was key to the defeat of the Clinton health care plan of 1993. In the first of what would become many strategy memos written for Republican policymakers, Kristol said the party should &quot;kill&quot;, not amend, President Clinton&#x27;s health care plan. A later memorandum used the phrase &quot;There is no health care crisis&quot;, which Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole used in his response to Clinton&#x27;s 1994 State of the Union address.

Kristol was a leading proponent of the Iraq War. In 1998, he joined other foreign policy analysts in sending a letter to President Clinton urging a stronger posture against Iraq. Kristol argued that Saddam Hussein posed a grave threat to the United States and its allies: &quot;The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction. In the near term, this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing. In the long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.&quot; In 1998 he and Robert Kagan wrote a New York Times piece where they said &quot;bombing Iraq isn&#x27;t enough&quot; and called on Clinton to invade the country.

In the 2000 presidential election, Kristol supported John McCain. Answering a question from a PBS reporter about the Republican primaries, he said, &quot;No. I had nothing against Governor Bush. I was inclined to prefer McCain. The reason I was inclined to prefer McCain was his leadership on foreign policy.&quot; After the Bush administration developed its response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, Kristol said: &quot;We&#x27;ve just been present at a very unusual moment, the creation of a new American foreign policy.&quot; Kristol ardently supported the Bush administration&#x27;s decision to go to war with Iraq. In 2003, he and Lawrence Kaplan wrote &quot;The War Over Iraq,&quot; in which he described reasons for removing Saddam. Kristol rejected comparisons to Vietnam and predicted a &quot;two-month war, not an eight-year war&quot; during a March 28 C-SPAN appearance.

As the military situation in Iraq began to deteriorate in 2004, Kristol argued for an increase in the number of U.S. troops in Iraq. He also wrote an op-ed strongly criticizing United States secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying he &quot;breezily dodged responsibility&quot; for planning mistakes made in the Iraq War, including insufficient troop levels. In September 2006, he and fellow commentator Rich Lowry wrote, &quot;There is no mystery as to what can make the crucial difference in the battle of Baghdad: American troops.&quot; This was one of the early calls for what became the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 four months later. In December 2008, Kristol wrote that the surge was &quot;opposed at the time by the huge majority of foreign policy experts, pundits, and pontificators,&quot; but that &quot;most of them – and the man most of them are happy won the election, Barack Obama – now acknowledge the surge&#x27;s success.&quot;
Kristol was one of many conservatives to publicly oppose Bush&#x27;s second U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers. &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed, depressed, and demoralized,&quot; he said of Miers. &quot;It is very hard to avoid the conclusion that President Bush flinched from a fight on constitutional philosophy. Miers is undoubtedly a decent and competent person. But her selection will unavoidably be judged as reflecting a combination of cronyism and capitulation on the part of the president.&quot; He was a vocal supporter of the 2006 Lebanon War, stating that the war is &quot;our war too&quot;, referring to the United States. Kristol was an ardent promoter of Sarah Palin, advocating for her selection as the running mate of John McCain in the 2008 United States presidential election months before McCain chose her. However, he later recanted his support for her, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m perfectly willing to say that given what I now know about her, she would not have been a good vice president.&quot;

In response to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, Kristol has supported strong sanctions. In June 2006, at the height of the Lebanon War, he suggested: &quot;We might consider countering this act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. Why wait?&quot; In 2010, Kristol criticized the Obama administration and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Mike Mullen for an unserious approach to Iran. He wrote: &quot;The real question is what form of instability would be more dangerous – that caused by this Iranian government with nuclear weapons, or that caused by attacking this government&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. It&#x27;s time to have a serious debate about the choice between these two kinds of destabilization, instead of just refusing to confront the choice.&quot;

In the 2010 affair surrounding the disclosure of U.S. diplomatic cables, Kristol spoke strongly against the organization and suggested using &quot;our various assets to harass, snatch, or neutralize Julian Assange and his collaborators, wherever they are.&quot; In March 2011, he wrote an editorial in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; arguing that the United States&#x27; military interventions in Muslim countries (including the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War) should not be classified as &quot;invasions,&quot; but rather as &quot;liberations.&quot; Kristol backed President Barack Obama&#x27;s decision to intervene in the Libyan Civil War in 2011 and urged fellow conservatives to support the action.

== Opposition to Donald Trump ==
Kristol vehemently opposed the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for president in 2016. He has continued to express animosity towards Trump&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy aims, and dismay at conservative Republicans who have accommodated themselves to the Trump administration.

In January 2019, Kristol criticized President Trump&#x27;s planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and from Afghanistan. On December 21, Kristol and a group calling itself Republicans for the Rule of Law released an ad encouraging viewers to call their Senators to demand top Trump officials be forced to testify in his impeachment trial.

In March 2020, Kristol endorsed former U.S. vice president Joe Biden for President of the United States. Kristol is founding director of Republican Voters Against Trump, a project of Defending Democracy Together, launched in May 2020. On October 15, Kristol voted for the Democratic ticket. He stated: &quot;Just filled out my early absentee ballot in VA for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris, Mark Warner, and Jennifer Wexton. No regrets at all about this.&quot;

Kristol did an interview with Jewish Insider in 2021 where he said that he identifies as more of a former Republican. Defending Democracy Together spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in January 2024 to support Nikki Haley and run advertisements against Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; reported. After the incumbent U.S. vice president Kamala Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee for U.S. President, Kristol endorsed her on &quot;The Bulwark&quot;.

==Personal life==
Since 1975, Kristol has been married to Susan Scheinberg, whom he met while they were both students at Harvard. Scheinberg holds a Ph.D. in classics. The couple has three children. Their daughter, Anne, is married to writer Matthew Continetti, editor-in-chief of &quot;The Washington Free Beacon&quot; website. Their son, Joseph, served in the U.S. Marine Corps in Afghanistan and worked for the management consulting company McKinsey &amp; Company before taking a job as legislative director for Senator Tom Cotton in 2018. Kristol lives in McLean, Virginia.

<text>Royal Maundy () is a religious service in the Church of England held on Maundy Thursday, the day before Good Friday. At the service, the British monarch or a royal official ceremonially distributes small silver coins known as &quot;Maundy money&quot; (legally, &quot;the King&#x27;s Maundy money&quot;) as symbolic alms to elderly recipients. The coins are technically legal tender, but typically do not circulate due to their silver content and numismatic value. A small sum of ordinary money is also given in lieu of gifts of clothing and food that the sovereign once bestowed on Maundy recipients.

The name &quot;Maundy&quot; and the ceremony itself derive from an instruction, or , of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper that his followers should love one another. In the Middle Ages, English monarchs washed the feet of beggars in imitation of Jesus, and presented gifts and money to the poor. Over time, additional money was substituted for the clothing and other items that had once been distributed. Beginning in 1699 the monarch did not attend the service, sending an official in his place. The custom of royal representatives washing the feet of beggars did not survive the 18th century.

In 1931 Princess Marie Louise attended Royal Maundy, and afterwards suggested that her cousin, King George V, make the distributions the following year. He did so, beginning a new royal custom. Traditionally, the service was held in or near London, in most years in the early-to-mid-20th century at Westminster Abbey; the service is now held in a different church (usually a cathedral) every year. Queen Elizabeth II almost always attended (she was absent only five times in her reign). Recipients were once chosen for their poverty and were entitled to remain as Maundy recipients for life; today new recipients are chosen every year for service to their churches or communities, on the recommendation of clergymen of various Christian denominations. Generally, recipients live in the diocese where the service is held, although this was altered for the 2011 and 2012 services. The 2020 and 2021 services were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with recipients sent their gifts by post. At the 2024 service, Queen Camilla attended in place of her husband, King Charles III, following his diagnosis with cancer.

Maundy money is struck in denominations of one penny, two pence, three pence, and four pence. Until the 18th century the coins given were from the circulating coinage, and it was not until the latter half of the century that the four Maundy coins developed as distinct, noncirculating pieces. The obverse design of the coins features the reigning monarch. The reverse, with a crowned numeral enclosed by a wreath, derives from a design first used during the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, and which has been virtually unaltered since 1822. The coins are presented in two leather purses, a white one containing coins to the value of the same number of pence as the years of the monarch&#x27;s age, and a red purse containing a £5 and a 50p coin. In most years there are fewer than 2,000 complete sets of Maundy money; they are highly sought after by collectors.

== Origins; early and medieval history ==

The word &quot;Maundy&quot; derives from the command or by Christ at the Last Supper, to love one another.
The Gospels relate that on the eve of his Crucifixion, Jesus Christ ate a meal with his disciples. After the meal, it is recorded that Jesus washed their feet, and gave them the following or command: &quot;If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another&#x27;s feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you.&quot; The Latin is the derivation of the word &quot;Maundy&quot;, and the Royal Maundy service evolved from Jesus&#x27; command to his disciples.

By the fourth or fifth century a ceremony had been developed following Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday, in which high Church leaders washed the feet of the poor. The ceremony, known as the , was performed daily in some monasteries; in 992, Bishop Oswald of Worcester died during its performance.

The first English monarch to be recorded as distributing alms at a Maundy service was John, who on 15 April 1210 donated garments, forks, food, and other gifts to the poor of Knaresborough, Yorkshire. John is also the first English monarch to be recorded as giving gifts of small silver coins to the poor when in 1213 he gave 13 pence to each of 13 poor men at a ceremony in Rochester—the number being symbolic of the Twelve Apostles together with either Jesus or an angel. Few details of the 13th century Maundy survive; they are known to have existed from records which show the spending necessary for the gifts to the poor. The monarch was not alone in performing the rituals of the Maundy service; Henry III&#x27;s children assisted him as part of their political and religious training. Henry&#x27;s son, Edward I, was the first monarch to keep the Maundy only on or about Maundy Thursday; before Edward, additional Maundys might be kept during the year. According to Virginia Cole in her study of royal children&#x27;s role in the 13th century Maundy, the service had a political purpose as well, as needing to humble himself by doing the proclaimed the monarch&#x27;s greatness. Attendance at a Maundy service became an obligation for all major European ruling houses.

By 1363 the English monarch performed the and also gave gifts: that year, fifty-year-old Edward III gave fifty pence to each of fifty poor men. It is not known, however, whether it was as yet the practice each year to have the number of pence and the number of recipients track the monarch&#x27;s age: Henry IV was the first monarch to decree that the number of pence given be determined by the monarch&#x27;s age. The ceremony was not always performed on Maundy Thursday; it could be postponed a day to Good Friday by royal command, as it was in 1510. Nobles could hold their own Maundy distributions, as did Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland in the early 16th century, according to a contemporary record: &quot;My Lord useth and accustomyth yerly uppon the said Maundy Thursday when his Lordshipe is at home to gyf yerly as manny Pursses of Lether ... with as manny Penys in every purse to as many poore men as his Lordshipe is Yeres of Aige and one for the Yere of my Lords Aige to come.&quot;

Although Mary I and Elizabeth I differed religiously, both performed elaborate Maundy ceremonies. Records from 1556 show that Mary washed the feet of forty-one poor women (reflecting her age) while &quot;ever on her knees&quot;, and gave them forty-one pence each, as well as gifts of bread, fish, and clothing, donating her own gown to the woman said to be poorest of all. In 1572, disliking the scenes as each woman tried to secure a piece of the royal gown, Elizabeth granted a sum of £1 to each recipient in lieu of the gown, giving it in a red purse. Contemporary writer William Lambarde noted that the money was substituted for the gown &quot;to avoid trouble of suite, which accustomabile was made for that perferment&quot;. In years in which plague was rife, the monarch did not attend, sending an official, usually the Lord High Almoner, to make the distributions and perform the . Even though scented water was used to disguise any unpleasant odours from the poor, the feet were washed three times before the monarch performed the , once by a menial and twice by Court officials. In later years, sweet-smelling nosegays were used to disguise odours—the nosegays are still carried today.

== Post-Restoration ==

Charles I rarely attended the Royal Maundy service. Author Brian Robinson, who traced the development of Royal Maundy, suggests that after the 1660 Stuart Restoration, his son Charles II attempted to gain popularity by assiduous attendance (and distribution of money) at the service. Charles II even attended during the plague years of 1661 and 1663. His brother and successor, James II, performed the ceremony as well. Although there is a record of William III doing so in 1698, most sources state that James was the last to wash the feet of the poor himself, in 1685. There is no record of any attendance by a monarch at the Royal Maundy ceremony after 1698 until 1932, but pre-1725 records are vague. The Lord High Almoner continued to perform the at the Maundy ceremony until 1737. Today, the only traces of the at Royal Maundy are the nosegays and the linen towels worn or carried by several of the officials.

The service was usually held somewhere near London. This was done to suit the monarch&#x27;s convenience: in medieval times, it was held in Windsor, Eton, Richmond, Greenwich, or wherever the monarch happened to be at Eastertime. In 1714, with the monarch no longer present at the ceremony, the service was moved to the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, where it remained until 1890, when the Royal Chapel was given to the Royal United Services Institute. After 1890, by order of Queen Victoria, it was moved to Westminster Abbey, though in years when there was a coronation and the Abbey was closed for preparations, the service was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. From 1954 to 1970, it was held in even-numbered years at Westminster, and in odd-numbered years at provincial cathedrals; since then it has, in most years, been held outside London. When the service was confined to London, recipients were customarily householders who had met their financial obligations to society, but had since fallen on hard times.

The number of recipients continued to track the monarch&#x27;s age. Until the joint reign of William III and Mary II, the recipients were of the same sex as the monarch. During that reign, each of the monarchs made gifts to poor people of their sex, but after Mary&#x27;s death, only men received gifts from William. Beginning with the reign of George I (1714–1727), both men and women have received gifts, each sex in a number corresponding to the monarch&#x27;s age, each recipient receiving that number of pence. Despite the monarch&#x27;s absence, the ceremony was held each year, with the Lord High Almoner or the Sub-Almoner deputising for the sovereign.

The gift of clothing was eliminated for women beginning in 1724, as the recipients immediately tried on the gifts and exchanged ill-fitting ones with each other, a practice thought unseemly in a church. The women were instead given 35 shillings (decimalised as £1.75). For men, the clothing gift was replaced by woollen cloth that year. Men continued to be given cloth until 1883, when royal officials realised that many of the recipients were too poor to have the cloth made into garments and were instead selling it. Men were given 45 shillings (decimalised as £2.25) in lieu of the cloth, an amount increased in 1973 to £3 for both men and women.

There is a record of the 1802 Royal Maundy; it notes that the recipients were given of beef and four threepenny loaves. After the 1837 Maundy, William IV ordered that as the recipients were selling the food gift for less than its full value—they were to be given 30 shillings in food which was sometimes sold by the recipients for as little as five shillings—it was to be replaced by a money gift of 30 shillings. This amount (decimalised into £1.50) is still given. The same year, a report on the Civil List written for the House of Commons proposed eliminating the Royal Maundy: &quot;Considering that the sum distributed annually as alms and charity is applied in a manner suited rather to ancient than modern times and is attended with some expense, it may not be inexpedient to consider whether the purpose of the Royal benevolence might not be more fully attained if some other and better mode of distribution were adopted.&quot; William IV&#x27;s death aged 71 that year and the accession of his 18-year-old niece Victoria resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of Maundy recipients. As at that time a Maundy recipient continued in that status for life, the surplus recipients were placed on waiting lists, and given royal charity through other means. One vacancy occurred a week before the 1838 Maundy when recipient Elizabeth Love died aged 110.

In 1843, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; described a Maundy ceremony:
On the day alluded to a certain number of poor men and women, of each the exact number of our sovereign&#x27;s age, attends divine worship in the Royal Chapel, Whitehall in the morning and afternoon. Bread, meat and fish is distributed to them in large wooden bowls, and a procession formed of the royal almoner or sub-almoner, with other officers, who are decorated with white scarfs and sashes, and each carrying a bouquet of flowers; one of the officers supports a large gold dish or salver, on which are placed small red and white leather bags, the red containing a sovereign, the white the pieces ... termed Maundy Money. One of each of these bags is given to the persons selected to receive the royal bounty; they have likewise given to them cloth, linen, shoes &amp;c., as well as a small maple cup, out of which previous to the termination of the ceremony they drink the Queen&#x27;s health ... These small pieces are, by an order of Government declared current coins of the realm, therefore no one dare refuse to take them if offered in payment, still they are not in reality intended for that purpose.
The drinking of the monarch&#x27;s health, which is believed to have originated with the custom of the loving cup, was abolished in the 19th century, though the exact date is uncertain. In the early 20th century, members of the royal family sometimes attended the Royal Maundy service—Queen Alexandra twice was present. Most Royal Maundy ceremonies in the first part of the century were attended by Princess Helena or by her daughter Princess Marie Louise. In 1931, Marie Louise was present at Royal Maundy and suggested, after the service, that her cousin King George V make the distributions the following year. King George did so in 1932, the only time he was at the service during his reign. In 1936, the year of King George&#x27;s death, the new king Edward VIII made the distribution. George VI, who succeeded in 1936, did not attend until 1940, and then not again until 1944, his place being taken in most years by the Lord High Almoner, Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury.

Until 1956 a recipient, once chosen for the Maundy service, had the right to continue to be a recipient for life. In 1957, with the service leaving London for the first time in over two centuries (it was held in 1957 at St Albans), this became impractical and it was decided that, in future years, recipients would attend once only. To honour the promise to the surviving lifetime appointees, they were given the opportunity to attend whenever the service was held in London, and were sent an equivalent sum by post in years when it was not.

== Modern day ==

Queen Elizabeth II, who first attended Royal Maundy as Princess Elizabeth of York in 1935, was absent from the service only five times during her long reign. She was absent twice following childbirth, and twice because she was visiting other parts of the Commonwealth, and, at age 95, did not attend the 2022 service at St George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor, with Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall standing in her place. Charles&#x27;s first Maundy service as king took place at York Minster on 6 April 2023, accompanied by Queen Camilla. After the announcement in February 2024 that Charles is stepping back from royal duties following a diagnosis of cancer, Camilla deputised for Charles at the 2024 service at Worcester Cathedral, with the King sending an audio message to the Maundy recipients expressing his &quot;great sadness&quot; at his absence.

 Elizabeth II viewed the service as an important part of her devotional life. It was the only occasion on which she visited others to make awards, as recipients of honours usually came to her. According to Ronald Allison and Sarah Riddell in their &quot;Royal Encyclopedia&quot;, the service &quot;has become the occasion of a royal pilgrimage to different parts of the country&quot;. Elizabeth directed that the service not be held in London more often than once in ten years. Westminster Abbey was the site of the 2001 Royal Maundy, and again in 2011. The 2011 service was billed as the first ever televised, but in fact the 1979, 1982 and 1986 services were televised on BBC1.

The ceremony has only been held outside England twice: in 1982, at St David&#x27;s Cathedral in Wales, and 2008, at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Northern Ireland. With the 2017 service at Leicester Cathedral, every Anglican cathedral in England has hosted the Royal Maundy, and all did so with Elizabeth in attendance.

The 2020 and 2021 services were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the gifts to the chosen recipients were sent by post, after the coins were blessed at the Chapel Royal.

The recipients are pensioners, chosen on an interdenominational basis from various Christian churches for their service to their churches and communities. In most years, recipients are nominated by Christian clergy of various denominations in the diocese where the service is held. In 2011, however, as well as recipients representing Westminster Abbey, forty recipients came from the Anglican Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe, which covers continental Europe, and forty from the Diocese of Sodor and Man, which consists of the Isle of Man. Robert Patterson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, while at a conference of Anglican bishops, had invited Elizabeth to his cathedral for Maundy services; he received word that this would be too difficult, but that his diocese could nominate recipients. For 2012, in honour of her Diamond Jubilee, recipients were selected from all 44 dioceses in the United Kingdom for the service at York Minster.

The Yeomen of the Guard are present at the ceremony and serve as &quot;Indoor Guard&quot;; the choir of the Chapel Royal is also present. Six wandsmen, whose original function is uncertain, guide the recipients to their places and render any other help which is needed. Present at the ceremony are four Maundy Children (formally &quot;Children of the Royal Almonry&quot;), two boys and two girls. The original Maundy Children were four old men, charity recipients, whose sole duty was to attend at the Royal Maundy service wearing linen scarves. As their fees for the service amounted to over twenty pounds per year, this was deemed an abuse of charity, and in 1808 the old men were pensioned off and replaced by actual children. The first children appointed from 1808 did not personally attend the service, but their parents received five guineas per year to aid in their education until the age of fourteen, and four other children from schools in the City of Westminster represented them at the service. Today, the Maundy Children are chosen from religious and state schools, and receive a set of Maundy coins for their participation. Officials in the Maundy service wear towels over their clothing, worn over the shoulder and tied at the waist. The linen towels were once retained by their wearers, but since 1883, the same towels, laundered each year, have been used.

In 1968, a royal warrant was granted to Barrow Hepburn and Gale to produce the traditional white and red leather purses, which continues to today. Until 1979, the Queen made two distributions of money in leather purses to each recipient. The first distribution, given to women in green purses and to men in white, was of an allowance in lieu of the clothing formerly given. The white purses used for the clothing allowance may be distinguished from the white purses which contained Maundy money, as the former was tied with a short green string; the latter bears a long red string. The clothing allowance purses had been introduced in 1936; prior to that, the clothing allowance was distributed in a paper packet. In the second distribution two purses were given by the monarch; the red one contained £1.50 for provisions, once given in kind, and the additional sum of £1 mandated by Elizabeth I. The white purses contained the Maundy money. After 1979, the separate distribution of the clothing allowance was discontinued—the gifts have now been consolidated, and recipients thereafter received two purses in a single distribution, one white containing the Maundy coins, and one red containing the other money. The distributions were consolidated so as to reduce the physical strain of the ceremony on Elizabeth as she aged. The red purse contains £1 representing the money for redemption of the monarch&#x27;s gown, £3 in lieu of the clothing once given, and £1.50 in place of the food once presented, totalling £5.50. In 2024, for the ceremony at Worcester Cathedral, the £5.50 not given in Maundy money took the form of a £5 coin with the image of a Tudor dragon and a 50p recognising the Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#x27;s 200th anniversary.

One man and one woman are chosen for each year the monarch has lived (including the year the monarch is currently living), and they receive Maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years. Recipients attend a &quot;Maundy Lecture&quot; in the cathedral in advance of the service to familiarise them with what will happen. The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service, and the Royal Standard flies. The purses are carried into the church by the Yeomen on silver dishes, held above their heads. The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor; some experts believe the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from grabbing at the food prematurely; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed by the smell of fish.

The Order of Service for Royal Maundy is a simple one. It begins with the reading of John 13:34, which contains the from which Royal Maundy evolved. It contains two lessons, the first of which (John 13) also recalls the . The second reading contains that portion of Matthew 25 which describes the Last Judgment. The monarch makes half of the presentations after the first lesson, and half after the second. Anthems, led by the Chapel Royal choir and the local choir, are sung while the distribution is going on, concluding with George Frideric Handel&#x27;s coronation anthem &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot;. The Royal Maundy service concludes with prayers, &quot;God Save the King&quot; and the blessing. Two hymns are sung; there is no address. Six silver dishes are used to hold the gifts; one, the traditional Maundy Dish, forms part of the Royal Regalia and is held at the Tower of London when not in use. All six dishes date from the reign of Charles II; five of the six have been added to the service since 1971. They are held by the Yeomen as the monarch walks about, greeting recipients and giving them their gifts. The Lord High Almoner receives his only recompense for his position if he attends the Royal Maundy service—a small fee, though payable in Maundy money.

The Pope still performs the , as does the Archbishop of Canterbury. In recent years, the has become more popular across Christian denominations, and even as a gesture of humility among those serving the poor. Today, the Royal Maundy ceremony involves a considerable security operation, with drains in the area checked. Two 17-year-old boys were arrested in Wakefield in 2005 for popping balloons in the area of the service, as the sound could have been mistaken for gunfire.

The monarch interacts informally with the Maundy recipients, it is said, some of whom have given gifts in return—one participant handed Queen Elizabeth II a jar of marmalade. Mercia Tapsell, a 71-year-old Maundy recipient who participated in the 1992 ceremony at Chester for her work with the Salvation Army, spoke of the ceremony before her death in July of that year:
It surpassed anything that I ever thought. I didn&#x27;t ever think that I should be in the cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. It&#x27;s really been out of this world. Just to hear &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot;, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it&#x27;s something that I love. And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. And yes, she smiled. She smiled at me.
2023 marked the first mintage of Maundy money depicting Charles III, using the obverse portrait by Martin Jennings; the reverse designs were unchanged.

=== Development and design ===
Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins are known from the time of Charles II onwards. There is no record of any denomination higher than 1d (then struck for circulation in silver) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731; sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. At times when little silver was being struck by the Royal Mint, the coins distributed might bear a previous year&#x27;s date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were struck later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size of the coins was slightly reduced, as the Royal Mint increased the amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin. The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821.

In 1689, the Royal Mint began using a design for the reverse of the four low-denomination silver coins depicting a crowned numeral. The designer is unknown (Richard Lobel, in his catalogue of British coins, suggests the artist was George Bower, an employee of the Royal Mint whose medals bear similar characteristics) but his work has endured, in a revised form, for over 300 years. In 1822 an amended reverse was introduced, and has been struck every year since then in all four denominations. The 1822 reverse design, which places the crowned numeral within an oak wreath, was created by Jean Baptiste Merlen. This design is still struck each year, though the crown was altered in 1888, as was the appearance of the numeral &quot;2&quot; on the twopence. These changes were made by Royal Mint engraver Leonard Charles Wyon. A proposal by the Royal Mint in 1950 to return to the pre-1888 &quot;2&quot; as more artistic was refused by George VI, who felt the current numeral was stylistically similar to the numerals on the other coins, and the pre-1888 &quot;2&quot; was not.

Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) pieces were struck for circulation, bearing the same design as the Maundy 3d. The circulation pieces were initially struck for use in the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent, and these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces. The design of the circulation 3d remained the same as that of the Maundy 3d until 1927, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins. Twopence coins identical to Maundy pieces, intended for colonial use, were struck in 1838, 1843, and 1848.

The original composition of the coins was sterling (0.925) silver. In common with all British silver coins, the fineness was reduced to 0.500 in 1921. In 1947 silver was removed from all circulating British coinage in favour of cupronickel, but as it was felt to be inappropriate to strike Maundy coins in base metal, their fineness was restored to 0.925. On Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, the pound sterling became decimalised, with 100 new pence instead of 20 shillings of 12 pence (240 pence) in a pound. No change was made to the design of the Maundy pieces, and all Maundy pieces, both pre- and post-Decimal Day, are by law deemed denominated in new pence, more than doubling the face value of the pre-1971 pieces. The Maundy pieces continued to use the original obverse design for Queen Elizabeth II by Mary Gillick, although the bust of the queen on other British coins was repeatedly replaced as she aged. At the time of decimalisation, the Royal Mint Advisory Commission recommended the retention out of affection for the Gillick design; this was accepted by the queen.

After seventy years of use of the Gillick portrait on Elizabeth&#x27;s Maundy coinage, coins were distributed in 2023 with a new obverse. These used the official coinage portrait of King Charles by Martin Jennings.

=== Distribution and resale ===

In the 19th century, as many as sixty times the number of pieces needed for the ceremony were struck, due to public interest in the ceremony and the pieces. Beginning in 1846, Queen Victoria requested pieces for her private use, as much as £10 (2,400 pence) per year. Many sets were purchased by coin dealers, others by Mint officials as gifts. Small quantities of Maundy twopences and fourpences (principally the latter) were obtained by colleges at the University of Cambridge for use in making token annual payments. These requests were fulfilled until the middle of the 20th century, after which the Royal Mint refused them; the colleges thereafter used obsolete circulation groats (fourpences), or dispensed with the custom.

According to Robinson, the practice of recipients being asked to sell their gifts &quot;is of long standing&quot;. Robinson recounts a description of the scenes after a Maundy service at the turn of the 19th century:
[A]s soon as the service is over, crowds of buyers flock eagerly around the old people, who take a price for their coins. The rate they usually charge is four or five times the face value of the coins. The purses are sometimes disposed of at from one to two shillings each, depending on the market.
By 1897, Maundy recipients were being urged to sell the small pieces at a premium; there are tales of Americans paying high prices for a set that year, wanting a souvenir of Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.
In 1903, the Royal Mint made its first effort to cut back on the number of pieces distributed, eliminating 200 Mint workers (principally charwomen and labourers) from the distribution list. Until 1908 Maundy sets could be ordered through banks. Beginning in 1909, however, distribution of the pieces was restricted to Maundy recipients and certain officials. Mintage of sets of Maundy money dropped from 9,929 in 1908 to 2,428 the following year. By 1932, Maundy recipients were routinely selling the coins to dealers at a premium. There was little official response to this until the 1960s, when questions were asked in the House of Lords after the press reported that recipients were being approached by dealers after the service and being offered cash for their gifts. In response, the Royal Mint decreased the number of sets available to officials, though Royal Mint employees of long service are offered the opportunity, every few years, to purchase a set. A number of sets are used as prizes for students at Westminster School, a practice said to have begun with Elizabeth I, though this now occurs only in years when the service is held at Westminster Abbey. Sets distributed by the Royal Mint in these ways are not given in purses, but in presentation cases.

In recent years, approximately 1,600–1,900 sets have been minted. Additional sets have been struck for inclusion in special silver proof sets marketed by the Royal Mint in 1996, 2000 and 2006, with a special issue in gold as part of a gold proof set in 2002. Individual Maundy recipients have realised as much as £100 per set of four pieces by selling them on eBay.

<text>The long s, , also known as the medial &quot;s orinitial &quot;s, is an archaic form of the lowercase letter , found mostly in works from the late 8th to early 19th centuries. It replaced one or both of the letters &quot;s&quot; in a double-&quot;s&quot; sequence (e.g., &quot;ſinfulneſs&quot; for &quot;sinfulness&quot; and &quot;poſſeſs&quot; or &quot;poſseſs&quot; for &quot;possess&quot;, but never &quot;poſſeſſ&quot;). The modern letterform is known as the &quot;short&quot;, &quot;terminal&quot;, or &quot;round&quot; &quot;s&quot;. In typography, the long &quot;s&quot; is known as a type of swash letter, commonly referred to as a &quot;swash &quot;s&quot;&quot;. The long &quot;s&quot; is the basis of the first half of the grapheme of the German alphabet ligature letter , ( or , &#x27;sharp &quot;s&quot;&#x27;). As with other letters, the long &quot;s&quot; may have a variant appearance depending on typeface: ſ, ſ, ſ, ſ.

== Rules ==
=== English ===
This list of rules for the long &quot;s&quot; is not exhaustive, and it applies only to books printed during the 17th to early 19th centuries in English-speaking countries. Similar rules exist for other European languages.

Long &quot;s&quot; was always used (&quot;ſong&quot;, &quot;ſubſtitute&quot;) &quot;except&quot;:
* Upper-case letters are always the round &quot;S&quot;; there is no upper-case long &quot;s&quot;.
* A round &quot;s&quot; was always used at the end of a word ending with : &quot;his&quot;, &quot;complains&quot;, &quot;ſucceſs&quot;
** However, long &quot;s&quot; was maintained in abbreviations such as &quot;ſ.&quot; for &quot;ſubſtantive&quot; (substantive), and &quot;Geneſ.&quot; for &quot;Geneſis&quot; (Genesis).
* Before an apostrophe (indicating an omitted letter), a round &quot;s&quot; was used: &quot;us&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;clos&#x27;d&quot;.
* Before or after an &quot;f&quot;, a round &quot;s&quot; was used: &quot;offset&quot;, &quot;ſatisfaction&quot;.
* In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the round &quot;s&quot; was used before &quot;k&quot; and &quot;b&quot;: &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;husband&quot;, , Salisbury, ; in the late 18th century, the long &quot;s&quot; was used instead: &quot;aſk&quot;, &quot;huſband&quot;, &quot;Aileſbury&quot;, &quot;Saliſbury&quot; &quot;Shaftſbury&quot;.
** These two exceptions applied only if the letters were physically adjacent on the page, and long &quot;s&quot; was used if the two were separated by a hyphen and line break, e.g. &quot;off-ſet&quot;, &quot;Saliſ-bury&quot;.
* There were no special exceptions for a double &quot;s&quot;. The first &quot;s&quot; was always long, while the second was long in mid-word (e.g. &quot;poſſeſſion&quot;), or short when at the end of a word (e.g. &quot;poſſeſs&quot;). See, for example, the word &quot;Bleſſings&quot; in the Preamble to the United States Constitution.
** This usage was not universal, and a long followed by a short &quot;s&quot; is sometimes seen even mid-word (e.g. &quot;Miſsiſsippi&quot;).
* Round &quot;s&quot; was used at the end of each word in a hyphenated compound word: &quot;croſs-piece&quot;.
* In the case of a &quot;triple s&quot;, such words were normally hyphenated with a round &quot;s&quot;, e.g. &quot;croſs-ſtitch&quot;, but a round &quot;s&quot; was used even if the hyphen was omitted: &quot;croſsſtitch&quot;.

In handwriting, these rules did not apply—the long &quot;s&quot; was usually confined to preceding a round &quot;s&quot;, either in the middle or at the end of a word—for example, &quot;aſsure&quot;, &quot;bleſsings&quot;.

=== German ===

The general idea is that round s indicates the end of a semantic part. Thus, long ſ is used everywhere except at the end of a syllable, where further conditions need to be true.

The following rules were laid down at the German Orthographic Conference of 1901.

The round s is used:
* at the end of (non-abbreviated) words:&lt;br&gt;e.g. &lt;br&gt;(however: )

* at the end of prefixes, as a connecting s and in compounds at the end of the first part-word, even if the following part-word begins with a long ſ:e.g. 

* in derivations with word formation suffixes that begin with a consonant, such as etc. (not before inflectional endings with &quot;t&quot; and possibly schwa []):&lt;br&gt;e.g. &lt;br&gt;(however: cf. below &quot;ſt&quot;)

* at the end of a syllable, even if the syllable is not the end of a (part-)word, common in names and proper nouns:&lt;br&gt;e.g. &lt;br&gt;Many exceptions apply.

Long ſ is used whenever round s is not used (for s):
* at the beginning of a syllable, i.e. anywhere before the vowel in the center of a syllable:&lt;br&gt;e.g. (syllables: )&lt;br&gt;The same applies for the beginning of a syllable of a suffix like &quot;-ſel, -ſal, -ſam,&quot; etc.: &lt;br&gt;e.g. 

* in &quot;ſp&quot; and &quot;ſt&quot; (since 1901 also &quot;ſz&quot;), unless they arise by happenstance (via a connecting s or composition); that includes flexion suffixes starting with &quot;t&quot;:&lt;br&gt;e.g. (modern orthography; traditionally: ), 

* in multigraphs that represent a single sound such as &quot;ſch&quot; (to represent , but not ) and English &quot;ſh&quot; and doubled consonants &quot;ſſ&quot; and &quot;ſs:&quot;&lt;br&gt;e.g. (modern orthography.; traditionally: ), however: &lt;br&gt;Also applies to double s through assimilation:&lt;br&gt;e.g. 

* before &quot;l, n,&quot; and &quot;r&quot; if an &quot;e&quot; is omitted:&lt;br&gt;e.g. &lt;br&gt;however: 

* before an apostrophe and other forms of abbreviation:&lt;br&gt;e.g. (casual for ), (common abbreviation for )

* when the initial ſ of a word is merged with and has priority over the terminal s of a prefix:&lt;br&gt;e.g. in etc.; in this case, the initial ſ of &quot;ſzend&quot; is merged with the terminal s of the &quot;trans&quot; prefix due to &quot;z&quot; following the ſ.

These rules do not cover all cases and in some corner cases, multiple variants can be found. One such case is whether to apply original semantics (that are largely unknown) or follow spoken syllables; e.g. in vs. as it is spoken &quot;As⋅best&quot;, but comes from Ancient Greek composed of plus , meaning &quot;a&quot; is a prefix, and thus, a long ſ follows.

In Fraktur, the ligature ſt (Unicode: ) as the ligatures ch and ck, is &quot;immune&quot; to spaced setting.

==History==

The long &quot;s&quot; was derived from the old Roman cursive &quot;s&quot;, . When the distinction between majuscule (uppercase) and minuscule (lowercase) letter forms became established, toward the end of the eighth century, it developed a more vertical form. During this period, it was occasionally used at the end of a word, a practice that quickly died but that was occasionally revived in Italian printing between about 1465 and 1480. Thus, the general rule that the long &quot;s&quot; never occurred at the end of a word is not strictly correct, although the exceptions are rare and archaic. The double &quot;s&quot; in the middle of a word was also written with a long &quot;s&quot; and a short &quot;s&quot;, as in: &quot;Miſsiſsippi&quot;. In German typography, the rules are more complicated: short &quot;s&quot; also appears at the end of each component within a compound word, and there are more detailed rules and practices for special cases.

=== Similarity to letter &quot;f&quot; ===

The long &quot;s&quot; is often confused with the minuscule , sometimes even having an &quot;f&quot;-like nub at its middle but on the left side only in various roman typefaces and in blackletter. There was no nub in its italic type form, which gave the stroke a descender that curled to the left and which is not possible without kerning in the other type forms mentioned. For this reason, the short &quot;s&quot; was also normally used in combination with &quot;f&quot;: for example, in &quot;ſatisfaction&quot;.

The nub acquired its form in the blackletter style of writing. What looks like one stroke was actually a wedge pointing downward. The wedge&#x27;s widest part was at that height (x-height) and capped by a second stroke that formed an ascender that curled to the right. Those styles of writing, and their derivatives, in type design had a crossbar at the height of the nub for letters &quot;f&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, as well as for &quot;k&quot;. In roman type, except for the crossbar on &quot;s&quot;, all other cross bars disappeared.

=== Ligatures ===

The long &quot;s&quot; was used in ligatures in various languages. Four examples were , , , and the German letter .

The present-day German letter &quot;ß&quot; ( or ; also used in Low German and historical Upper Sorbian orthographies) is generally considered to have originated in a (Fraktur) ligature of (which is supported by the fact that the second part of the grapheme usually resembles a Fraktur &quot;z&quot;: , hence ), although in Antiqua, the ligature of is used instead. An alternative hypothesis claims that the German letter &quot;ß&quot; originated in Tironian notes.

=== &quot;ſ&quot; and &quot;s&quot; as distinct letters ===
Some old orthographic systems of Slavonic and Baltic languages used and as two separate letters with different phonetic values. For example, the Bohorič alphabet of the Slovene language included , , , . In the original version of the alphabet, majuscule was shared by both letters.

===Decline===

In general, the long &quot;s&quot; fell out of use in roman and italic typefaces in professional printing well before the middle of the 19th century. It rarely appears in good-quality London printing after 1800, though it lingers provincially until 1824 and is found in handwriting into the second half of the nineteenth century, and is sometimes seen later on in archaic or traditionalist printing such as printed collections of sermons. Woodhouse&#x27;s &quot;The Principles of Analytical Calculation&quot;, published by the Cambridge University Press in 1803, uses the long &quot;s&quot; throughout its roman text.

====Abandonment by printers and type founders====

The long &quot;s&quot; disappeared from new typefaces rapidly in the mid-1790s, and most printers who could afford to do so had discarded older typefaces by the early years of the 19th century. Pioneer of type design John Bell (1746–1831), who started the British Letter Foundry in 1788, is often &quot;credited with the demise of the long &quot;s&quot;&quot;. Paul W. Nash concluded that the change mostly happened very fast in 1800, and believes that this was triggered by the Seditious Societies Act. To discourage subversive publications, this required printing to name the identity of the printer, and so in Nash&#x27;s view gave printers an incentive to make their work look more modern.

Unlike the 1755 edition, which uses the long &quot;s&quot; throughout, the 1808 edition of the &quot;Printer&#x27;s Grammar&quot; describes the transition away from the use of the long &quot;s&quot; among type founders and printers in its list of available sorts:

An individual instance of an important work using &quot;s&quot; instead of the long &quot;s&quot; occurred in 1749, with Joseph Ames&#x27;s &quot;Typographical Antiquities&quot;, about printing in England 1471–1600, but &quot;the general abolition of long &quot;s&quot; began with John Bell&#x27;s British Theatre (1791)&quot;.

In Spain, the change was accomplished mainly between the years 1760 and 1766; for example, the multivolume made the switch with volume 16 (1762). In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793: François Didot designed Didone to be used substantially without long &quot;s&quot;. The change happened in Italy at about the same time: Giambattista Bodoni also designed his Bodoni typeface without long &quot;s&quot;. Printers in the United States stopped using the long &quot;s&quot; between 1795 and 1810: for example, acts of Congress were published with the long &quot;s&quot; throughout 1803, switching to the short &quot;s&quot; in 1804. In the US, a late use of the long &quot;s&quot; was in &quot;Low&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;, which was published between 1805 and 1811. Its reprint in 1816 was one of the last such uses recorded in the US. The most recent recorded use of the long &quot;s&quot; typeset among English printed Bibles can be found in the Lunenburg, Massachusetts, 1826 printing by W. Greenough and Son. The same typeset was used for the 1826 printed later by W. Greenough and Son, and the statutes of the United Kingdom&#x27;s colony Nova Scotia also used the long &quot;s&quot; as late as 1816. Some examples of the use of the long and short &quot;s&quot; among specific well-known typefaces and publications in the UK include the following:
* The Caslon typeface of 1732 has the long &quot;s&quot;.
* The Caslon typeface of 1796 has the short &quot;s&quot; only.
* In the UK, &quot;The Times&quot; of London made the switch from the long to the short &quot;s&quot; with its issue of 10 September 1803.
* The Catherwood typeface of 1810 has the short &quot;s&quot; only.
* &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 5th edition, completed in 1817, was the last edition to use the long &quot;s&quot;. The 1823 6th edition uses the short &quot;s&quot;.
* The Caslon typeface of 1841 has the short &quot;s&quot; only.
* Two typefaces from Stephenson Blake, both 1838–1841, have the short &quot;s&quot; only.

When the War of 1812 began, the contrast between the non-use of the long &quot;s&quot; by the United States, and its continued use by the United Kingdom, is illustrated by the Twelfth US Congress&#x27;s use of the short &quot;s&quot; of today in the US declaration of war against the United Kingdom, and, in contrast, the continued use of long &quot;s&quot; within the text of Isaac Brock&#x27;s counterpart document responding to the declaration of war by the US.

Early editions of Scottish poet Robert Burns that have lost their title page can be dated by their use of the long &quot;s&quot;; that is, James Currie&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Works of Robert Burns&quot; (Liverpool, 1800 and many reprintings) does not use the long &quot;s&quot;, while editions from the 1780s and early 1790s do.

In printing, instances of the long &quot;s&quot; continue in rare and sometimes notable cases in the UK until the end of the 19th century, possibly as part of a consciously antiquarian revival of old-fashioned type. For example:
* The Chiswick Press reprinted the Wyclyffite New Testament in 1848 in the Caslon typeface, using the long &quot;s&quot;; Chiswick Press, run by Charles Whittingham II (nephew of Charles Whittingham) from c. 1832–1870s, reprinted classics like Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in a typeface of Caslon that included the long &quot;s&quot;.
* The &quot;antiqued&quot; first edition of Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The History of Henry Esmond&quot; (1852), a historical novel set in the eighteenth century, prints long &quot;s&quot;, and not just when doubled as in &quot;mistreſs&#x27;s&quot;.
* Mary Elizabeth Coleridge&#x27;s first volume of poetry, &quot;Fancy&#x27;s Following&quot;, published in 1896, was printed with the long &quot;s&quot;.
* Collections of sermons were published using the long &quot;s&quot; until the end of the 19th century.

In Germany, Fraktur-family typefaces (such as Tannenberg, used by Deutsche Reichsbahn for station signage, as illustrated above) continued in widespread official use until the &quot;Normal Type&quot; decree of 1941 required that they be phased out. (Private use had already largely ceased.) The long &quot;s&quot; survives in Fraktur typefaces.

====Eventual abandonment in handwriting====
After its decline and disappearance in printing in the early years of the 19th century, the long &quot;s&quot; persisted into the second half of the century in manuscript. In handwriting used for correspondence and diaries, its use for a single &quot;s&quot; seems to have disappeared first: most manuscript examples from the 19th century use it for the first &quot;s&quot; in a double &quot;s&quot;. For example,
* Charlotte Brontë used the long &quot;s&quot;, as the first in a double &quot;s&quot;, in some of her letters, e.g., &quot;Miſs Austen&quot; in a letter to the critic G. H. Lewes, 12 January 1848; in other letters, however, she uses the short &quot;s&quot;, for example in an 1849 letter to Patrick Brontë, her father. Her husband Arthur Bell Nicholls used the long &quot;s&quot; in writing to Ellen Nussey of Brontë&#x27;s death.
* Edward Lear regularly used the long &quot;s&quot; in his diaries in the second half of the 19th century; for example, his 1884 diary has an instance in which the first &quot;s&quot; in a double &quot;s&quot; is long: &quot;Addreſsed&quot;.
* Wilkie Collins routinely used the long &quot;s&quot; for the first in a double &quot;s&quot; in his manuscript correspondence; for example, he used the long &quot;s&quot; in the words &quot;mſs&quot; (manuscripts) and &quot;needleſs&quot; in a 1 June 1886 letter to Daniel S. Ford.

For these as well as others, the handwritten long &quot;s&quot; may have suggested type and a certain formality as well as the traditional. Margaret Mathewson &quot;published&quot; her &quot;Sketch of 8 Months a Patient in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, A.D. 1877&quot; of her experiences as a patient of Joseph Lister in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by writing copies out in manuscript. In place of the first &quot;s&quot; in a double &quot;s&quot;, Mathewson recreated the long &quot;s&quot; in these copies, a practice widely used for both personal and business correspondence by her family, who lived on the remote island of Yell, Shetland. The practice of using the long &quot;s&quot; in handwriting on Yell, as elsewhere, may have been a carryover from 18th-century printing conventions, but it was not unfamiliar as a convention in handwriting.

==Modern usage==
The long &quot;s&quot; survives in elongated form, with an italic-styled curled descender, as the integral symbol () used in calculus. Gottfried Leibniz based the character on the Latin (&#x27;sum&#x27;), which he wrote &quot;ſumma&quot;. This use first appeared publicly in his paper &quot;De Geometria&quot;, published in &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; of June 1686, but he had been using it in private manuscripts at least since 29 October 1675. The integral of a function with respect to a real variable over the interval is typeset as:

In linguistics, a similar character (, called &quot;esh&quot;) is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet, in which it represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative, the first sound in the English word &quot;ship&quot;.

In Nordic and German-speaking countries, relics of the long &quot;s&quot; continue to be seen in signs and logos that use various forms of fraktur typefaces. Examples include the logos of the Norwegian newspapers and ; the packaging logo for Finnish pastilles; and the German logo.

The long &quot;s&quot; exists in some current OpenType digital fonts that are historic revivals, like Caslon, Garamond, and Bodoni.

Some Latin alphabets devised in the 1920s for some Caucasian languages used the for some specific sounds. These orthographies were in actual use until 1938. Some of these developed a capital form which resembles the IPA letter .

In the 1993 Turkmen orthography, represented ; however, it was replaced by 1999 by the letter . The capital form was , which was replaced by .

=== In Unicode ===

==Solidus or slash ==

An echo of the long &quot;s&quot; survives today in the form of the mark , popularly known as a &quot;slash&quot; but formally named a solidus. The mark is an evolution of the long &quot;s&quot; which was used as the abbreviation for &#x27;shilling&#x27; in Britain&#x27;s pre-decimal currency, originally written as in 7ſ 6d, later as &quot;7/6&quot;, meaning &quot;seven shillings and six pence&quot;.

<text>Willow is a 1988 American dark fantasy adventure film directed by Ron Howard and produced by Nigel Wooll. The film was executive produced by George Lucas and written by Bob Dolman from a story by Lucas. The film stars Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Warwick Davis, Billy Barty, and Jean Marsh. Davis portrays the title character, an aspiring magician who teams up with a disaffected warrior (Kilmer) to protect a young baby princess from an evil queen (Marsh).

Lucas conceived the idea for the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the post-production phase of &quot;Cocoon&quot; in 1985. Bob Dolman was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts that Lucas was actively involved in developing. It was finished in late 1986. It was then set up at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and principal photography began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place in Dinorwic quarry in Wales with some at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, as well as a small section in New Zealand. Industrial Light &amp; Magic created the visual effects and animation sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital morphing technology.

The film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics with praise for the visual effects and character designs but criticisms for its direction and plot. It grossed $137.6 million worldwide against a $35 million budget. While not the blockbuster some expected, it turned a profit based on international box office returns and strong home video and television returns. It received two Academy Award nominations. A television series that served as a sequel to the film was released on Disney+ in 2022.

==Plot==

In a fantasy world, the evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda of Nockmaar hears of a prophecy that a child with a special rune birthmark will bring about her downfall. She imprisons all pregnant women in her realm. The child is born, but her mother persuades the midwife to smuggle the baby out of the castle. Bavmorda sends her Nockmaar Hounds after the midwife. With the hounds closing in on her, the midwife sets the baby adrift on a tangle of dried grass in a river before succumbing to the hounds. Meanwhile, Bavmorda sends her daughter Sorsha and an army led by General Kael to hunt down the baby.

Downriver, a village of Nelwyn (a race of dwarves) prepares for a festival. The baby is found by the children of farmer and aspiring sorcerer Willow Ufgood, and his family takes her in. At the festival, a Nockmaar hound arrives and attacks cradles. After Nelwyn warriors kill it, Willow presents the baby to the village leader as a possible reason for the hound&#x27;s appearance. The leader orders the baby must return to a Daikini (the Nelwyn&#x27;s name for &quot;tall people&quot;) family, so Willow and volunteers set out with the baby to find one.

At a crossroads, they find Madmartigan, a mercenary trapped in a crow&#x27;s cage, who offers to take the baby in exchange for his freedom. Most Nelwyn think they should give him the baby, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, causing the others to leave for home. After meeting Madmartigan&#x27;s old comrade Airk, riding with an army to attack Bavmorda, Willow agrees to Madmartigan&#x27;s terms.

On the way home, Willow and Meegosh discover that some brownies have stolen the baby, and pursue them. They are captured by the brownies, but Fairy Queen Cherlindrea frees them and explains the baby is Elora Danan, the foretold Princess of Tir Asleen. She gives Willow a magic wand and sends him to find aging enchantress Fin Raziel.

Willow sends Meegosh home, and continues the journey in the company of two brownies. At a tavern, he re-encounters Madmartigan, who is disguising himself as a woman to hide from his mistress&#x27;s husband Llug. Sorsha and Kael&#x27;s army arrives, but Madmartigan is revealed as a man to Llug, who starts a brawl which helps Willow and Madmartigan escape with Elora.

Madmartigan allows Willow to follow him to the lake where Raziel lives. They are captured soon thereafter, along with Raziel, who was turned into a brushtail possum by Bavmorda. Willow tries to restore her, but turns her into a rook.

One of the brownies accidentally doses Madmartigan with love potion. He declares undying love for Sorsha, but she is skeptical. Willow&#x27;s party flees, finding Airk and the remnants of his army after Bavmorda defeated them. When the Nockmaar army pursues, Madmartigan takes Sorsha hostage, and they flee once more. However, Sorsha escapes.

Willow&#x27;s party arrives at Tir Asleen, only to find it cursed and overrun with trolls. Kael&#x27;s army arrives, and Madmartigan and Willow attempt to fend them off. Willow accidentally turns a troll into a giant two-headed monster with the wand, and in the ensuing chaos, Kael kidnaps Elora. Sorsha, realizing she loves Madmartigan, defects to his side. Airk&#x27;s army arrives, but Kael escapes with Elora and makes his way to Nockmaar Castle. Bavmorda prepares a ritual to banish Elora from the world forever.

Willow&#x27;s party and Airk&#x27;s army arrive at Nockmaar Castle, but Bavmorda casts a spell to turn them all into pigs. Willow, having used the wand to protect himself, finally restores Raziel to her human form. She breaks Bavmorda&#x27;s spell, and Willow&#x27;s army tricks their way into the castle. Kael slays Airk, but Madmartigan avenges him, as Willow, Sorsha, and Raziel confront Bavmorda in the ritual chamber. Bavmorda incapacitates Raziel and Sorsha. Willow uses sleight-of-hand to trick Bavmorda into thinking he made Elora vanish. Bavmorda, unnerved, moves to attack him, but in doing so accidentally completes the ritual while standing over the altar, banishing herself.

During celebrations at the restored Tir Asleen, Willow is gifted a spellbook by Raziel. Leaving Elora in the care of Madmartigan and Sorsha, Willow returns home to his village and family in triumph.

===Development===
George Lucas conceived the idea for the film (originally titled &quot;Munchkins&quot;) in 1972. Similarly to his intent in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he created &quot;a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience&quot;. During the production of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas &quot;thought it would be great to use a little person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea.&quot;

Lucas explained that he had to wait until the mid-1980s to make the film because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision. Meanwhile, actor-turned-director Ron Howard was looking to do a fantasy film. He was at Industrial Light &amp; Magic during the post-production phase of &quot;Cocoon&quot;, when he was first approached by Lucas to direct &quot;Willow&quot;. He had previously starred in Lucas&#x27;s &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared a symbiotic relationship similar to the one he enjoyed with Steven Spielberg. Howard nominated Bob Dolman to write the screenplay based on Lucas&#x27;s story. Dolman had worked with him on a 1983 television pilot called &quot;Little Shots&quot; that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman&#x27;s work on the sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;.

Dolman joined Howard and Lucas at Skywalker Ranch for a series of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986. Pre-production began in late 1986. Various major film studios turned down the chance to distribute and cofinance it with Lucasfilm because they believed the fantasy genre was unsuccessful. This was largely due to films such as &quot;Krull&quot;, &quot;Legend&quot;, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. Lucas took it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which was headed by Alan Ladd Jr. Ladd and Lucas shared a relationship as far back as the mid-1970s, when Ladd, running 20th Century Fox, greenlit Lucas&#x27;s idea for &quot;Star Wars&quot;. However, in 1986, MGM was facing financial troubles, and major investment in a fantasy film was perceived as a risk. Ladd advanced half of the $35 million budget in return for theatrical and television rights, leaving Lucasfilm with home video and pay television rights to offer in exchange for the other half. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video paid $15 million to Lucas in exchange for the video rights.

Lucas named the character of General Kael (Pat Roach) after film critic Pauline Kael, a fact that was not lost on Kael in her printed review of the film. She referred to General Kael as an &quot;homage a moi&quot;. Similarly, the two-headed dragon was called an &quot;Eborsisk&quot; after film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on April 2, 1987, and ended the following October. Interior footage took place at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, while location shooting took place in Dinorwic quarry, Wales, and New Zealand. Lucas initially visualized shooting the film similar to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, with studio scenes at Elstree and locations in Northern California, but the idea eventually faded. However, some exteriors were done around Skywalker Ranch and on location at Burney Falls, near Mount Shasta. The Chinese government refused Lucas the chance for a brief location shoot. He then sent a group of photographers to South China to photograph specific scenery, which was then used for background blue screen footage. Tongariro National Park in New Zealand was chosen to house Bavmorda&#x27;s castle.

Some of the waterfalls scenes for the movie were shot at Burney Falls in Northern California, although Powerscourt Waterfall in Ireland was also used for other scenes.

===Visual effects and design===

Lucasfilm&#x27;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) created the visual effects and animation sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites what he thinks is the appropriate spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise and, finally, a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM VFX supervisor Dennis Muren considered using CGI stop-motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late 1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.

Muren found both stop-motion and optical effects to be too technically challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The techniques developed for the sequence were later utilized by ILM for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;.

The head of ILM&#x27;s animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film&#x27;s animation sequences.

==Soundtrack==

The film score was composed and conducted by James Horner and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. According to Horner, &quot;I am a musicologist, a doctor of music. Therefore I listened to, studied and analysed a lot of music. I also enjoy metaphors, the art of quoting and of cycles. The harmonic draft of the &quot;Willow&quot; score, and most particularly its spiritual side, came from such a cycle, from such mythology and music history that I was taught, and that I myself convey with my own emotions and compositions.&quot;

Eclectic influences on the score include Leoš Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, &quot;The Nine Splendid Stags&quot; from Béla Bartók, Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Dance&quot; for the theater play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, and compositions by Sergei Prokofiev.

&quot;Willow&#x27;s Theme&quot; purposefully (see Horner&#x27;s quote above) contains a reworking/alteration of part of the theme of the first movement (&quot;Lebhaft&quot;) of Robert Schumann&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 referencing it, while &quot;Elora Danan&#x27;s Theme&quot; shows a reference to the Bulgarian folk song &quot;Mir Stanke Le&quot; (Мир Станке ле), also known as the &quot;Harvest Song from Thrace&quot;.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film was shown and promoted at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. It was released on May 20, 1988, in 1,209 theaters, earning $8,300,169 in its opening weekend, placing number one at the weekend box office. Lucas had hoped it would earn as much money as &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, but the film faced early competition with &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot;, &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Rambo III&quot;. Grossing $57.3 million at the box office in the United States and Canada, it was not the blockbuster hit insiders had anticipated. The film opened in Japan in July and grossed $16.7 million in its first seven weeks, MGM&#x27;s highest-grossing film in Japan at the time and went on to gross $20.3 million there. It performed well in other international markets, grossing $80.3 million for a worldwide total of $137.6 million. Strong home video, and television sales added to its profits.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Willow&quot; was released to mixed reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Lucas&#x27;s storytelling, but was critical of Ron Howard&#x27;s direction. &quot;Howard appears to have had his hands full in simply harnessing the special effects,&quot; Maslin said.

Siskel &amp; Ebert gave it Two Thumbs Down.

Desson Thomson writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, explained &quot;Rob Reiner&#x27;s similar fairytale adventure &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (which the cinematographer Adrian Biddle also shot) managed to evoke volumes more without razzle-dazzle. It&#x27;s a sad thing to be faulting Lucas, maker of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, for forgetting the tricks of entertainment.&quot; Mike Clark in &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that &quot;the rainstorm wrap-up, in which Good edges Evil is like &quot;Led Zeppelin Meets The Wild Bunch&quot;. The film is probably too much for young children and possibly too much of the same for cynics. But any 6–13-year-old who sees this may be bitten by the ’movie bug’ for life.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 61st Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects. It won Best Costume Design at the Saturn Awards, where it was also nominated for Warwick Davis for Best Performance by a Younger Actor (lost to Fred Savage for &quot;Vice Versa&quot;) and Jean Marsh for Best Supporting Actress (lost to Sylvia Sidney for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;). It also lost Best Fantasy Film and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation to &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. It was also nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Screenplay, which lost to &quot;Cocktail&quot; and Worst Supporting Actor for Billy Barty, who lost to Dan Aykroyd for &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS, Betamax, Video 8, and LaserDisc on November 22, 1988 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video and had multiple re-releases on VHS in the 1990s under Columbia TriStar Home Video as well as a Widescreen LaserDisc in 1995. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment re-released the film on VHS and on DVD for the first time as a &quot;special edition&quot; on November 27, 2001, both of which were THX certified. The release included an audio commentary by Warwick Davis and two &quot;making of&quot; featurettes. In the commentary, Davis confirms that there were a number of &quot;lost scenes&quot; previously rumored to have been deleted from it including a battle in the valley, Willow battling a boy who transforms into a fish-like monster in a lake while retrieving Fin Raziel, and an extended sorceress duel at the climax. George Lucas and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc on March 12, 2013, with an all-new digital transfer overseen by Lucasfilm. Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm (and 21st Century Fox&#x27;s assets), the film was re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital (for the first time) on January 29, 2019, and was later made available to stream on Disney+ when the service launched on November 12, 2019. A 4K UHD Blu-ray release is scheduled for December 10, 2024.

==Other media==
===Board game===
In 1988, Tor Books released The Willow Game, a two- to six-player adventure board game based on the film and designed by Greg Costikyan.

===Video games===
Three video games based on the film were released. Mindscape published an action game in 1988 for Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS. Japanese game developer Capcom published two different games in 1989 based on the film; the first &quot;Willow&quot; is a platform game for the arcades and the second &quot;Willow&quot; game is a role-playing game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

===Novels===
Wayland Drew adapted Lucas&#x27;s story into a film novel, providing additional background information to several major characters, while Joan Vinge adapted the story into another novelization. Both included various additional scenes, including an encounter with a lake monster near Raziel&#x27;s island which was filmed, but ultimately not used in the movie. A segment of that scene&#x27;s filmed material can be found in the DVD&#x27;s &quot;Making of Willow&quot; documentary. 

Lucas outlined the &quot;Chronicles of the Shadow War&quot; trilogy to follow the film and hired comic book writer/novelist Chris Claremont to adapt them into a series of books. They take place about fifteen years after the original film and feature the teenage Elora Danan as a central character.

#&quot;Shadow Dawn&quot; (1996) 
#&quot;Shadow Star&quot; (2000) 

===Television series===
Beginning in 2005, Lucas and Davis discussed the possibility of a television series serving as a sequel to &quot;Willow&quot;. Throughout the years, in various interviews, Davis expressed interest in reprising his role as the title character.

In May 2018, Howard confirmed that there were ongoing discussions regarding a sequel, while confirming the project would not be called &quot;Willow 2&quot;. In 2019, Ron Howard announced that a sequel television series was currently in development, with intentions for the series to be exclusively released on the Disney+ streaming service. Jonathan Kasdan would be involved in the television series, while Warwick Davis would reprise his role from the original film. Creator George Lucas would not participate in this series.

In October 2020, the series was officially green-lit by Disney+, with Ron Howard set to executive produce the series alongside Kasdan, Wendy Mericle, and Jon M. Chu. Chu would direct the series first episode, with Kasdan and Mericle serving as showrunners, Warwick Davis reprising his role as Willow Ufgood, and Bob Dolman serving as a consulting producer. In December 2020, it was announced the show would be released in 2022. In January 2021, Chu left his directorial duties due to production moving towards the summer and it corresponding with birth of his next child.

That same month, it was revealed that Jonathan Entwistle had officially been hired to replace Chu as director, with filming commencing in Spring 2021 in Wales. However, due to production delays as a result of a recasting, Entwistle also exited the series, with Stephen Woolfenden coming in to direct the first two episodes of the series.

In November 2021, a promo video featuring the cast of the series was released for Disney+ Day. The new live-action series premiered on November 30, 2022 on Disney+. The series was cancelled in March 2023 and was removed from streaming on May 26, 2023.

<doc id="198317" wikidata="Q740716" url="?curid=198317" title="Clyde Tolson">
<text>Clyde Anderson Tolson (May 22, 1900 – April 14, 1975) was an American law enforcement officer who was the second-ranking official of the FBI from 1930 until 1972, from 1947 titled Associate Director, primarily responsible for personnel and discipline. He was the protégé and long-time top deputy of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.

==Early life==
Tolson was born in Laredo, Missouri to James William Tolson, a farmer and railroad freight guard, and Joaquin Miller Tolson (née Anderson). His brother, Hillory Alfred Tolson (1887–1983), was assistant director of the National Park Service, executive director of the White House Historical Association, and an FBI agent before entering the Park Service. Tolson graduated from Laredo High School in 1915 and attended Cedar Rapids Business College, from which he graduated in 1918.

==Early career==
From 1919 to 1928, Tolson was confidential secretary for three Secretaries of War: Newton D. Baker, John W. Weeks, and Dwight F. Davis. He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at George Washington University in 1925 and a Bachelor of Laws from the same institution in 1927. While attending George Washington, Tolson became a member of the Delta Pi chapter of Sigma Nu.

==Career==
In 1928, Tolson applied to the FBI and was hired as a special agent later that year. Tolson reportedly indicated on his application that he wanted to use the job as a stepping stone to gain experience and earn enough money to open a law practice in Cedar Rapids. After working in the FBI&#x27;s Boston and Washington, D.C., field offices, he became the chief FBI clerk and was promoted to assistant director in 1930.

In 1936, Tolson joined Hoover to arrest bank robber Alvin Karpis. Later that year, he survived a gunfight with gangster Harry Brunette. In 1942, Tolson participated in capturing Nazi saboteurs on Long Island and in Florida. In 1947, he was made FBI Associate Director with duties in budget and administration.

==Relationship with Hoover==
It has been stated that J. Edgar Hoover described: &quot;They rode to and from work together, ate lunch together, and often traveled together on official or unofficial business.&quot; Their relationship has been described as &quot;what many considered a &#x27;spousal&#x27; relationship between the two men&quot;. Some authors dismissed the rumors about Hoover&#x27;s sexual orientation and possible intimate relationship with Tolson, while others have described them as probable or even confirmed, and still others reported the rumors without stating an opinion. The two men often spent weekends together in New York, Christmas season together in Florida, and the start of the Del Mar horse racing season together in California.

When Hoover died in 1972, Tolson inherited his estate of US$551,000 ($ million today), moved into his house, and accepted the U.S. flag draped on Hoover&#x27;s coffin.

==Later life and death==
In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded him the President&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service, saying that Tolson &quot;has been a vital force in raising the proficiency of law enforcement at all levels and in guiding the Federal Bureau of Investigation to new heights of accomplishment through periods of great National challenge.&quot; Hoover kept Tolson employed in the FBI even after Tolson became too old for police duty and passed the retirement age.

After Hoover&#x27;s death on May 2, 1972, Tolson was briefly the acting head of the FBI. L. Patrick Gray became acting director on May 3. Citing ill health, Tolson retired from the bureau on May 4, the day of Hoover&#x27;s funeral. Mark Felt was appointed to Tolson&#x27;s position.

After Tolson left the FBI, his health began to decline further. In 1975, Tolson suffered a stroke and remained somewhat frail for the remainder of his life. On April 10, 1975, Tolson was admitted to Doctors Community Hospital in Washington, D.C., for kidney failure. He died there four days later of heart failure at the age of 74. Tolson is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C., near Hoover&#x27;s grave.

==Depictions in media==
Tolson has been depicted numerous times in novels, television, and movies, including:
*The 1977 film &quot;The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; portrayed by Dan Dailey
*The 1984 TV movie &quot;Concealed Enemies&quot; portrayed by Ralph Byers

<doc id="198319" wikidata="Q477921" url="?curid=198319" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">
<text>In physics, Hamiltonian mechanics is a reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics that emerged in 1833. Introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, Hamiltonian mechanics replaces (generalized) velocities formula_1 used in Lagrangian mechanics with (generalized) &quot;momenta&quot;. Both theories provide interpretations of classical mechanics and describe the same physical phenomena.

Hamiltonian mechanics has a close relationship with geometry (notably, symplectic geometry and Poisson structures) and serves as a link between classical and quantum mechanics.

== Overview ==
=== Phase space coordinates (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) and Hamiltonian &quot;H&quot; ===
Let formula_2 be a mechanical system with configuration space formula_3 and smooth Lagrangian formula_4 Select a standard coordinate system formula_5 on formula_6 The quantities formula_7 are called &quot;momenta&quot;. (Also &quot;generalized momenta&quot;, &quot;conjugate momenta&quot;, and &quot;canonical momenta&quot;). For a time instant formula_8 the Legendre transformation of formula_9 is defined as the map formula_10 which is assumed to have a smooth inverse formula_11 For a system with formula_12 degrees of freedom, the Lagrangian mechanics defines the &quot;energy function&quot;
formula_13

The Legendre transform of formula_9 turns formula_15 into a function formula_16 known as the . The Hamiltonian satisfies
formula_17
which implies that
formula_18
where the velocities formula_19 are found from the (formula_12-dimensional) equation formula_21 which, by assumption, is uniquely solvable for . The (formula_22-dimensional) pair formula_23 is called &quot;phase space coordinates&quot;. (Also &quot;canonical coordinates&quot;).

=== From Euler–Lagrange equation to Hamilton&#x27;s equations ===
In phase space coordinates , the (formula_12-dimensional) Euler–Lagrange equation
formula_25
becomes &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s equations&quot; in formula_22 dimensions

{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial \boldsymbol{p}},\quad
\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

{\partial \boldsymbol{p}} &amp;= \dot\boldsymbol{q} \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}} &amp;= -\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \boldsymbol{q}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Besides, since formula_27, the Euler–Lagrange equations yield
formula_28

=== From stationary action principle to Hamilton&#x27;s equations ===
Let formula_29 be the set of smooth paths formula_30 for which formula_31 and formula_32 The action functional formula_33 is defined via
formula_34
where , and formula_35 (see above). A path formula_36 is a stationary point of formula_37 (and hence is an equation of motion) if and only if the path formula_38 in phase space coordinates obeys the Hamilton&#x27;s equations.

=== Basic physical interpretation ===

A simple interpretation of Hamiltonian mechanics comes from its application on a one-dimensional system consisting of one nonrelativistic particle of mass . The value formula_39 of the Hamiltonian is the total energy of the system, in this case the sum of kinetic and potential energy, traditionally denoted and , respectively. Here is the momentum and is the space coordinate. Then
formula_40
 is a function of alone, while is a function of alone (i.e., and are scleronomic).

In this example, the time derivative of is the velocity, and so the first Hamilton equation means that the particle&#x27;s velocity equals the derivative of its kinetic energy with respect to its momentum. The time derivative of the momentum equals the &quot;Newtonian force&quot;, and so the second Hamilton equation means that the force equals the negative gradient of potential energy.

== Example ==
A spherical pendulum consists of a mass &quot;m&quot; moving without friction on the surface of a sphere. The only forces acting on the mass are the reaction from the sphere and gravity. Spherical coordinates are used to describe the position of the mass in terms of , where is fixed, .
The Lagrangian for this system is
formula_41

Thus the Hamiltonian is
formula_42
where
formula_43
and
formula_44
In terms of coordinates and momenta, the Hamiltonian reads
formula_45
Hamilton&#x27;s equations give the time evolution of coordinates and conjugate momenta in four first-order differential equations,
formula_46
Momentum , which corresponds to the vertical component of angular momentum , is a constant of motion. That is a consequence of the rotational symmetry of the system around the vertical axis. Being absent from the Hamiltonian, azimuth formula_47 is a cyclic coordinate, which implies conservation of its conjugate momentum.

== Deriving Hamilton&#x27;s equations ==
Hamilton&#x27;s equations can be derived by a calculation with the Lagrangian , generalized positions , and generalized velocities , where . Here we work off-shell, meaning , , are independent coordinates in phase space, not constrained to follow any equations of motion (in particular, formula_48 is not a derivative of ). The total differential of the Lagrangian is:
formula_49
The generalized momentum coordinates were defined as , so we may rewrite the equation as:
formula_50

After rearranging, one obtains:
formula_51

The term in parentheses on the left-hand side is just the Hamiltonian formula_52 defined previously, therefore:
formula_53

One may also calculate the total differential of the Hamiltonian formula_54 with respect to coordinates , , instead of , , , yielding:
formula_55

One may now equate these two expressions for , one in terms of , the other in terms of :
formula_56

Since these calculations are off-shell, one can equate the respective coefficients of , , on the two sides:
formula_57

On-shell, one substitutes parametric functions formula_58 which define a trajectory in phase space with velocities , obeying Lagrange&#x27;s equations:
formula_59

Rearranging and writing in terms of the on-shell formula_60 gives:
formula_61

Thus Lagrange&#x27;s equations are equivalent to Hamilton&#x27;s equations:
formula_62

In the case of time-independent formula_54 and , i.e. , Hamilton&#x27;s equations consist of first-order differential equations, while Lagrange&#x27;s equations consist of second-order equations. Hamilton&#x27;s equations usually do not reduce the difficulty of finding explicit solutions, but important theoretical results can be derived from them, because coordinates and momenta are independent variables with nearly symmetric roles.

Hamilton&#x27;s equations have another advantage over Lagrange&#x27;s equations: if a system has a symmetry, so that some coordinate formula_64 does not occur in the Hamiltonian (i.e. a &quot;cyclic coordinate&quot;), the corresponding momentum coordinate formula_65 is conserved along each trajectory, and that coordinate can be reduced to a constant in the other equations of the set. This effectively reduces the problem from coordinates to coordinates: this is the basis of symplectic reduction in geometry. In the Lagrangian framework, the conservation of momentum also follows immediately, however all the generalized velocities formula_66 still occur in the Lagrangian, and a system of equations in coordinates still has to be solved.

The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches provide the groundwork for deeper results in classical mechanics, and suggest analogous formulations in quantum mechanics: the path integral formulation and the Schrödinger equation.

== Properties of the Hamiltonian ==
* The value of the Hamiltonian formula_67 is the total energy of the system if and only if the energy function formula_68 has the same property. (See definition of ).
* formula_69 when , form a solution of Hamilton&#x27;s equations. Indeed, formula_70 and everything but the final term cancels out.
* formula_71 does not change under &quot;point transformations&quot;, i.e. smooth changes formula_72 of space coordinates. (Follows from the invariance of the energy function formula_73 under point transformations. The invariance of formula_15 can be established directly).
* formula_75 (See &quot;).
* . (Compare Hamilton&#x27;s and Euler-Lagrange equations or see &quot;).
* formula_76 if and only if .A coordinate for which the last equation holds is called &quot;cyclic&quot; (or &quot;ignorable&quot;). Every cyclic coordinate formula_77 reduces the number of degrees of freedom by , causes the corresponding momentum formula_78 to be conserved, and makes Hamilton&#x27;s equations easier to solve.

== Hamiltonian as the total system energy ==
In its application to a given system, the Hamiltonian is often taken to be
formula_79

where formula_80 is the kinetic energy and formula_81 is the potential energy. Using this relation can be simpler than first calculating the Lagrangian, and then deriving the Hamiltonian from the Lagrangian. However, the relation is not true for all systems.

The relation holds true for nonrelativistic systems when all of the following conditions are satisfied
formula_82
formula_83
formula_84

where formula_85 is time, formula_12 is the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and each formula_87 is an arbitrary scalar function of formula_88.

In words, this means that the relation formula_89 holds true if formula_80 does not contain time as an explicit variable (it is scleronomic), formula_81 does not contain generalised velocity as an explicit variable, and each term of formula_80 is quadratic in generalised velocity.

=== Proof ===
Preliminary to this proof, it is important to address an ambiguity in the related mathematical notation. While a change of variables can be used to equate
formula_93,
it is important to note that
formula_94.
In this case, the right hand side always evaluates to 0. To perform a change of variables inside of a partial derivative, the multivariable chain rule should be used. Hence, to avoid ambiguity, the function arguments of any term inside of a partial derivative should be stated.

Additionally, this proof uses the notation formula_95 to imply that formula_96.

,t)
&lt;/math&gt;
formula_97
formula_98

Substituting the generalized momenta into the Hamiltonian gives
formula_99

Substituting the Lagrangian into the result gives
formula_100

Now assume that
formula_82

and also assume that
formula_83

Applying these assumptions results in
formula_103

Next assume that T is of the form
formula_84

where each formula_87 is an arbitrary scalar function of formula_88.

Differentiating this with respect to formula_107, formula_108, gives
formula_109

Splitting the summation, evaluating the partial derivative, and rejoining the summation gives
formula_110

Summing (this multiplied by formula_107) over formula_112 results in
formula_113

This simplification is a result of Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem.

Hence, the Hamiltonian becomes
formula_114

=== Application to systems of point masses ===
For a system of point masses, the requirement for formula_80 to be quadratic in generalised velocity is always satisfied for the case where formula_116, which is a requirement for formula_89 anyway.

,t)=T(\boldsymbol{q},\boldsymbol{\dot{q}})&lt;/math&gt;, then it can be shown that formula_118 (See &quot;&quot;). Therefore, the kinetic energy is
formula_119

The chain rule for many variables can be used to expand the velocity
formula_120

Resulting in
formula_121

This is of the required form.

=== Conservation of energy ===
If the conditions for formula_89 are satisfied, then conservation of the Hamiltonian implies conservation of energy. This requires the additional condition that formula_81 does not contain time as an explicit variable.

formula_124

With respect to the extended Euler-Lagrange formulation (See &quot;&quot;), the Rayleigh dissipation function represents energy dissipation by nature. Therefore, energy is not conserved when formula_125. This is similar to the velocity dependent potential.

In summary, the requirements for formula_126 to be satisfied for a nonrelativistic system are
# formula_127
# formula_128
# formula_80 is a homogeneous quadratic function in formula_130

== Hamiltonian of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field ==

A sufficient illustration of Hamiltonian mechanics is given by the Hamiltonian of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. In Cartesian coordinates the Lagrangian of a non-relativistic classical particle in an electromagnetic field is (in SI Units):
formula_131
where is the electric charge of the particle, is the electric scalar potential, and the are the components of the magnetic vector potential that may all explicitly depend on formula_132 and .

This Lagrangian, combined with Euler–Lagrange equation, produces the Lorentz force law
formula_133
and is called minimal coupling.

The canonical momenta are given by:
formula_134

The Hamiltonian, as the Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian, is therefore:
formula_135

This equation is used frequently in quantum mechanics.

Under gauge transformation:
formula_136
where is any scalar function of space and time. The aforementioned Lagrangian, the canonical momenta, and the Hamiltonian transform like:
formula_137
which still produces the same Hamilton&#x27;s equation:
formula_138

In quantum mechanics, the wave function will also undergo a local U(1) group transformation during the Gauge Transformation, which implies that all physical results must be invariant under local U(1) transformations.

=== Relativistic charged particle in an electromagnetic field ===
The relativistic Lagrangian for a particle (rest mass formula_139 and charge ) is given by:

formula_140

Thus the particle&#x27;s canonical momentum is
formula_141
that is, the sum of the kinetic momentum and the potential momentum.

Solving for the velocity, we get
formula_142

So the Hamiltonian is
formula_143

This results in the force equation (equivalent to the Euler–Lagrange equation)
formula_144
from which one can derive
formula_145

The above derivation makes use of the vector calculus identity:
formula_146

An equivalent expression for the Hamiltonian as function of the relativistic (kinetic) momentum, , is
formula_147

This has the advantage that kinetic momentum formula_148 can be measured experimentally whereas canonical momentum formula_149 cannot. Notice that the Hamiltonian (total energy) can be viewed as the sum of the relativistic energy (kinetic+rest), , plus the potential energy, .

== From symplectic geometry to Hamilton&#x27;s equations ==

=== Geometry of Hamiltonian systems ===

The Hamiltonian can induce a symplectic structure on a smooth even-dimensional manifold in several equivalent ways, the best known being the following:

As a closed nondegenerate symplectic 2-form &quot;ω&quot;. According to the Darboux&#x27;s theorem, in a small neighbourhood around any point on there exist suitable local coordinates formula_150 (&quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;symplectic&quot; coordinates) in which the symplectic form becomes: 
formula_151
The form formula_152 induces a natural isomorphism of the tangent space with the cotangent space: . This is done by mapping a vector formula_153 to the 1-form , where formula_154 for all . Due to the bilinearity and non-degeneracy of , and the fact that , the mapping formula_155 is indeed a linear isomorphism. This isomorphism is &quot;natural&quot; in that it does not change with change of coordinates on formula_6 Repeating over all , we end up with an isomorphism formula_157 between the infinite-dimensional space of smooth vector fields and that of smooth 1-forms. For every formula_158 and ,
formula_159

(In algebraic terms, one would say that the formula_160-modules formula_161 and formula_162 are isomorphic). If , then, for every fixed , , and . formula_163 is known as a Hamiltonian vector field. The respective differential equation on formula_3
formula_165
is called . Here formula_166 and formula_167 is the (time-dependent) value of the vector field formula_163 at .

A Hamiltonian system may be understood as a fiber bundle over time , with the fiber being the position space at time . The Lagrangian is thus a function on the jet bundle over ; taking the fiberwise Legendre transform of the Lagrangian produces a function on the dual bundle over time whose fiber at is the cotangent space , which comes equipped with a natural symplectic form, and this latter function is the Hamiltonian. The correspondence between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is achieved with the tautological one-form.

Any smooth real-valued function on a symplectic manifold can be used to define a Hamiltonian system. The function is known as &quot;the Hamiltonian&quot; or &quot;the energy function.&quot; The symplectic manifold is then called the phase space. The Hamiltonian induces a special vector field on the symplectic manifold, known as the Hamiltonian vector field.

The Hamiltonian vector field induces a Hamiltonian flow on the manifold. This is a one-parameter family of transformations of the manifold (the parameter of the curves is commonly called &quot;the time&quot;); in other words, an isotopy of symplectomorphisms, starting with the identity. By Liouville&#x27;s theorem, each symplectomorphism preserves the volume form on the phase space. The collection of symplectomorphisms induced by the Hamiltonian flow is commonly called &quot;the Hamiltonian mechanics&quot; of the Hamiltonian system.

The symplectic structure induces a Poisson bracket. The Poisson bracket gives the space of functions on the manifold the structure of a Lie algebra.

If and are smooth functions on then the smooth function is properly defined; it is called a &quot;Poisson bracket&quot; of functions and and is denoted . The Poisson bracket has the following properties:
# bilinearity
# antisymmetry
# Leibniz rule: formula_169
# Jacobi identity: formula_170
# non-degeneracy: if the point on is not critical for then a smooth function exists such that .

Given a function 
formula_171
if there is a probability distribution , then (since the phase space velocity formula_172 has zero divergence and probability is conserved) its convective derivative can be shown to be zero and so
formula_173

This is called Liouville&#x27;s theorem. Every smooth function over the symplectic manifold generates a one-parameter family of symplectomorphisms and if , then is conserved and the symplectomorphisms are symmetry transformations.

A Hamiltonian may have multiple conserved quantities . If the symplectic manifold has dimension and there are functionally independent conserved quantities which are in involution (i.e., ), then the Hamiltonian is Liouville integrable. The Liouville–Arnold theorem says that, locally, any Liouville integrable Hamiltonian can be transformed via a symplectomorphism into a new Hamiltonian with the conserved quantities as coordinates; the new coordinates are called &quot;action–angle coordinates&quot;. The transformed Hamiltonian depends only on the , and hence the equations of motion have the simple form
formula_174
for some function . There is an entire field focusing on small deviations from integrable systems governed by the KAM theorem.

The integrability of Hamiltonian vector fields is an open question. In general, Hamiltonian systems are chaotic; concepts of measure, completeness, integrability and stability are poorly defined.

=== Riemannian manifolds ===
An important special case consists of those Hamiltonians that are quadratic forms, that is, Hamiltonians that can be written as
formula_175
where is a smoothly varying inner product on the fibers , the cotangent space to the point in the configuration space, sometimes called a cometric. This Hamiltonian consists entirely of the kinetic term.

If one considers a Riemannian manifold or a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the Riemannian metric induces a linear isomorphism between the tangent and cotangent bundles. (See &quot;Musical isomorphism&quot;). Using this isomorphism, one can define a cometric. (In coordinates, the matrix defining the cometric is the inverse of the matrix defining the metric.) The solutions to the Hamilton–Jacobi equations for this Hamiltonian are then the same as the geodesics on the manifold. In particular, the Hamiltonian flow in this case is the same thing as the geodesic flow. The existence of such solutions, and the completeness of the set of solutions, are discussed in detail in the article on geodesics. See also &quot;Geodesics as Hamiltonian flows&quot;.

=== Sub-Riemannian manifolds ===
When the cometric is degenerate, then it is not invertible. In this case, one does not have a Riemannian manifold, as one does not have a metric. However, the Hamiltonian still exists. In the case where the cometric is degenerate at every point of the configuration space manifold , so that the rank of the cometric is less than the dimension of the manifold , one has a sub-Riemannian manifold.

The Hamiltonian in this case is known as a sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian. Every such Hamiltonian uniquely determines the cometric, and vice versa. This implies that every sub-Riemannian manifold is uniquely determined by its sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian, and that the converse is true: every sub-Riemannian manifold has a unique sub-Riemannian Hamiltonian. The existence of sub-Riemannian geodesics is given by the Chow–Rashevskii theorem.

The continuous, real-valued Heisenberg group provides a simple example of a sub-Riemannian manifold. For the Heisenberg group, the Hamiltonian is given by
formula_176
 is not involved in the Hamiltonian.

=== Poisson algebras ===

Hamiltonian systems can be generalized in various ways. Instead of simply looking at the algebra of smooth functions over a symplectic manifold, Hamiltonian mechanics can be formulated on general commutative unital real Poisson algebras. A state is a continuous linear functional on the Poisson algebra (equipped with some suitable topology) such that for any element of the algebra, maps to a nonnegative real number.

A further generalization is given by Nambu dynamics.

=== Generalization to quantum mechanics through Poisson bracket ===

Hamilton&#x27;s equations above work well for classical mechanics, but not for quantum mechanics, since the differential equations discussed assume that one can specify the exact position and momentum of the particle simultaneously at any point in time. However, the equations can be further generalized to then be extended to apply to quantum mechanics as well as to classical mechanics, through the deformation of the Poisson algebra over and to the algebra of Moyal brackets.

Specifically, the more general form of the Hamilton&#x27;s equation reads
formula_177
where is some function of and , and is the Hamiltonian. To find out the rules for evaluating a Poisson bracket without resorting to differential equations, see &quot;Lie algebra&quot;; a Poisson bracket is the name for the Lie bracket in a Poisson algebra. These Poisson brackets can then be extended to Moyal brackets comporting to an inequivalent Lie algebra, as proven by Hilbrand J. Groenewold, and thereby describe quantum mechanical diffusion in phase space (See &quot;Phase space formulation&quot; and &quot;Wigner–Weyl transform&quot;). This more algebraic approach not only permits ultimately extending probability distributions in phase space to Wigner quasi-probability distributions, but, at the mere Poisson bracket classical setting, also provides more power in helping analyze the relevant conserved quantities in a system.

<doc id="198324" wikidata="Q248893" url="?curid=198324" title="Ananda Mahidol">
<text>Ananda Mahidol (20 September 19259 June 1946) was the eighth king of Siam (later Thailand) from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama VIII. At the time he was recognised as king by the National Assembly in March 1935, he was a nine-year-old boy living in Switzerland. He returned to Thailand in December 1945, but six months later, in June 1946, he was found shot dead in his bed. Although at first thought to have been an accident, his death was ruled a murder by medical examiners, and three royal aides were later executed following very irregular trials. The mysterious circumstances surrounding his death have been the subject of much controversy.

==Name==
Ananda Mahidol (; ) is his given name, and is one word in Thai. King Vajiravudh, his uncle, sent a telegram on 13 October 1925 bestowing upon him this name, which means &quot;the joy of Mahidol&quot;. When he held his birth rank of Mom Chao—the lowest rank of Thai princes—he used the surname &quot;Mahidol&quot;, his father&#x27;s given name. His full name and title was thus Mom Chao Ananda Mahidol Mahidol ().

Upon his accession, he became known as Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua Ananda Mahidol (). &quot;Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua&quot; is the title of a Thai king prior to coronation.

After his death, his brother and successor King Bhumibol Adulyadej posthumously elevated his title to that of a crowned king. He was posthumously renamed again in 1996, so as to give him an auspiciously long name similar to the names of his predecessors Mongkut, Chulalongkorn, Vajiravudh, and Prajadhipok. Nowadays, Thais refer to him officially as Phra Bat Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha Ananda Mahidol Phra Atthama Ramathibodindara (), an abbreviation of the latest name given to him.

==Early life==
Prince Ananda Mahidol was born in Heidelberg, Germany. He was the first son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla (son of King Rama V) and Mom Sangwan (last title Somdej Phra Sri Nakarindhara Borommaratchachonnani) who were studying there at the time. He was the first Thai King to be born outside of the country.

He went with his parents to Paris, Lausanne, and then to Massachusetts, when in 1927, his uncle, King Prajadhipok, issued a royal edict elevating him to the higher princely class of Phra Worawong Ther Phra Ong Chao (this edict also benefited other &quot;Mom Chao&quot; who were the children of Chao Fa and their commoner wives, among them his elder sister Mom Chao Galyani Vadhana and his younger brother who was born later that year Phra Worawong Ther Phra Ong Chao Bhumibol Adulyadej).

The family returned to Thailand in 1928 after Prince Mahidol finished his medical studies at Harvard University. Prince Mahidol died at age 37 in 1929, when Ananda Mahidol was four years old. His widowed mother was thus left to raise her family alone.

He briefly attended Debsirin School in Bangkok before the revolution in 1932 ended the absolute monarchy and raised the possibility that King Prajadhipok might abdicate. Queen Savang Vadhana, his grandmother, was concerned about Prince Ananda Mahidol&#x27;s safety, since he was one of the likely heirs to the throne. It was then suggested that Mom Sangwal and her children return to Lausanne, and when they did so in 1933, the official reason given was for the health and further education of the princes.

Prince Ananda Mahidol spent most of his youth in Switzerland. However, when King Prajadhipok&#x27;s abdication appeared imminent, the prince&#x27;s mother was approached by a member of the government, asking for her opinion about Ananda Mahidol succeeding as monarch.

==Circumstances of succession==

King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) abdicated in 1935 due to political quarrels with the new quasi-democratic government as well as health problems. The king decided to abstain from exercising his prerogative to name a successor to the throne. By that time, the crown had already passed from Prince Mahidol&#x27;s line to that of his half-brother&#x27;s when his eldest full brother, Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis, died as a teenager during King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s reign. A half-brother, Prince Vajiravudh (as the next eldest) replaced Prince Vajirunhis as the crown prince. He eventually succeeded to the throne in 1910 as King Rama VI. In 1924 the king instituted the Palace Law of Succession in order to govern subsequent successions. The law gave priority to the children of his mother Queen Regent Saovabha Phongsri over the children of King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s two other royal wives. The law was enacted on the death of King Vajiravudh in 1925 and the crown passed to his youngest brother, Prince Prajadhipok of Sukhothai.

Offering the throne to Prince Prajadhipok was not without a debate. In doing so, another candidate was bypassed: Prince Chula Chakrabongse, son of the late Field Marshal Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath of Phitsanulok, who before his death had been the heir-apparent to King Vajiravudh. It was questioned whether the Succession Law enacted by King Vajiravudh actually barred Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath (and for that matter, Prince Chula Chakrabongse) from succession on the grounds that he married a foreigner. However, his marriage had taken place before this law was enacted and had been endorsed by King Chulalongkorn himself. There was no clear resolution, but in the end the many candidates were passed over and Prince Prajadhipok was enthroned.

When King Prajadhipok later abdicated, since he was the last remaining son of Queen Saovabha, the crown went back to the sons of the queen whose rank was next to hers: Queen Savang Vadhana, mother of the late Crown Prince Vajirunhis. Besides the late crown prince, she had two more sons who survived to adulthood: Prince Sommatiwongse Varodaya of Nakhon Si Thammarat, who had died without a son in 1899, and Prince Mahidol who, although deceased, had two living sons. It thus appeared that Prince Ananda Mahidol would be the first person in the royal line of succession.

Nevertheless, the same debate over the half-foreign Prince Chula Chakrabongse occurred again. It was argued that King Vajiravudh had virtually exempted the prince&#x27;s father from the ban in the Succession Law, and the crown might thus be passed to him.

However, since the kingdom was now governed under a constitution, it was the cabinet that would decide. Opinion was split on the right to succession of Prince Chula Chakrabongse. A key figure was Pridi Banomyong, who persuaded the cabinet that the Law should be interpreted as excluding the prince from succession, and that Prince Ananda Mahidol should be the next king. It also appeared more convenient for the government to have a monarch who was only nine years old and studying in Switzerland. On 2 March 1935, Prince Ananda Mahidol was elected by the National Assembly and the Thai government to succeed his uncle, King Prajadhipok, as the eighth king of the Chakri dynasty.

==Reign==

As the new king was still a child and was still studying in Switzerland, the National Assembly appointed Colonel Prince Anuwatjaturong, Lieutenant Commander Prince Aditya Dibabha, and Chao Phraya Yommaraj (Pun Sukhum) as his regents.

In 1938, at age thirteen, Ananda Mahidol visited Siam for the first time as its monarch. The king was accompanied during his visit by his mother and his younger brother, Bhumibol Adulyadej. Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram was prime minister at the time and during most of Ananda Mahidol&#x27;s brief reign.

===World War II===

On 8 December 1941, Thailand was invaded by Japan. Despite fierce fighting in Southern Thailand, the fighting lasted only five hours before ending in a ceasefire. Thailand and Japan then formed an alliance making Thailand part of the Axis alliance until the end of World War II. King Ananda was away from the country, as he had returned to Switzerland to complete his studies, and Pridi Phanomyong served as regent in his absence. From 24 January 1942, Thailand became a formal ally of the Empire of Japan and a member of the Axis. Under Plaek Pibunsonggram, Thailand declared war on the Allied powers. The regent refused to sign the declaration and it was thus legally invalid. Many members of the Thai government, including the Siamese embassy in Japan, acted as &quot;de facto&quot; spies in the Seri Thai underground on the side of the Allies, funnelling secret information to British intelligence and the US Office of Strategic Services. By 1944, it was apparent that Japan was going to lose the war. Bangkok suffered heavily from the Allied bombing raids. These, plus economic hardships, made the war and the government of Plaek Pibunsonggram very unpopular. In July, Plaek Pibunsonggram was ousted by the Seri Thai-infiltrated government. The National Assembly reconvened and appointed the liberal lawyer Khuang Aphaiwong prime minister. Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945, and Allied military responsibility for Thailand fell to Britain.

===Post-war===

Only after the end of World War II could Ananda Mahidol return to Thailand. He returned for a second visit in December 1945 with a degree in law. Despite his youth and inexperience, he quickly won the hearts of the Thai people, who had continued to revere the monarchy through the upheavals of the 1930s and 1940s. The Thai were delighted to have their king amongst them once again. One of his well-remembered activities was a highly successful visit to Bangkok&#x27;s Chinatown Sampheng Lane (), which was intended to defuse the post-war tensions that lingered between Bangkok&#x27;s ethnic Chinese and Thai people.

Foreign observers, however, believed that Ananda Mahidol did not want to be king and felt his reign would not last long. Louis Mountbatten, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the British commander in Southeast Asia, visited Bangkok in January 1946 and described the king as &quot;a frightened, short-sighted boy, his sloping shoulders and thin chest behung with gorgeous diamond-studded decorations, altogether a pathetic and lonely figure&quot;. At a public function, Mountbatten wrote: &quot;[H]is nervousness increased to such an alarming extent, that I came very close to support him in case he passed out&quot;.

==Death==
On 9 June 1946, the king was found shot dead in his bedroom in the Boromphiman Throne Hall (a modern residential palace located in the Grand Palace), only four days before he was scheduled to return to Switzerland to finish his doctoral degree in law at the University of Lausanne.

===Events of 9 June 1946===

Keith Simpson, pathologist to the British Home Office and founding chairman of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London, performed a forensic analysis of the king&#x27;s death and recounted the following sequence of events on the morning of 9 June 1946:

* 06:00: Ananda was awakened by his mother.
* 07:30: His page, But Patthamasarin, came on duty and began preparing a breakfast table on a balcony adjoining the king&#x27;s dressing room.
* 08:30: But Patthamasarin saw the king standing in his dressing room. He brought the king his customary glass of orange juice a few minutes later. However, by then the king had gone back to bed and refused the juice.
* 08:45: The king&#x27;s other page, Chit Singhaseni, appeared, saying he had been called to measure the King&#x27;s medals and decorations on behalf of a jeweller who was making a case for them.
* 09:00: Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej visited King Ananda. He said afterwards that he had found the king dozing in his bed.
* 09:20: A single shot rang out from the king&#x27;s bedroom. Chit Singhaseni ran in and then ran out along the corridor to the apartment of the king&#x27;s mother, crying &quot;The King&#x27;s shot himself!&quot; The king&#x27;s mother followed Chit Singhaseni into the king&#x27;s bedroom and found the king lying face up in bed, bloodied from a wound to the head.

===Aftermath===

An initial radio announcement on 9 June surmised that the king was accidentally killed while toying with his pistol.

Soon after the death, the Democrat Party spread rumours that left-wing prime minister Pridi Banomyong was behind the death.

Following the change of prime minister, in October 1946, a Commission of Inquiry reported that the king&#x27;s death could not have been accidental, but that neither suicide nor murder was satisfactorily proved.

In November 1947, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram staged a coup against the elected government of Pridi, appointed Democrat Party leader Khuang Aphaiwong as Prime Minister, and ordered a trial. King Ananda&#x27;s secretary, Senator Chaliao Pathumrot, and the pages, But and Chit, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to murder the king. After the coup, former Prime Minister Luang Thamrong privately confided to US Ambassador Edwin F. Stanton that the evidence gathered during investigations of the regicide implicated King Bhumibol in the late king&#x27;s death.

The trial began in August 1948. Prior to the trial, Plaek Phibunsongkhram admitted to U.S. Ambassador Edwin F. Stanton that he was doubtful that the trial would resolve the mystery of Ananda Mahidol&#x27;s death. The prosecution&#x27;s case was supported by 124 witnesses and such voluminous documentary evidence that defence counsel asked for an adjournment to give them time to consider it. When this was refused the counsel resigned, and new counsel was found. Later, two of the defence counsel were arrested and charged with treason. Of the remaining two, one resigned, leaving only a single young lawyer for the defence, Fak Na Songkhla. Towards the end of the case he was joined by Chaliao Pathumrot&#x27;s daughter, who had just graduated.

The lengthy trial finally ended in May 1951. The court ruled that King Ananda had been assassinated, but that Chaliao had not been proved guilty and that neither of the pages could have fired the fatal shot. However, they found Chit guilty of being party to the crime. The charges against Chaliao and But were dismissed and they were released.

Chit appealed his conviction, and the prosecution appealed the acquittal of Chaliao and But. After fifteen months of deliberation the Appeals Court dismissed Chit&#x27;s appeal, and also found But guilty.

Chit and But appealed to the Supreme Court, which deliberated for ten more months before finally upholding both convictions, and this time convicting Chaliao as well.

The three men&#x27;s petitions for clemency were rejected by King Rama IX (Bhumibol Adulyadej), and they were executed by firing squad on 17 February 1955. King Rama IX later said that he did not believe they were guilty.

King Ananda Mahidol was cremated at Sanam Luang, Bangkok, on 29 March 1950, four years after his death.

===Alternative explanations of the death===
The king&#x27;s death is still seen as a mystery. The subject is never openly discussed in Thailand in the mainstream media, though the subject is not taboo and numerous books have been written about it in Thai. All the principals known to be related in any way to the death are now deceased.

====Bhumibol Adulyadej====
On 15 June 1946, American Chargé d&#x27;affaires Charles Yost met with Foreign Minister Direk Jayanama, who had just had an audience with the new king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. In his report to the US State Department, Yost noted,

King Bhumiphol... informed the Foreign Minister that he considered the [widely circulated] rumors [on the late King&#x27;s death] absurd, that he knew his brother well and that he was certain that his death had been accidental... What the King said to Direk does not necessarily represent what he really believes, it is nevertheless interesting that he made so categorical a statement to the Foreign Minister.
In 1948, Pinit Intaratood, who had just been appointed as the police officer in charge, went to the Villa Vadhana in Lausanne to question King Bhumibol. During the inquiry, the king looked gloomy, so Pinit decided to ask for forgiveness. The king was smiling and says:
However, in a 1980 BBC documentary, Bhumibol stated that although the court ruled that the death was &#x27;proven&#x27; not an accident, &quot;one doesn&#x27;t know.&quot; He noted in English:

The investigation provided the fact that he died with a bullet wound in his forehead. It was proved that it was not an accident and not a suicide. One doesn&#x27;t know. ... But what happened is very mysterious, because immediately much of the evidence was just shifted. And because it was political, so everyone was political, even the police were political, [it was] not very clear.

I only know [that] when I arrived he was dead. Many people wanted to advance not theories but facts to clear up the affair. They were suppressed. And they were suppressed by influential people in this country and in international politics.
====Sulak Sivaraksa====
Sulak Sivaraksa, a prominent conservative and monarchist, wrote that Pridi&#x27;s role in the event was he protected a wrongdoing royal, and prevented an arrest of a person who destroyed the evidence. He wrote a Facebook post in 2015 claiming: &quot;in truth, the murderer of King Rama VIII is not Pridi Banomyong. That person is still alive, even though not intending in doing so.&quot;

====Seni Pramoj and the Democrat Party====
Seni Pramoj and the Democrat Party spread rumours that Pridi was behind the death. Yost noted in a US State Department communication:

&quot;... Within forty-eight hours after the death of the late King, two relatives of Seni Pramoj, first his nephew and later his wife, came to the Legation and stated categorically their conviction that the King had been assassinated at the instigation of the Prime Minister (Pridi Phanomyong). It was of course clear that they had been sent by Seni. I felt it necessary to state to both of them in the strongest terms, in order to make it perfectly clear that this Legation could not be drawn into Siamese political intrigues, that I did not believe these stories and that I considered the circulation at this time of fantastic rumors un-supported by a shred of evidence to be wholly in-excusable. The British Minister informed me this morning that he had also been approached by several members of the Opposition to whom he had stated that he accepted the official account of the King&#x27;s death and that he would not be drawn into any further discussion of the matter.
====Pridi Banomyong====
On 14 June 1946, Yost met with Pridi Banomyong and made the following report to the US State Department:
&quot;[Pridi spoke] very frankly about the whole situation and ascribed the King&#x27;s death to an accident, but it was obvious that the possibility of suicide was at the back of his mind. [Pridi] was violently angry at the accusations of foul play leveled against himself and most bitter in the manner in which he alleged (without doubt justly) that the Royal Family and the Opposition, particularly Seni Pramoj and Phra Sudhiat, had prejudiced the King and especially the Princess Mother against him.&quot;
====Plaek Pibulsonggram====
After overthrowing Pridi Banomyong in a coup, Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram told US Ambassador Edwin Stanton that he &quot;personally doubted whether Pridi was directly involved for two reasons: firstly, ... Pridi is a very clever politician and secondly, ... he has a &#x27;kind heart&#x27;.&quot; Pibul concluded to the Ambassador that &quot;he did not think [Pridi] would cause anybody to be murdered. Pibul&#x27;s wife, present in the meeting, seconded her husband&#x27;s observations. However, Pibul noted that it was possible that Pridi had covered up or destroyed some of the evidence to protect the successor, Bhumibol Adulyadej.&quot;

====Keith Simpson====
Keith Simpson, a forensic pathologist who investigated the king&#x27;s death, found it highly unlikely that the death was due to suicide, noting that:
*The pistol was found by the king&#x27;s left hand, but he was right-handed.
*The direction of bullet fired was not inward towards the centre of the head.
*The wound, over the left eye, was not in one of the elective sites, nor a &quot;contact&quot; discharge.
*The king was killed while lying flat on his back. Simpson noted that in twenty years&#x27; experience he had never known of any suicide shooting while lying flat on the back.

====William Stevenson====
An account of the death is given in William Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Revolutionary King&quot;, written with the co-operation of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. This account exculpates those executed and suggests that Ananda Mahidol was murdered by Tsuji Masanobu. Masanobu was a former Japanese intelligence officer who had been active in Thailand during the war and, at the time of Ananda Mahidol&#x27;s death, was hiding out in Thailand for fear of being prosecuted for his war crimes.

Stevenson&#x27;s account is that Ananda Mahidol could not have killed himself, either by suicide or by accident. He was found lying on his back in his bed, not wearing his glasses, without which he was almost blind. He had a small bullet wound in his forehead and a somewhat larger exit wound in the back of his head. His pistol, an M1911 given him by a former US Army officer, was not nearby. The M1911 is not especially prone to accidental discharge; it will fire only if considerable pressure is applied to the safety plate at the back of the butt at the same time as the trigger is depressed. It is a heavy pistol and awkward to use by an untrained person. It would have been almost impossible for Ananda Mahidol, a frail 20-year-old, to lie on his back and shoot himself in the forehead with such a weapon. Had he done so, the impact, according to forensics experts, would have blown his skull apart, not caused the small wounds seen by many witnesses. Stevenson writes that no cartridge case was found, and subsequent inquiries ordered by King Bhumibol, but suppressed by later governments, found that the Colt had not been fired.

====Rayne Kruger====
Another account, which concluded that Ananda Mahidol&#x27;s death was the result of suicide, was explored by journalist Rayne Kruger in his book, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Discus&quot;. The book is banned in Thailand. However, a website by a Thai writer has provided a summary of Kruger&#x27;s arguments, and it links to other material about the death. Kruger, who had unprecedented access to members of the inner circle of the Thai royal family (although these contacts had to remain unidentified), drew the conclusion that Ananda&#x27;s death was most probably an &#x27;accidental suicide&#x27;. Thus, said Kruger, it appears the sad, most likely accidental, death of the young king was exploited for the purposes of a political vendetta, and that three innocent victims were executed to maintain the façade.

====Paul Handley====
Paul Handley, author of a biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, wrote that either suicide or an accidental shooting by Prince Bhumibol was responsible for the king&#x27;s death: &quot;I have no idea whether Ananda shot himself or was killed by Bhumibol, the two possibilities most accepted among historians. If the latter, I clearly term it an accident that occurred in play&quot;.

<doc id="198325" wikidata="Q4643566" url="?curid=198325" title="777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley">
<text>777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley is a collection of papers written by Aleister Crowley. It is a table of magical correspondences. It was edited and introduced by Dr. Israel Regardie, and is a reference book based on the Hermetic Qabalah.

==777 and modern Qabalah==
The Golden Dawn was in part an expression of Hermetic Qabalah, which was itself derived from Jewish mystical Kabbalah. In Judaism, Kabbalah is a form of Torah commentary that was especially prominent in the sixteenth century via the book the &quot;Zohar&quot;. It introduced the diminishing Four Worlds, God as the transcendent Ain Soph, Israel as embodying the Shekinah, or &quot;presence&quot;, as children of the True God, and most famously the ten Sephiroth as schema of the universe between Israel and Jehovah. It did this by interpreting the concrete ethics of the scripture. From the 15th century through the Enlightenment, esoteric groups drew from Christian Kabbalah, which was practiced and reinterpreted by occultists like Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Pico della Mirandola and Eliphas Levi before being popularized in contemporary esoteric magic.

==Contents==
===Gematria===
&quot;Gematria&quot; was extrapolated from &quot;The Equinox&quot; vol. 1, no.5 where it was originally titled &quot;The Temple of Solomon the King continued&quot; being the fifth in that series. It explains the dogmatic Qabalah as taught by the original order of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The main studies are the ten &quot;Sephiroth&quot; or &quot;Emanations&quot; of the godhead. These can also be seen as rungs of a divine hierarchy between Earth and Godhead—and the three forms of word analysis. These consist of gematria where each of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet have their own number and are added together in words to make metaphorical sympathy; aiq baqir, also called &quot;Qabalah of the Nine Chambers&quot;, which converts any letter in a word to its radical equivalent, such as &quot;A&quot; (=1) to &quot;I&quot; (=10) or &quot;Q&quot; (=100), hence &quot;AIQ&quot; for the radical no. 1 column; and notariqon, which uses Hebrew words as initials for a potential larger sentence, for instance the first word of the Torah BRAShITh is manipulated as BRAShITh RAH ALHIM ShIQBLV IShRAL ThVRH (&quot;In the beginning Elohim saw that Israel would accept the law&quot;). It quotes much of the introduction to Mathers&#x27; &quot;Kabbalah Unveiled&quot; and also Crowley&#x27;s own &quot;Qabalistic Dogma&quot;, an appendix to his &quot;Collected Works vol. I.&quot; before beginning a study of important numbers in magical art.

===Liber 777===
&quot;Liber 777 Vel Prolegoma Symbolica Ad Systemam Sceptico-Mysticae Viae Explicande, Fundamentum Hieroglyphicum Sanctissimorum Scientiae Summae&quot; is designated a &quot;Class B&quot; document by Crowley. The title refers to a lightning flash descending the diagrammatic worlds, the zig-zag pattern suggesting three diminishing 7s and the sum value of the Gematria of the paths. It consists of roughly 191 columns, with each row corresponding to a specific Sephirah or path on the Tree of Life for a total of 35 rows and is used for a quick reference for corresponding mnemonics and factors of religion for use in magic (for instance, an evocation of Venus would have one looking across that column for the colour corresponding to Venus that will be the colour of his or her robe, and then Venusian incense, etc.).

The first appearance of &quot;777&quot; was published anonymously in 1909 after Crowley had written it from memory in just a week. An introduction to one edition by &quot;Frater N∴&quot; states that Crowley may have published it anonymously because it was taken from a Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn manuscript that was obligatory for initiates to memorise.

Within the detail of the book the column&#x27;s vertical axis is numbered from 1 to 32 signifying the 32-paths of wisdom which occur in the western Qabalah, numbers 1–10 are the sephirah of the universe and numbers 11–32 the paths which join them. The horizontal columns have many categories pertinent to religion, mythology and magick given in some 32-parts each. The Hebrew alphabet, the tarot cards and the astrological glyphs total 22-each and are given to the paths as a map of the magician&#x27;s universe. From the 11th path onward some of these numbers have been exemplified by appearing to the left or right in the margin for easy reference, paths 11, 23, 31, 32-&quot;bis&quot; and 31-&quot;bis&quot; are leftwards and denote the five astrological elements; paths 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29 are rightwards and denote the 12 astrological signs, the rest are astrological planets.

The tables were constantly revised in Crowley&#x27;s lifetime but it was not until 1955 that they were published (&quot;&quot;Revised Prolegomena Symbolica ad Systemam...&quot;). This includes smaller tables that extrapolate correspondences of the five elements, twelve zodiacal signs and seven planets only.

===Sepher Sephiroth===
&quot;Sepher Sephiroth&quot; was originally a supplement to the Equinox vol. 1, no.8. that was published in 1912. The title means &quot;Book of Emanations&quot;&quot; and is also indexed as Liber 500. It was written by Crowley and Allan Bennet (Frater I.A.) and is basically an index of numbers from 1–3321 listing their Hebrew word equivalents. This book is also useful for magical students as a reference for word-sympathy, from AB (&quot;father&quot;) and BA (&quot;to come&quot;) = 3 to ShDBRShHMOTh ShRThThN = 3321. Numbers 1–1000 are inclusive whilst 1000+ are abridged.

<text>The Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is a public research university located in the coastal city of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. It has two major campuses, a modern city campus in Gardens Point and a historical campus in Kelvin Grove. The university offers courses in fields including architecture, engineering, information technology, healthcare, teaching, law, arts and design, science and mathematics.

QUT operated as the Queensland Institute of Technology (QIT&quot;)&quot; established in 1965 receiving university status by act of Parliament of Queensland in 1988. Queensland University of Technology commenced operations the following year in January 1989. The Brisbane College of Advanced Education, an amalgamation of tertiary colleges dating back to 1849, merged with QUT expanding to its Kelvin Grove site in 1990.

In 2022, QUT enrolled 50,216 students, including 37,860 undergraduate and 11,760 postgraduate students and employed 4,675 regular staff members. It also had a total income of 1.004 billion, a total expenditure of 1.135 billion and held 1.849 billion in accumulated assets. It is eighth largest university in Australia by enrolment and the second-largest in Queensland.

QUT was formerly a member of the Australian Technology Network of universities, but withdrew participation on 28 September 2018. The QUT Business School is one of three Triple Crown business schools in Australia and possesses accreditation by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, Association of MBAs and EQUIS.
== History ==

Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has a history that dates to 1849 when the Brisbane School of Arts was established. Queensland Institute of Technology (QIT) succeeded the Central Technical College and was formed in 1965. The current QUT was established as a university in 1989 from the merger of several predecessor institutions listed below:

*Brisbane School of Arts (1849)
*Brisbane Technical College (1882)
*Central Technical College (1908)
*Queensland Institute of Technology (1965)

Brisbane College of Advanced Education was formed in 1982, which itself is a combination of multiple predecessor institutions shown in the list below:
*Brisbane Kindergarten Training College (1911)
*Brisbane Kindergarten Teachers College (1965)
*Queensland Teachers&#x27; Training College (1914)
*Kelvin Grove Teachers College (1961)
*Kelvin Grove College of Advanced Education (1976)
*Kedron Park Teachers College (1961)
*North Brisbane College of Advanced Education (1974)

In 1988, the Queensland University of Technology Act was passed for the grant of university status to Queensland Institute of Technology (QIT). As a result, QIT was granted university status and was operational as Queensland University of Technology (QUT) beginning in January 1989. The Brisbane College of Advanced Education joined with QUT in 1990.

The Gardens Point campus was once entirely housed in the 19th-century former Government House of Queensland. In 1909, during the relocation of the governor&#x27;s residence, the Old Government House and the surrounding five hectares were set aside for both a university and a technical college. The first university on the site was the University of Queensland which was moved to St Lucia in 1945, where it remains today.

== Campuses and buildings ==
=== Gardens Point ===
Gardens Point campus is located in Brisbane&#x27;s city centre, beside the Brisbane River and adjacent to the City Botanic Gardens and Queensland Parliament House. At the centre of the campus is the Old Government House which was built in 1862 and re-opened in 2009. The faculties of Business, Law, and Science and Engineering are based at this campus, such as other non-important facilities, such as: Basketball courts, general parks, and others.

==== Gardens Cultural Precinct ====
Gardens Point campus hosts the Gardens Cultural Precinct, comprising the Gardens Theatre and QUT Art Museum, which offer a full theatre and exhibition program.
*The QUT Art Museum houses the university&#x27;s art collection, which focuses on contemporary Australian art, including painting, sculpture, decorative art and works on paper. The museum opened in 2000 and attracted about 350,000 people in its first decade of operations. The building is a 1930s neo-classical revivalist building designed by Peddle Thorpe Architects, Brisbane.
*The Gardens Theatre features professional theatre, children&#x27;s theatre, and student showcases. The Gardens Theatre is a medium-sized venue, formerly known as the Basil Jones Theatre, and was renovated with assistance from the Queensland Government. It was reopened as the Gardens Theatre in 1999 by then-Premier Peter Beattie. It provides space for QUT productions and visiting performers, and is the only theatre complex in Brisbane&#x27;s central business district.

==== Science and Engineering Precinct ====
The Science and Engineering Precinct was completed in November 2012. It brings together teaching and research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. The 200 million required for the precinct came from QUT (65 million), the Australian Government (75 million), the Queensland Government (35 million), and Atlantic Philanthropies (25 million).

=== Kelvin Grove ===
The Kelvin Grove campus hosts the faculties of Creative Industries, Education, and Health as well as the QUT International College and the Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation.

QUT Kelvin Grove Health Clinics offer services for free or low-cost services to staff, students, and the general public.

The Creative Industries Precinct architecturally designed in joint venture by KIRK (Richard Kirk Architect) + Hassell, located at Kelvin Grove campus, includes many arts and exhibition spaces open to the public:
*the Roundhouse Theatre, a large theatre venue and home of the La Boite Theatre Company.
*interactive exhibition spaces.
*an experimental black-box theatre.
*multimedia performance spaces.
*public artwork exhibition spaces.

The Precinct was built at a cost of around $60 million on the site of the Gona Barracks, an Australian Army barracks, which was decommissioned in 1998.

=== Canberra Executive Education Centre ===
QUT hosts a small campus in the suburb of Deakin in Canberra, called the Canberra Executive Education Centre (CEEC). The CEEC provides in-person classes for QUT&#x27;s Executive Master of Business Administration, which is jointly taught with an academic mission from the MIT Sloan School of Management. The Centre also provides professional training and development short courses through the QUTeX brand and is an in-person hub for the QUT Public Sector Management Program (QUT PSMP).

=== Former campuses ===

==== Caboolture ====
The Caboolture campus, located north of Brisbane, was co-occupied by TAFE Queensland. The campus offered undergraduate degrees in business, education, and nursing, and first-year studies in creative industries before the campus was transferred to the University of the Sunshine Coast on 8 January 2018.

==== Carseldine ====
In November 2008, Carseldine teaching, research, and support activities were relocated to Kelvin Grove and Gardens Point campuses. This included the School of Psychology and Counselling and the School of public health and social work, as well as some business, science, and information technology subjects. The campus has since been closed and was subsequently renovated by the Queensland Government. Following QUT&#x27;s decision to vacate the campus and the lack of a suitable education provider to take over the site, the State Government announced plans to decentralise government services and move around 1000 employees to the remodeled former QUT buildings, which occurred post-2012.
==Academic profile==
QUT offers undergraduate and postgraduate coursework, graduate diplomas and certificates, and higher degree research courses (Masters and PhDs) including, but not limited to the fields listed below:
*Architecture
*Business
*Communication
*Creative Industries
*Design
*Education
*Health and Community
*Information Technology
*Law and Justice
*Mathematics
*Science and Engineering

The QUT Business School has triple accreditation (AMBA, EQUIS, and AACSB). It is placed within the top 1% of Business Schools worldwide.

San Jose State University in San Jose, CA, US offers a PhD program in library science in collaboration with Queensland University of Technology.

=== Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame ===

In 2009, State Library of Queensland, the Queensland Library Foundation, and QUT Business School collaborated to establish the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame (QBLHOF) initiative. The QBLHOF recognises outstanding contributions made by organisations, companies and individuals to develop the Queensland economy and society, both contemporary and historical. A governing committee determines a list of inductees based on a set of criteria including:
* Sustained leadership
* Major financial contribution
* Pioneering
* Outstanding contribution
* Achievement of iconic status

The inductees are announced at a gala event each year in July. Since 2014, the QBLHOF has also awarded an annual Fellowship, to recipients working on a research project that utilises the resources of the John Oxley Library to produce new interpretations of Queensland&#x27;s business history.

=== Research divisions ===

QUT establishes collaborative research partnerships between academia, industry, government and community actors. The university is a key member of the Brisbane Diamantina Health Partners, Queensland&#x27;s first academic health science system. QUT attracts national grants and industry funding and has a number of research centres, including:

==== Indigenous Research Centres ====

== Notable people ==
== Controversies ==
QUT has come under renewed criticism around its workplace culture, allegations of bullying and misrepresentation of job losses in 2020–21. Many academic and professional staff have expressed living in fear of this workplace, in the most significant publicity the university has received in several years. Initial steps towards change in response to these claims have been made, although this has been met with scepticism by staff, citing issues with the concept of &quot;leadership training&quot; for executive managers, and the lack of urgency in implementing a safe method of complaint.

The current vice-chancellor Margaret Sheil has been criticised for excessively lavish renovations for a private bathroom with &quot;marble finishes&quot; in her personal office.

<doc id="198333" wikidata="Q502058" url="?curid=198333" title="The Communards">
<text>The Communards were a British synth-pop duo formed in London in 1985. They consisted of Scottish singer Jimmy Somerville and English musician Richard Coles. They are best known for their cover versions of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes featuring Teddy Pendergrass&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;, and of The Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot;.

The name &quot;Communards&quot; refers to the revolutionaries of the 1871 Paris Commune.

== History ==
===Formation (1985)===
The Communards formed in 1985 after singer Jimmy Somerville left his earlier band Bronski Beat to team up with classically trained musician Richard Coles. Somerville often used a falsetto/countertenor singing style. Coles, though mainly a pianist, played a number of instruments and had been seen previously performing the clarinet solos on the Bronski Beat hit &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;. They were joined by bass player Dave Renwick, who had also played with Bronski Beat.

===Breakthrough and &quot;Communards&quot; (1985–1987)===
The band had their first UK top 30 hit in 1985 with the piano-based number 30 single &quot;You Are My World&quot;. The following year, they had their biggest hit with an energetic hi-NRG cover version of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes&#x27; soul classic &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; (in a version inspired by Thelma Houston&#x27;s cover) which spent four weeks at number one and became the UK&#x27;s biggest selling single of 1986. It also made the US top 40. It featured Sarah Jane Morris as co-vocalist, taking advantage of the contrast between Morris&#x27;s deep and rounded contralto and Somerville&#x27;s soaring falsetto.

On one &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; episode, with the song being mimed, Morris and Somerville changed roles so that Somerville appeared to sing the deep notes and Morris the high ones. Morris performed both backing and co-lead vocals on many of the Communards&#x27; other recordings, and appeared in group photos as an unofficial third member. Later that year, the Communards had another UK top 10 hit with the single &quot;So Cold the Night&quot;, which reached number 8. 

===&quot;Red&quot; and split (1987–1988)===
In 1987, they released an album titled &quot;Red&quot;, which was partly produced by Stephen Hague. &quot;Red&quot; featured a cover version of the Jackson 5 hit &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; (in a version inspired by Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s cover), which the Communards took to number 4 on the UK chart. Their last released single was &quot;There&#x27;s More to Love (Than Boy Meets Girl)&quot; in 1988, which reached number 20 and was their final top 20 hit. &quot;Red&quot; is also noteworthy for &quot;Victims&quot; and &quot;For a Friend&quot; (also released as a single), which relates to people living with, and having died from, HIV/AIDS and was written in memory of activist Mark Ashton.
The Communards split in 1988. Somerville pursued a solo musical career, while Coles was ordained as an Anglican priest in 2005, serving as a parish priest in Northamptonshire until he retired in 2022.

<text>Wilhelm Reich ( ; ; 24 March 1897 – 3 November 1957) was an Austrian doctor of medicine and a psychoanalyst, a member of the second generation of analysts after Sigmund Freud. The author of several influential books, &quot;The Impulsive Character&quot; (1925), &quot;The Function of the Orgasm&quot; (1927), &quot;Character Analysis&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot; (1933), he became one of the most radical figures in the history of psychiatry.

Reich&#x27;s work on character contributed to the development of Anna Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence&quot; (1936), and his idea of muscular armour—the expression of the personality in the way the body moves—shaped innovations such as body psychotherapy, Gestalt therapy, bioenergetic analysis and primal therapy. His writing influenced generations of intellectuals; he coined the phrase &quot;the sexual revolution&quot; and according to one historian acted as its midwife. During the 1968 student uprisings in Paris and Berlin, students scrawled his name on walls and threw copies of &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot; at police.

After graduating in medicine from the public University of Vienna in 1922, Reich became deputy director of Freud&#x27;s outpatient clinic, the Vienna Ambulatorium. During the 1930s, he was part of a general trend among younger analysts and Frankfurt sociologists that tried to reconcile psychoanalysis with Marxism. He established the first sexual advisory clinics in Vienna, along with Marie Frischauf. He said he wanted to &quot;attack the neurosis by its prevention rather than treatment&quot;.

Reich moved to Oslo, Norway in 1934. He then moved on to New York in 1939, after having accepted a position as Assistant Professor at the New School of Social Research. During his five years in Oslo, he had coined the term &quot;orgone energy&quot;—from &quot;orgasm&quot; and &quot;organism&quot;—for the notion of life energy. In 1940 he started building orgone accumulators, modified Faraday cages that he claimed were beneficial for cancer patients. He claimed that his laboratory cancer mice had had remarkable positive effects from being kept in a Faraday cage, so he built human-size versions, where one could sit inside. This led to newspaper stories about &quot;sex boxes&quot; that cured cancer.

Following two critical articles about him in &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in 1947, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration obtained an injunction against the interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and associated literature, calling them &quot;fraud of the first magnitude&quot;. Charged with contempt in 1956 for having violated the injunction, Reich was sentenced to two years imprisonment, and that summer over six tons of his publications were burned by order of the court. He died in prison of heart failure just over a year later.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Reich was born the first of two sons to Leon Reich, a farmer, and his wife Cäcilie (née Roniger) in Dobzau, Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary, now in Ukraine. Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s parents were married by Rabbi Schmelkes on June 4, 1895. Baby Wilhelm was circumcised four days after his birth. There was a sister too, born one year after Reich, but she died in infancy. Shortly after his birth the family moved to Jujinetz, a village in Bukovina, where his father ran a cattle farm leased by his mother&#x27;s uncle, Josef Blum.

===Death of parents===
Reich was taught at home until he was 12, when his mother was discovered having an affair with his live-in tutor. Reich wrote about the affair in 1920 in his first published paper, &quot;Über einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke&quot; (), presented in the third person as though about a patient. He wrote that he would follow his mother when she went to the tutor&#x27;s bedroom at night, feeling ashamed and jealous, and wondering if they would kill him if they found out that he knew. He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him on the threat of telling his father. In the end, he did tell his father, and after a protracted period of beatings, his mother committed suicide on October 1, 1910, for which Reich blamed himself.

With the tutor ordered out of the house, Reich was sent to an all-male gymnasium in Czernowitz. It was during this period that a skin condition appeared, diagnosed as psoriasis, that plagued him for the rest of his life, leading several commentators to remark on his ruddy complexion. His father died of tuberculosis on May 3, 1914, and because of rampant inflation the father&#x27;s insurance was worthless, so no money was forthcoming for the brothers. Reich managed the farm and continued with his studies, graduating in 1915 with &quot;Stimmeneinhelligkeit&quot; (). The Russians invaded Bukovina that summer and the Reich brothers fled, losing everything. Reich wrote in his diary: &quot;I never saw either my homeland or my possessions again. Of a well-to-do past, nothing was left.&quot;

==1919–1930: Vienna==
===Undergraduate studies===
Reich joined the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, for the last two years as a lieutenant at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.

Myron Sharaf, his biographer, wrote that Reich loved medicine but was caught between a reductionist/mechanistic and vitalist view of the world. Reich wrote later of this period:

===Introduction to Freud===
Reich first met Sigmund Freud in 1919, when he asked Freud for a reading list for a seminar concerning sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.

One of Reich&#x27;s first patients was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old young woman with whom he had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but in the early days of psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich&#x27;s diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings).

===First marriage, graduation===
Two months after Kahn&#x27;s death, Reich accepted her friend, Annie Pink (1902–1971), as an analysand. Pink was Reich&#x27;s fourth female patient, a medical student three months shy of her 19th birthday. He had an affair with her too, and married her in March 1922 at her father&#x27;s insistence, with psychoanalysts Otto Fenichel and Edith Buxbaum as witnesses. Annie Reich became a well-known psychoanalyst herself. The marriage produced two daughters, Eva (1924–2008) and Lore (1928-2024), both of whom became physicians; Lore Reich Rubin also became a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.

Because he was a war veteran, Reich was allowed to complete a combined bachelor&#x27;s and M.D. in four years, instead of six, and graduated in July 1922. After graduating, he worked in internal medicine at the city&#x27;s University Hospital, and studied neuropsychiatry from 1922 to 1924 at the hospital&#x27;s neurological and psychiatric clinic under Professor Julius Wagner von Jauregg, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927.

===Vienna Ambulatorium===
In 1922, Reich began working in Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic outpatient clinic, known as the Vienna Ambulatorium, which was opened on May 22 that year at Pelikangasse 18 by Eduard Hitschmann. Reich became the assistant director under Hitschmann in 1924 and worked there until his move to Berlin in 1930.

Between 1922 and 1932, the clinic offered free or reduced-cost psychoanalysis to 1,445 men and 800 women, many suffering from shell shock after World War I. It was the second such clinic to open under Freud&#x27;s direction; the first was the Poliklinik in Berlin, set up in 1920 by Max Eitingon and Ernst Simmel.

Sharaf writes that working with labourers, farmers and students allowed Reich to move away from treating neurotic symptoms to observing chaotic lifestyles and anti-social personalities. Reich argued that neurotic symptoms such as obsessive–compulsive disorder were an unconscious attempt to gain control of a hostile environment, including poverty or childhood abuse. They were examples of what he called &quot;character armour&quot; (&quot;Charakterpanzer&quot;), repetitive patterns of behaviour, speech and body posture that served as defence mechanisms. According to Danto, Reich sought out patients at the Ambulatorium who had been diagnosed as psychopaths, believing that psychoanalysis could free them of their rage.

Reich joined the faculty of the Psychoanalytic Institute in Vienna in 1924 and became its director of training. According to Danto, he was well-regarded for the weekly technical seminars he chaired at the Ambulatorium, where he gave papers on his theory of character structure, arguing that psychoanalysis should be based on the examination of unconscious character traits, later known as ego defences. The seminars were attended, from 1927, by Fritz Perls, who went on to develop Gestalt therapy with his wife, Laura Perls. Several commentators remarked on how captivating the seminars were and how eloquently Reich spoke. According to a Danish newspaper in 1934:

===&quot;Der triebhafte Charakter&quot;===
Reich&#x27;s first book, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Impulsive Character: A Psychoanalytic Study of the Pathology of the Self&quot;), was published in 1925. It was a study of the anti-social personalities he had encountered in the Ambulatorium, and argued the need for a systematic theory of character. The book won him professional recognition, including from Freud, who in 1927 arranged for his appointment to the executive committee of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. The appointment was made over the objection of Paul Federn, who had been Reich&#x27;s second analyst in 1922 and who, according to Sharaf, regarded Reich as a psychopath. Reich found the society dull and wrote that he behaved &quot;like a shark in a pond of carps&quot;.

===Orgastic potency===

Beginning in 1924, Reich published a series of papers on the idea of &quot;orgastic potency&quot;, the ability to release the emotions from the muscles and lose the self in an uninhibited orgasm, an idea that Freud came to call Reich&#x27;s &quot;Steckenpferd&quot; (hobby horse). Reich argued that psychic health and the ability to love depended on orgastic potency, the full discharge of the libido: &quot;Sexual release in the sex act must correspond to the excitement which leads up to it.&quot; He wrote: &quot;It is not just to fuck ... not the embrace in itself, not the intercourse. It is the real emotional experience of the loss of your ego, of your whole spiritual self.&quot; He argued that orgastic potency was the goal of character analysis.

Whereas Reich&#x27;s work on character was well received by the psychoanalytic community, Sharaf writes, his work on orgastic potency was unpopular from the start and later ridiculed. He came to be known as the &quot;prophet of the better orgasm&quot; and the &quot;founder of a genital utopia&quot;.

===Rest cure in Switzerland===
Reich&#x27;s brother died of tuberculosis (TB) in 1926, the same disease that had killed their father. Christopher Turner writes in his biography of Reich that a quarter of deaths in Vienna were caused by TB in the 1920s. Reich himself contracted it in 1927 and spent several weeks in the winter of that year in a sanitorium in Davos, Switzerland, where TB patients went for rest cures and fresh air before antibiotics became widely available around 1945. Turner writes that Reich underwent a political and existential crisis in Davos; he returned home in the spring angry and paranoid, according to Annie Reich. Some months later he and Annie were on the streets during the July Revolt of 1927 in Vienna, when 84 workers were shot and killed by police and another 600 were injured. It seems that the experience changed Reich; he wrote that it was his first encounter with human irrationality. He began to doubt everything, and in 1928 joined the Communist Party of Austria:

===Sex-pol movement===
Partly in response to the shooting he had witnessed in Vienna, Reich, then 30, opened six free sex-counseling clinics in the city in 1927 for working-class patients. Each clinic was overseen by a physician, with three obstetricians and a lawyer on call, and offered what Reich called Sex-Pol counseling. Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Reich offered a mixture of &quot;psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives&quot;, Danto writes, and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help.

He also took to the streets in a mobile clinic, driving to parks and out to the suburbs with other psychoanalysts and physicians. Reich would talk to the teenagers and men, while a gynaecologist fitted the women with contraceptive devices, and Lia Laszky, the woman Reich fell in love with at medical school, spoke to the children. They also distributed sex-education pamphlets door to door.

===&quot;Die Funktion des Orgasmus&quot;===
Reich published &quot;Die Funktion des Orgasmus&quot; (&quot;The Function of the Orgasm&quot;) in 1927, dedicating it to Freud. He had presented a copy of the manuscript to Freud on the latter&#x27;s 70th birthday on 6 May 1926. Freud had not appeared impressed. He replied, &quot;That thick?&quot; when Reich handed it to him, and took two months to write a brief but positive letter in response, which Reich interpreted as a rejection. Freud&#x27;s view was that the matter was more complicated than Reich suggested, and that there was no single cause of neurosis. He wrote in 1928 to another psychoanalyst, Dr. Lou Andreas-Salomé:

===Visit to the Soviet Union===
In 1929, Reich and his wife visited the Soviet Union on a lecture tour, leaving the two children in the care of the psychoanalyst Berta Bornstein. Sharaf writes that he returned even more convinced of the link between sexual and economic oppression, and of the need to integrate Marx and Freud. In 1929 his article &quot;Dialectical Materialism and Psychoanalysis&quot; was published in &quot;Unter dem Banner des Marxismus&quot;, the German Communist Party journal. The article explored whether psychoanalysis was compatible with historical materialism, class struggle and proletarian revolution. Reich concluded that they were compatible if dialectical materialism was applied to psychology. This was one of the central theoretical statements of his Marxist period, which included &quot;The Imposition of Sexual Morality&quot; (1932), &quot;The Sexual Struggle of Youth&quot; (1932), &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot; (1933), &quot;What is Class Consciousness?&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot; (1936).

==1930–1934: Germany, Denmark, Sweden==
===&quot;Verlag für Sexualpolitik&quot;===
Reich and his wife moved to Berlin in November 1930, where he set up clinics in working-class areas, taught sex education and published pamphlets. He joined the Communist Party of Germany, but grew impatient over their delay in publishing one of his pamphlets, &#x27; (1932) later published in English as &quot;The Sexual Struggle of Youth&quot; (1972) and so set up his own publishing house, &#x27;, to produce the pamphlet himself.

His subsequent involvement in a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that it would no longer publish his material. On 24 March 1933 Freud told him that his contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish &quot;Character Analysis&quot; had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich&#x27;s stance on teenage sex.

===&quot;Character Analysis&quot;===
Reich published what Robert Corrington called his masterpiece, &quot;Charakteranalyse: Technik und Grundlagen für studierende und praktizierende Analytiker&quot;, in 1933. It was revised and published in English in 1946 and 1949 as &quot;Character Analysis&quot;. The book sought to move psychoanalysis toward a reconfiguration of character structure.

For Reich, character structure was the result of social processes, in particular a reflection of castration and Oedipal anxieties playing themselves out within the nuclear family. Les Greenberg and Jeremy Safran write that Reich proposed a functional identity between the character, emotional blocks, and tension in the body, or what he called character (or muscular/body) armour (&quot;Charakterpanzer&quot;).

Reich proposed that muscular armour was a defence that contained the history of the patient&#x27;s traumas. For example, he blamed Freud&#x27;s jaw cancer on his muscular armour, rather than his smoking: Freud&#x27;s Judaism meant he was &quot;biting down&quot; impulses, rather than expressing them. Dissolving the armour would bring back the memory of the childhood repression that had caused the blockage in the first place.

===End of first marriage===
Reich had several affairs during his marriage to Annie Reich, which ended in 1933 after he began a serious relationship in May 1932 with Elsa Lindenberg, a dancer and pupil of Elsa Gindler. He was living with Lindenberg in Germany when Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933. On March 2 that year, the Nazi newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; published an attack on &quot;Der Sexuelle Kampf der Jugend&quot;. Reich and Lindenberg left for Vienna the next day. They moved from there to Denmark, where Reich was excluded from the Danish Communist Party in November 1933 (without ever having joined it) because of his promotion of teenage sex and the publication that year of &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot;, which they regarded as &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot;. There were multiple complaints about his promotion of abortion, sex education, and the attempted suicide of a teenage patient. According to Turner, when Reich&#x27;s visa expired, it was not renewed.

He tried to find support among psychoanalysts in the UK so that he could settle there, and was interviewed in London by Ernest Jones, Melanie Klein, Joan Riviere and James Strachey. They decided that he had been &quot;insufficiently analysed&quot; and had an unresolved hostility toward Freud. Anna Freud, Freud&#x27;s daughter—whom Jones had contacted about Reich&#x27;s desire to relocate to England—wrote in 1938: &quot;There is a wall somewhere where he stops to understand the other person&#x27;s point of view and flies off into a world of his own ... He is an unhappy person ... and I am afraid this will end in sickness.&quot;

Reich and Lindenberg moved instead to Malmö in Sweden, which Reich described as &quot;better than a concentration camp&quot;, but he was placed under surveillance when police suspected that the hourly visits of patients to his hotel room meant he was running a brothel, with Lindenberg as the prostitute. The government declined to extend his visa, and the couple had to move briefly back to Denmark, Reich under an assumed name.

===Vegetotherapy===

From 1930 onwards, Reich began to treat patients outside the limits of psychoanalysis&#x27;s restrictions. He would sit opposite them, rather than behind them as they lay on a couch (the traditional psychoanalyst&#x27;s position), and begin talking to them and answering their questions, instead of offering the stock, &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; analyst&#x27;s response. He had noticed that after a successful course of psychoanalysis his patients would hold their bodies differently, so he began to try to communicate with the body using touch. He asked his male patients to undress down to their shorts, and sometimes entirely, and his female patients down to their underclothes, and began to massage them to loosen their body armour. He would also ask them to simulate physically the effects of certain emotions in the hope of triggering them.

He first presented the principles of what he called character-analytic vegetotherapy in August 1934, in a paper entitled &quot;Psychischer Kontakt und vegetative Strömung&quot; (&quot;Psychological Contact and Vegetative Current&quot;) at the 13th International Congress of Psychoanalysis at Lucerne, Switzerland. His second wife, Ilse Ollendorf, said vegetotherapy replaced the psychoanalytic method of never touching a patient with &quot;a physical attack by the therapist&quot;.

The method eliminated the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality. Reich argued that the psychoanalytic taboos reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient, and that he wanted his patients to see him as human. He would press his thumb or the palm of his hand hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity. He wrote that the purpose of the massage was to retrieve the repressed memory of the childhood situation that had caused the repression. If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the &quot;orgasm reflex&quot;. According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it &quot;orgasmotherapy&quot;, but thought better of it.

Just before the crucial August 1934 Lucerne conference (13th International Congress of Psycho-analysis), Reich was (perhaps naively) ignorant of the ground-swell of opinion against him. At the meeting, he was asked to resign from the International Psychoanalytical Association, where Anna Freud was the &quot;acknowledged leader&quot; at the time, for prioritizing his revolutionary political-social (communist) views over Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic ideas. Besides the theoretical differences, there was also, by that time, a significant level of &quot;appeasement&quot; to the increasing power of Nazism. Reich had protested to Anna Freud (Secretary of the International Association) about the omission of his name from the list of German members of the Association, apparently on the spurious grounds that he was going to join the Scandinavian branch. Ernest Jones was the President of the International Association and he had also turned against Reich, combined with Paul Federn and Max Eitingon, who had all levelled personal attacks against Reich.

According to Lore Reich Rubin, Reich&#x27;s daughter, Anna Freud was responsible for destroying her father&#x27;s career: &quot;She got rid of him&quot;. However, there is also some evidence that she later regretted this. He arrived at the conference, relatively unconscious about his future treatment. He presented a significant paper and was then informed that he was to be excluded. Turner writes that he cemented his reputation as a madman, camping in a tent outside the conference hall and reportedly carrying a large knife in his belt. According to the psychiatrist Grete L. Bibring, Paul Federn declared, &quot;Either Reich goes or I go.&quot;

==1934–1939: Norway==
===Bioelectricity===
In October 1934, Reich and Lindenberg moved to Oslo, Norway, where Harald K. Schjelderup, professor of psychology at the University of Oslo, had invited Reich to lecture on character analysis and vegetotherapy. They ended up staying for five years. During his time in Norway, Reich attempted to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud&#x27;s metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He wanted to know what additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.

Reich was influenced by the work of the Austrian internist Friedrich Kraus, who argued in his paper &quot;Allgemeine und Spezielle Pathologie der Person&quot; (1926) that the biosystem was a relay-like switch mechanism of electrical charge and discharge. Reich wrote in an essay, &quot;Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung&quot; (&quot;The Orgasm as an Electrophysiological Discharge&quot;, 1934), that the orgasm is just such a bioelectrical discharge and proposed his &quot;orgasm formula&quot;: mechanical tension (filling of the organs with fluid; tumescence) → bioelectrical charge → bioelectrical discharge → mechanical relaxation (detumescence).

In 1935, Reich bought an oscillograph and attached it to friends and students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, he was married to Reich&#x27;s secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against Nazi Germany. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital&#x27;s director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in &quot;Experimentelle Ergebnisse über die elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst&quot; (&quot;The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety&quot;).

===Bion experiments===

From 1934 to 1939, Reich conducted what he called the bion experiments, which he published as &quot;Die Bione: zur Entstehung des vegetativen Lebens&quot; in Oslo in February 1938 (published in English in 1979 and later called &quot;The Bion Experiments on the Origin of Life&quot;). He examined protozoa and grew cultured vesicles using grass, sand, iron and animal tissue, boiling them and adding potassium and gelatin. Having heated the materials to incandescence with a heat-torch, he wrote that he had seen bright, glowing, blue vesicles. His photographs and films of his experiments were taken by Kari Berggrav. He called them &quot;bions&quot; and believed they were a rudimentary form of life, halfway between life and non-life. He wrote that when he poured the cooled mixture onto growth media, bacteria were born, dismissing the idea that the bacteria were already present in the air or on other materials.

In what Sharaf writes was the origins of the orgone theory, Reich said he could see two kinds of bions, the blue vesicles and smaller red ones shaped like lancets. He called the former PA-bions and the latter T-bacilli, the T standing for &quot;Tod&quot;, German for death. He wrote in his book &quot;The Cancer Biopathy&quot; (1948) that he had found T-bacilli in rotting cancerous tissue obtained from a local hospital, and when injected into mice they caused inflammation and cancer. He concluded that, when orgone energy diminishes in cells through aging or injury, the cells undergo &quot;bionous degeneration&quot;. At some point the deadly T-bacilli start to form in the cells. Death from cancer, he believed, was caused by an overwhelming growth of the T-bacilli.

===Opposition to his ideas===

In 1937, Reich faced strong opposition from Norwegian scientists regarding his theories on bions, many deriding them as nonsense. To counter this, he allowed the Norwegian pathologist Leiv Kreyberg to examine one of his bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that, while the broth Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed sterile, the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci, and thus concluded that Reich&#x27;s control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification. Reich sent a sample of the bacteria to a Norwegian biologist, Theodor Thjøtta of the Oslo Bacteriological Institute, who also blamed airborne infection. As a result, &quot;Tidens Tegn&quot;, a leading liberal newspaper, launched a campaign against him with support from scientists and other newspapers.

By February 1938, Reich&#x27;s visa had expired. Several Norwegian scientists argued against an extension, Kreyberg saying, &quot;If it is a question of handing Dr. Reich over to the Gestapo, then I will fight that, but if one could get rid of him in a decent manner, that would be the best.&quot; The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: &quot;When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?&quot; Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich&#x27;s sociological works were &quot;a distinct and valuable contribution toward science&quot;, and from A. S. Neill, founder of Summerhill, a progressive school in England, who argued that &quot;the campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized, more like fascism than democracy&quot;. Norway was proud of its intellectual tolerance, so the &quot;Reich affair&quot;, especially following the country&#x27;s 1936 expulsion of Leon Trotsky, put Nygaardsvold&#x27;s government on the spot. A compromise was found in which Reich was given his visa, but a royal decree was later issued stipulating that anyone wanting to practice psychoanalysis needed a licence, which Reich was not permitted to have.

The affair drew much attention between March and December 1938, with more than 165 articles and letters appearing in 13 Norwegian newspapers denouncing Reich&#x27;s work. The most prominent was published by the country&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;Aftenposten&quot;, on 19 and 21 April 1938, containing the views of both Kreyberg and Thjøtta, in which the former alleged that &quot;Mr. Reich&quot; knew less about bacteria and anatomy than a first-year medical student. When Reich requested a detailed control study, Kreyberg responded that his work did not merit it. Throughout the affair Reich issued just one public statement, when he asked for a commission to replicate his bion experiments. Sharaf writes that the opposition to his work affected his personality and relationships. He was left humiliated, no longer comfortable in public, and seething with bitterness against the researchers who had denounced him.

===Personal life===
According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was the happiest period of Reich&#x27;s personal life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg was good and he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg&#x27;s great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.

In 1937, Reich began an affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to a colleague of his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the analysis would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm her as much as it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had an affair with Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.

Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the newspaper campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she not have a separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom she was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour took its toll on their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.

==1939–1947: United States==
===Teaching, second marriage===
When Hitler annexed Austria in March 1938, Reich&#x27;s ex-wife and daughters had already left for the United States. Later that year, Theodore P. Wolfe, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, traveled to Norway to study under Reich. Wolfe offered to help Reich settle in the States, and managed to arrange an invitation from The New School in New York for Reich to teach a course on &quot;Biological Aspects of Character Formation&quot;. Wolfe and Walter Briehl, a former student of Reich&#x27;s, put up $5,000 to guarantee his visa. Wolfe also pulled strings with Adolph Berle, an official in the State Department. Reich wrote in his diary in May 1939:

He received the visa in August 1939, and sailed out of Norway on August 19 on the &quot;SS Stavangerfjord&quot;, the last ship to leave for the United States before the war began on September 3. He began teaching at The New School, where he remained until May 1941, living first at 7502 Kessel Street, Forest Hills, Queens, where he conducted experiments on mice with cancer, injecting them with bions. He built a small Faraday cage to examine the vapors and lights he said the bions were producing. In October 1939, his secretary Gertrud Gaasland introduced him to Ilse Ollendorf, 29 years old at the time. Reich was still in love with Lindenberg, but Ollendorf started organizing his life for him, becoming his bookkeeper and laboratory assistant. They began living together in the Kessel Street house on Christmas Day 1939. She was eight weeks pregnant, but according to Turner he insisted that she have an abortion. Five years later, in 1944, they had a son, Peter, and were married in 1946.

Sharaf writes that Reich&#x27;s personality changed after his experience in Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know him as a man that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.

===Orgonomy===

It was shortly after he arrived in New York in 1939 that Reich first said he had discovered a biological or cosmic energy, an extension of Freud&#x27;s idea of the libido. He called it &quot;orgone energy&quot; or &quot;orgone radiation&quot;, and the study of it &quot;orgonomy&quot;. Reich said he had seen orgone when he injected his mice with bions and in the sky at night through an &quot;organoscope&quot;, a special telescope. He argued that it is in the soil and air (indeed, is omnipresent), is blue or blue-grey, and that humanity had divided its knowledge of it in two: aether for the physical aspect and God for the spiritual. The colour of the sky, the northern lights, St Elmo&#x27;s Fire, and the blue of sexually excited frogs are manifestations of orgone, he wrote. He also argued that protozoa, red corpuscles, cancer cells and the chlorophyll of plants are charged with it.

In 1940, he began to build insulated Faraday cages, &quot;orgone accumulators&quot;, that he said would concentrate the orgone. The earliest boxes were for laboratory animals. The first human-sized, five-foot-tall box was built in December 1940, and set up in the basement of his house. Turner writes that it was made of plywood lined with rock wool and sheet iron, and had a chair inside and a small window. The boxes had multiple layers of these materials, which caused the orgone concentration inside the box to be three to five times stronger than in the air, Reich said. Patients were expected to sit inside them naked.

The accumulators were tested on plant growth and mice with cancer. Reich wrote to his supporters in July 1941 that orgone is &quot;definitely able to destroy cancerous growth. This is proved by the fact that tumors in all parts of the body are disappearing or diminishing. No other remedy in the world can claim such a thing.&quot; Although not licensed to practise medicine in the United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, that he had been hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.

===Experiment with Einstein===
In December 1940, Reich wrote to Albert Einstein saying he had a scientific discovery he wanted to discuss, and, in January 1941, visited Einstein at his home in Princeton, where they talked for nearly five hours. He told Einstein that he had discovered a &quot;specific biologically effective energy which behaves in many respects differently to all that is known about electromagnetic energy&quot;. He said it could be used against disease, and as a weapon &quot;in the fight against the Fascist pestilence&quot;. (Einstein had signed a letter to President Roosevelt in August 1939 to warn of the danger of Nazi Germany building an atom bomb, and had urged the United States to establish its own research project.) Einstein agreed that if an object&#x27;s temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, as Reich was suggesting, it would be &quot;a bomb&quot;.

Reich was much encouraged by the meeting and hoped he would be invited to join Princeton&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Study. During their next meeting, he gave Einstein a small accumulator, and over the next 10 days Einstein performed experiments with it in his basement, which involved taking the temperature above, inside and near the device, and stripping it down to its Faraday cage to compare temperatures. He observed an increase of temperature, which Reich argued was caused by orgone. One of Einstein&#x27;s assistants pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on the ceiling. Einstein concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient inside the room. &quot;Through these experiments I regard the matter as completely solved&quot;, he wrote to Reich on 7 February 1941.

Reich responded with a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein&#x27;s mind. To rule out the influence of convection he told Einstein that he had taken certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich&#x27;s future correspondence—Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments—until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein&#x27;s change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as &quot;The Einstein Affair&quot;.

===Arrest by the FBI===
Reich lost his position at the New School in May 1941, after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich&#x27;s claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.

On 12 December 1941, five days after the attack on Pearl Harbor and a day after Germany declared it was at war with the United States, Reich was arrested in his home at 2 a.m. by the FBI and taken to Ellis Island, where he was held for over three weeks. He identified himself at the time as the Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, Director of the Orgone Institute. He was at first left to sleep on the floor in a large hall, surrounded by members of the fascist German American Bund, who Reich feared might kill him, but when his psoriasis returned he was transferred to the hospital ward. He was questioned about several books the FBI found when they searched his home, including Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;My Life&quot;, a biography of Lenin and a Russian alphabet book for children. After threatening to go on hunger strike he was released, on 5 January, but his name remained on the &quot;key figures list&quot; of the Enemy Alien Control Unit, which meant he was placed under surveillance.

Turner writes that it seems Reich was the victim of mistaken identity; there was a William Reich who ran a bookstore in New Jersey, which was used to distribute Communist material. The FBI acknowledged the mistake in November 1943 and closed Reich&#x27;s file. In 2000 it released 789 pages of the file:

===Purchase of Orgonon===

In November 1942, Reich purchased an old farm for $4,000 on Dodge Pond, Maine, near Rangeley, with of land. Calling it Orgonon, he started spending summers there, and had a one-room cabin built in 1943, a laboratory in 1945, a larger cabin in 1946, and an observatory in 1948.

In 1950, he decided to live there year-round, and in May that year moved from New York with Ilse, their son, Peter, and Reich&#x27;s daughter Eva, with the idea of creating a centre for the study of orgone. Several colleagues moved there with him, including two physicians with an interest in orgone, and Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Press Institute. The artist William Moise joined Reich as an assistant at Orgonon, later marrying Eva Reich. Orgonon still houses the Wilhelm Reich Museum, as well as holiday cottages available to rent, one of which is the cottage in which the Reichs lived.

==1947–1957: Legal problems==
===Brady articles, FDA===

Until 1947, Reich enjoyed largely uncritical attention from the press in the United States. One journal, &quot;Psychosomatic Medicine&quot;, had called orgone a &quot;surrealist creation&quot;, but his psychoanalytic work had been discussed in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; and the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot; had given his writing positive reviews, and he was listed in &quot;American Men of Science&quot;.
His reputation took a sudden downturn in April and May 1947, when articles by Mildred Edie Brady were published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, the latter entitled &quot;The Strange Case of Wilhelm Reich&quot;, with the subhead, &quot;The man who blames both neuroses and cancer on unsatisfactory sexual activities has been repudiated by only one scientific journal.&quot; Brady&#x27;s ultimate target was not Reich but psychoanalysis, which according to Turner she saw as akin to astrology.

Of Reich she wrote: &quot;Orgone, named after the sexual orgasm, is, according to Reich, a cosmic energy. It is, in fact, cosmic energy. Reich has not only discovered it; he has seen it, demonstrated it and named a town—Orgonon, Maine—after it. Here he builds accumulators of it, which are rented out to patients, who presumably derive &#x27;orgastic potency&#x27; from it.&quot; She claimed, falsely, that he had said the accumulators could cure not only impotence but cancer. Brady argued that the &quot;growing Reich cult&quot; had to be dealt with. On his copy of the &quot;New Republic&quot; article, Reich wrote &quot;THE SMEAR&quot;. He issued a press release, but no one published it.

In July 1947, Dr. J. J. Durrett, director of the Medical Advisory Division of the Federal Trade Commission, wrote to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking them to investigate Reich&#x27;s claims about the health benefits of orgone. The FDA assigned an investigator to the case, who learned that Reich had built 250 accumulators. The FDA concluded that they were dealing with a &quot;fraud of the first magnitude&quot;. According to Sharaf, the FDA suspected a sexual racket of some kind; questions were asked about the women associated with orgonomy and &quot;what was done with them&quot;. From that point on, Reich&#x27;s work came increasingly to the attention of the authorities.

===Orgonomic Infant Research Center===
Reich established the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, with the aim of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich&#x27;s associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children&#x27;s &quot;blockages&quot;. Reich&#x27;s daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.

The sexual allegations apart, several people discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed hard on the body to loosen muscular armour. Reich&#x27;s son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Book of Dreams&quot; (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the niece of William Steig, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.

===Divorce, cloudbusters===

Reich and Ilse Ollendorff divorced in September 1951, ostensibly because he thought she had an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.

In 1951, Reich said he had discovered another energy that he called deadly orgone radiation (DOR), accumulations of which played a role in desertification. He designed a &quot;cloudbuster&quot;, rows of 15-foot aluminium pipes mounted on a mobile platform, connected to cables that were inserted into water. He believed that it could unblock orgone energy in the atmosphere and cause rain. Turner described it as an &quot;orgone box turned inside out&quot;.

He conducted dozens of experiments with the cloudbuster, calling his research &quot;Cosmic Orgone Engineering&quot;. During a drought in 1953, two farmers in Maine offered to pay him if he could make it rain to save their blueberry crop. Reich used the cloudbuster on the morning of July 6, and according to the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot;—based on an account from an anonymous eyewitness who was probably Peter Reich—rain began to fall that evening. The crop survived, the farmers declared themselves satisfied, and Reich received his fee.

===Injunction===
Over the years the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich&#x27;s students and his patients, asking about the orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phony, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.

The attention of the FDA triggered belligerent responses from Reich, who called them &quot;HiGS&quot; (hoodlums in government) and the tools of red fascists. He developed a delusion that he had powerful friends in government, including President Eisenhower, who he believed would protect him, and that the U.S. Air Force was flying over Orgonon to make sure that he was all right. On 29 July 1952 three inspectors arrived at Orgonon unannounced. Sharaf writes that Reich detested unannounced visitors; he had once chased some people away with a gun just for looking at an adjacent property. He told the inspectors they had to read his work before he would interact with them, and ordered them to leave.

In February 1954, the United States Attorney for the District of Maine filed a 27-page complaint seeking a permanent injunction, under Sections 301 and 302 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, to prevent interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and to ban promotional literature. Reich refused to appear in court, arguing that no court was in a position to evaluate his work. In a letter to Judge John D. Clifford, Jr. in February, he wrote:

The injunction was granted by default on 19 March 1954. The judge ordered that all accumulators, parts and instructions be destroyed, and that several of Reich&#x27;s books that mentioned orgone be withheld.

===Chasing UFOs===
According to Turner, the injunction triggered a further deterioration in Reich&#x27;s mental health. From at least early 1954, he came to believe that the planet was under attack by UFOs, which he called &quot;energy alphas&quot;. He said he often saw them flying over Orgonon, shaped like thin cigars with windows, leaving streams of black Deadly Orgone Radiation in their wake, which he believed the aliens were scattering to destroy the Earth.

He and his son would spend their nights searching for UFOs through telescopes and binoculars, and sometimes, when they believed they had found one, they would roll out a cloudbuster to suck the energy out of it (the perceived-or-imagined-UFO). Reich claimed he had shot several of them down. Armed with two cloudbusters, they fought what Reich called a &quot;full-scale interplanetary battle&quot; in Arizona, where he had rented a house as a base station. In &quot;Contact with Space&quot; (1956), he wrote of the &quot;very remote possibility&quot; that his own father had been from outer space.

In &quot;Wilhelm Reich versus The Flying Saucers,&quot; James Reich (unrelated) takes the view that Reich&#x27;s involvement with UFO phenomena can be traced to his introjection of cinematic content, not least &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951).

In late 1954, Reich began an affair with Grethe Hoff, a former patient. Hoff was married to another former student and patient of his, the psychologist Myron Sharaf, who decades later, with his &quot;Fury on Earth&quot; (1983), became Reich&#x27;s main biographer. Hoff and Sharaf had had their first child the year before Hoff left him for Reich; the marriage was never repaired although the affair had ended by June 1955. Two months later Reich began another relationship, this time with Aurora Karrer, a medical researcher, and, in November, he moved out of Orgonon to an apartment in Alban Towers, Washington, D.C., to live with her, using the pseudonym Dr. Walter Roner.

===Contempt of court===

While Reich was in Arizona in May 1956, one of his associates sent an accumulator part through the mail to another state, in violation of the injunction, after an FDA inspector posing as a customer requested it. Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with contempt of court; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich&#x27;s absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.

Representing himself during the hearing, he admitted the violation but pleaded not guilty and hinted at conspiracies. During a recess the judge apparently suggested a psychiatric evaluation to Reich&#x27;s ex-wife, Ilse Ollendorff, but this was not communicated to Reich. The jury found him guilty on 7 May 1956, and he was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. Silvert was sentenced to a year and a day, the Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000, and the accumulators and associated literature were to be destroyed.

===Book burning===
On 5 June 1956, two FDA officials arrived at Orgonon to supervise the destruction of the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York, leaving only three accumulators at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only to supervise the destruction, so Reich&#x27;s friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.

On 26 June, the agents returned to supervise the destruction of the promotional material, including 251 copies of Reich&#x27;s books. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize the destruction of the accumulators. In England, A. S. Neill and the poet Herbert Read signed a letter of protest, but it was never published. On July 23 the remaining accumulators in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.

On 23 August, six tons of Reich&#x27;s books, journals and papers were burned in New York, at the Gansevoort incinerator, a public incinerator on 25th Street. The material included copies of several of his books, including &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, &quot;Character Analysis&quot; and &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot;. Although these had been published in German before Reich ever discussed orgone, he had added mention of it to the English editions, so they were caught by the injunction. It has been cited as one of the worst examples of censorship in U.S. history. As with the accumulators, the FDA was supposed only to observe the destruction. The psychiatrist Victor Sobey (d. 1995), an associate of Reich&#x27;s, wrote:

===Imprisonment===
Reich appealed the lower court&#x27;s decision in October 1956, but the Court of Appeals upheld it on 11 December. He wrote several times to J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, requesting a meeting, and appealed to the Supreme Court, which decided on 25 February 1957 not to review the case. On 12 March 1957 Reich and Silvert were sent to Danbury Federal Prison. (Silvert committed suicide in May 1958, five months after his release.) Richard C. Hubbard, a psychiatrist who admired Reich, examined him on admission, recording paranoia manifested by delusions of grandiosity, persecution, and ideas of reference:

On March 19, Reich was transferred to the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary and examined again. This time it was decided that he was mentally competent and that his personality seemed intact, though he might become psychotic when stressed. A few days later, on his 60th birthday, he wrote to his son, Peter, then 13:

He applied for a presidential pardon in May, to no avail. Peter visited him in jail several times, where one prisoner said Reich was known as the &quot;flying saucer guy&quot; and the &quot;Sex Box man&quot;. Reich told Peter that he cried a lot, and wanted Peter to let himself cry too, believing that tears are the &quot;great softener&quot;. His last letter to his son was on 22 October 1957, when he said he was looking forward to being released on 10 November, having served one third of his sentence. A parole hearing had been scheduled for a few days before that date. He wrote that he and Peter had a date for a meal at the Howard Johnson restaurant near Peter&#x27;s school. Peter&#x27;s mother Ilse, who was a Quaker, stated that Wilhelm attended some Protestant services during his imprisonment and sent his son various prayers.

===Death===
Reich failed to appear for roll call on 3 November 1957, and was found at 7 a.m. in his bed. The prison doctor said he had died during the night of &quot;myocardial insufficiency with sudden heart failure&quot;. He was buried in a vault at Orgonon that he had asked his caretaker to dig in 1955. He had left instructions that there was to be no religious ceremony, but that a record should be played of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot; sung by Marian Anderson, and that his granite headstone should read simply: &quot;Wilhelm Reich, Born March 24, 1897, Died ... &quot; None of the academic journals carried an obituary. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote on 18 November 1957:

==Reception and legacy==
===Psychotherapy===
The psychoanalyst Richard Sterba wrote in 1982 that Reich had been a brilliant clinician and teacher in the 1920s; even the older analysts had wanted to attend his technical seminars in Vienna. But according to Sharaf, they came to consider Reich as paranoid and belligerent. Psychologist Luis Cordon wrote that Reich&#x27;s slide from respectability concluded with the consensus inside and outside the psychoanalytic community that he was at best a crackpot and perhaps seriously ill.

There were inaccurate rumours from the late 1920s that he had been hospitalized. Paul Federn became Reich&#x27;s second analyst in 1922; he later said he had detected &quot;incipient schizophrenia&quot; and called Reich a psychopath. Similarly, Sandor Rado had Reich as an analyst and in 1931 declared him schizophrenic &quot;in the most serious way&quot;. Reich&#x27;s daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, a psychiatrist, speculated that he had bipolar disorder and may have been sexually abused as a child.

Sharaf argued that psychoanalysts tended to dismiss as ill anyone from within the fold who had transgressed, and this was never done so relentlessly as with Reich. His work was split into the pre-psychotic &quot;good&quot; and the post-psychotic &quot;bad&quot;, the date of the illness&#x27;s onset depending on which parts of his work a speaker disliked. Psychoanalysts preferred to see him as sane in the 1920s because of his work on character, while political radicals regarded him as sane in the 1930s because of his Marxist-oriented research.

Despite Reich&#x27;s precarious mental health, his work on character and the idea of muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body psychotherapy, and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich&#x27;s student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.

===Humanities===
Reich&#x27;s work influenced a generation of intellectuals, including Saul Bellow, William Burroughs and Norman Mailer, and the founder of Summerhill School in England, A. S. Neill. The French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote in &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; (1976) that the impact of Reich&#x27;s critique of sexual repression had been substantial.

The Austrian-American philosopher Paul Edwards said that the FDA&#x27;s pursuit of Reich had intensified Edwards&#x27; attachment to him. He wrote in 1977 that for years he and his friends regarded Reich as &quot;something akin to a messiah&quot;. Paul Mathews and John M. Bell started teaching a course on Reich in 1968 at New York University through its Division of Continuing Study, and it was still being taught at the time Sharaf was writing Reich&#x27;s biography in 1983, making it the longest-running course ever taught in that division.

Several well-known figures used orgone accumulators, including Orson Bean, Sean Connery, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Goodman, Jack Kerouac, Isaac Rosenfeld, J. D. Salinger, William Steig and Robert Anton Wilson. Norman Mailer—who owned several orgone accumulators, including some in the shape of eggs—wrote about Reich enthusiastically in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, as a result of which Orgonon became a place of pilgrimage and the orgasm a symbol of liberation.

===Popular culture===
Reich continued to influence popular culture after his death. Turner writes that the evil Dr. Durand Durand (Milo O&#x27;Shea) in the feature film &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968) seems to be based on Reich; he places Barbarella (Jane Fonda) in his &quot;Excessive Machine&quot; so that she would die of pleasure, but rather than killing her the machine burns out. A film about Reich and the implications of his ideas, &quot;W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism&quot; (1971), was made by Yugoslav director Dušan Makavejev. An orgone accumulator made an appearance as the Orgasmatron in Woody Allen&#x27;s comedy feature film &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973). The use of orgone accumulators, a cloudbuster and representations of Reich&#x27;s orgone therapy with patients, together with a snapshot of the FDA&#x27;s hostile actions against Reich were dramatised in a short film called &quot;It Can Be Done&quot;, which was made by British director Jon East in 1999. The film screened at the 56th Venice Film Festival on 11 September 1999.

Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Birdland&quot; on her album &quot;Horses&quot; (1975) is based on Reich&#x27;s life. Hawkwind&#x27;s song &quot;Orgone Accumulator&quot;, on their album &quot;Space Ritual&quot; (1973) is named for his invention. In Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Joey&quot; from &quot;Desire&quot; (1976), the eponymous gangster spends his time in prison reading Nietzsche and Reich. Reich is also a character in the opera &quot;Marilyn&quot; (1980) by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.

Kate Bush&#x27;s single &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; (1985) described Reich&#x27;s arrest through the eyes of his son, Peter, who wrote his father&#x27;s story in &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot; (1973). The video for the song features Donald Sutherland as Reich and Bush as Peter. Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s play, &quot;Wilhelm Reich in Hell&quot; (1987), is about Reich&#x27;s confrontation with the American government. &quot;Four-beat Rhythm: The Writings of Wilhelm Reich&quot; (2013) is a compilation album on which Reich&#x27;s writings are adapted to music. The Australian designer Marc Newson has produced a range of orgone furniture, most famously his Orgone Chair (1993). In James Reich&#x27;s novel &quot;Soft Invasions&quot; (2017), a fictionalized Wilhelm Reich is treating a Hollywood mogul using an orgone accumulator.

===Science===
The scientific community dismissed Reich&#x27;s orgone theory as pseudoscience. James Strick, a historian of science at Franklin and Marshall College, wrote in 2015 that the dominant narrative since Reich&#x27;s death has been that &quot;there is no point in looking more closely at Reich&#x27;s science because there no legitimate science from Reich&quot;.

From 1960, apparently in response to the book burning, the New York publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux began republishing his major works. Reichian physicians organized study groups. Reich asked his student and colleague, Dr. Elsworth Baker, to carry the study of orgonomy forward. In 1967 Baker, established the bi-annual &quot;Journal of Orgonomy&quot;, still published , and in 1968 founded the American College of Orgonomy in Princeton, New Jersey. According to Sharaf, contributors to the &quot;Journal of Orgonomy&quot; who worked in academia often used pseudonyms. The Orgone Biophysical Research Laboratory was founded in 1978 by James DeMeo and the Institute for Orgonomic Science in 1982 by Morton Herskowitz.

There was renewed interest in November 2007, when the Reich archives at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine at Harvard University were unsealed; Reich had left instructions that his unpublished papers be stored for 50 years after his death. James E. Strick, a historian of science and later president of the Wilhelm Reich Trust, began studying Reich&#x27;s laboratory notebooks from the 1935–1939 bion experiments in Norway. In 2015 Harvard University Press published Strick&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Reich, Biologist&quot;, in which he writes that Reich&#x27;s work in Oslo &quot;represented the cutting edge of light microscopy and time-lapse micro-cinematography&quot;. He argues that the dominant narrative of Reich as a pseudoscientist is incorrect and that Reich&#x27;s story is &quot;much more complex and interesting&quot;.

Speaking to Christopher Turner in 2011, Reich&#x27;s son, Peter, said of his father, &quot;He was a nineteenth-century scientist; he wasn&#x27;t a twentieth-century scientist. He didn&#x27;t practice science the way scientists do today. He was a nineteenth-century mind who came crashing into twentieth-century America. And boom!&quot;

<text>Robert Emerson Clampett Sr. (May 8, 1913 – May 2, 1984) was an American animator, director, producer and puppeteer best known for his work on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; animated series from Warner Bros. as well as the television shows &quot;Time for Beany&quot; and &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. He was born and raised not far from Hollywood and, early in life, showed an interest in animation and puppetry. After dropping out of high school in 1931, he joined the team at Harman-Ising Productions and began working on the studio&#x27;s newest short subjects, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;.

Clampett was promoted to a directorial position in 1937. During his 15 years at the studio, he directed 84 cartoons later deemed classic, and designed some of the studio&#x27;s most famous characters, including Porky Pig, Daffy Duck and Tweety. Among his most acclaimed films are &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot; (1946). He left Warner Bros. Cartoons in 1946 and turned his attention to television, creating the puppet show &quot;Time for Beany&quot; in 1949. A later animated version of the series, &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;, was initially broadcast on ABC in 1962 and rerun until 1967. It is considered the first fully creator-driven television series and carried the byline &quot;a Bob Clampett Cartoon&quot;.

In his later years, Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation. His Warner cartoons have seen renewed praise in decades since for their surrealistic qualities, energetic and outrageous animation, and irreverent, wordplay-laden humor. Animation historian Jerry Beck lauded Clampett for &quot;putting the word &#x27;looney&#x27; in &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;.

==Early life==
Clampett was born on May 8, 1913 in San Diego, California to Robert Caleb Clampett and Mildred Joan Merrifield. His father was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland in 1882, and immigrated to the United States with his parents at age two in 1884.&lt;ref name=&quot;irishtimes/animator-looney-tunes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Clampett showed art skills by the age of five. From the beginning, he was intrigued with and influenced by Douglas Fairbanks, Lon Chaney, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, and began making film short-subjects in his garage when he was 12. Living in Hollywood as a young boy, he and his mother Joan lived next door to Charlie Chaplin and his brother Sydney Chaplin. Clampett also recalled watching his father play handball at the Los Angeles Athletic Club with another of the great silent comedians, Harold Lloyd.

From his teens on, Clampett showed an interest in animation. He had made hand puppets as a child and, before adolescence, completed what animation historian Milt Gray describes as &quot;a sort of prototype, a kind of nondescript dinosaur sock puppet that later evolved into Cecil.&quot; In high school, Clampett drew a full-page comic about the nocturnal adventures of a cat, later published in color in a Sunday edition of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. King Features took note and offered Clampett a &quot;cartoonist&#x27;s contract&quot; beginning a $75 a week after high school. King Features allowed him to work in their Los Angeles art department on Saturdays and vacations during high school. King Features occasionally printed his cartoons for encouragement, and paid his way through Otis Art Institute, where he learned to paint in oils and to sculpt.

Clampett attended Glendale High School and Hoover High School in Glendale, California, but left Hoover a few months short of graduating in 1931. He found a job at a doll factory owned by his aunt, Charlotte Clark. Clark was looking for an appealing item to sell and Clampett suggested Mickey Mouse, whose popularity was growing. Unable to find a drawing of the character anywhere, Clampett took his sketchpad to the movie theater and came out with several sketches. Clark was concerned with copyright, so they drove to the Disney studio. Walt and Roy Disney were delighted, and they set up a business not far from the Disney studio. Clampett recalled his short time working for Disney: &quot;Walt Disney himself sometimes came over in an old car to pick up the dolls; he would give them out to visitors to the studio and at sales meetings. I helped him load the dolls in the car. One time his car, loaded with Mickeys, wouldn&#x27;t start, and I pushed while Walt steered, until it caught, and he took off.&quot;

==Career==
===&quot;Looney Tunes&quot; (1931–1946)===

Clampett was, in his words, so &quot;enchanted&quot; by the new medium of sound cartoons that he tried to join Disney as an animator. While Disney wanted to hire Clampett, they ultimately turned him down due to them having had enough animators at that time, so Clampett instead joined Harman-Ising Studios in 1931 for ten dollars a week. Leon Schlesinger viewed one of Clampett&#x27;s 16mm films and was impressed, offering him an assistant position at the studio. His first job was animating secondary characters in the first &quot;Merrie Melodie&quot;, &quot;Lady, Play Your Mandolin!&quot; (1931). The same year, Clampett began attending story meetings after submitting an idea eventually used for &quot;Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!&quot;. The two series were produced at Harman-Ising until mid-1933 when Harman and Ising left Schlesinger, who went on to found Leon Schlesinger Productions. Clampett left Harman and Ising and joined the new studio. In his first years at the studio, Clampett mostly worked for Friz Freleng, under whose guidance Clampett grew into an able animator. By the time he joined Harman-Ising, Clampett was only 17 years old.

By 1934, Schlesinger was in a bit of a crisis trying to find a well-known cartoon character. He noted that the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series consisted of nothing but &quot;little kids doing things together,&quot; and a studio-wide drive to get ideas for an animal version of &quot;Our Gang&quot; commenced. Clampett submitted a drawing of a pig (Porky) and a black cat (Beans), and, in an imitation of the lettering on a can of Campbell&#x27;s Pork and Beans, wrote &quot;Clampett&#x27;s Porky and Beans.&quot; Porky debuted in the Friz Freleng-directed &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot; in 1935. Around the same time, Schlesinger announced a studio-wide contest, with a money prize to whichever member of the staff turned in the best original story. Clampett&#x27;s story won first prize and was made into &quot;My Green Fedora&quot;, also directed by Freleng.

Clampett felt encouraged after these successes and began writing more story contributions. After Schlesinger realized he needed another unit, he made a deal with Tex Avery, naming Clampett his collaborator. They were moved to a ramshackle building used by gardeners and WB custodial staff for storage of cleaning supplies, solvents, brooms, lawnmowers and other implements. Working apart from the other animators in the small, dilapidated wooden building in the middle of the Vitaphone lot, Avery and Clampett soon discovered they were not the only inhabitants - they shared the building with thousands of tiny termites. They christened the building &quot;Termite Terrace&quot;, a name eventually used by historians to describe the entire studio. The two soon developed an irreverent style of animation that would set Warner Bros. apart from its competitors. They were soon joined by animators Chuck Jones, Virgil Ross and Sid Sutherland, and worked virtually without interference on their new, groundbreaking style of humor for the next year. It was a wild place with an almost college fraternity-like atmosphere. Animators would frequently pull pranks such as gluing paper streamers to the wings of flies. Leon Schlesinger, who rarely ventured there, was reputed on one visit to have remarked in his lisping voice, &quot;Pew, let me out of here! The only thing missing is the sound of a flushing toilet!!&quot;

On the side, Clampett directed a sales film, co-animated by Chuck Jones and in-betweened by Robert Cannon. Clampett filmed Cannon in live action as the hero and rotoscoped it into the film. Clampett planned to leave Leon Schlesinger Productions, but Schlesinger offered him a promotion to director and more money if he would stay. Clampett was promoted to director in late 1936, directing a color sequence in the feature &quot;When&#x27;s Your Birthday?&quot; (1937). This led to what was essentially a co-directing stint with fellow animator Chuck Jones for the financially ailing Ub Iwerks, whom Schlesinger subcontracted to produce several Porky Pig shorts. These shorts featured the short-lived and generally unpopular Gabby Goat as Porky&#x27;s sidekick. Despite Clampett and Jones&#x27; contributions, however, Iwerks was the only credited director. Clampett&#x27;s first cartoon with a directorial credit was &quot;Porky&#x27;s Badtime Story&quot;. Under the Warner system, Clampett had complete creative control over his own films, within severe money and time limitations (he was only given $3,000 and four weeks to complete each short). During production of &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; in 1937, Avery created a character that would become Daffy Duck and Clampett animated the character for the first time.

Clampett was so popular in theaters that Schlesinger told the other directors to imitate him, emphasizing gags and action. When Tex Avery departed in 1941, his unit was taken over by Clampett while Norman McCabe took over Clampett&#x27;s old unit. Clampett finished Avery&#x27;s remaining unfinished cartoons. When McCabe joined the armed forces, Frank Tashlin rejoined Schlesinger as director, and that unit was eventually turned over to Robert McKimson. Milton Gray notes that from &quot;The Hep Cat&quot; (1942) on, the cartoons become even more wild as Clampett&#x27;s experimentation reached a peak. Clampett later created the character of Tweety, introduced in &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot; in 1942. His cartoons grew increasingly violent, irreverent, and surreal, not beholden to even the faintest hint of real-world physics, and his characters have been argued to be easily the most rubbery and wacky of all the Warner directors&#x27;. Clampett was heavily influenced by the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, as is most visible in &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; (1938), wherein the entire short takes place within a Dalí-esque landscape complete with melting objects and abstracted forms. Clampett and his work can even be considered part of the surreal movement, as it incorporated film as well as static media. It was largely Clampett&#x27;s influence that would impel the Warners directors to shed the final vestiges of all Disney influence. Clampett was also known for creating some brief voices or sound effects in some of the cartoons. One of these became a personal trademark: a vocal sound accompanying the iris-out closing of every Clampett cartoon (&quot;Bay-woop!&quot;) Clampett liked to bring contemporary cultural movements into his cartoons, especially jazz; film, magazines, comics, novels, and popular music are referenced in Clampett shorts, most visible in &quot;Book Revue&quot; (1946), where performers are drawn onto various celebrated books.

Clampett was a good source for censorship stories, though the accuracy of his recollections has been disputed. According to an interview published in &quot;Funnyworld&quot; #12 (1971), Clampett had a method for ensuring that certain elements of his films would escape the censors&#x27; cuts. He added extremely suggestive or objectionable gags aimed just at the censors; they would focus on cutting those and thus leave in the ones he actually wanted.

Clampett left the studio in May 1945, leaving a handful of shorts unfinished before they were picked up again by other studio directors. The generally accepted story was that Clampett left over matters of artistic freedom, despite some people claimed that he left the studio on his own. Clampett&#x27;s style was becoming increasingly divergent from those of Freleng and Jones. In any event, Clampett was fired by Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s successor, Edward Selzer, who was far less tolerant of him than Schlesinger had been. The Warner style that he was so instrumental in developing was leaving him behind. Warner Bros. had recently bought the rights to the entire &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; studio from Schlesinger and, while his cartoons of 1946 are today considered on the cutting edge of the art for that period, at the time, Clampett was ready to seek new challenges. Clampett left at what some considered the peak of his creativity and against everyone&#x27;s advice.

===Later career and &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; (1946–1984)===

In 1946, two years after Warner Bros. bought out Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s studio, his key executives Henry Binder and Ray Katz went to Screen Gems, the cartoon division of Columbia Pictures, and asked Clampett to join them as the studio&#x27;s creative head. He ultimately worked as a screenwriter and gag writer for the studio. Clampett was now working for three studios at the same time: Warner Bros., Screen Gems, and his new independent studio, Bob Clampett Productions. Deciding &quot;this was too much of a good thing&quot; and seeking more creative freedom than WB would allow, he made the decision to leave WB shortly after joining Screen Gems. That same year, Republic Pictures incorporated animation (by Walter Lantz) into its Gene Autry feature film &quot;Sioux City Sue&quot;. It turned out well enough for Republic to dabble in animated cartoons. Bob Clampett, now working solely for his own studio, directed a single cartoon for Republic, &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Nag&quot;, featuring the equine character Charlie Horse and produced at Bob Clampett Productions. Republic management, however, had second thoughts due to dwindling profits, and they discontinued the series. Clampett took his direction credit under the name &quot;Kilroy&quot;.

In 1949, Clampett turned his attention to television, where he created the famous puppet show &quot;Time for Beany&quot;. The show, featuring the talents of voice artists Stan Freberg and Daws Butler, would earn Clampett three Emmys. Groucho Marx and Albert Einstein were both fans of the series. In 1952, he created the &quot;Thunderbolt the Wondercolt&quot; television series and the 3D prologue to &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; featuring Beany and Cecil. In 1954, he directed &quot;Willy the Wolf&quot; (the first puppet variety show on television), as well as creating and voicing the lead in the &quot;Buffalo Billy&quot; television show. In the late 1950s, Clampett was hired by Associated Artists Productions to catalog the pre-August 1948 Warner cartoons it had just acquired. He also created an animated version of the puppet show called &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;, whose 26 half-hour episodes were first broadcast on ABC in 1962 and were rerun on the network for five years.

Clampett&#x27;s studio was at 729 Seward Street in Hollywood,&lt;ref name=&quot;hqdevelopment/729-Seward&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; later a Klasky Csupo studio.

In his later years, Bob Clampett toured college campuses and animation festivals as a lecturer on the history of animation. In 1974, he was awarded an Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic Convention. In 1975, he was the focus of a documentary entitled &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;, the first documentary to examine the history of the Warner Bros. cartoons. Clampett, whose collection of drawings, films and memorabilia from the golden days of Termite Terrace was legendary, provided nearly all of the behind-the-scenes drawings and home-movie footage for the film; furthermore, his wife, Sody Clampett,&lt;ref name=&quot;catalog.afi/335695&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/2014/07/29/sody-clampett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is credited as the film&#x27;s production coordinator. In an audio commentary recorded for &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;, director Larry Jackson claimed that in order to secure Clampett&#x27;s participation and access to Clampett&#x27;s collection of Warners history, he had to sign a contract that stipulated Clampett would host the documentary and also have approval over the final cut. Jackson also claimed that Clampett was very reluctant speaking about the other directors and their contributions.

==Rivalry with Chuck Jones==
Though Clampett&#x27;s contribution to the Warner Brothers animation legacy was considerable and inarguable, he has been criticized by his peers as &quot;a shameless self-promoter who provoked the wrath of his former Warner&#x27;s colleagues in later years for allegedly claiming credit for ideas that were not his.&quot; Chuck Jones particularly disliked Clampett and deliberately avoided making any mention of his association with him in his 1979 compilation film &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; (compiled by Jones, in which Jones lists himself and other Warners directors), though he did briefly mention working with Clampett in his 1989 autobiography &quot;Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of An Animated Cartoonist&quot; and his 1998 interview for the American Television Archive. Some of this animosity appears to have come from Clampett&#x27;s perceived &quot;golden boy&quot; status at the studio (Clampett&#x27;s mother was said to be a close friend of cartoon producer Leon Schlesinger), which allowed him to ignore studio rules that everyone else was expected to follow. In addition, Mel Blanc, the voice actor who worked with Clampett at the same studio for ten years, also accused Clampett of being an &quot;egotist who took credit for everything.&quot;

Beginning with a magazine article in 1946, shortly after he left the studio, Clampett repeatedly referred to himself as &quot;the creator&quot; of Bugs Bunny, often adding the side-note that he used Clark Gable&#x27;s carrot-eating scene in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; as inspiration for his &quot;creation&quot;. (Clampett can be observed making this claim in &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;.) The other two directorial fathers Bugs is claimed to have had are Tex Avery, who directed &quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, his first official short; and Robert McKimson, who drew the definitive Bugs Bunny model sheet. Depending on the source, Bugs&#x27; primary creator could be either Jones or Freleng. Some argue that, based on a viewing of the early Bugs cartoons of the late 1930s and early 1940s, the character was not &quot;created&quot; by one director, but evolved in personality, voice, and design over several years through the collective efforts of Clampett, Avery, Jones, Freleng, McKimson, Mel Blanc, Cal Dalton, Ben Hardaway and Bob Givens. In &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;, Clampett also takes credit for drawing the model sheet for the first Porky Pig cartoon, &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot; (1935), even though it was actually drawn by Friz Freleng.

Animation historian Milton Gray details the long and bitter rivalry between Clampett and Jones in his essay &quot;Bob Clampett Remembered&quot;. Gray, a personal friend of Clampett, calls the controversy &quot;a deliberate and vicious smear campaign by one of Bob&#x27;s rivals in the cartoon business&quot;. He reveals that Jones was angry at Clampett for making some generalizations in his 1970 interview with &quot;Funnyworld&quot; that gave Clampett too much credit, including taking sole credit for not only Bugs and Daffy but also Jones&#x27;s Sniffles character and Freleng&#x27;s Yosemite Sam. He writes that Jones began making additional accusations against Clampett, such as that Clampett would &quot;go around the studio at night, looking at other directors&#x27; storyboards for ideas he could steal for his own cartoons.&quot; Jones wrote a letter of accusations in 1975 and, according to Gray, distributed copies to every fan he met—seemingly the genesis of the growing controversy. Gray asserts that Clampett was a &quot;kind, generous man [who was] deeply hurt and saddened by Jones&#x27;s accusations. […] I feel that Bob Clampett deserves tremendous respect and gratitude for the wonderful work that he left us.&quot; Other Warner Bros. peers, such as musical coordinator Carl Stalling and animator Tex Avery, stood by Clampett during his talks on the animation industry in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Death==
Clampett died of a heart attack on May 2, 1984, in Detroit, Michigan, six days before his 71st birthday, while touring the country to promote the home video release of &quot;Beany &amp; Cecil&quot; cartoons. He is buried in Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills.

==Legacy==
Since 1984, The Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award has been given each year at the Eisner Awards. Recipients of the award include June Foray, Jack Kirby, Sergio Aragonés, Patrick McDonnell, Maggie Thompson, Ray Bradbury and Mark Evanier.

Clampett&#x27;s &quot;Tin Pan Alley Cats&quot; (1943) was chosen by the Library of Congress as a &quot;prime example of the music and mores of our times&quot; and a print was buried in a time capsule in Washington, D.C., so future generations might see it. &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; (1938) was inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2000, deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

Animator John Kricfalusi, best known for being the creator of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, got to know Clampett in his later years and has reflected on those times as inspirational. Kricfalusi cited Clampett as his favorite animator and Clampett&#x27;s &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot; (1946) as his favorite cartoon: &quot;I saw this thing and it completely changed my life, I thought it was the greatest thing I&#x27;d ever seen, and I still think it is.&quot;

Animation historian Leonard Maltin has called Clampett&#x27;s cartoons &quot;unmistakable&quot;. Milton Gray believes that Schlesinger put Clampett in charge of the black and white cartoon division in order to save it, and many historians have singled out a scene in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;, in which Daffy exits, as a defining Clampett moment. Maltin called it &quot;a level of wackiness few moviegoers had ever seen&quot;.

Historian Charles Solomon noted a rubbery, flexible animation quality visible in all Clampett&#x27;s shorts, and Maltin noted an &quot;energetic, comic anarchy&quot;. While Clampett&#x27;s cartoons were not as well known in the latter half of the 20th century because television syndicators only had the rights to the post-1948 Warner cartoons, his creations have increased in notoriety and acclaim in recent decades.

Martha Sigall recalled Clampett as &quot;an enthusiastic and fun type of guy&quot;. She describes him as consistently nice to her and very generous when it came to gifts or donations to a cause. She had left the Termite Terrace in 1943 and did not meet Clampett again until 1960. She did, however, hear from people whom Clampett helped break into the animation business and/or mentored.

Clampett is survived by his three children, who preserve his work. They are Robert Clampett Jr., who worked for his father as a puppeteer at Bob Clampett Productions; Ruth Clampett, an author of several books, including a book about an animated couple (she also founded Clampett Studio collections after her father&#x27;s death); and Cheri Clampett, a therapeutic yoga specialist.

<doc id="198362" wikidata="Q894612" url="?curid=198362" title="The Boswell Sisters">
<text>The Boswell Sisters were an American close harmony singing trio of the jazz and swing eras, consisting of three sisters: Martha Boswell (June 9, 1905 – July 2, 1958), Connie Boswell (later spelled &quot;Connee&quot;, December 3, 1907 – October 11, 1976), and Helvetia &quot;Vet&quot; Boswell (May 20, 1911 – November 12, 1988). Hailing from uptown New Orleans, the group blended intricate harmonies and song arrangements featuring effects such as scat, instrumental imitation, ‘Boswellese’ gibberish, tempo and meter changes, major/minor juxtaposition, key changes, and incorporation of sections from other songs. They attained national prominence in the United States in the 1930s during the twilight of the Jazz Age and the onset of the Great Depression.

After the trio split in 1936, Connie continued as a solo vocalist in radio, film, and later television for an additional quarter century. The trio&#x27;s &quot;unique singing style and ground-breaking arrangements fused &#x27;blackness&#x27; and &#x27;whiteness&#x27; in music,&quot; and their collaborations with &quot;the preeminent white swing musicians of their day—the Dorsey Brothers, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang, Artie Shaw, Victor Young, Bunny Berigan—had a profound effect on the development of the big band sound in the 1930s.&quot; When assessing their legacy, scholars claim the Boswell Sisters &quot;made &#x27;real&#x27; jazz commercially viable, destigmatizing the music and opening its appreciation to the wider American public.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

Martha and Connie were born in Kansas City, Missouri; Helvetia was born in Birmingham, Alabama. Their parents were manager and former vaudevillian from Indiana Alfred Clyde &quot;A. C.&quot; Boswell (1877—1944) and his music-loving wife Meldania George Foore (1871—1947), originally from Missouri. The sisters—along with their 14-year-old brother Clyde Jr. (Clydie)—landed in New Orleans, Louisiana as children in 1914. They were raised in a middle-class family home at 3937 Camp Street. The sisters&#x27; parents, their Aunt Mattie, and their Uncle Charlie originally sang as a barbershop quartet. This love of music and singing was passed on to the children.

Martha, Connie, and Vet studied classical piano, cello, and violin, respectively, under the tutelage of Tulane University professor Otto Finck. They performed their classical repertoire in local recitals, often as a trio, but the city&#x27;s jazz scene swiftly won them over, personally and professionally. &quot;We studied classical music...and were being prepared for the stage and a concert tour throughout the United States, but the saxophone got us,&quot; Martha said in a 1925 interview with the &quot;Shreveport Times&quot;.

In addition to providing the young Boswells with formal, classical musical education, Meldania Boswell took her children regularly to see the leading African–American performers of the day at the renowned Lyric Theatre. Although Black and White performers and audiences of the period normally were segregated, the Lyric Theatre offered a &quot;Midnight Frolics&quot; program for white-only audiences. There, young Connie heard Mamie Smith, whose &quot;Crazy Blues&quot; (1920), the first blues record performed by an African American, was a hit. Connie later imitated Smith&#x27;s style on the Boswells&#x27; first record &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Cry (Cryin&#x27; Blues),&quot; then settled into her own vocal style. Like many middle-class southern households, the Boswell family employed black house servants who, in this musical home environment, were welcome to sing while working, and the girls were known to join in with the singing. Helvetia in particular remembered that their housekeeper, named Aunt Rhea, sang traditional African-American lullabies to her at bedtime. In interviews, the sisters recalled driving around New Orleans listening for new and interesting sounds, which they often found when being outside African–American churches and barrooms of the French Quarter or when listening to street musicians at the French Market. Connie&#x27;s other primary vocal influence was the legendary Italian opera tenor Enrico Caruso, whom she saw perform at the Athenaeum in New Orleans: &quot;I used to sit and listen and be amazed by his breathing. Then I’d try and do what he was doing. I’d take a long breath and hit a lot of notes.&quot;

As their older brother Clydie began breaking away from classical music to study jazz, he introduced his sisters to the syncopated style and to many of the young jazz players in New Orleans. Leon Roppolo (clarinet, guitar), Monk Hazel (drums, cornet), Pinky Vidacovich (clarinet, saxophone), Nappy Lamare (guitar, banjo), Ray Bauduc (tuba, vocals), Dan LeBlanc (tuba), Leon Prima (trumpet), Louis Prima (trumpet, vocals), Wingy Manone (trumpet, vocals), Al Gallodoro (clarinet, saxophone), Chink Martin (bass, tuba, guitar), Santo Pecora (trombone), Raymond Burke (clarinet, saxophone), and Tony Parenti (clarinet, saxophone) were regular guests at the Boswell home. Norman Brownlee and his band were also regular participants in musical evenings at the Boswell home. Reportedly, father A.C. Boswell tried unsuccessfully to limit these visits to just one night per week—with little success. The sisters were particularly influenced by Brownlee&#x27;s cornetist Emmett Louis Hardy, another friend of Clydie, whose well-documented talent and skill helped shape the sisters&#x27; knowledge of jazz harmony, syncopation, and improvisation. Hardy and Clydie both died young and unrecorded, Hardy of tuberculosis at age 22 and Clydie of Spanish flu-related complications at the age of 18.

After becoming interested in jazz, Vet took up the banjo and guitar, and Connie the saxophone and trombone. Martha continued playing the piano but focused on the rhythms and idioms of ragtime and hot jazz.

== Career ==
=== New Orleans ===

The sisters came to be well known in New Orleans while in their early teens, making appearances in local theaters and on the emerging medium of radio. By the early 1920s, they were performing regularly at local vaudeville theaters, with an act that combined classical, semi-classical, and jazz styles—though, as their popularity increased, the classics faded into the background.

The sisters performed as they would for virtually their entire career: Martha and Connie seated at the piano, with Vet close behind. This arrangement served to disguise Connie&#x27;s inability to walk, or stand for any length of time, a condition whose source has never been fully confirmed. A childhood bout with polio and a coaster wagon accident are the two main hypotheses, and Connie backed up both of them in various media sources. One theory holds that Meldania crafted the accident story in order to spare her daughter the stigma attached to the disease.

In March 1925, they made their first recording for Victor Records with a mobile recording unit. The session consisted of five songs, three of which were composed by Martha. Victor rejected three of the recordings and accepted &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Cry (Crying Blues)&quot; and &quot;Nights When I Am Lonely&quot; for release (both by Martha). The recording equipment used for this session was the primitive acoustic horn-style of sound capture, which tended to make vocals sound thin and tinny (and so singers were often forced to over compensate by singing at full volume into the horn). At the time of this first recording session Martha was 19, Connie 17 and Vet only 13 years of age. The Boswells would not record again until 1930, instead performing on a succession of vaudeville circuits in the Midwest and later California.

=== West Coast ===
In December 1928, while completing their Midwest vaudeville tour through Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma, Connie Boswell was injured and briefly hospitalized, as reported on the front page of the &quot;Arkansas City Daily Traveler&quot; on Monday, December 10, 1928. The Boswell sisters arrived in San Francisco at the beginning of 1929. They were able to sign with a California vaudeville circuit and start performing again within the week, as advertised in the &quot;Napa Valley Register&quot; on January 5, 1929. Their next break came when an old New Orleans acquaintance invited the sisters to appear on his weekly radio program at KFWB.

:&quot;By 1929 the sisters were living in Los Angeles and had signed a contract with radio station KNX, owned and operated by the &quot;Los Angeles Evening Express&quot; newspaper and broadcast from the Paramount Pictures studios. The Boswells contributed to sponsored variety programs, such as &quot;The Navigator Hour&quot; and &quot;The Paramount Hour&quot;. In 1930 they signed with Warner Brothers Pictures’ station KFWB, which would also play a role in the early careers of Bing Crosby, Ronald Reagan, and, later, the Beach Boys&quot;

This initial exposure led to an opportunity for Martha to perform as a voice actor and singer on Tom Breneman&#x27;s KNX radio comedy show &quot;Tom and His Mule Hercules&quot;, playing Tom&#x27;s girlfriend &quot;Miss Somaphine&quot;. Breneman soon hired the Boswell trio to perform regularly on KNX (broadcast from the Paramount Pictures studios). &quot;Tom and His Mule Hercules&quot; later became known as &quot;Tom and Miss Somaphine&quot;, and finally &quot;Radio Periscope&quot; with the continued participation of Martha, and the Boswells as a trio. When later in the year Breneman became programming director for station KFVD he continued to program Boswell trio radio appearances.

Another New Orleans friend by the name of Bobby Burns Berman had opened a restaurant in Hollywood, and invited the Boswell trio to perform at &quot;B.B.B.&#x27;s Cellar&quot;. The restaurant performances got them noticed by Hollywood entertainment executives. The Boswells began to get &quot;side-miking&quot; work in Hollywood film musicals at this time, singing for other performers in &quot;They Learned About Women&quot; (MGM), &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Places&quot; (Fox), and &quot;Under Montana Skies&quot; (Tiffany Productions).

As the sisters gained regional notice through their radio appearances, the trio made as many as 50 broadcast transcription recordings for the Continental Broadcasting Corporation, and a selection of these were shipped out for broadcast in Hawaii.

In July 1930, the Boswells made their first disc recordings in almost five years, beginning with two songs recorded for Victor Records in Hollywood. Both featured the Jackie Taylor Orchestra as backing musicians. In October 1930, the Boswells then recorded a total of five songs for OKeh Records accompanied solely by Martha Boswell on piano: Four of the OKeh recordings were issued on two records, and internationally the tracks were paired with jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong and Frankie Trumbauer.

The Boswells received numerous mentions in various radio/stage/screen magazines of the period:

:&quot;It really isn&#x27;t fair to be both beautiful and talented, but nevertheless it goes right on happening as witness this page of fair harmonizers. The Boswell Sisters, with their soft Louisiana accent, began showing promise with Connie, who at seven, played the &#x27;cello in the New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra. After making Victor records, appearing in vaudeville and moving pictures, the girls have more or less settled down to radio broadcasting from the San Francisco studios to the National Broadcasting Company. Connie shines as a &quot;blues&quot; singer; Martha plays all the accompaniments and sings her part and Vet harmonizes, plays several instruments and doubles for the &#x27;plunk&#x27; of a banjo in an amazing manner.&quot;
:—&quot;What Price Television?&quot; from Radio Doings; The Red Book of Radio, December, 1930, p.18 

:&quot;GIRLS MADE GOOD
:The Boswell Sisters vocal trio starred for some time on KFWB, appeared on the &#x27;California Melodies&#x27; program this week, which is released nationally by the Columbia network. The hometowners in New Orleans made it a special Boswell night and stayed home to listen in on the girls who made good in Hollywood.&quot; —Fred Yeates, Radioland, August 2nd, 1930

However, the trio&#x27;s unique approach to arrangements, which often involved reworking melodies and lyrics, altering tempos and keys in mid-song, as well as their improvisational style, did not always garner universal acclamation.

In their inaugural year of radio broadcasting in California, &quot;station employers received letters of opprobrium from outraged listeners voicing disapproval of the sisters&#x27; new and unusual arranging and singing styles.&quot; One letter stated: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you choke those Boswell Sisters? How wonderful it would be if they sang just one song like it was written. Really when they get through murdering it, one can never recognize the original.&quot; Another outraged letter from an angry listener read: &quot;Please get those terrible Boswell Sisters off the station! You can&#x27;t follow the melody and the beat is going too rapidly. And to me they sound like savage chanters!&quot;

During this period, the Boswells developed their signature recording technique somewhat by accident. Normally the sisters would sing into a large carbon microphone from a distance of about three feet, but on one particular day there was a problem: Connie was sick with a head cold and couldn&#x27;t project her voice as usual. They decided to sing together more softly and in a lower register, grouped close around the single microphone.

=== East Coast ===
:&quot;...the Boswells left KGO— the flagship station of the NBC Pacific Coast network—in January 1931 to travel to New York where they had landed a 52-week network contract with NBC. They were to appear on several special broadcasts of the Pleasure Hour sponsored by not Chesterfield (that happened for the Boswells the next year and was their longest running commercial program, lasting 10 months) but by Camel cigarettes.&quot; —David W. McCain, &quot;The King Sisters: A Chapter From the History of Harmony&quot;

After moving to New York City in 1931, the Boswell Sisters soon attained national attention and began making national radio broadcasts. The trio had a program on CBS from 1931 to 1933. They soon signed a contract with Brunswick Records and made recordings from 1931 to 1935 under the aegis of producer Jack Kapp. These Brunswick recordings are widely regarded as milestone recordings of vocal jazz. For their Brunswick recordings, &quot;the Boswells took greater liberties, regularly changing style, tempi, modality, lyrics, time signatures and voicings (both instrumental and vocal) to create unexpected textures and effects.&quot;

The sisters&#x27; reworking of melodies and rhythms of popular songs, and the participation of top New York jazz musicians (including the Dorsey Brothers, Benny Goodman, Bunny Berigan, Fulton McGrath, Joe Venuti, Arthur Schutt, Eddie Lang, Joe Tarto, Mannie Klein, Chauncey Morehouse, Dick McDonough, and Carl Kress), made these recordings unlike any others. Some of the sessions with Dorsey Brothers&#x27; band musicians were notable in having the young Glenn Miller writing instrumental arrangements for his bandmates from Connie’s dictation. Melodies were rearranged and slowed down, major keys were changed to minor keys (sometimes in mid-song), and unexpected rhythmic changes were par for the course. The Boswells were among the few performers who were allowed to make changes to current popular tunes since, during this era, music publishers and record companies pressured performers not to alter current popular song arrangements. Connie also recorded a series of more conventional solo records for Brunswick during the same period.

In an interview with CBS Records and Sony Music producer and archivist Michael Brooks, Connie Boswell revealed the often chaotic nature of the New York jazz recording sessions in the early 1930s. But years later, both Connie and Vet spoke with pride about the trio&#x27;s first session with top-flight New York studio accompanists, after which the musicians stood up to applaud and cheer. &quot;That&#x27;s a real compliment...when those boys stand.&quot;

=== Popular success ===
The Boswell Sisters soon appeared in films during this time. They sang the lively &quot;Shout, Sister, Shout&quot; (1931), written by Clarence Williams, in the 1932 film &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot;, which featured Bing Crosby and Cab Calloway. The song—one of the sisters&#x27; signature tunes—was described in a November 2011 issue of the music magazine &quot;Mojo&quot; as &quot;by no means as archaic as its age.&quot; They sang their 1934 song &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; in the film &quot;Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round&quot;, bringing with them an early use of the phrase &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, referring in the song to &quot;the rolling rocking rhythm of the sea&quot;.

The Boswell Sisters chalked up 20 hits during the 1930s, including the number-one record &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; (1935). (Of special note is their involvement in a handful of 12&quot; medley/concert recordings made by Red Nichols, Victor Young and Don Redman and their 1934 recording of &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;, which was issued only in Australia.) They also completed two successful tours of Europe, appeared on the inaugural television broadcast of CBS, and performed on &quot;Hello, Europe&quot;, the first internationally broadcast radio program.

The Boswell Sisters were among radio&#x27;s earliest stars, making them one of the first hit acts of the mass-entertainment age. In 1934, the Sisters appeared 13 times on the radio show &quot;Bing Crosby Entertains&quot; on CBS. They were featured in fan magazines, and their likenesses were used in advertisements for beauty and household products. During the early 1930s the Boswell Sisters, Three X Sisters, and Pickens Sisters were the talk of early radio female harmonizing. The Andrews Sisters started out as imitators of the Boswell Sisters. Young Ella Fitzgerald loved the Boswell Sisters and in particular idolized Connie, after whose singing style she initially patterned her own.

In 1936, the group signed to American Decca, now headed by their producer Jack Kapp, but after just six single records they broke up. The last recording was made on February 12, 1936 (Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Putting All My Eggs In One Basket&quot;). Approximately one month earlier, Martha Boswell had married Major George L. Lloyd of Britain&#x27;s Royal Air Force. Connie served as her sister&#x27;s only attendant at the wedding and Harold J. Warner served as their best man. Lloyd was the managing director of the Aero Insurance Underwriters in New York. and a flying ace of the Great War Connie Boswell continued to have a successful solo career as a singer for Decca. She changed the spelling of her name from Connie to Connee in the 1940s, reputedly because it made it easier to sign autographs. When she tried to become involved with the overseas USO tours during World War II, she was not granted permission to travel overseas because of her disability, so she instead visited hospitalized soldiers and sailors in the U.S. and &quot;did considerable entertaining at Army and Navy posts throughout the country during World War II&quot;. Connie and fellow singer Eddie Cantor &quot;were among the original founders of the March of Dimes, and from 1960 on her appearances were limited to benefits for hospitals and other institutions active on behalf of the handicapped&quot;.

== Vocal techniques ==
=== Passing harmony ===
The Boswell Sisters approached harmony in a manner different from most vocal groups of the 1920s and 30s. Rather than assign each vocalist to a particular range, such as contralto, alto, soprano, etc., the sisters were comfortable moving unexpectedly across one another&#x27;s natural ranges. Martha Boswell described it as &quot;a desertion, at various times, of the tones in which we would normally sing&quot;, but with the end effect being a &quot;blending&quot; of tones. This idea is supported by a later Vet Boswell comment that &quot;whichever one the note seemed to fit the voice better, we left it that way. We never had a set tenor or alto.&quot;

Allowing one another the freedom to choose a different pitch range, in the moment, and basically switch places, became a hallmark of their harmony style. A primary example of the Boswell passing harmony/cross-voicing technique would be the trio&#x27;s singing on &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot; recorded in 1934.

=== &#x27;Boswellese&#x27; gibberish ===
The Boswell Sisters&#x27; recording of “Nights When I Am Lonely” for Victor in 1925 was the first recorded instance of what has come to be known as &quot;Boswellese,&quot; a gibberish language reportedly created by their father, A.C. Boswell, but taken to a virtuoso level by his daughters. The effect was achieved by inserting “ggled” (pronounced as &quot;guhl-d&quot;) after the vowel of a word, with the chosen rhythm determining where the accent should be placed. Probably the clearest example of this technique appears in the trio&#x27;s version of &quot;Everybody Loves My Baby&quot; from 1932. Essentially the Boswellese chorus substitutes for the expected instrumental break.

:&quot;Along with the blackness of their vocal quality, the sisters&#x27; musical style incorporated many elements that could be associated with blackness, blues, and hot jazz. “Boswellese” gibberish, although primarily an effective way of making a straight tune more rhythmically sophisticated, was also alienating and foreign to the listener, redolent of both scat and the &#x27;jive talk&#x27; being developed by the alternative black jazz community.&quot;

=== Authenticity and a natural tessitura ===
By the beginning of the 1930s, the Boswells plainly differed from their competitors by avoiding caricature or hyper-vocalization in their performances. Both Martha and Connie developed the lower parts of their natural ranges, and the trio sang mostly in their throats and chests rather than relying on the fashionable nasally intonations favored by most white female singers of the day. By sticking to their natural voices and leaving their genuine New Orleans accents intact, the Boswells were able to avoid the introduction of false mannerisms and artificial melodrama into their song renditions:

:&quot;...what set the Boswells’ sound apart from that tradition [minstrelsy] was the lack of travesty or hypervocalization, or the necessity for another contextual marker (blackface makeup, black-identified material) to confirm the racial categorization. Furthermore, the Boswells sang with voices that sounded naturally produced; the quality of tone, ornamentation, vibrato, and enunciation was not overly manufactured, and the accent was genuine.&quot;

For the American public, the Boswell Sisters&#x27; sound contrasted sharply with the popular white singers of the day:

:&quot;The radio audience in California could only compare what they heard from the Boswells with known models, and up against the most popular white female voices of the period, the Boswell Sisters were, quite literally, something else. Connie and Martha’s ultra-low tessitura and the sisters’ informal and natural diction contrast sharply with those of the established white sweethearts of stage and screen, such as Ruth Etting, Gertrude Lawrence, and the soon-to-be archetypal Hollywood soprano Jeanette MacDonald.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Later groups such as the Pfister Sisters, the Stolen Sweets, Boswellmania, the Puppini Sisters, YazooZazz, the Spanish group O Sister!, the Italian trio Sorelle Marinetti, and the Israeli band the Hazelnuts imitated the sisters&#x27; recordings. Canada&#x27;s Company B Jazz Band includes many Boswell Sisters arrangements in its repertoire and even created a set saluting the Boswells&#x27; appearance in &quot;Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round&quot; for the cover of their second album, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. The Ditty Bops have covered Boswell Sisters songs in concert. Caffeine Trio from Brazil also claims to have been influenced by them. There is also an Australian group, the Boswell Project, based in Adelaide, South Australia. A London harmony trio, The Haywood Sisters, have also recorded some Boswell Sisters hits and are greatly influenced by their style.

In 2001, &quot;The Boswell Sisters&quot;, a major musical based on their lives, was produced at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. The play starred Michelle Duffy, Elizabeth Ward Land, and Amy Pietz and was produced by the same team that produced &quot;Forever Plaid&quot;. The show was a hit with audiences and a critical success, but failed to be picked up for a much hoped-for Broadway run.

The Boswell Sisters were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. At a ceremony covered by the Pfister Sisters, the Boswells were inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2008.

In 2014, Vet&#x27;s daughter and granddaughter published &quot;The Boswell Legacy&quot;, the first comprehensive book on the life and times of the influential trio. The same year, the 52-track compilation double-CD &quot;Shout, Sister, Shout!&quot; was released by Retrospective Records. In his review of the album, Robert Christgau wrote of the Sisters: &quot;They were so prolific and original that except for Billie [Holiday] and their fan Ella they were not just the premier jazz singers of the decade, rewriting melodies at will, but pop stars with a dozen top 10 singles. The Boswells didn’t just imitate instruments when the fancy struck them, they sang as though they were instruments, outswinging both the ‘30s competition and such heirs as Lambert, Hendricks and Ross.&quot;

<text>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America is a book written by Barbara Ehrenreich. Written from her perspective as an undercover journalist, it sets out to investigate the impact of the 1996 welfare reform act on the working poor in the United States.

The events related in the book took place between spring 1998 and summer 2000. The book was first published in 2001 by Metropolitan Books. It was expanded from an article she wrote from a January 1999 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;. Ehrenreich later wrote a companion book, &quot;Bait and Switch&quot; (published September 2005), about her attempt to find a white-collar job.

In 2019, the book was ranked 13th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. In 2024, it was ranked 57th on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.

==Social and economic issues==
Ehrenreich investigates many of the difficulties low wage workers face, including the hidden costs involved in such necessities as shelter (the poor often have to spend much more on daily hotel costs than they would pay to rent an apartment if they could afford the security deposit and first-and-last month fees) and food (e.g., the poor have to buy food that is both more expensive and less healthy than they would if they had access to refrigeration and appliances needed to cook).

Foremost, Ehrenreich attacks the notion that low-wage jobs require only unskilled labor. A journalist with a Ph.D. in cell biology, she found that manual labor required highly demanding feats of stamina, focus, memory, quick thinking, and fast learning. Constant and repeated movement creates a risk of repetitive stress injury; pain must often be worked through to hold a job in a market with constant turnover; and the days are filled with degrading and uninteresting tasks (e.g. toilet-cleaning and mopping). She also details several individuals in management roles who served mainly to interfere with worker productivity, to force employees to undertake pointless tasks, and to make the entire low-wage work experience even more miserable. Additionally, she describes her managers changing her shift schedule from week to week without notifying her.

Ehrenreich describes personality tests, questionnaires designed to weed out incompatible potential employees, and urine drug tests, increasingly common in the low wage market, arguing that they deter potential applicants and violate liberties while having little tangible positive effect on work performance. She also comments that she believes they are a way for an employer to relay to an employee what is expected of them conduct-wise.

She argues that &#x27;help needed&#x27; signs do not necessarily indicate a job opening; more often their purpose is to sustain a pool of applicants in fields that have notorious rapid turnover of employees. She also posits that one low-wage job is often not enough to support one person (let alone a family); with inflating housing prices and stagnant wages, this practice increasingly becomes difficult to maintain. Many of the workers encountered in the book survive by living with relatives or other persons in the same position, or even in their vehicles.

Ehrenreich concludes with the argument that all low-wage workers, recipients of government or charitable services like welfare, food, and health care, are not simply living off the generosity of others. Instead, she suggests, we live off their generosity:

The author concludes that someday, low-wage workers will rise up and demand to be treated fairly, and when that day comes everyone will be better off.

== The Goal ==
Barbara Ehrenreich states in her book that her goal is to &quot;see whether or not I could match income to expenses, as the truly poor attempt to do every day.&quot;

==Adaptations==

Ehrenreich makes an appearance in the documentary &quot;The American Ruling Class&quot; in 2007. She portrays her life undercover working as a waitress and is accompanied by a musical rendition titled &quot;Nickeled and Dimed&quot;.

<text>Robert Porter McKimson Sr. (October 13, 1910 – September 29, 1977) was an American animator and illustrator, best known for his work on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons from Warner Bros. Cartoons and later DePatie–Freleng Enterprises. He wrote and directed many animated cartoon shorts starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Foghorn Leghorn, Hippety Hopper, Speedy Gonzales, and the Tasmanian Devil, among other characters. He also developed Bugs Bunny&#x27;s design in the 1943 short &quot;Tortoise Wins by a Hare&quot;.

== Career ==
After he was born in Denver, Colorado, on October 13, 1910, McKimson&#x27;s family variously lived in Wray, Colorado, Los Angeles, and Canadian, Texas, before settling in Los Angeles in 1926. From 1927 to 1928, McKimson and his brother Tom illustrated a prospective children&#x27;s book written by their mother titled &quot;Mouse Tales&quot;, the characters of which were notably similar to those of Walt Disney cartoons (e.g. Mickey Mouse). These drawings entered storage in the 1930s, resurfacing six decades later.

In mid-1929, Robert was offered a job at Walt Disney Studio as an assistant animator to Dick Lundy, while Tom apprenticed under Norm Ferguson. According to Tom, Disney animators attending Otis Art Institute with him recommended him, while Robert said they were hired after an aunt from Denver met Disney at a party. According to Robert, the studio included less than 30 people, comprising nine animators, each with one assistant. After three months, the brothers received a raise from $18 to $25. Despite little extant evidence, Lundy corroborated that the McKimsons worked for Disney. In 1930, they were offered a higher salary at an Altadena studio planned by Romer Grey, the oldest son of Western author Zane Grey. The Romer Grey Studio produced several cartoons, four featuring Binko the Bear Cub, developed by the McKimsons and bearing strong similarities to Mickey Mouse. Due to the Great Depression, Grey&#x27;s studio was unable to close a distribution deal. No shorts were released, with only a handful completed (and only one known to survive).

At the same time he began working for Grey, McKimson was hired by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, first doing ink-and-paint duties for the first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, then becoming an in-betweener before becoming an animator by 1931, when the Romer Grey Studio shut down. At that time he had an accident that gave him a concussion. As a result, he was able to visualize better, thus increasing his production and animation. He was the head animator and go-to guy in the late 1930s at the studio, which overwhelmed him. Eventually he worked exclusively with Bob Clampett. He was offered a directorial position by Leon Schlesinger in 1938, but declined, allowing the position to go to animator Chuck Jones. He accepted his own directorial position in late 1944, when Frank Tashlin left Warner Bros. to direct live-action films.
McKimson&#x27;s first Warner Bros. cartoon that he finished, &quot;The Return of Mr. Hook,&quot; was released in 1945 exclusively for the U.S. Navy. His first theatrical short, &quot;Daffy Doodles&quot;, was released in early April 1946. His third theatrical short entitled &quot;Acrobatty Bunny&quot; would be the first Bugs Bunny short McKimson directed. It was released in June 1946. His better-known efforts include &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot;, , &quot;Stupor Duck&quot;, &quot;The Windblown Hare&quot;, &quot;Walky Talky Hawky&quot;, and &quot;Big Top Bunny&quot;.

McKimson created characters like Foghorn Leghorn and the Tasmanian Devil, as well as directing every Hippety Hopper/Sylvester pairing. He also created Speedy Gonzales for the 1953 short &quot;Cat-Tails for Two&quot; and directed many others periodically (along with Friz Freleng and other directors) for the remainder of his theatrical career.

In June 1953, the Warner Bros. cartoon studio was shut down for a period of six months due to the 3-D fad at the time, which Jack Warner found to be too costly a process to use for animated cartoons. McKimson&#x27;s unit however was disbanded entirely two months before the shutdown. He would make an Oldsmobile commercial at Cascade Studios around this time. After the studio , Freleng and Jones quickly their respective units, but there was no indication if McKimson and his unit would be brought back. McKimson was able to convince Warner Bros. to reopening his unit, at the cost of working with less resources and lesser money. Apart from writer Tedd Pierce, background painter Richard H. Thomas and animator Keith Darling (who worked uncredited for McKimson prior to the 1953 closure), he was unable to hire back most of his animators, including Rod Scribner and his own brother Charles. At the start of this period, McKimson animated on four of his own shorts, &quot;The Hole Idea&quot; (in fact, he was the sole animator credited on &quot;The Hole Idea&quot;), &quot;Dime to Retire&quot;, &quot;Too Hop to Handle&quot; (along with uncredited work from Jones&#x27; animator Ben Washam), and &quot;Weasel Stop&quot; (where McKimson had no animation credit). Soon, McKimson assembled a new team of artists, including layout man/background painter Robert Gribbroek (formerly of Jones&#x27;s unit) plus animators Warren Batchelder, Ted Bonnicksen, George Grandpré and Tom Ray. Russ Dyson briefly worked with McKimson in 1956 until Dyson&#x27;s death that year.

McKimson&#x27;s office in Warner Bros.&#x27;s &quot;Termite Terrace&quot; studio was on the second floor.

== Later career ==
McKimson continued working at Warner&#x27;s Cartoon Studio as it began to lose staff (including such key personnel as Jones) in the early 1960s. According to an interview with his son, he generally did not like how things were going at the studio and missed full animation, as well as disliking the new characters in the new shorts. Over this time, he directed his share of shorts and worked on the feature &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; with Hawley Pratt, taking over the role of director from Bill Tytla due to his illness.

After the studio closed, he joined DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, by his old associate Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie, who had been a producer at the Warners studio. At DePatie–Freleng, McKimson briefly worked in Freleng&#x27;s unit directing several &quot;The Inspector&quot; shorts and working on some of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; contracted out to DePatie–Freleng by Warner Bros. In 1967, Warner opened its animation studio again, with all cartoons directed by Alex Lovy. After Lovy left, McKimson re-joined the studio in 1968. According to his son Robert McKimson, Jr., McKimson &quot;hated&quot; the cartoons he directed at Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, which suffered from restricted budgets, and he was forbidden from using Bugs Bunny in his cartoons. The studio was shut down again in 1969. His last Warner Bros. cartoon was &quot;Injun Trouble&quot; with Cool Cat. It was shortlisted for an Academy Award, but wasn&#x27;t nominated. &quot;Injun Trouble&quot; was also the last of the original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; or &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon to be produced before the Warner Bros. cartoon studio was closed. McKimson was the one person to be at the studio from the start of the Looney Tunes series through its finish in 1969, first as an animator and then as a director.

After a sabbatical, he went back to DePatie–Freleng in 1972 to direct &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot; shorts, among their other series.

== Death ==
On the morning of September 27, 1977, McKimson&#x27;s doctor declared him in good health for a 66-year-old (despite having a case of emphysema after years of smoking), and, according to Freleng, McKimson then referred to his family history of living past 90 and bragged, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be around after you guys are gone!&quot; On September 29, McKimson suffered a sudden heart attack and died, at age 66. At the time of his death, he had recently completed directing &quot;Misterjaw&quot; and had begun work on &quot;Baggy Pants and the Nitwits&quot;.

McKimson was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Personal life ==
McKimson&#x27;s wife, Viola, died in 1963. In addition to being an animator, McKimson was a skilled horseman and polo player, a dedicated bowler, and a Master Mason. He played polo from 1932 until after the outbreak of war in 1942. In addition to his brothers Tom and Charles, their two sisters, Anabel and Aylce McKimson, also worked as animators. Charles was frequently part of McKimson&#x27;s unit at Warner Bros.

<text>Carsten Ramelow (; born 20 March 1974) is a German former professional footballer who played as either a central defender or a defensive midfielder.

Known for his tough tackling and defensive positioning, he played professionally for Hertha BSC and Bayer Leverkusen, for 17 years. The recipient of nearly 50 caps with Germany, he represented the nation at one World Cup and one European Championship.

==Club career==
Born in Berlin, Ramelow grew as a player at local Hertha BSC, playing five second division matches in his first two years combined, and five seasons in total: his debut came on 25 April 1992 (aged 18), in a 0–5 home loss against Bayer Uerdingen. In 1992–93, he helped the reserve squad reach the domestic cup final, where they lost to Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

In January 1996, Ramelow moved to the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen, being a major part of the squads that never finished lower than fourth until the 2003–04 season (except for 2002–03, where they would rank only 15th, the last place before the relegation zone); a defensive-minded player, he scored twice in his top flight debut, a 2–0 home win against F.C. Hansa Rostock on 19 March, and contributed with 16 matches (15 complete) in Bayer&#x27;s 2001–02 UEFA Champions League runner-up run, including the final loss against Real Madrid.

On 3 November 2004, Ramelow was involved in an incident with A.S. Roma&#x27;s Francesco Totti, during a 1–1 draw at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome in the Champions League: the Italian Totti jumped on a sliding Ramelow, stomping on his shoulder and back, and receiving a yellow card. From 2006 to 2008, he appeared rarely due to injuries, and announced his retirement from football in March, at the age of 34.

==International career==
Ramelow first appeared for the Germany national team on 10 October 1998, in a 1–0 loss in Turkey for the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers. He went on to win 46 caps, and was summoned for the squads at that tournament (not leaving the bench in an eventual group stage exit) and the 2002 FIFA World Cup (appearing five times for the losing finalists, and receiving a red card in the 2–0 group stage win against Cameroon).

Ramelow was poised to be selected by manager Rudi Völler for Euro 2004 in Portugal, but announced his international retirement one week before the squad was picked.

==Career statistics==
==Honours==

<text>Barbara Ehrenreich (, ; ; August 26, 1941 – September 1, 2022) was an American author and political activist. During the 1980s and early 1990s, she was a prominent figure in the Democratic Socialists of America. She was a widely read and award-winning columnist and essayist and the author of 21 books. Ehrenreich was best known for her 2001 book &quot;Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America&quot;, a memoir of her three-month experiment surviving on a series of minimum-wage jobs. She was a recipient of a Lannan Literary Award and the Erasmus Prize.

== Early life ==
Ehrenreich was born to Isabelle ( Oxley) and Ben Howes Alexander in Butte, Montana, which she describes as then being &quot;a bustling, brawling, blue collar mining town&quot;. In an interview on C-SPAN, she characterized her parents as &quot;strong union people&quot; with two family rules: &quot;never cross a picket line and never vote Republican&quot;. In a talk she gave in 1999, Ehrenreich called herself a &quot;fourth-generation atheist&quot;. Later in life, she wrote that she rejected &quot;the God of monotheism&quot; because of the philosophical problem of a being that was all good and all powerful, when people were living with &quot;all the misery he allowed or instigated&quot;. She had mystical experiences throughout her life, which she identified as belonging to a type animism rather than theism.

&quot;As a little girl&quot;, she told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1993, &quot;I would go to school and have to decide if my parents were the evil people they were talking about, part of the Red Menace we read about in the &quot;Weekly Reader&quot;, just because my mother was a liberal Democrat who would always talk about racial injustice.&quot; Her mother was a deeply unhappy homemaker. Her father was a copper miner who went to the Montana School of Mines (renamed Montana Technological University in 2018) and then to Carnegie Mellon University. A high-functioning alcoholic, he strongly valued intelligence.

After her father graduated from the Montana School of Mines, the family moved to Pittsburgh, New York, and Massachusetts, before settling down in Los Angeles. He eventually became a senior executive at the Gillette Corporation. Her parents later divorced.

Ehrenreich studied physics at Reed College, switched to chemistry, graduating in 1963. Her senior thesis was &quot;Electrochemical oscillations of the silicon anode&quot;. In 1968, she enrolled in a theoretical physics Ph.D, but changed early on to cellular immunology and received her Ph.D at Rockefeller University.

In 1970, Ehrenreich gave birth to her daughter Rosa in a public clinic in New York. &quot;I was the only white patient at the clinic, and I found out this was the health care women got,&quot; she told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper in 1987, &quot;They induced my labor because it was late in the evening and the doctor wanted to go home. I was enraged. The experience made me a feminist.&quot;

== Career ==
After completing her doctorate, Ehrenreich did not pursue a career in science. Instead, she worked first as an analyst with the Bureau of the Budget in New York City and with the Health Policy Advisory Center, and later as an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Old Westbury.

In 1972, Ehrenreich began co-teaching a course on women and health with feminist journalist and academic Deirdre English. Through the rest of the seventies, Ehrenreich worked mostly in health-related research, advocacy and activism, including co-writing, with English, several feminist books and pamphlets on the history and politics of women&#x27;s health. During this period she began speaking frequently at conferences staged by women&#x27;s health centers and women&#x27;s groups, by universities, and by the United States government. She also spoke regularly about socialist feminism and about feminism in general.

Throughout her career, Ehrenreich worked as a freelance writer. She is arguably best known for her non-fiction reportage, book reviews and social commentary. Her reviews have appeared in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Review supplement, &quot;Vogue&quot;, Salon.com, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Mirabella&quot; and &quot;American Film&quot;. Her essays, op-eds and feature articles have appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;In These Times&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, &quot;Working Woman&quot;, and &quot;Z Magazine&quot;.

Ehrenreich served as founder, advisor or board member to a number of organizations including the National Women&#x27;s Health Network, the National Abortion Rights Action League, the National Mental Health Consumers&#x27; Self-Help Clearinghouse, the Nationwide Women&#x27;s Program of the American Friends Service Committee, the Brooklyn-based Association for Union Democracy, the Boehm Foundation, the Women&#x27;s Committee of 100, the National Writers Union, the Progressive Media Project, FAIR&#x27;s advisory committee on women in the media, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, and the Campaign for America&#x27;s Future.

Between 1979 and 1981, she served as an adjunct associate professor at New York University and as a visiting professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia and at Sangamon State University (Now University of Illinois, Springfield.) She lectured at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was a writer-in-residence at the Ohio State University, Wayne Morse chair at the University of Oregon, and a teaching fellow at the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. She was a fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Institute for Policy Studies, and the New York-based Society of American Historians.

In 2000, Ehrenreich endorsed the presidential campaign of Ralph Nader; in 2004, she urged voters to support John Kerry in the swing states.

In February 2008, she expressed support for then-Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign.

In 2001, Ehrenreich published her seminal work, &quot;Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America&quot;. Seeking to explore whether people can subsist on minimum wage in the United States, she worked &quot;undercover&quot; in a series of minimum-wage jobs, such as waitress, housekeeper, and Wal-Mart associate, and reported on her efforts to pay living expenses with the low wages paid by those jobs (an average of $7 per hour). She concluded that it was impossible to pay for food and rent without working at least two such jobs. &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot; became a bestseller and admirers regard the book as &quot;a classic of social justice literature.&quot;
Ehrenreich founded the Economic Hardship Reporting Project with one main purpose: support immersive reporting on the working poor, in the manner of Ehrenreich&#x27;s own &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot;.

Filling in for a vacationing Thomas Friedman as a columnist with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2004, Ehrenreich wrote about how, in the fight for women&#x27;s reproductive rights, &quot;it&#x27;s the women who shrink from acknowledging their own abortions who really irk me&quot; and said that she herself &quot;had two abortions during my all-too-fertile years&quot;.

In her 1990 book of essays, &quot;The Worst Years of Our Lives&quot;, she wrote that &quot;the one regret I have about my own abortions is that they cost money that might otherwise have been spent on something more pleasurable, like taking the kids to movies and theme parks.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called her &quot;a veteran muckraker&quot;.

In 2006, she founded United Professionals, an organization described as &quot;a nonprofit, non-partisan membership organization for white-collar workers, regardless of profession or employment status. We reach out to all unemployed, underemployed, and anxiously employed workers—people who bought the American dream that education and credentials could lead to a secure middle class life, but now find their lives disrupted by forces beyond their control.&quot;

In 2009, she wrote &quot;Bright-sided: How Positive Thinking Is Undermining America&quot;, which investigated the rise of the positive thinking industry in the United States. She included her own experience after being told that she had breast cancer as a starting point in the book. In this book, she brought to light various methods of what Nobel physicist Murray Gell-Mann called &quot;quantum flapdoodle&quot;.

Beginning in 2013, Ehrenreich was an honorary co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America. She also served on the NORML board of directors, the Institute for Policy Studies board of trustees and the editorial board of &quot;The Nation&quot;. She has served on the editorial boards of &quot;Social Policy&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;Seven Days&quot;, &quot;Lear&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New Press&quot;, and Culturefront, and as a contributing editor to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 1980, Ehrenreich shared the National Magazine Award for excellence in reporting with colleagues at &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine for the cover story &quot;The Corporate Crime of the Century&quot;, about &quot;what happens after the U.S. government forces a dangerous drug, pesticide or other product off the domestic market, then the manufacturer sells that same product, frequently with the direct support of the State Department, throughout the rest of the world.&quot;

In 1998 the American Humanist Association named her &quot;Humanist of the Year&quot;.

In 2000, she received the Sidney Hillman Award for journalism for the &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; article &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot;, which was later published as a chapter in her book of the same title.

In 2002, she won a National Magazine Award for her essay &quot;Welcome to Cancerland: A mammogram leads to a cult of pink kitsch&quot;, which describes Ehrenreich&#x27;s own experience of being diagnosed with breast cancer, and describes what she calls the &quot;breast cancer cult,&quot; which &quot;serves as an accomplice in global poisoning – normalizing cancer, prettying it up, even presenting it, perversely, as a positive and enviable experience.&quot;

In 2004, she received the Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship, awarded jointly by the Puffin Foundation of New Jersey and The Nation Institute to an American who challenges the status quo &quot;through distinctive, courageous, imaginative, socially responsible work of significance&quot;.

In 2007, she received the &quot;Freedom from Want&quot; Medal, awarded by the Roosevelt Institute in celebration of &quot;those whose life&#x27;s work embodies FDR&#x27;s Four Freedoms&quot;.

Ehrenreich received a Ford Foundation award for humanistic perspectives on contemporary society (1982), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1987–88) and a grant for research and writing from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (1995). She received honorary degrees from Reed College, the State University of New York at Old Westbury, the College of Wooster in Ohio, John Jay College, UMass Lowell and La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.

In November 2018, Ehrenreich received the Erasmus Prize by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for her work in investigative journalism.

== Personal life and family ==
Ehrenreich had one brother, Ben Alexander Jr., and one sister, Diane Alexander. When she was 35, according to the book &quot;Always Too Soon: Voices of Support for Those Who Have Lost Both Parents&quot;, her mother died &quot;from a likely suicide&quot;. Her father died years later from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Ehrenreich was married and divorced twice. She met her first husband, John Ehrenreich, during an anti-war activism campaign in New York City, and they married in 1966. He is a clinical psychologist, and they co-wrote several books about health policy and labor issues before divorcing in 1977. In 1983, she married Gary Stevenson, a union organizer for the Teamsters. She divorced Stevenson in 1993.

Ehrenreich had two children with her first husband. Her daughter Rosa, born in 1970, was named after a great-grandmother and Rosa Luxemburg. She is a Virginia-based law professor, national security and foreign policy expert and writer. Ehrenreich&#x27;s son Ben, born in 1972, is a novelist and a journalist in Los Angeles.

Ehrenreich was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after the release of her book &quot;Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America&quot;. This led to the award-winning article &quot;Welcome to Cancerland,&quot; published in the November 2001 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The piece inspired the 2011 documentary &quot;Pink Ribbons, Inc.&quot;

Ehrenreich lived in Alexandria, Virginia, where she died at a hospice facility on September 1, 2022, from a stroke, six days after her 81st birthday. Her &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary called her an &quot;Explorer of Prosperity&#x27;s Dark Side&quot; for her commentary of inequality in the United States.

<text>Charlestown is the capital of the island of Nevis in the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the Leeward Islands of the West Indies. Charlestown is situated on the leeward side of the island of Nevis near the southern end of Pinney&#x27;s Beach.

Charlestown was originally called Bath Bay in reference to Bath Stream, a stream noted for its curative waters.
It became the chief town after Jamestown, Nevis&#x27;s first settlement, was inundated by a tidal wave in 1680. In the late 18th century, Charlestown was both a naval base and a resort known for mineral waters. The town was almost destroyed by fire in 1873. 

The main industry in Charlestown is sugar milling. Notable buildings in Charlestown include Hamilton House, where Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father of the United States and framer of the U.S. Constitution, was born, and the nearby ruins of Montpelier Estate, where the British naval hero Horatio Nelson was married.

Historically, in colonial times, the town of Charlestown was protected by Fort Charles to the south and Fort Black Rocks to the north. Many of the oldest two-story stone buildings were severely damaged over time by earthquakes, which tended to cause the upper story to collapse into the lower story. This unfortunate design flaw led to the common practice of building a wooden upper floor above a stone ground floor.

Charlestown was the birthplace and childhood home of Alexander Hamilton. The restored stone building which was his place of birth now houses the Museum of Nevis History on the ground floor, and the Nevis Island Administration Assembly Room on the upper floor. There are two other museums in Charlestown: the &quot;Nelson Museum&quot;, and the &quot;Nevis Sport Museum&quot;, as well as the Philatelic Bureau.

There are many other important buildings in the town, some historical and some recent, such as the Post Office, the old Treasury Building which is now the Nevis Tourism Authority, the Court House and Public Library, the new Police Station and the Alexandra Hospital. At the northern end of town is the Bath Hotel and Spring House, which was a famous tourist hotel and spa during the 18th century. The main building of the Bath Hotel was for a while occupied by government offices.

Charlestown has a population of 1,500. It is the main administrative and commercial center for the island of Nevis and is also the most concentrated residential area on the island. It is the hub for much of the transportation in Nevis. There is a modern port area with a dock where the ferries from St. Kitts load and unload passengers. However, Charlestown lacks a commercial airport.

Memorial Square commemorates all the Nevisian soldiers who died during World Wars I and II. Nearby is the &quot;Cotton Ginnery Mall&quot; which supplies some of Nevis&#x27; residents&#x27; recreational shopping needs.

The education system on Nevis is similar to the British system. There are five pre-schools and seven primary schools (grades K–6). Primary schools are government-provided. In addition, there are three private primary schools. After primary school, children attend one of three secondary schools. Please also see the article: List of schools in Saint Kitts and Nevis.

<doc id="198395" wikidata="Q378668" url="?curid=198395" title="Dr. Feelgood (album)">
<text>Dr. Feelgood (stylized as ) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, released on August 28, 1989. &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, making it the band&#x27;s only album to claim this position. It was the first album Mötley Crüe recorded after their quest for sobriety and rehabilitation in 1989. In addition to being Mötley Crüe&#x27;s best selling album, it is highly regarded by music critics and fans as the band&#x27;s best studio album. This was also the band&#x27;s last album to be recorded with lead singer Vince Neil until the 1997 album &quot;Generation Swine&quot;.

==Recording==
Producer Bob Rock found working with Mötley Crüe difficult, describing them as &quot;four L.A. bad asses who used to drink a bottle of wine and want to kill each other.&quot; To minimize conflict and allow production to proceed smoothly, Rock had each member record their parts separately.

The title track, inspired by a drug dealer, is the band&#x27;s highest-charting single to date, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition, it is the band&#x27;s only single to sell over 500,000 copies and receive Gold certification by the RIAA.

&quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; was written by bassist Nikki Sixx after his experience being clinically dead for two minutes from a heroin overdose before paramedics revived him with two shots of adrenaline.

&quot;Without You&quot; was co-written by drummer Tommy Lee about his relationship with his then-wife Heather Locklear.

The lyrics of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)&quot; feature a reference to &quot;Too Young to Fall in Love&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;.

The intro track &quot;T.n.T. (Terror &#x27;n Tinseltown)&quot; features a sample of a woman saying &quot;Dr Davis, telephone please&quot;. This was the same sample used by the band Queensrÿche for their song &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot; which was off of their album &quot;&quot; released one year prior to &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;.

The end of &quot;Slice of Your Pie&quot; is based on &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;, from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album.

Steven Tyler of Aerosmith sings backing vocals on &quot;Sticky Sweet&quot;. &quot;Nikki and Tommy and I hung out a lot,&quot; said Tyler, who was in Vancouver around the same time, recording &quot;Pump&quot;. &quot;Of course, we&#x27;re all akin by our old drinking and drugging days.&quot; Guitarist Mick Mars reportedly set his amps so loud that his playing leaked into Tyler&#x27;s vocal recording.

In addition to Tyler, Bryan Adams, Skid Row, Robin Zander and Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, and Jack Blades of Night Ranger contributed backing vocals on the album.

==Release==
&quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; has sold more than six million copies in the U.S., and went Gold in the U.K. In various interviews, members of Mötley Crüe stated that it was their most solid album from a musical standpoint, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety.

==Critical reception==

Reviews for &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; have been highly positive. Critics remarked the renewed energy and entertaining values that permeate the album, bringing the listeners &quot;in a world of everlasting party&quot;, where they &quot;savored the joys of trashy, unapologetically decadent fun&quot;. Bob Rock&#x27;s meticulous production was universally praised, in particular for affording &quot;the band the ability to write stronger melodic hooks without losing the hard rock sound they so coveted&quot; and for the power of the guitar riffs.

Canadian journalist Martin Popoff wrote that &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; is an album &quot;made by a dumb band trying really hard&quot; while a BBC Music reviewer declared it &quot;a glitzy flashy experience... ultimately shallow and narcissistic&quot;. Other critics stated that Mötley Crüe are not &quot;out to win humanitarian awards or impress us with lyrical muscle&quot;, but to rock &quot;...hard&quot;! &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, wrote Mick Wall in a review of 2009&#x27;s reissue, &quot;was the first time Mötley Crüe actually became well-known for music. Until then, their unthinking mash-up of glam and metal had made them a hoot onstage but a disappointment on record... Though pushed close by last year&#x27;s shock return with the weighty &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;, [the album is] the best Mötley Crüe have ever released.&quot;

&quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; and &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; were nominated for Grammy awards for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1990 and 1991, but lost both years to Living Colour. Mötley Crüe won the best Hard rock/Heavy metal album of the year at the American Music Awards in January 1991 for &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;.

==Legacy==
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich recruited Bob Rock to produce their self-titled 1991 album after being impressed with Rock&#x27;s production work on &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;. Rock would later produce Metallica&#x27;s subsequent albums, until &quot;St. Anger&quot;, where he also played that album&#x27;s bass parts.

Nike SB created a shoe based on the album cover.

As of October 14, 2008, the album, minus the opening track &quot;T.N.T. (Terror &#x27;N Tinseltown)&quot; because of length and playability, has become downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; video game series. The tracks &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; and &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; were also released as downloadable content for the video game &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot; in 2015.
&quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; and &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; are available in the soundtrack of 2009 video game, &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

To mark the twentieth anniversary of the album, Mötley Crüe performed the album in its entirety at Crüe Fest 2.

<text>Frank Tashlin (born Francis Fredrick von Taschlein, February 19, 1913 – May 5, 1972), also known as Tish Tash and Frank Tash, was an American animator and filmmaker. He was best known for his work on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of animated shorts for Warner Bros., as well as his work as a director of live-action comedy films.

==Animator and brief career as cartoonist==
Born in Weehawken, New Jersey, Tashlin drifted from job to job after dropping out of high school in New Jersey at age 13. In 1930, he began working for John Foster as a cartoonist on the &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; cartoon series, then worked briefly for Amadee J. Van Beuren, but he was just as much a drifter in his animation career as he had been as a teenager.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seife/2012/Tashlin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tashlin joined Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s cartoon studio at Warner Bros. as an animator in 1933, where he was known as a fast animator. He used his free time to start his own comic strip in 1934 called &quot;Van Boring&quot;, inspired by former boss Van Beuren, which ran for three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;strippersguide/van-boring&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He signed his comic strip &quot;Tish Tash&quot;, and used the same name for his cartoon credits (at the time it was considered extremely unprofessional to use anything except one&#x27;s birth name among animators, but Tashlin was able to get away with this due to the anti-German sentiment of that era).&lt;ref name=&quot;bampfa/nonsense-tashlin&quot;&gt; PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Tashlin was fired from the studio when he refused to give Schlesinger a cut of his comic strip revenues. He joined the Ub Iwerks studio in 1934. He moved to Hal Roach&#x27;s studio in 1935 as a writer.

He returned to Schlesinger in 1936 as an animation director, where his diverse interest and knowledge of the industry brought a new understanding of camerawork to the Warners directors. &quot;He used all different kinds of camera angles, montages, and pan shots, vertical and horizontal.&quot; He directed 16 or 17 shorts from 1936 to 1938. He was making $150 a week. At one point he had an argument with studio manager Henry Binder and resigned. In 1938, he worked for Disney in the story department, where he made 50 dollars a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;sensesofcinema/tashlin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, he served as production manager at Columbia Pictures&#x27; Screen Gems animation studio in 1941. He effectively ran the studio and hired many former Disney staffers who had left as a result of the Disney animators&#x27; strike. He launched The Fox and the Crow series, one of the better products of the studio. He was fired over an argument with the executives of Columbia.

Tashlin rejoined the Warner directors of &quot;Termite Terrace&quot; in 1942. One of his directorial efforts was &quot;Porky Pig&#x27;s Feat&quot; (1943), the final black-and-white appearance of Porky Pig. He stayed with the studio during World War II and worked on numerous wartime shorts, including the &quot;Private Snafu&quot; educational films. Shortly after he left Warner Bros. in late 1944, he directed some stop-motion puppet films for John Sutherland in 1946. Robert McKimson took over his unit after his departure from the studio.

His only Bugs Bunny shorts were &quot;The Unruly Hare&quot; and &quot;Hare Remover&quot;. The latter was also his last credit at Warner Bros.

Martha Sigall described him as &quot;Here today, gone tomorrow. Now you see him, now you don&#x27;t. That was Frank Tashlin, who would be working at Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s one day, and, suddenly, gone the next day.&quot;

==Film director and writer==
Tashlin moved on from animation in 1946 to become a gag writer for the Marx Brothers, Lucille Ball, and others, and as a screenwriter for stars such as Bob Hope and Red Skelton. His live-action films still echo elements of his animation background; Tashlin peppered them with unlikely sight gags, breakneck pacing, and unexpected plot twists.

Tashlin began his career directing feature films when he was asked to finish directing the 1951 film &quot;The Lemon Drop Kid&quot; starring Bob Hope.

Beginning with the 1956 film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, with its satirical look at early rock and roll,&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmdb/Frank-Tashlin/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tashlin had a streak of commercial successes with the Martin and Lewis film &quot;Hollywood or Bust&quot; in 1956, &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; in 1957, which, like 1956&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, starred actress and &quot;Playboy&quot; model Jayne Mansfield, and six of Jerry Lewis&#x27; early solo films (&quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby&quot;, &quot;The Geisha Boy&quot;, &quot;Cinderfella&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Money&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot;, and &quot;The Disorderly Orderly&quot;).

Moreover, in the 1950s Tashlin came to the approving attention of French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, in reviews that the director dismissed as &quot;all this philosophical double-talk.&quot; Also, the broad, colorful satire of Madison Avenue advertising in &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; earned the film a place on the National Film Registry in 2000. In 2014, his stop-motion animation short &quot;The Way of Peace&quot; was also added to the Registry.

In the 1960s, Tashlin&#x27;s films lost some of their spark, and his career ended in the latter part of that decade, along with those of most of the stars with whom he had worked. His final film was &quot;The Private Navy of Sgt. O&#x27;Farrell&quot; starring Bob Hope and Phyllis Diller in 1968.

==Author==
Tashlin wrote and illustrated three books, &quot;The Bear That Wasn&#x27;t&quot; (1946), &quot;The Possum That Didn&#x27;t&quot; (1950), and &quot;The World That Isn&#x27;t&quot; (1951). These are often referred to as &quot;children&#x27;s books&quot; although all contained satirical elements; &quot;The Bear That Wasn&#x27;t&quot; was adapted as an animated cartoon by Tashlin&#x27;s former Warner Bros. colleague, Chuck Jones, in 1967. Another children&#x27;s story which Tashlin wrote in 1949 was recorded by Spike Jones: &quot;How the Circus Learned to Smile&quot;. Tashlin also wrote and self-published an instructional booklet entitled &quot;How to Create Cartoons&quot; (about cartoon drawing, not animation) in 1952.

==Death==
Tashlin died on May 5, 1972&lt;ref name=&quot;nyrb/frank-tashlin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Frank-Tashlin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1972/05/28/tashlin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after being stricken with a coronary thrombosis three days before at his Beverly Hills home. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.
