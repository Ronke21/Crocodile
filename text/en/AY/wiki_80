<text>Indigenous peoples in Canada (also known as Aboriginals) are the Indigenous peoples within the boundaries of Canada. They comprise the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, representing roughly 5.0% of the total Canadian population. There are over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music.

Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Indigenous cultures in Canada prior to European colonization included permanent settlements, agriculture, civic and ceremonial architecture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Métis nations of mixed ancestry originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married Europeans, primarily the French colonizers. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting Europeans during the North American fur trade.

Various Aboriginal laws, treaties, and legislation have been enacted between European immigrants and Indigenous groups across Canada. The impact of settler colonialism in Canada can be seen in its culture, history, politics, laws, and legislatures. This led to the systematic abolishment of Indigenous languages, traditions, religion and the degradation of Indigenous communities that has been described as a genocide of Indigenous peoples. 

The modern Indigenous right to self government provides for Indigenous self-government in Canada and the management of their historical, cultural, political, health care and economic control aspects within Indigenous communities. National Indigenous Peoples Day recognizes the vast cultures and contributions of Indigenous peoples to the history of Canada. First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples of all backgrounds have become prominent figures and have served as role models in the Indigenous community and help to shape the Canadian cultural identity.

==Terminology==
In Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, &quot;Aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot; includes Indian, Inuit, and Métis peoples. &quot;Aboriginal&quot; as a collective noun is a specific term of art used as a legal term encompassing all Indigenous peoples living in Canada. Although &quot;Indian&quot; is a term still commonly used in legal documents for First Nations, the descriptors &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; have fallen into disuse in Canada, and most consider them to be pejorative. &quot;Aboriginal peoples&quot; has begun to be considered outdated and is slowly being replaced by the term &quot;Indigenous peoples&quot;. There is also an effort to recognize each Indigenous group as a distinct nation, much as there are distinct European, African, and Asian cultures in their respective places.

&quot;First Nations&quot; (most often used in the plural) has come into general use since the 1970s replacing &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;Indian bands&quot; in everyday vocabulary. However, on Indian reserves, &quot;First Nations&quot; is being supplanted by members of various nations referring to themselves by their group or ethnic identity. In conversation, this would be &quot;I am Haida&quot;, or &quot;we are Kwantlens&quot;, in recognition of their First Nations ethnicities. Also coming into general use since the 1970s, First Peoples refers to all Indigenous groups, i.e. First Nations, Inuit, and Métis.

Notwithstanding Canada&#x27;s location within the Americas, the term &quot;Native American&quot; is hardly ever used in Canada, in order to avoid any confusion due to the ambiguous meaning of the word &quot;American&quot;. Therefore, the term is typically used only in reference to the Indigenous peoples within the boundaries of the present-day United States. &quot;Native Canadians&quot; was often used in Canada to differentiate this American term until the 1980s.

In contrast to the more-specific &quot;Aboriginal&quot;, one of the issues with the term is its general applicability: in certain contexts, it could be used in reference to non-Indigenous peoples in regards to an individual place of origin / birth. For instance, people who were born or grew up in Calgary may call themselves &quot;Calgary natives&quot;, as in they are &quot;native&quot; to that city. With this in mind, even the term &quot;native American&quot;, as another example, may very well indicate someone who is &quot;native to America&quot; rather than a person who is ethnically Indigenous to the boundaries of the present-day United States. In this sense, &quot;native&quot; may encompass a broad range of populations and is therefore not recommended, although it is not generally considered offensive.

The &quot;Indian Act&quot; (Revised Statutes of Canada (R.S.C.), 1985, c. I-5) sets the legal term &quot;Indian&quot;, designating that &quot;a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian.&quot; Section 5 of the act states that a registry shall be maintained &quot;in which shall be recorded the name of every person who is entitled to be registered as an Indian under this Act.&quot; No other term is legally recognized for the purpose of registration and the term &quot;Indian&quot; specifically excludes reference to Inuit as per section 4 of the act.

&quot;Indian&quot; remains in place as the legal term used in the Canadian Constitution; however, its usage outside such situations can be considered offensive.

The term &quot;Eskimo&quot; has pejorative connotations in Canada and Greenland. Indigenous peoples in those areas have replaced the term &quot;Eskimo&quot; with &quot;Inuit&quot;, though the Yupik of Alaska and Siberia do not consider themselves Inuit, and ethnographers agree they are a distinct people. They prefer the terminology Yupik, Yupiit, or Eskimo. The Yupik languages are linguistically distinct from the Inuit languages, but are related to each other. Linguistic groups of Arctic people have no universal replacement term for &quot;Eskimo&quot;, inclusive of all Inuit and Yupik across the geographical area inhabited by them.

Besides these ethnic descriptors, Aboriginal peoples are often divided into legal categories based on their relationship with the Crown (i.e. the state). Section 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for &quot;Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians.&quot; The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the Numbered Treaties). The &quot;Indian Act&quot;, passed by the federal Parliament in 1876, has long governed its interactions with all treaty and non-treaty peoples.

Members of First Nations bands who are subject to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; are compiled on a list called the Indian Register, and such people are designated as status Indians. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and Métis peoples are not subject to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. However, two court cases have clarified that Inuit, Métis, and non-status First Nations people are all covered by the term &quot;Indians&quot; in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. The first was &quot;Reference Re Eskimos&quot; (1939), covering the Inuit; the second was &quot;Daniels v. Canada&quot; (2013), which concerns Métis and non-status First Nations.

==History==
===Paleo-Indian period===


According to North American archaeological and genetic evidence, migration to North and South America made them the last continents in the world with human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska). Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.

Indigenous genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia. The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.

The first inhabitants of North America arrived in Canada at least 14,000 years ago. It is believed the inhabitants entered the Americas pursuing Pleistocene mammals such as the giant beaver, steppe wisent (bison), muskox, mastodons, woolly mammoths and ancient reindeer (early caribou). One route hypothesized is that people walked south by way of an ice-free corridor on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, and then fanned out across North America before continuing on to South America. The other conjectured route is that they migrated, either on foot or using primitive boats, down the Pacific coast to the tip of South America, and then crossed the Rockies and Andes. Evidence of the latter has been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of metres following the last ice age.

The Old Crow Flats and basin was one of the areas in Canada untouched by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and refuge for ice age plants and animals. The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000 years ago. Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels. Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone was radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago.
Clovis sites dated at 13,500 years ago were discovered in western North America during the 1930s. Clovis peoples were regarded as the first widespread Paleo-Indian inhabitants of the New World and ancestors to all Indigenous peoples in the Americas. Archaeological discoveries in the years 1979–2009 brought forward other distinctive knapping cultures who occupied the Americas from the lower Great Plains to the shores of Chile.

Localized regional cultures developed from the time of the Younger Dryas cold climate period from 12,900 to 11,500 years ago. The Folsom tradition is characterized by the use of Folsom points as projectile tips at archaeological sites. These tools assisted activities at kill sites that marked the slaughter and butchering of bison.

The land bridge existed until 13,000–11,000 years ago, long after the oldest proven human settlements in the New World began. Lower sea levels in the Queen Charlotte sound and Hecate Strait produced great grass lands called &quot;archipelago of Haida Gwaii&quot;.
Hunter-gatherers of the area left distinctive lithic technology tools and the remains of large butchered mammals, occupying the area from 13,000–9,000 years ago. In July 1992, the Government of Canada officially designated X̱á:ytem (near Mission, British Columbia) as a national historic site, one of the first Indigenous spiritual sites in Canada to be formally recognized in this manner.

The Plano cultures was a group of hunter-gatherer communities that occupied the Great Plains area of North America between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indians moved into new territory as it emerged from under the glaciers. Big game flourished in this new environment. The Plano culture is characterized by a range of projectile point tools collectively called Plano points, which were used to hunt bison. Their diets also included pronghorn, elk, deer, raccoon and coyote. At the beginning of the Archaic period, they began to adopt a sedentary approach to subsistence. Sites in and around Belmont, Nova Scotia, have evidence of Plano-Indians, indicating small seasonal hunting camps, perhaps re-visited over generations from around 11,000–10,000 years ago. Seasonal large and smaller game fish and fowl were food and raw material sources. Adaptation to the harsh environment included tailored clothing and skin-covered tents on wooden frames.

===Archaic period===
The North American climate stabilized by 8000 BCE (10,000 years ago); climatic conditions were very similar to today&#x27;s. This led to widespread migration, cultivation and later a dramatic rise in population all over the Americas. Over the course of thousands of years, Indigenous peoples of the Americas domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.

The vastness and variety of Canada&#x27;s climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations have defined ancient peoples implicitly into cultural or linguistic divisions. Canada is surrounded north, east, and west with coastline and since the last ice age, Canada has consisted of distinct forest regions. Language contributes to the identity of a people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices. Indigenous religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.

The placement of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated social differentiation based upon status. There is a continuous record of occupation of S&#x27;ólh Téméxw by Indigenous people dating from the early Holocene period, 10,000–9,000 years ago. Archaeological sites at Stave Lake, Coquitlam Lake, Fort Langley and region uncovered early period artifacts. These early inhabitants were highly mobile hunter-gatherers, consisting of about 20 to 50 members of an extended family. The Na-Dene people occupied much of the land area of northwest and central North America starting around 8,000 BCE. They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples, including the Navajo and Apache. They had villages with large multi-family dwellings, used seasonally during the summer, from which they hunted, fished and gathered food supplies for the winter. The Wendat peoples settled into Southern Ontario along the Eramosa River around 8,000–7,000 BCE (10,000–9,000 years ago). They were concentrated between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. Wendat hunted caribou to survive on the glacier-covered land. Many different First Nations cultures relied upon the buffalo starting by 6,000–5,000 BCE (8,000–7,000 years ago). They hunted buffalo by herding migrating buffalo off cliffs. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, near Lethbridge, Alberta, is a hunting grounds that was in use for about 5,000 years.

By 7,000–5000 BCE (9,000–7,000 years ago) the west coast of Canada saw various cultures who organized themselves around salmon fishing. The Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time. The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America&#x27;s Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000 BCE–1,500 BCE (9,000–3,500 years ago) along the Atlantic Coast of North America. Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine. The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America. The culture flourished between 3,000 BCE – 1,000 BCE (5,000–3,000 years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of red ochre to cover bodies and grave goods.

The Arctic small tool tradition is a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500 BCE (4,500 years ago). These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits. The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000 CE.
===Post-Archaic periods===

The Old Copper complex societies dating from 3,000 BCE – 500 BCE (5,000–2,500 years ago) are a manifestation of the Woodland culture, and are pre-pottery in nature. Evidence found in the northern Great Lakes regions indicates that they extracted copper from local glacial deposits and used it in its natural form to manufacture tools and implements.

The Woodland cultural period dates from about 1,000 BCE – 1,000 CE, and has locales in Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime regions. The introduction of pottery distinguishes the Woodland culture from the earlier Archaic stage inhabitants. Laurentian people of southern Ontario manufactured the oldest pottery excavated to date in Canada. They created pointed-bottom beakers decorated by a cord marking technique that involved impressing tooth implements into wet clay. Woodland technology included items such as beaver incisor knives, bangles, and chisels. The population practising sedentary agricultural life ways continued to increase on a diet of squash, corn, and bean crops.

The Hopewell tradition is an Indigenous culture that flourished along American rivers from 300 BCE – 500 CE. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell Exchange System networked cultures and societies with the peoples on the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Canadian expression of the Hopewellian peoples encompasses the Point Peninsula, Saugeen, and Laurel complexes.

====First Nations====

First Nations peoples had settled and established trade routes across what is now Canada by 500 BCE – 1,000 CE. Communities developed each with its own culture, customs, and character. In the northwest were the Athapaskan speaking, Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ, Tutchone, and Tlingit. Along the Pacific coast were the Tsimshian; Haida; Salish; Kwakwakaʼwakw; Heiltsuk; Nootka; Nisga&#x27;a; Senakw and Gitxsan. In the plains were the Niisitapi; Káínawa; Tsuutʼina; and Piikáni. In the northern woodlands were the Cree and Chipewyan. Around the Great Lakes were the Anishinaabe; Algonquin; Haudenosaunee and Wendat. Along the Atlantic coast were the Beothuk, Wolastoqiyik, Innu, Abenaki and Mi&#x27;kmaq.

Many First Nations civilizations established characteristics and hallmarks that included permanent urban settlements or cities, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies. These cultures had evolved and changed by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (–early 16th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations.

There are indications of contact made before Christopher Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. Indigenous people in Canada first interacted with Europeans around 1000 CE, but prolonged contact came after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries. European written accounts generally recorded friendliness of the First Nations, who profited in trade with Europeans. Such trade generally strengthened the more organized political entities such as the Iroquois Confederation. Throughout the 16th century, European fleets made almost annual visits to the eastern shores of Canada to cultivate the fishing opportunities. A sideline industry emerged in the un-organized traffic of furs overseen by the British Indian Department.

Prominent First Nations people include Joe Capilano, who met with King of the United Kingdom, Edward VII, to speak of the need to settle land claims and Ovide Mercredi, a leader at both the Meech Lake Accord constitutional reform discussions and Oka Crisis.

====Inuit====
Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around 1,000 CE and spread eastward across the Arctic, displacing the Dorset culture (in Inuktitut, the &quot;Tuniit&quot;). Inuit historically referred to the Tuniit as &quot;giants&quot;, who were taller and stronger than the Inuit. Researchers hypothesize that the Dorset culture lacked dogs, larger weapons and other technologies used by the expanding Inuit society. By 1300, the Inuit had settled in west Greenland, and finally moved into east Greenland over the following century. The Inuit had trade routes with more southern cultures. Boundary disputes were common and led to aggressive actions.

Warfare was common among Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit, such as the Nunamiut (Uummarmiut) who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in common warfare. The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare. In the 13th century, the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. Norse accounts are scant. Norse-made items from Inuit campsites in Greenland were obtained by either trade or plunder. One account, Ívar Bárðarson, speaks of &quot;small people&quot; with whom the Norsemen fought. 14th-century accounts relate that a western settlement, one of the two Norse settlements, was taken over by the Skræling.

After the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century. By the mid-16th century, Basque fishers were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as those excavated at Red Bay. The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations, but they did raid the stations in winter for tools, and particularly worked iron, which they adapted to native needs.

Notable among the Inuit are Abraham Ulrikab and family who became a zoo exhibit in Hamburg, Germany, and Tanya Tagaq, a traditional throat singer. Abe Okpik was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers and Kiviaq (David Ward) won the legal right to use his single-word Inuktitut name.

====Métis====

The Métis are people descended from marriages between Europeans (mainly French) and Cree, Ojibwe, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi&#x27;kmaq, Maliseet, and other First Nations. Their history dates to the mid-17th century.

When Europeans first arrived to Canada they relied on Indigenous peoples for fur trading skills and survival. To ensure alliances, relationships between European fur traders and Indigenous women were often consolidated through marriage. The Métis homeland consists of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories (NWT).

Amongst notable Métis people are singer and actor Tom Jackson, Commissioner of the Northwest Territories Tony Whitford, and Louis Riel who led two resistance movements: the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885, which ended in his trial and subsequent execution.

The languages inherently Métis are either Métis French or a mixed language called Michif. Michif, Mechif or Métchif is a phonetic spelling of Métif, a variant of Métis. The Métis today predominantly speak English, with French a strong second language, as well as numerous Indigenous tongues. A 19th-century community of the Métis people, the Anglo-Métis, were referred to as Countryborn. They were children of Rupert&#x27;s Land fur trade typically of Orcadian, Scottish, or English paternal descent and Indigenous maternal descent. Their first languages would have been Indigenous (Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc.) and English. Their fathers spoke Gaelic, thus leading to the development of an English dialect referred to as &quot;Bungee&quot;.

S.35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; mentions the Métis yet there has long been debate over legally defining the term Métis, but on September 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Métis are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling).

Unlike First Nations people, there has been no distinction between status and non-status Métis; the Métis, their heritage and Indigenous ancestry have often been absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations.

===Forced assimilation===
From the late 18th century, European Canadians (and the Canadian government) encouraged assimilation of Indigenous culture into what was referred to as &quot;Canadian culture.&quot; These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a series of initiatives that aimed at complete assimilation and subjugation of the Indigenous peoples. These policies, which were made possible by legislation such as the &quot;Gradual Civilization Act&quot; and the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, focused on European ideals of Christianity, sedentary living, agriculture, and education.

====Christianization====
Missionary work directed at the Indigenous people of Canada had been ongoing since the first missionaries arrived in the 1600s, generally from France, some of whom were martyred (Jesuit saints called the Canadian Martyrs). Christianization as government policy became more systematic with the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 1876, which would bring new sanctions for those who did not convert to Christianity. For example, the new laws would prevent non-Christian Indigenous people from testifying or having their cases heard in court, and ban alcohol consumption. When the &quot;Indian Act&quot; was amended in 1884, traditional religious and social practices, such as the Potlatch, would be banned, and further amendments in 1920 would prevent &quot;status Indians&quot; (as defined in the &quot;Act&quot;) from wearing traditional dress or performing traditional dances in an attempt to stop all non-Christian practices.

====Sedentary living, reserves, and &quot;gradual civilization&quot;====
Another focus of the Canadian government was to make the Indigenous groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Indigenous groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the &quot;Indian Act&quot; of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reserves. Farming was still seen as an important practice for assimilation on reserves; however, by the late 19th century the government had instituted restrictive policies here too, such as the Peasant Farm Policy, which restricted reserve farmers largely to the use of hand tools. This was implemented largely to limit the competitiveness of First Nations farming.

Through the &quot;Gradual Civilization Act&quot; in 1857, the government would encourage Indians (i.e., First Nations) to &quot;enfranchise&quot; – to &quot;remove all legal distinctions between [Indians] and Her Majesty&#x27;s other Canadian Subjects&quot;. If an Indigenous chose to enfranchise, it would strip them and their family of Aboriginal title, with the idea that they would become &quot;less savage&quot; and &quot;more civilized,&quot; thus become assimilated into Canadian society. However, they were often still defined as &quot;non-citizens&quot; by Europeans, and those few who did enfranchise were often met with disappointment.

====Residential system====

The final government strategy of assimilation, made possible by the &quot;Indian Act&quot; was the Canadian residential school system:

Beginning in 1874 and lasting until 1996, the Canadian government, in partnership with the dominant Christian Churches, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Indigenous children, who were forcibly taken from their homes. While the schools provided some education, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, and abuse.

According to some scholars, the Canadian government&#x27;s laws and policies, including the residential school system, that encouraged or required Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a Eurocentric society, violated the United Nations Genocide Convention that Canada signed in 1949 and passed through Parliament in 1952. Therefore, these scholars believe that Canada could be tried in international court for genocide. A legal case resulted in settlement of in 2006 and the 2008 establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which confirmed the injurious effect on children of this system and turmoil created between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous peoples. In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an apology on behalf of the Canadian government and its citizens for the residential school system.

==Politics, law, and legislation==
===Indigenous law vs. Aboriginal law===

The term &quot;Canadian Indigenous law&quot; refers to Indigenous peoples&#x27; own legal systems. This includes the laws and legal processes developed by Indigenous groups to govern their relationships, manage their natural resources, and manage conflicts. Indigenous law is developed from a variety of sources and institutions, which differ across legal traditions. Canadian Aboriginal law is the area of law related to the Canadian government&#x27;s relationship with the Indigenous peoples. Section 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to Aboriginals, which includes groups governed by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, different Numbered Treaties and outside of those acts.

===Treaties===
The Monarchy of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of Canada began interactions in North America during the European colonization period. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 recognized Indigenous title and the Treaty of Niagara of 1764 bound the Crown and the Indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes basin together in a familial relationship, a relationship that exists to this day, exemplified by First Nations attendance at the coronation of King Charles III. Post-Confederation Canada adopted a paternalistic approach and imposed an approach as though the nation-to-nation relationship did not exist, administering relations solely under Canadian law.

After Canada&#x27;s acquisition of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory in 1870, the eleven Numbered Treaties were imposed on the First Nations from 1871 to 1921. These treaties are agreements with the Crown administered by Canadian Aboriginal law and overseen by the Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations. 

Treaty rights would be recognized and incorporated into the 1982 Constitution. Many agreements signed before the Confederation of Canada are recognized in Canadian law, such as the Peace and Friendship Treaties, the Robinson Treaties, the Douglas Treaties, and many others, although many First Nations still have no treaty with the Crown recognizing their title, such as the Mikmaq, the Anishnaabe and several northern British Columbia nations.

For many years, Canada did not negotiate with First Nations to address their aboriginal title. Canadian court judgments and political pressure led to a change in ways following the Canadian Centennial year. The first treaty implemented under the new framework was the &quot;James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement&quot; in 1970 between the Cree and Quebec. This was followed by the &quot;Inuvialuit Final Agreement&quot; in 1984 that led to the creation of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement of 1993 lead to the creation of the Inuit-majority territory of Nunavut later that decade. The Canadian Crown continues to sign new treaties with Indigenous peoples, notably though the British Columbia Treaty Process.

According to the &quot;First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord&quot;, &quot;cooperation will be a cornerstone for partnership between Canada and First Nations, wherein &quot;Canada&quot; is the short-form reference to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada argued that treaties &quot;served to reconcile pre-existing Indigenous sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty, and to define Aboriginal rights.&quot; First Nations interpreted agreements covered in Treaty 8 to last &quot;as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow.&quot; However, the Canadian government has frequently breached the Crown&#x27;s treaty obligations over the years, and tries to address these issues by negotiating specific land claim.

===&quot;Indian Act&quot;===

The &quot;Indian Act&quot; is Canadian law that dates from 1876. The Act replaced pre-Confederation Canadian laws, and was intended to administer the Indigenous people, and define Canadian interactions. Successive Canadian governments used its powers to impose conditions on the First Nations, and guide their integration into Canada. Today still, the &quot;Indian Act&quot; indicates how reserves and bands can operate and defines who is recognized as an &quot;Indian.&quot; There have been many updates to this law since then, allowing Canadian citizenship and voting rights among others.

In 1985, the Canadian Parliament passed Bill C-31, &quot;An Act to Amend the Indian Act&quot;. Because of a constitutional requirement, the bill took effect on April 17, 1985.
* It ends discriminatory provisions of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, especially those that discriminated against women.
* It changes the meaning of &quot;status&quot; and for the first time allows for limited reinstatement of Indians who were denied or lost status or band membership.
* It allows bands to define their own membership rules.

Those people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians. C-31 clarified that various sections of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; apply to band members. The sections under debate concern community life and land holdings. Sections pertaining to Indians (First Nations peoples) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included.

===Royal Commission===

The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was a royal commission undertaken by the Government of Canada in 1991 to address issues of the Indigenous peoples of Canada. It assessed past government policies toward Indigenous people, such as residential schools, and provided policy recommendations to the government. The Commission issued its final report in November 1996. The five-volume, 4,000-page report covered a vast range of issues; its 440 recommendations called for sweeping changes to the interaction between Indigenous , non-Indigenous people and the governments in Canada. The report &quot;set out a 20-year agenda for change.&quot;

===Health policy===
In 1995, the Government of Canada announced the Aboriginal Right to Self-Government Policy. This policy recognizes that First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances. The Indian Health Transfer Policy provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by Indigenous peoples, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on self-determination in health. Through this process, the decision to enter transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities can take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities. The National Aboriginal Health Organization (NAHO) incorporated in 2000, was an Indigenous -designed and-controlled not-for-profit body in Canada that worked to influence and advance the health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples. Its funding was discontinued in 2012.

===Political organization===
First Nations and Inuit organizations ranged in size from band societies of a few people to multi-nation confederacies like the Iroquois. First Nations leaders from across the country formed the Assembly of First Nations, which began as the National Indian Brotherhood in 1968. The Métis and the Inuit are represented nationally by the Métis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami respectively.

Today&#x27;s political organizations have resulted from interaction with European-style methods of government through the Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians. Indigenous political organizations throughout Canada vary in political standing, viewpoints, and reasons for forming. First Nations, Métis and Inuit negotiate with the Government of Canada through Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada in all affairs concerning land, entitlement, and rights. The First Nation groups that operate independently do not belong to these groups.

==Culture==

Countless Indigenous words, inventions and games have become an everyday part of Canadian language and use. The canoe, snowshoes, the toboggan, lacrosse, tug of war, maple syrup and tobacco are just a few of the products, inventions and games. Some of the words include the barbecue, caribou, chipmunk, woodchuck, hammock, skunk, and moose.

Many places in Canada, both natural features and human habitations, use Indigenous names. The word &quot;Canada&quot; itself derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word meaning &#x27;village&#x27; or &#x27;settlement&#x27;. The province of Saskatchewan derives its name from the Saskatchewan River, which in the Cree language is called &quot;Kisiskatchewani Sipi&quot;, meaning &#x27;swift-flowing river&#x27;. &quot;Ottawa&quot;, the name of Canada&#x27;s capital city, comes from the Algonquin language term &quot;adawe&quot;, meaning &#x27;to trade&#x27;.

Modern youth groups, such as Scouts Canada and the Girl Guides of Canada, include programs based largely on Indigenous lore, arts and crafts, character building and outdoor camp craft and living.

Indigenous cultural areas depend upon their ancestors&#x27; primary lifeway, or occupation, at the time of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas, the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals and to a lesser extent plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inuksuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. &quot;Inuksuit&quot; are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called &quot;inunnguaq&quot;.
Indian reserves, established in Canadian law by treaties such as Treaty 7, are lands of First Nations recognized by non-Indigenous governments. Some reserves are within cities, such as the Opawikoscikan Reserve in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Wendake in Quebec City or Enoch Cree Nation 135 in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. There are more reserves in Canada than there are First Nations, which were ceded multiple reserves by treaty. Indigenous people currently work in a variety of occupations and may live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on them, from spirituality to political attitudes. National Indigenous Peoples Day is a day of recognition of the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year, by then Governor General of Canada, Roméo LeBlanc, to be celebrated on June 21 annually. Most provincial jurisdictions do not recognize it as a statutory holiday.

===Languages===

There are thirteen Indigenous language groups, eleven oral and two sign, in Canada, made up of more than sixty-five distinct dialects. Of these, only Cree, Inuktitut, and Ojibwe have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term. Two of Canada&#x27;s territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktut, also known as the Inuit language, (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French.

In the Northwest Territories, the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; declares that there are 11 different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwichʼin, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey, and Tłįchǫ. Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.

===Visual art===

Indigenous peoples were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them, Indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, Plateau, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, and Arctic.

Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture. Indigenous visual art may be used in conjunction with other arts. Among Inuit the masks and rattles of the &quot;angakkuq&quot; (shaman) are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music. Artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads. The distinct Métis cultures that have arisen from inter-cultural relationships with Europeans contribute culturally hybrid art forms. During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century the Canadian government pursued an active policy of forced and cultural assimilation toward Indigenous peoples. The &quot;Indian Act&quot; banned manifestations of the Sun Dance, the Potlatch, and works of art depicting them.

It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that Indigenous artists such as Mungo Martin, Bill Reid and Norval Morrisseau began to publicly renew and re-invent Indigenous art traditions. Currently, there are Indigenous artists practising in all media in Canada and two Indigenous artists, Edward Poitras and Rebecca Belmore, have represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1995 and 2005 respectively.

===Music===
Indigenous peoples in Canada encompass diverse ethnic groups with their individual musical traditions. Music is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private). Public, social music may be dance music accompanied by rattles and drums. Private, ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on percussion, used to mark occasions like Midewivin ceremonies and Sun Dances.

Traditionally, Indigenous peoples used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.

==Demography==


There are three (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) distinctive groups of Indigenous peoples that are recognized in the Canadian &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, sections 25 and 35. Under the &quot;Employment Equity Act&quot;, Indigenous people are a designated group along with women, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities; as such, they are neither a visible minority under the &quot;Act&quot; or in the view of Statistics Canada.

The 2021 Census data reveals that there are over 1.8 million Indigenous people in Canada, comprising 5.0% of the overall population and a slight increase from 4.9% in 2016.

The growth of the Indigenous population has slowed compared to previous years. The population grew by 18.9% between 2011 to 2016, while the growth from 2016 to 2021 was only 9.4%. For the first time, the Census recorded more than 1 million First Nations people living in Canada. The Indigenous population continues to grow at a faster rate than the non-Indigenous population but at a reduced speed. The Indigenous population is projected to reach between 2.5 million and 3.2 million in the next 20 years.

The First Nations population overall increased by 9.7% from 2016 to 2021. However, Status First Nations saw a slower growth of 4.1%, compared to those without Registered Indian status, which grew by 27.2%. The Métis population rose by 6.3%, and the Inuit population grew by 8.5%. More than half of First Nations people (55. 5%) lived in Western Canada as of 2021. Ontario had the highest number of First Nations people, with 251,030 (about 23.9%) of the total First Nations population. Approximately 11.1% of First Nations people lived in Quebec, with 7.6% in Atlantic Canada and 1.9% in the territories.

The 2021 Census showed nearly three in four Canadians lived in urban areas, with 801,045 Indigenous people living in large urban centers. This is an increase of 12.5% from 2016, signifying that Indigenous people were more likely to reside in these areas compared to before.

Moreover, the Indigenous population is generally younger than the non-Indigenous population. In 2021, the average age of Indigenous people was 33.6 years, compared to 41.8 years for non-Indigenous people. The Inuit population was the youngest, averaging 28.9 years, followed by First Nations at 32.5 years and Métis at 35.9 years. In total, there were 459,215 Indigenous children aged 14 years and younger, making up 25.4% of the Indigenous population, while only 16.0% of the non-Indigenous population fell into this age category.

In the 20th century, the Indigenous population of Canada increased tenfold. Between 1900 and 1950 the population grew by 29%. After the 1960&#x27;s the infant mortality level on reserves dropped dramatically. Since the 1980&#x27;s, the number of First Nations babies more than doubled and currently almost half of the First Nations population is under the age of 25.

Indigenous people assert that their sovereign rights are valid, pointing to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which is mentioned in the Canadian &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, Section 25, the &quot;British North America Acts&quot; and the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (to which Canada is a signatory) in support of this claim.
===Geographical distribution===
Ethnographers commonly classify Indigenous peoples of the Americas in the United States and Canada into ten geographical regions, cultural areas, with shared cultural traits. The Canadian regions are:
* Arctic cultural area (Eskaleut languages)
* Subarctic culture area (Na-Dene languages and Algic languages)
* Eastern Woodlands (Northeast) cultural area (Algic languages and Iroquoian languages)
* Plains cultural area (Siouan–Catawban languages)
* Northwest Plateau cultural area (Salishan languages)
* Northwest Coast cultural area (Penutian languages, Tsimshianic languages and Wakashan languages)

====Urban population====
Across Canada, 56% of Indigenous peoples live in urban areas. The urban Indigenous population is the fastest-growing population segment in Canada.

<text>The Lamborghini Murciélago is a sports car produced by Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini between 2001 and 2010. The successor to the Diablo and flagship V12 of the automaker&#x27;s lineup, the Murciélago was introduced as a coupé in 2001. The car was first available in North America for the 2002 model year. The Murciélago was Lamborghini&#x27;s first new design in eleven years, and was also the brand&#x27;s first new model under the ownership of German parent company Audi, which is owned by Volkswagen. The car is designed by Peruvian-born Belgian Luc Donckerwolke, Lamborghini&#x27;s head of design from 1998 to 2005.

A roadster variant was introduced in 2003, followed by the more powerful and updated LP 640 coupé and roadster and a limited edition LP 650–4 Roadster. The final variation to wear the Murciélago nameplate was the LP 670–4 SuperVeloce, powered by the largest and final evolution of the original Lamborghini V12 engine. Production of the Murciélago ended on 5 November 2010, with a total production run of 4,099 cars. Its successor, the Aventador, was unveiled at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show.

However, the Italian automaker often uses the Southern Spanish and Latin American Spanish pronunciation, , with an sound.

== Variants ==
=== Murciélago (2001–2006) ===

The Murciélago is an all-wheel drive, mid-engine sports car. With an angular design and a low slung body, the highest point of the roof is just under above the ground. One of the vehicle&#x27;s most distinguishing features is its scissor doors, a hallmark feature of flagship Lamborghini models since the Countach. The first generation of the Murciélago was produced between 2001 and 2006 and was powered by a Lamborghini V12 that traces its roots back to the company&#x27;s beginnings in the 1960s. The rear differential is integrated with the engine itself, with a viscous coupling centre differential transferring power to the front wheels. The total power distribution is 70 percent at the rear and 30 percent at the front. Power is delivered through a 6-speed manual transmission. The suspension utilised in the car uses an independent double-wishbone design, and the bodywork mostly features carbon fibre except for the steel roof and aluminium scissor doors. The active rear wing and the active air intakes integrated into the car&#x27;s shoulders are electromechanically controlled, deploying automatically only at high speeds in an effort to maximise both aerodynamic and cooling efficiency. The interior was also made more comfortable and ergonomic than its predecessor sporting a simple and clean look with all the major controls along with the gearshift knob integrated into the central tunnel.

The first generation cars were known simply as Murciélago. The naturally aspirated V12 engine installed in the first generation cars generated a maximum power output of at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 5,400 rpm, accelerating the car from a stand still to in 3.8 seconds and on to a top speed of . Subsequent versions incorporated an alphanumeric designation to the name Murciélago, which indicated their engine orientation and output. However, the original Murciélago is never referred to as &quot;LP 580&quot;.

=== Murciélago Roadster (2004–2006) ===
The concept car of the upcoming open-top variant was presented at the 2003 Detroit Motor Show as the Murciélago Barchetta. The production version called the Murciélago Roadster was introduced in 2004. Primarily designed to be an open-top car, it employed a manually attached soft roof as a cover from adverse weather, but a warning on the windshield header advised the driver not to exceed with the roof in place. The roof which was made of fabric could be folded and fit into a leather bag supplied with the car in order to store it in the front compartment when not in use. The designer, Luc Donckerwolke used the B-2 stealth bomber, the Wally 118 WallyPower yacht, and architect Santiago Calatrava&#x27;s Ciutat de Les Arts i Les Ciències in Valencia, Spain as his inspiration for the roadster&#x27;s revised rear pillars and engine cover. The roadster weighs more than the coupé due to the loss of the roof and the addition of chassis reinforcing components. The roadster could accelerate from in 3.8 seconds which is more than the coupé owing to the increased weight while the top speed remained the same as the coupé.
=== Murciélago LP 640 (2006–2010) ===

In March 2006, Lamborghini unveiled an updated version of the Murciélago at the Geneva Motor Show: the Murciélago LP 640. The new title incorporated the car&#x27;s name, along with an alphanumeric designation which indicated the engine&#x27;s orientation (&quot;Longitudinale Posteriore&quot;), and the updated power output. With displacement now increased to 6.5 litres, the engine was rated at at 8,000 rpm. The exterior received a noticeable facelift, featuring revised front and rear fascias, and asymmetrical side air intakes, with the left side intake feeding an oil cooler. A new single outlet exhaust system incorporated into the rear diffuser, modified suspension system, revised programming, and upgraded clutch for the 6-speed &quot;e-Gear&quot; automated manual transmission with launch control rounded out the performance modifications. Interior seating was also re-configured in order to provide greater headroom, and a new stereo system formed part of the updated dashboard. Optional equipment included Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite brakes, chrome paddle shifters and a glass engine cover. The car&#x27;s estimated fuel economy for the 6-speed manual variant is in the city and on the highway, making it the least efficient car in 2008 for city and highway driving, according to the EPA.

=== Murciélago LP 640 Roadster (2006–2010) ===
At the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show, Lamborghini announced that the roadster version of the Murciélago would also be updated to LP 640 specifications. One of the most rare of all the LP640 Roadster derivatives in the LP640 in right-hand-drive guise with a manual transmission. A rumoured five of these are said to exist worldwide.

=== Murciélago LP 670–4 SuperVeloce (2009–2010) ===
At the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled a high performance variant of the Murciélago, the LP 670–4 SuperVeloce. The SV moniker had previously appeared on the Diablo SV, as well as the Miura SV. The SV variants are more track-oriented than the normal production variants and are usually produced in limited numbers.

The SuperVeloce&#x27;s V12 engine generates a maximum power output at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 6,500 rpm, due to revised valve timing and upgraded intake system. The air intakes were made bigger for better brake cooling and the front spoiler extended much farther for improved downforce. The engine cover was specially designed for the SV and consisted of three hexagonal plexiglass plates supported by a carbon fibre framework. The car&#x27;s weight was also reduced by through the extensive use of carbon fibre inside and out. A new, lighter exhaust system also helps in saving weight. The interior was also trimmed in Alcantara as a weight saving measure. As a result of the extensive weight loss, the SV has a power-to-weight ratio of 429 hp/long ton. The LP 640&#x27;s optional 15-inch carbon-ceramic disc brakes with 6 piston callipers came as standard equipment with the car. In its June 2009 issue, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine estimated that the LP 670–4 SV is capable of accelerating to from a standing start in just 3.0 seconds and on to in 7.2 seconds. Subsequent testing by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; revealed a time of 3.1 seconds and a quarter mile time of 10.9 seconds at . Lamborghini claimed a top speed of when the car is fitted with an optional smaller spoiler, or with the standard Aeropack spoiler.

According to Maurizio Reggiani, head of Lamborghini R&amp;D at the time, the LP 670–4 SV&#x27;s steering was tuned for high-speed sensitivity. The original production plan of the ultimate Murciélago was limited to 350 cars. However, an Instagram page known as &quot;@murcielagosv.registry&quot; has been tracking the exact number of LP 670-4s and as of 2023 there have been 261 units found so far. The initial plan of 350 units was scrapped due to the factory requiring to make room for the Aventador&#x27;s assembly line which is the Murcielago&#x27;s successor. The chassis numbers of the total cars manufactured do not represent manufacturing order.

=== R-GT ===
The Lamborghini Murciélago R-GT is a racing version of the Murciélago, developed jointly with Reiter Engineering and Audi Sport, and unveiled at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show. Unlike the standard car, the R-GT is rear-wheel drive only, and in order to comply with the FIA, ACO, and JAF rules, the car retains the standard V12 engine, but air restrictors are used to manage power. Acceleration and top speed performance are dependent on gearing, as different ratios are used for different tracks. Most sources report that around 7 original R-GTs were sold. This number doesn&#x27;t include later derivatives such as the RG-1 or R-SV.

In March 2007, the All-Inkl.com Racing Murciélago won the Zhuhai 2 Hours. A Murciélago R-GT was entered into the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans but was not classified. However, a Murciélago R-GT entered jointly by IPB Spartak Racing and Reiter Engineering finished 8th overall and 5th in the GT1 class in the 2008 24 Hours of Spa.

In April 2009, beating a Corvette C6.R, and Saleen S7R, a Murciélago R-GT of the Russian IPB Spartak Racing Team won the GT1 class in the 1000 km de Catalunya, a LMS race. The drivers of the IPB Spartak Racing car were Russian, Roman Rusinov, and Dutch, Peter Kox. The Lamborghini made a pole position but was moved to the end of the grid due to some technical irregularities. They finished 2 laps ahead of the lead Corvette to take the second international win for a Lamborghini GT car.

=== RG-1 ===

The Lamborghini Murciélago RG-1 was built for the Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to compete in Japanese Super GT series in 2004. In March 2006, the RG-1 recorded a win in the GT300 class at the Super GT Suzuka 500 km race.
:;RG-1LM
:The Lamborghini Murciélago RG-1LM (alias: RGT-LM) is endurance version of Murciélago RG-1 specially developed for JLOC by Reiter Engineering and run in 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 2006.

=== LP 670 R-SV ===
The Lamborghini Murciélago LP 670 R-SV is an evolution of the R-GT developed by Reiter Engineering to comply with the FIA rules for the new FIA GT1 World Championship. It was unveiled at the 2010 24 Hours of Spa weekend. The 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season saw Reiter run two cars and the other two were run by All-Inkl.com Münnich Motorsport. Reiter saw some success winning two Championship races, finishing third in the teams&#x27; championship. The All-Inkl team did not have as much success finishing ninth in the championship. The 2011 season saw Swiss Racing Team run the ex-Reiter R-SV&#x27;s, after an unsuccessful season in 2010 running Nissan GT-R&#x27;s. All-Inkl has had a successful season so far topping the teams&#x27; championship as of round seven. Swiss Racing Team had some points finishes but after a crash between both cars at the Sachsenring round, they had a lack of spare parts and did not compete in the next three events. DKR Engineering announced that they would be using Murciélago R-SVs for the last 2 rounds of the season, instead of the Chevrolet Corvette C6.R that they were using for the first 8 rounds.

=== Lamborghini Miura concept ===
In January 2006, a retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, built on a Murciélago chassis, was announced at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio and promoted at the Los Angeles Auto Show, although the car itself was not present at the show. Subsequently, the Miura concept was officially debuted at the North American International Auto Show just two weeks later. It was the first design penned by Lamborghini&#x27;s then design chief, Walter de&#x27;Silva, and commemorated the 40th anniversary of the 1966 introduction of the original Miura in Geneva.

Lamborghini president and CEO, Stefan Winkelmann, rejected any possibility of the concept marking the Miura&#x27;s return to production, however, stating “The Miura was a celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about the future. Retro design is not what we are here for. So we won’t do the Miura.”

=== Lamborghini Reventón ===
Debuted in 2007 at the Frankfurt Auto Show, the Lamborghini Reventón is a modified version of the Murciélago. The car&#x27;s mechanical underpinnings and engine are identical to those of the Murciélago LP 640. However, cosmetics are all unique. Interior and exterior styling were inspired by stealth fighter design, taking cues from aircraft such as the F-22 Raptor. Only 21 units were built, of which one was retained by the factory to be exhibited in the Lamborghini museum. Lamborghini also produced 15 units of a roadster version.

== Production ==
== In popular culture ==
The Murciélago is featured on the cover and in the car roster of the racing video game &quot;Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2&quot;. A Murciélago LP 640 in police livery is also featured in the promotional video of &quot;Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot; alongside a Pagani Zonda Cinque.

The Murciélago Roadster was used in the 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and the Murciélago LP 640 was used in its sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. It is used as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s personal transport, with its name meaning &quot;bat&quot; connecting to his identity as &quot;Batman&quot;. Lamborghini lent the production crew of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; three Murciélago LP 640s to use in a chase scene. One of the cars was destroyed in the process.

The Murciélago is the titular Lamborghini referenced in the Kanye West song &quot;Mercy&quot;, though the actual car depicted in the music video is a Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4.

<text>Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data about issues relating to marketing products and services. The goal is to identify and assess how changing elements of the marketing mix impacts customer behavior.

This involves employing a data-driven marketing approach to specify the data required to address these issues, then designing the method for collecting information and implementing the data collection process. After analyzing the collected data, these results and findings, including their implications, are forwarded to those empowered to act on them.

Market research, marketing research, and marketing are a sequence of business activities; sometimes these are handled informally.

The field of &quot;marketing research&quot; is much older than that of &quot;market research&quot;. Although both involve consumers, &quot;Marketing&quot; research is concerned specifically with marketing processes, such as advertising effectiveness and salesforce effectiveness, while &quot;market&quot; research is concerned specifically with markets and distribution. Two explanations given for confusing &quot;market research&quot; with &quot;marketing research&quot; are the similarity of the terms and also that market research is a subset of marketing research. Further confusion exists because of major companies with expertise and practices in both areas.

==Overview==
Marketing research is often partitioned into two sets of categorical pairs, either by target market:

* Direct or Business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing research, and
* Business-to-business (B2B) marketing research.

Or, alternatively, by methodological approach:

* Qualitative marketing research, and
* Quantitative marketing research.

Consumer marketing research is a form of applied sociology that concentrates on understanding the preferences, attitudes, and behaviors of consumers in a market-based economy, and it aims to understand the effects and comparative success of marketing campaigns.

Thus, marketing research may also be described as the systematic and objective identification, collection, analysis, and dissemination of information for the purpose of assisting management in decision making related to the identification and solution of problems and opportunities in marketing. The goal of market research is to obtain and provide management with viable information about the market (e.g. competitors), consumers, the product/service itself etc.

==Role==

The purpose of marketing research (MR) is to provide management with relevant, accurate, reliable, valid, and up to date market information. Competitive marketing environment and the ever-increasing costs attributed to poor decision making require that marketing research provide sound information. Sound decisions are not based on gut feeling, intuition, or even pure judgment.

Managers make numerous strategic and tactical decisions in the process of identifying and satisfying customer needs. They make decisions about potential opportunities, target market selection, MARKETING segmentation, planning and implementing marketing programs, marketing performance, and control. These decisions are complicated by interactions between the controllable marketing variables of product, pricing, promotion, and distribution. Further complications are added by uncontrollable environmental factors such as general economic conditions, technology, public policies and laws, political environment, competition, and social and cultural changes. Another factor in this mix is the complexity of consumers. Marketing research helps the marketing manager link the marketing variables with the environment and the consumers. It helps remove some of the uncertainty by providing relevant information about the marketing variables, environment, and consumers. In the absence of relevant information, consumers&#x27; response to marketing programs cannot be predicted reliably or accurately. Ongoing marketing research programs provide information on controllable and non-controllable factors and consumers; this information enhances the effectiveness of decisions made by marketing managers.

Traditionally, marketing researchers were responsible for providing the relevant information and marketing decisions were made by the managers. However, the roles are changing and marketing researchers are becoming more involved in decision making, whereas marketing managers are becoming more involved with research. The role of marketing research in managerial decision making is explained further using the framework of the DECIDE model.

==History==
Evidence for commercial research being gathered informally dates to the Medieval period. In 1380, the German textile manufacturer, Johann Fugger, travelled from Augsburg to Graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry. He exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas. Although, this type of information would have been termed &quot;commercial intelligence&quot; at the time, it created a precedent for the systemic collection of marketing information.

During the European age of discovery, industrial houses began to import exotic, luxury goods - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. International traders began to demand information that could be used for marketing decisions. During this period, Daniel Defoe, a London merchant, published information on trade and economic resources of England and Scotland. Defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to the state of trade including; &quot;Trade of Britain Stated,&quot; (1707); &quot;Trade of Scotland with France,&quot; (1713) and &quot;The Trade to India Critically and Calmly Considered,&quot; (1720) - all of which provided merchants and traders with important information on which to base business decisions.

Until the late 18th-century, European and North-American economies were characterised by local production and consumption. Produce, household goods and tools were produced by local artisans or farmers with exchange taking place in local markets or fairs. Under these conditions, the need for marketing information was minimal. However, the rise of mass-production following the industrial revolution, combined with improved transportation systems of the early 19th-century, led to the creation of national markets and ultimately, stimulated the need for more detailed information about customers, competitors, distribution systems, and market communications.

By the 19th-century, manufacturers were exploring ways to understand the different market needs and behaviours of groups of consumers. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation as early as the 1820s. From the 1880s, German toy manufacturers were producing models of tin toys for specific geographic markets; London omnibuses and ambulances destined for the British market; French postal delivery vans for Continental Europe and American locomotives intended for sale in America. Such activities suggest that sufficient market information was collected to support detailed market segmentation.

In 1895, American advertising agency, N. H. Ayer &amp; Son, used telegraph to contact publishers and state officials throughout the country about grain production, in an effort to construct an advertising schedule for client, Nichols-Shephard company, an agricultural machinery company in what many scholars believe is the first application of marketing research to solve a marketing/ advertising problem)

Between 1902 and 1910, George B Waldron, working at Mahin&#x27;s Advertising Agency in the United States used tax registers, city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated vs illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in a very early example of simple market segmentation. In 1911 Charles Coolidge Parlin was appointed as the Manager of the Commercial Research Division of the Advertising Department of the Curtis Publishing Company, thereby establishing the first in-house market research department - an event that has been described as marking the beginnings of organised marketing research. His aim was to turn market research into a science. Parlin published a number of studies of various product-markets including agriculture (1911); consumer goods (c.1911); department store lines (1912) a five-volume study of automobiles (1914).

In 1924 Paul Cherington improved on primitive forms of demographic market segmentation when he developed the &#x27;ABCD&#x27; household typology; the first socio-demographic segmentation tool. By the 1930s, market researchers such as Ernest Dichter recognised that demographics alone were insufficient to explain different marketing behaviours and began exploring the use of lifestyles, attitudes, values, beliefs and culture to segment markets.

In the first three decades of the 20th century, advertising agencies and marketing departments developed the basic techniques used in quantitative and qualitative research – survey methods, questionnaires, gallup polls etc. As early as 1901, Walter B Scott was undertaking experimental research for the Agate Club of Chicago. In 1910, George B Waldron was carrying out qualitative research for Mahins Advertising Agency. In 1919, the first book on commercial research was published, &quot;Commercial Research: An Outline of Working Principles&quot; by Professor C.S. Duncan of the University of Chicago.

Adequate knowledge of consumer preferences was a key to survival in the face of increasingly competitive markets. By the 1920s, advertising agencies, such as J Walter Thompson (JWT), were conducting research on the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; consumers used brands, so that they could recommend appropriate advertising copy to manufacturers.

The advent of commercial radio in the 1920s, and television in the 1940s, led a number of market research companies to develop the means to measure audience size and audience composition. In 1923, Arthur Nielsen founded market research company, A C Nielsen and over next decade pioneered the measurement of radio audiences. He subsequently applied his methods to the measurement of television audiences. Around the same time, Daniel Starch developed measures for testing advertising copy effectiveness in print media (newspapers and magazines), and these subsequently became known as Starch scores (and are still used today).

During, the 1930s and 1940s, many of the data collection methods, probability sampling methods, survey methods, questionnaire design and key metrics were developed. By the 1930s, Ernest Dichter was pioneering the focus group method of qualitative research. For this, he is often described as the &#x27;father of market research.&#x27; Dichter applied his methods on campaigns for major brands including Chrysler, Exxon/Esso where he used methods from psychology and cultural anthropology to gain consumer insights. These methods eventually lead to the development of &quot;motivational research.&quot; Marketing historians refer to this period as the &quot;Foundation Age&quot; of market research.

By the 1930s, the first courses on marketing research were taught in universities and colleges. The text-book, &quot;Market Research and Analysis&quot; by Lyndon O. Brown (1937) became one of the popular textbooks during this period. As the number of trained research professionals proliferated throughout the second half of the 20th-century, the techniques and methods used in marketing research became increasingly sophisticated. Marketers, such as Paul Green, were instrumental in developing techniques such as conjoint analysis and multidimensional scaling, both of which are used in positioning maps, market segmentation, choice analysis and other marketing applications.

Web analytics were born out of the need to track the behavior of site visitors and, as the popularity of e-commerce and web advertising grew, businesses demanded details on the information created by new practices in web data collection, such as click-through and exit rates. As the Internet boomed, websites became larger and more complex and the possibility of two-way communication between businesses and their consumers became a reality. Provided with the capacity to interact with online customers, Researchers were able to collect large amounts of data that were previously unavailable, further propelling the marketing research industry.

In the new millennium, as the Internet continued to develop and websites became more interactive, data collection and analysis became more commonplace for those marketing research firms whose clients had a web presence. With the explosive growth of the online marketplace came new competition for companies; no longer were businesses merely competing with the shop down the road — competition was now represented by a global force. Retail outlets were appearing online and the previous need for bricks-and-mortar stores was diminishing at a greater pace than online competition was growing. With so many online channels for consumers to make purchases, companies needed newer and more compelling methods, in combination with messages that resonated more effectively, to capture the attention of the average consumer.

Having access to web data did not automatically provide companies with the rationale behind the behavior of users visiting their sites, which provoked the marketing research industry to develop new and better ways of tracking, collecting and interpreting information. This led to the development of various tools like online focus groups and pop-up or website intercept surveys. These types of services allowed companies to dig deeper into the motivations of consumers, augmenting their insights and utilizing this data to drive market share.

As information around the world became more accessible, increased competition led companies to demand more of market researchers. It was no longer sufficient to follow trends in web behavior or track sales data; companies now needed access to consumer behavior throughout the entire purchase process. This meant the Marketing Research Industry, again, needed to adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the marketplace, and to the demands of companies looking for a competitive edge.

Today, marketing research has adapted to innovations in technology and the corresponding ease with which information is available. B2B and B2C companies are working hard to stay competitive and they now demand both quantitative (“What”) and qualitative (“Why?”) marketing research in order to better understand their target audience and the motivations behind customer behaviors.

This demand is driving marketing researchers to develop new platforms for interactive, two-way communication between their firms and consumers. Mobile devices such as Smart Phones are the best example of an emerging platform that enables businesses to connect with their customers throughout the entire buying process.

As personal mobile devices become more capable and widespread, the marketing research industry will look to further capitalize on this trend. Mobile devices present the perfect channel for research firms to retrieve immediate impressions from buyers and to provide their clients with a holistic view of the consumers within their target markets, and beyond. Now, more than ever, innovation is the key to success for Marketing Researchers. Marketing Research Clients are beginning to demand highly personalized and specifically focused products from the marketing research firms; big data is great for identifying general market segments, but is less capable of identifying key factors of niche markets, which now defines the competitive edge companies are looking for in this mobile-digital age.

==Characteristics==
First, marketing &quot;research is systematic&quot;. Thus systematic planning is required at all the stages of the marketing research process. The procedures followed at each stage are methodologically sound, well documented, and, as much as possible, planned in advance. Marketing research uses the scientific method in that data are collected and analyzed to test prior notions or hypotheses. Experts in marketing research have shown that studies featuring multiple and often competing hypotheses yield more meaningful results than those featuring only one dominant hypothesis.

Marketing research is &quot;objective&quot;. It attempts to provide accurate information that reflects a true state of affairs. It should be conducted impartially. While research is always influenced by the researcher&#x27;s research philosophy, it should be free from the personal or political biases of the researcher or the management. Research which is motivated by personal or political gain involves a breach of professional standards. Such research is deliberately biased so as to result in predetermined findings. The objective nature of marketing research underscores the importance of ethical considerations. Also, researchers should always be objective with regard to the selection of information to be featured in reference texts because such literature should offer a comprehensive view on marketing. Research has shown, however, that many marketing textbooks do not feature important principles in marketing research.

==Related business research==
Other forms of business research include:
* Market research is broader in scope and examines all aspects of a business environment, but not internal business processes. It asks questions about competitors, market structure, government regulations, economic trends, technological advances, and numerous other factors that make up the external business environment (see environmental scanning). Sometimes the term refers more particularly to the financial analysis of competing companies, industries, or sectors. In this case, financial analysts usually carry out the research and provide the results to investment advisors and potential investors.
* Product research — This looks at what products can be produced with available technology, and what new product innovations near-future technology can develop (see new product development).
* Advertising research is a specialized form of marketing research conducted to improve the efficacy of advertising. Copy testing, also known as &quot;pre-testing,&quot; is a form of customized research that predicts in-market performance of an ad before it airs, by analyzing audience levels of attention, , motivation, entertainment, and communication, as well as breaking down the ad&#x27;s and . Pre-testing is also used on ads still in rough (ripomatic or animatic) form. (Young, p. 213)

==Classification==

Organizations engage in marketing research for two reasons: firstly, to identify and, secondly, to solve marketing problems. This distinction serves as a basis for classifying marketing research into problem identification research and problem solving research.

Problem identification research is undertaken to help identify problems which are, perhaps, not apparent on the surface and yet exist or are likely to arise in the future like company image, market characteristics, sales analysis, short-range forecasting, long range forecasting, and business trends research. Research of this type provides information about the marketing environment and helps diagnose a problem. For example, the findings of problem solving research are used in making decisions which will solve specific marketing problems.

The Stanford Research Institute, on the other hand, conducts an annual survey of consumers that is used to classify persons into homogeneous groups for segmentation purposes. The National Purchase Diary panel (NPD) maintains the largest diary panel in the United States.

Standardized services are research studies conducted for different client firms but in a standard way. For example, procedures for measuring advertising effectiveness have been standardized so that the results can be compared across studies and evaluative norms can be established. The Starch Readership Survey is the most widely used service for evaluating print advertisements; another well-known service is the Gallup and Robinson Magazine Impact Studies. These services are also sold on a syndicated basis.

*Customized services offer a wide variety of marketing research services customized to suit a client&#x27;s specific needs. Each marketing research project is treated uniquely.
*Limited-service suppliers specialize in one or a few phases of the marketing research project. Services offered by such suppliers are classified as field services, coding and data entry, data analysis, analytical services, and branded products. Field services collect data through the internet, traditional mail, in-person, or telephone interviewing, and firms that specialize in interviewing are called field service organizations. These organizations may range from small proprietary organizations which operate locally to large multinational organizations with WATS line interviewing facilities. Some organizations maintain extensive interviewing facilities across the country for interviewing shoppers in malls.
*Coding and data entry services include editing completed questionnaires, developing a coding scheme, and transcribing the data on to diskettes or magnetic tapes for input into the computer. NRC Data Systems provides such services.
*Analytical services include designing and pretesting questionnaires, determining the best means of collecting data, designing sampling plans, and other aspects of the research design. Some complex marketing research projects require knowledge of sophisticated procedures, including specialized experimental designs, and analytical techniques such as conjoint analysis and multidimensional scaling. This kind of expertise can be obtained from firms and consultants specializing in analytical services.
*Data analysis services are offered by firms, also known as tab houses, that specialize in computer analysis of quantitative data such as those obtained in large surveys. Initially most data analysis firms supplied only tabulations (frequency counts) and cross tabulations (frequency counts that describe two or more variables simultaneously). With the proliferation of software, many firms now have the capability to analyze their own data, but, data analysis firms are still in demand. 
*Branded marketing research products and services are specialized data collection and analysis procedures developed to address specific types of marketing research problems. These procedures are patented, given brand names, and marketed like any other branded product.

==Marketing Techniques==

Marketing research techniques come in many forms, including:

*Ad Tracking – periodic or continuous in-market research to monitor a performance using measures such as brand awareness, brand preference, and product usage. (Young, 2005)
*Advertising Research – used to predict copy testing or track the efficacy of advertisements for any medium, measured by the ad&#x27;s ability to get attention (measured with AttentionTracking), communicate the message, build the brand&#x27;s image, and motivate the consumer to purchase the product or service. (Young, 2005)
*Brand awareness research — the extent to which consumers can recall or recognize a brand name or product name
*Brand association research — what do consumers associate with the brand?
*Brand attribute research — what are the key traits that describe the brand promise?
*Brand name testing what do consumers feel about the names of the products?
* Buyer decision-making process— to determine what motivates people to buy and what decision-making process they use; over the last decade, Neuromarketing emerged from the convergence of neuroscience and marketing, aiming to understand consumer decision-making process
*Commercial eye tracking research — examine advertisements, package designs, websites, etc. by analyzing visual behavior of the consumer
*Concept testing to test the acceptance of a concept by target consumers
*Coolhunting (also known as trendspotting) to make observations and predictions in changes of new or existing cultural trends in areas such as fashion, music, films, television, youth culture and lifestyle
*Copy testing – predicts in-market performance of an ad before it airs by analyzing audience levels of , , , entertainment, and communication, as well as breaking down the ad&#x27;s and . (Young, p 213)
*Customer satisfaction research quantitative or qualitative studies that yields an understanding of a customer&#x27;s satisfaction with a transaction
*Demand estimation — to determine the approximate level of demand for the product
*Distribution channel audits — to assess distributors’ and retailers’ attitudes toward a product, brand, or company
*Internet strategic intelligence — searching for customer opinions in the Internet: chats, forums, web pages, blogs... where people express freely about their experiences with products, becoming strong opinion formers.
*Marketing effectiveness and analytics — Building models and measuring results to determine the effectiveness of individual marketing activities.
*Mystery consumer or mystery shopping An employee or representative of the market research firm anonymously contacts a salesperson and indicates he or she is shopping for a product. The shopper then records the entire experience. This method is often used for quality control or for researching competitors&#x27; products.
*Positioning research — how does the target market see the brand relative to competitors? what does the brand stand for?
*Price elasticity testing — to determine how sensitive customers are to price changes
*Sales forecasting — to determine the expected level of sales given the level of demand. With respect to other factors like Advertising expenditure, sales promotion etc.
*Segmentation research to determine the demographic, psychographic, cultural, and behavioral characteristics of potential buyers
*Online panel a group of individuals who accepted to respond to marketing research online
*Store audit — to measure the sales of a product or product line at a statistically selected store sample to determine market share, or to determine whether a retail store provides adequate service
*Test marketing — a small-scale product launch used to determine the likely acceptance of the product when it is introduced into a wider market
*Viral Marketing Research refers to marketing research designed to estimate the probability that specific communications will be transmitted throughout an individual&#x27;s Social Network. Estimates of Social Networking Potential (SNP) are combined with estimates of selling effectiveness to estimate ROI on specific combinations of messages and media.

All these forms of marketing research can be classified as either problem-identification research or as problem-solving research.

There are two main sources of data — primary and secondary. Primary research is conducted from scratch. It is original and collected to solve the problem at hand. Secondary research already exists since it has been collected for other purposes. It is conducted on data published previously and usually by someone else. Secondary research costs far less than primary research but seldom comes in a form that meets the researcher&#x27;s needs.

A similar distinction exists between exploratory research and conclusive research. Exploratory research provides insights into and comprehension of an issue or situation. It should draw definitive conclusions only with extreme caution. Conclusive research draws conclusions: the results of the study can be generalized to the whole population.

Exploratory research is conducted to explore a problem to get some basic idea about the solution at the preliminary stages of research. It may serve as the input to conclusive research. Exploratory research information is collected by focus group interviews, reviewing literature or books, discussing with experts, etc. This is unstructured and qualitative in nature. If a secondary source of data is unable to serve the purpose, a convenience sample of small size can be collected. Conclusive research is conducted to draw some conclusion about the problem. It is essentially, structured and quantitative research, and the output of this research is the input to management information systems (MIS).

Exploratory research is also conducted to simplify the findings of the conclusive or descriptive research, if the findings are very hard to interpret for the marketing managers.

==Methods==
Methodologically, marketing research uses the following types of research designs:

;Based on questioning:
:*Qualitative marketing research generally used for exploratory purposes — small number of respondents — not generalizable to the whole population — statistical significance and confidence not calculated — examples include focus groups, in-depth interviews, and projective techniques
:*Quantitative marketing research generally used to draw conclusions — tests a specific hypothesis uses random sampling techniques so as to infer from the sample to the population — involves a large number of respondents — examples include surveys and questionnaires. Techniques include choice modelling, maximum difference preference scaling, and covariance analysis.

;Based on observations:
:*Ethnographic studies — by nature qualitative, the researcher observes social phenomena in their natural setting — observations can occur cross-sectionally (observations made at one time) or longitudinally (observations occur over several time-periods) examples include product-use analysis and computer cookie traces. See also Ethnography and Observational techniques.
:*Experimental techniques by nature quantitative, the researcher creates a quasi-artificial environment to try to control spurious factors, then manipulates at least one of the variables — examples include purchasing laboratories and test markets. As described in the list of Marketing strategies.
:*Secondary research by nature qualitative, the researcher gathers information by accessing online and offline sources of information. These sources can be publicly available ones - examples include the Office of National Statistics in the UK, or data.gov in the US - or private sources of information - examples include textbooks and reports that are behind a paywall.

Researchers often use more than one research design. They may start with secondary research to get background information, then conduct a focus group (qualitative research design) to explore the issues. Finally they might do a full nationwide survey (quantitative research design) in order to devise specific recommendations for the client.

==Business to business==

Business to business (B2B) research is inevitably more complicated than consumer research. Researchers need to know what type of multi-faceted approach will answer the objectives, since seldom is it possible to find the answers using only one method. Finding the right respondents is crucial in B2B research, since they are often busy, and may not want to participate. Respondents may also be biased on a particular topic. Encouraging them to “open up” is yet another skill required of the B2B researcher. Last but not least, most business research leads to strategic decisions and this means that the business researcher must have expertise in developing strategies that are strongly rooted in the research findings and acceptable to the client.

There are four key factors that make B2B market research special and different from consumer markets:

* The decision making unit is far more complex in B2B markets than in consumer markets.
* B2B products and their applications are more complex than consumer products.
* B2B marketers address a much smaller number of customers who are very much larger in their consumption of products than is the case in consumer markets.
* Personal relationships are of critical importance in B2B markets.

==International plan==

International Marketing Research follows the same path as domestic research, but there are a few more problems that may arise. Customers in international markets may have very different customs, cultures, and expectations from the same company. They also require tailored translation approaches based on the expertise or resources available in the local country.

In this case, Marketing Research relies more on primary data rather than secondary information. Gathering the primary data can be hindered by language, literacy and access to technology. Basic Cultural and Market intelligence information will be needed to maximize the research effectiveness. Some of the steps that would help overcoming barriers include:
# Collect secondary information on the country under study from reliable international source e.g. WHO and IMF
# Collect secondary information on the product/service under study from available sources
# Collect secondary information on product manufacturers and service providers under study in relevant country
# Collect secondary information on culture and common business practices
# Ask questions to get better understanding of reasons behind any recommendations for a specific methodology

==Common terms==
Market research techniques resemble those used in political polling and social science research. Meta-analysis (also called the Schmidt-Hunter technique) refers to a statistical method of combining data from multiple studies or from several types of studies. Conceptualization means the process of converting vague mental images into definable concepts. Operationalization is the process of converting concepts into specific observable behaviors that a researcher can measure. Precision refers to the exactness of any given measure. Reliability refers to the likelihood that a given operationalized construct will yield the same results if re-measured. Validity refers to the extent to which a measure provides data that captures the meaning of the operationalized construct as defined in the study. It asks, “Are we measuring what we intended to measure?”

* Applied research sets out to prove a specific hypothesis of value to the clients paying for the research. For example, a cigarette company might commission research that attempts to show that cigarettes are good for one&#x27;s health. Many researchers have ethical misgivings about doing applied research.
* Sugging (from SUG, for &quot;selling under the guise&quot; of market research) forms a sales technique in which sales people pretend to conduct marketing research, but with the real purpose of obtaining buyer motivation and buyer decision-making information to be used in a subsequent sales call.
* Frugging comprises the practice of soliciting funds under the pretense of being a research organization.

==Careers==
Some of the positions available in marketing research include vice president of marketing research, research director, assistant director of research, project manager, field work director, statistician/data processing specialist, senior analyst, analyst, junior analyst and operational supervisor.

The most common entry-level position in marketing research for people with bachelor&#x27;s degrees (e.g., BBA) is as operational supervisor. These people are responsible for supervising a well-defined set of operations, including field work, data editing, and coding, and may be involved in programming and data analysis. Another entry-level position for BBAs is assistant project manager. An assistant project manager will learn and assist in questionnaire design, review field instructions, and monitor timing and costs of studies. In the marketing research industry, however, there is a growing preference for people with master&#x27;s degrees. Those with MBA or equivalent degrees are likely to be employed as project managers.

A small number of business schools also offer a more specialized Master of Marketing Research (MMR) degree. An MMR typically prepares students for a wide range of research methodologies and focuses on learning both in the classroom and the field.

The typical entry-level position in a business firm would be junior research analyst (for BBAs) or research analyst (for MBAs or MMRs). The junior analyst and the research analyst learn about the particular industry and receive training from a senior staff member, usually the marketing research manager. The junior analyst position includes a training program to prepare individuals for the responsibilities of a research analyst, including coordinating with the marketing department and sales force to develop goals for product exposure. The research analyst responsibilities include checking all data for accuracy, comparing and contrasting new research with established norms, and analyzing primary and secondary data for the purpose of market forecasting.

As these job titles indicate, people with a variety of backgrounds and skills are needed in marketing research. Technical specialists such as statisticians obviously need strong backgrounds in statistics and data analysis. Other positions, such as research director, call for managing the work of others and require more general skills. To prepare for a career in marketing research, students usually:

* Take all the marketing courses.
* Take courses in statistics and quantitative methods.
* Acquire computer skills.
* Take courses in psychology and consumer behavior.
* Acquire effective written and verbal communication skills.
* Think creatively.

<text>In mathematics, the discrete sine transform (DST) is a Fourier-related transform similar to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), but using a purely real matrix. It is equivalent to the imaginary parts of a DFT of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with odd symmetry (since the Fourier transform of a real and odd function is imaginary and odd), where in some variants the input and/or output data are shifted by half a sample.

The DST is related to the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which is equivalent to a DFT of real and &quot;even&quot; functions. See the DCT article for a general discussion of how the boundary conditions relate the various DCT and DST types. Generally, the DST is derived from the DCT by replacing the Neumann condition at &quot;x&quot;=0 with a Dirichlet condition. Both the DCT and the DST were described by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan, and K.R. Rao in 1974. The type-I DST (DST-I) was later described by Anil K. Jain in 1976, and the type-II DST (DST-II) was then described by H.B. Kekra and J.K. Solanka in 1978.

==Applications==
DSTs are widely employed in solving partial differential equations by spectral methods, where the different variants of the DST correspond to slightly different odd/even boundary conditions at the two ends of the array.

==Informal overview==
Like any Fourier-related transform, discrete sine transforms (DSTs) express a function or a signal in terms of a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies and amplitudes. Like the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a DST operates on a function at a finite number of discrete data points. The obvious distinction between a DST and a DFT is that the former uses only sine functions, while the latter uses both cosines and sines (in the form of complex exponentials). However, this visible difference is merely a consequence of a deeper distinction: a DST implies different boundary conditions than the DFT or other related transforms.

The Fourier-related transforms that operate on a function over a finite domain, such as the DFT or DST or a Fourier series, can be thought of as implicitly defining an &quot;extension&quot; of that function outside the domain. That is, once you write a function formula_1 as a sum of sinusoids, you can evaluate that sum at any formula_2, even for formula_2 where the original formula_1 was not specified. The DFT, like the Fourier series, implies a periodic extension of the original function. A DST, like a sine transform, implies an odd extension of the original function.

However, because DSTs operate on &quot;finite&quot;, &quot;discrete&quot; sequences, two issues arise that do not apply for the continuous sine transform. First, one has to specify whether the function is even or odd at &quot;both&quot; the left and right boundaries of the domain (i.e. the min-&quot;n&quot; and max-&quot;n&quot; boundaries in the definitions below, respectively). Second, one has to specify around &quot;what point&quot; the function is even or odd. In particular, consider a sequence (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) of three equally spaced data points, and say that we specify an odd &quot;left&quot; boundary. There are two sensible possibilities: either the data is odd about the point &quot;prior&quot; to &quot;a&quot;, in which case the odd extension is (−&quot;c&quot;,−&quot;b&quot;,−&quot;a&quot;,0,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), or the data is odd about the point &quot;halfway&quot; between &quot;a&quot; and the previous point, in which case the odd extension is (−&quot;c&quot;,−&quot;b&quot;,−&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)

These choices lead to all the standard variations of DSTs and also discrete cosine transforms (DCTs). Each boundary can be either even or odd (2 choices per boundary) and can be symmetric about a data point or the point halfway between two data points (2 choices per boundary), for a total of formula_5 possibilities. Half of these possibilities, those where the &quot;left&quot; boundary is odd, correspond to the 8 types of DST; the other half are the 8 types of DCT.

These different boundary conditions strongly affect the applications of the transform, and lead to uniquely useful properties for the various DCT types. Most directly, when using Fourier-related transforms to solve partial differential equations by spectral methods, the boundary conditions are directly specified as a part of the problem being solved.

==Definition==
Formally, the discrete sine transform is a linear, invertible function &quot;F&quot; : R&quot;N&quot; R&quot;N&quot; (where R denotes the set of real numbers), or equivalently an &quot;N&quot; × &quot;N&quot; square matrix. There are several variants of the DST with slightly modified definitions. The &quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;x&quot;0...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot; − 1 are transformed into the &quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;X&quot;0...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot; − 1 according to one of the formulas:

===DST-I===
:formula_6

The DST-I matrix is orthogonal (up to a scale factor).

A DST-I is exactly equivalent to a DFT of a real sequence that is odd around the zero-th and middle points, scaled by 1/2. For example, a DST-I of &quot;N&quot;=3 real numbers (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) is exactly equivalent to a DFT of eight real numbers (0,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,0,−&quot;c&quot;,−&quot;b&quot;,−&quot;a&quot;) (odd symmetry), scaled by 1/2. (In contrast, DST types II–IV involve a half-sample shift in the equivalent DFT.) This is the reason for the &quot;N&quot; + 1 in the denominator of the sine function: the equivalent DFT has 2(&quot;N&quot;+1) points and has 2π/2(&quot;N&quot;+1) in its sinusoid frequency, so the DST-I has π/(&quot;N&quot;+1) in its frequency.

Thus, the DST-I corresponds to the boundary conditions: &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is odd around &quot;n&quot; = −1 and odd around &quot;n&quot;=&quot;N&quot;; similarly for &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

===DST-II===
formula_7

Some authors further multiply the &quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot; − 1 term by 1/ (see below for the corresponding change in DST-III). This makes the DST-II matrix orthogonal (up to a scale factor), but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-odd DFT of half-shifted input.

The DST-II implies the boundary conditions: &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is odd around &quot;n&quot; = −1/2 and odd around &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot; − 1/2; &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; is odd around &quot;k&quot; = −1 and even around &quot;k&quot; = &quot;N&quot; − 1.

===DST-III===
formula_8

Some authors further multiply the &quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot; − 1 term by (see above for the corresponding change in DST-II). This makes the DST-III matrix orthogonal (up to a scale factor), but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-odd DFT of half-shifted output.

The DST-III implies the boundary conditions: &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is odd around &quot;n&quot; = −1 and even around &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot; − 1; &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; is odd around &quot;k&quot; = −1/2 and odd around &quot;k&quot; = &quot;N&quot; − 1/2.

===DST-IV===
formula_9

The DST-IV matrix is orthogonal (up to a scale factor).

The DST-IV implies the boundary conditions: &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is odd around &quot;n&quot; = −1/2 and even around &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot; − 1/2; similarly for &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

===DST V–VIII===
DST types I–IV are equivalent to real-odd DFTs of even order. In principle, there are actually four additional types of discrete sine transform (Martucci, 1994), corresponding to real-odd DFTs of logically odd order, which have factors of &quot;N&quot;+1/2 in the denominators of the sine arguments. However, these variants seem to be rarely used in practice.

===Inverse transforms===
The inverse of DST-I is DST-I multiplied by 2/(&quot;N&quot; + 1). The inverse of DST-IV is DST-IV multiplied by 2/&quot;N&quot;. The inverse of DST-II is DST-III multiplied by 2/&quot;N&quot; (and vice versa).

As for the DFT, the normalization factor in front of these transform definitions is merely a convention and differs between treatments. For example, some authors multiply the transforms by formula_10 so that the inverse does not require any additional multiplicative factor.

==Computation==
Although the direct application of these formulas would require O(&quot;N&quot;2) operations, it is possible to compute the same thing with only O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) complexity by factorizing the computation similar to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). (One can also compute DSTs via FFTs combined with O(&quot;N&quot;) pre- and post-processing steps.)

A DST-III or DST-IV can be computed from a DCT-III or DCT-IV (see discrete cosine transform), respectively, by reversing the order of the inputs and flipping the sign of every other output, and vice versa for DST-II from DCT-II. In this way it follows that types II–IV of the DST require exactly the same number of arithmetic operations (additions and multiplications) as the corresponding DCT types.

==Generalizations==

A family of transforms composed of sine and sine hyperbolic functions exists; these transforms are made based on the natural vibration of thin square plates with different boundary conditions.

<text>Shout at the Devil is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, released on September 23, 1983. It was the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, establishing Mötley Crüe as one of the top selling heavy metal acts of the 1980s. The singles &quot;Looks That Kill&quot; and &quot;Too Young to Fall in Love&quot; were moderate hits for the band.

==Overview==
&quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; was Mötley Crüe&#x27;s breakthrough success, selling 200,000 copies in its first two weeks. The album&#x27;s title and the band&#x27;s use of a pentagram caused a great deal of controversy upon its 1983 release, as Christian and conservative groups claimed the band was encouraging their listeners to worship Satan. The pentagram was something Nikki Sixx brought with him from Sister, a very theatrical band he had been a member of (along with future W.A.S.P. vocalist Blackie Lawless) in the late 1970s prior to the formation of Mötley Crüe. Sister fused occult symbolism such as the Pentagram into a theatrical heavy metal show incorporating blood and facial makeup. Sixx asked Lawless for permission to use some of Sister&#x27;s occult-related imagery for &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, as at that point Lawless was intent on moving in a different direction. &quot;I said &#x27;take whatever you want&#x27; because at that point, I realised that with an image like that, you end up painting yourself in a corner and you can&#x27;t get out,&quot; said Lawless.

Just prior to returning home to Los Angeles to begin recording the album, Mötley Crüe was famously kicked off their support spot on Kiss&#x27; &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; tour. The bands played only five shows together before Gene Simmons demanded they be replaced, citing their &quot;bad behavior&quot;.

During recording, bassist Sixx was involved in a serious car crash after drunkenly stealing a friend&#x27;s Porsche in Los Angeles. At around the same time, actress and friend Demi Moore told Sixx he needed Alcoholics Anonymous, though Sixx dismissed her concerns. Sixx badly injured his shoulder in the crash and was prescribed Percocet, a combination of acetaminophen and the powerful opioid oxycodone which was commonly prescribed to treat severe short-term pain. Sixx&#x27;s use of Percocet transitioned directly to a crippling addiction to heroin which would cost him $3,500 a day and almost claim his life later in the decade.

As the band toured with Ozzy Osbourne in support of &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, they discussed replacing guitarist Mick Mars. Mars was several years older than the other members of the band, and his bandmates were eager to add a more technically proficient guitarist in the vein of Yngwie Malmsteen. Bob Daisley, Osbourne&#x27;s bassist, was present during the tour-bus discussion and told the band &quot;do not try to fix something that isn&#x27;t broken&quot; when asked for his opinion. Daisley has said the band was serious at that time about replacing the guitarist. &quot;They didn&#x27;t have the balls&quot;, Mars said when asked about the prospect of being replaced. &quot;But one day at rehearsal they went, &#x27;Jake E. Lee would look good right here.&#x27; I went, &#x27;I&#x27;m the guitar player in the band. Nobody else needs to be there.&#x27;&quot;

As the tour continued, the band was invited to take part in the 1984 Monsters of Rock festival supporting Van Halen and headliners AC/DC. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen was bitten by Vince Neil during a dinner, with drummer Tommy Lee also biting Malcolm Young at some point. Van Halen and Young were both reportedly furious over this behaviour. Lee also became involved in a fistfight with David Lee Roth which saw Mötley Crüe expelled from their hotel. AC/DC and Van Halen both subsequently demanded Mötley Crüe be removed from the bill, but the band&#x27;s popularity at that time made such a move difficult. The promoter came up with an unusual solution: Mötley Crüe would enter their trailer immediately upon arrival at the concert venue, and a large crane would then lift the trailer several meters off the ground to prevent the band members from leaving and causing trouble prior to their performance. They would also be required to leave the concert venue immediately following their performance. &quot;You apologized every day&quot;, said manager Doc McGhee of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s behaviour during this period, which eventually resulted in him having to pay a $15,000 deposit before any hotel would allow the band to stay. McGhee also established a rule in which each band member would submit to him a list of everything they had destroyed in a hotel before he&#x27;d allow them to check out.

It was an article published in the June 1984 issue of &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine that brought the band&#x27;s shocking antics to national attention for the first time. Andy Secher, the magazine&#x27;s editor, traveled to Mexico for an interview with the band and was shocked to find &quot;this young woman, spread eagle on the bed, naked, and they&#x27;re going at her with a wine bottle&quot;. Though Secher had to heavily sanitize the story before it could be printed, the depiction of the band&#x27;s behaviour nonetheless shocked America and created a firestorm of controversy which saw some retailers threaten to remove the magazine from its shelves. The magazine not only survived, but soon saw its readership increase dramatically, with Secher saying &quot;We happened to hit perfectly with Mötley Crüe. That June issue was on the stands in April, just when &quot;Shout At The Devil&quot; was peaking.&quot;

&quot;Looks That Kill&quot; was a moderate hit for the band and played a large role in exposing the band to a wider audience. The music video produced for the song was shot over the course of an 18-hour day on the main sound stage at A&amp;M Records in Los Angeles. Model Wendy Barry, who portrayed the &quot;warrior princess&quot; in the &quot;Looks That Kill&quot; music video, has said her experience with the band was very positive, describing Mötley Crüe as &quot;all very nice. Really down-to-earth and fun&quot;, in stark contrast with their growing reputation for depravity. While Barry acknowledges the music video &quot;generated a stir&quot;, she later said of it &quot;I personally thought it was just a well-executed video as far as production, and the song was killer.&quot; A year later Barry would appear again with Sixx and Lee in the music video for Ratt&#x27;s &quot;Back For More&quot;.
The song &quot;Bastard&quot; was targeted by Tipper Gore and the PMRC, who were behind the move to have warning labels placed on albums with lyrics or other content they found disturbing. According to Mick Mars, the song wasn&#x27;t a call to violence but rather was about &quot;a certain person that we used to work with that we felt we were stabbed in the back by.&quot;

&quot;Knock &#x27;Em Dead, Kid&quot; was inspired by a violent encounter between Sixx and a group of Hells Angels. Sixx somehow wound up in a fight with a group of bikers, even hitting one member in the face with a chain he had been wearing as a belt. The Hells Angels turned out to be undercover cops, and the bassist was subsequently badly beaten and jailed, resulting in a black eye and broken cheekbone. After being released from jail, he was inspired to write a song about the ordeal.

The album also features a cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1968 song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, a song that allegedly inspired cult leader Charles Manson. Sixx was not a Beatles&#x27; fan, referring to the band as &quot;fucking wimpy&quot;, but he lists &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;The White Album&quot; among his favorites of all time.

==Reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau panned &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; and felt the band&#x27;s commercial appeal lay in false braggadocio on an album that is poor &quot;even by heavy metal standards&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s J. D. Considine found their style of rock formulaic, innocuous, and unoriginal: &quot;The whole point of bands like Motley Crue is to provide cheap thrills to jaded teens, and that&#x27;s where the album ultimately disappoints.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), he dismissed the music as &quot;a distressingly mild-mannered distillation of Kiss and Aerosmith clichés&quot;. In 2017, the same magazine would later go on to rank the album at 44th, in the list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. On the contrary, Dave Constable of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; wrote that Mötley Crüe had &quot;possibly come up with the major label metal LP of &#x27;83.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Barry Weber was more positive in a retrospective review, referring to the album as their best, displaying Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;sleazy and notorious (yet quite entertaining) metal at its best.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; inferior to Mötley&#x27;s debut album, but found its music extremely addictive if unoriginal, calling it &quot;punk rocking lobotomy metal&quot;. Adrian Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the album a sleazy and menacing &quot;timeless L.A. metal classic&quot;. In his opinion, the album contained the band&#x27;s best singles and &quot;remains to this day Mötley Crüe&#x27;s finest hour&quot;.

Ultimate Classic Rock&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia gave much praise to the album calling it the, &quot;ultimate L.A. glam metal album&quot;, and called the band, &quot;the first heavy metal band to truly cross over from the male to female audience, which automatically doubled the band’s fan-base-building prospects&quot;.

&quot;Without this album, a lot of the great hair metal bands wouldn&#x27;t have come about,&quot; observed Satchel of Steel Panther. &quot;&quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; was more of their glam look, but &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; was such a great record. It was fuckin&#x27; sick. They set the bar. People looked at that and said, &#x27;Fuck, we gotta dress up cool, man.&#x27;

&quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; peaked at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The singles &quot;Looks That Kill&quot; and &quot;Too Young to Fall in Love&quot;, peaked at No.54 and No.90 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1984, while &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; peaked at No. 30 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album was awarded 4× Platinum (reaching the four million mark in shipments) on May 15, 1997.

&quot;When a band like us put out &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;,&quot; Sixx observed in 2000, &quot;and the label does zero marketing, zero publicity and takes zero trade adverts, and you sell five million records, then everybody starts patting themselves on the back. But it&#x27;s Mötley Crüe that did that, not Elektra Records.&quot;

==Track listing==
===Original release===

===2003 remastered edition===
In 2003, the band re-issued their albums on their own label Mötley Records, including added bonus tracks from each album&#x27;s specific era. The bonus tracks of the remastered edition of &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; are mainly composed of demos, but include also the previously unreleased song &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, which was recorded in the same sessions. The song &quot;Black Widow&quot;, included in the &quot;Red, White &amp; Crüe&quot; compilation, was also recorded and left off this album. The track &quot;Hotter than Hell&quot; was later renamed and re-recorded into &quot;Louder Than Hell&quot; on the &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; album. This edition also sports a warning that the album may contain masked backwards messages. This is in reference to Sixx and Lee chanting &quot;Jesus is Satan&quot; as an underdub on the title track.

A limited edition &quot;Mini-LP&quot; Compact Disc version of the album was released in the Japanese market, featuring the original cover that was previously available only on the vinyl LP release.

<text>The carrion crow (Corvus corone) is a passerine bird of the family Corvidae, native to western Europe and the eastern Palearctic.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The carrion crow was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and it still bears its original name of &quot;Corvus corone&quot;. The binomial name is derived from the Latin , &quot;raven&quot;, and Greek , &quot;crow&quot;.

The hooded crow (&quot;Corvus cornix&quot;), formerly regarded as a subspecies, has been split off as a separate species, and there is some discussion whether the eastern carrion crow (&quot;C. c. orientalis&quot;) is distinct enough to warrant specific status; the two taxa are well separated, and it has been proposed they could have evolved independently in the wetter, maritime regions at the opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass.

Along with the hooded crow, the carrion crow occupies a similar ecological niche in Eurasia to the American crow (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;) in North America. The two species look very similar to one another, but can be differentiated by size, as the carrion crow is larger and of a stockier build compared to the American crow.

==Description==

The plumage of the carrion crow is black with a green or purple sheen, much greener than the gloss of the rook (&quot;Corvus frugilegus&quot;). The bill, legs and feet are also black. It can be distinguished from the common raven by its size of around in length as compared to an average of for ravens, and from the hooded crow by its black plumage. The carrion crow has a wingspan of and weighs .

Juvenile carrion crows can be identified by their brownish plumage and blue eyes, both of which darken to black and brown as the crow grows older.

==Distribution and genetic relationship to hooded crows==

The carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) and hooded crow (&quot;Corvus cornix&quot;), including the former&#x27;s slightly larger allied form or race &quot;C. c. orientalis&quot;, are two very closely related species; the geographic distributions of both forms of carrion crow across Europe are illustrated in the accompanying diagram. It is believed that this distribution might have resulted from the glaciation cycles during the Pleistocene, which caused the parent population to split into isolates which subsequently re-expanded their ranges when the climate warmed causing secondary contact.

Poelstra and coworkers sequenced almost the entire genomes of both species in populations at varying distances from the contact zone to find that the two species were genetically identical, both in their DNA and in its expression (in the form of &quot;m&quot;RNA), except for the &quot;lack of expression&quot; of a small portion (&lt;0.28%) of the genome (situated on avian chromosome 18) in the hooded crow, which imparts the lighter plumage colouration on its torso. Thus the two species can viably hybridize, and occasionally do so at the contact zone, but the all-black carrion crows on the one side of the contact zone mate almost exclusively with other all-black carrion crows, while the same occurs among the hooded crows on the other side of the contact zone.

It is therefore clear that it is only the outward appearance of the two species that inhibits hybridization. The authors attribute this to assortative mating (rather than to ecological selection), the advantage of which is not clear, and it would lead to the rapid appearance of streams of new lineages, and possibly even species, through mutual attraction between mutants. Unnikrishnan and Akhila propose, instead, that koinophilia is a more parsimonious explanation for the resistance to hybridization across the contact zone, despite the absence of physiological, anatomical or genetic barriers to such hybridization. The carrion crow is also found in the mountains and forests of Japan and also in the cities of Japan.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The rook is generally gregarious and the crow largely solitary, but rooks occasionally nest in isolated trees, and crows may feed with rooks; moreover, crows are often sociable in winter roosts. The most distinctive feature is the voice. The rook has a high-pitched &quot;kaaa&quot;, but the crow&#x27;s guttural, slightly vibrant, deeper croaked &quot;kraa&quot; is distinct from any note of the rook.

The carrion crow is noisy, perching on a vantage point such as a building or the top of a tree and calling three or four times in quick succession, with a slight pause between each series of croaks. During each series of calls, a crow may perform an accompanying gesture, raising its shoulders and bowing its head and neck downwards with each caw. The wing-beats are slower, more deliberate than those of the rook.

Carrion crows can become tame near humans, and can often be found near areas of human activity or habitation including cities, moors, woodland, sea cliffs and farmland where they compete with other social birds such as gulls, other corvids, and ducks for food in parks and gardens.

Like other species of corvid, carrion crows will actively harass predators and competitors that enter their territory or threaten them or their offspring, and will engage in group mobbing behaviour as a method to defend themselves.

=== Intelligence ===
Like all corvids, carrion crows are very intelligent. For example, they can discriminate between numerosities up to 30, flexibly switch between rules, and recognise human and crow faces. Given the difference in brain architecture in crows compared to primates, these abilities suggest that their intelligence is realised as a product of convergent evolution.

===Diet===

Though an eater of carrion of all kinds, the carrion crow will eat insects, earthworms, other invertebrates, grain, fruits, seeds, nuts, small mammals, amphibians, fish, scraps and will also steal eggs. Crows are scavengers by nature, which is why they tend to frequent sites inhabited by humans in order to feed on their household waste. Crows will also harass birds of prey or even foxes for their kills. Crows actively hunt and occasionally co-operate with other crows to make kills, and are sometimes seen catching ducklings for food. Due to their gregarious lifestyle and defensive abilities, carrion crows have few natural predators. However, powerful raptors such as the Eurasian goshawk, peregrine falcon, Eurasian eagle-owl and golden eagle will readily hunt them, and crows can become an important prey item locally.

===Nesting===

The bulky stick nest is usually placed in a tall tree, but cliff ledges, old buildings and pylons may be used as well. Nests are also occasionally placed on or near the ground. The nest resembles that of the common raven, but is less bulky. The 3 to 4 brown-speckled blue or greenish eggs are incubated for 18–20 days by the female alone, who is fed by the male. The young fledge after 29–30 days.
It is not uncommon for an offspring from the previous years to stay around and help rear the new hatchlings. Instead of seeking out a mate, it looks for food and assists the parents in feeding the young.

<text>The hooded crow (Corvus cornix), also called the scald-crow or hoodie, is a Eurasian bird species in the genus &quot;Corvus&quot;. Widely distributed, it is found across Northern, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe, as well as parts of the Middle East. It is an ashy grey bird with black head, throat, wings, tail, and thigh feathers, as well as a black bill, eyes, and feet. Like other corvids, it is an omnivorous and opportunistic forager and feeder.

The hooded crow is so similar in morphology and habits to the carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) that for many years they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized.

==Taxonomy==
The hooded crow was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;; he gave it the binomial name &quot;Corvus cornix&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;Europa&quot;, but this was restricted to Sweden by the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert in 1903. The genus name &quot;Corvus&quot; is Latin for &quot;raven&quot; while the specific epithet &quot;cornix&quot; is Latin for &quot;crow&quot;. The hooded crow was subsequently considered a subspecies of the carrion crow for many years, hence known as &quot;Corvus corone cornix&quot;, due to similarities in structure and habits. &quot;Hooded crow&quot; has been designated as the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). It is locally known as a &#x27;hoodie craw&#x27; or simply &#x27;hoodie&#x27; in Scotland and as a grey crow in Northern Ireland. It is also known locally as &quot;Scotch crow&quot; and &quot;Danish crow&quot;. In Irish, it is called , or the &quot;grey crow&quot;, as its name also means in the Slavic languages and in Danish. It is referred to as the &quot;fog crow&quot; (&#x27;) in German, and the &quot;dolman crow&quot; (&#x27;) in Hungarian.

===Subspecies===
Four subspecies of the hooded crow are now recognised; previously, all were considered subspecies of &quot;Corvus corone&quot;. A fifth subspecies, &quot;C. c. sardonius&quot; (Kleinschmidt, 1903) has been listed, although it has been alternately partitioned between &quot;C. c. sharpii&quot; (most populations), &quot;C. c. cornix&quot; (Corsican population), and the Middle Eastern &quot;C. c. pallescens&quot;. 

* &quot;C. c. cornix&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – the nominate race, occurs in Britain, Ireland and the rest of Europe south to Corsica.
* &quot;C. c. sharpii&quot; Oates, 1889 – named for English zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe. This is a paler grey form found from western Siberia through to the Caucasus region and Iran.
* &quot;C. c. pallescens&quot; (Madarász, 1904) – found in Turkey and Egypt, and is a paler form as its name suggests.
*&quot;C. c. capellanus&quot; Sclater, PL, 1877 – sometimes considered a separate species. This distinctive form occurs in Iraq and southwestern Iran. It has very pale grey plumage, which looks almost white from a distance. It is possibly distinct enough to be considered a separate species.

===Genetic difference from carrion crows===
 The hooded crow (&quot;Corvus cornix&quot;) and carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) are two closely related species whose geographical distribution across Europe is illustrated in the accompanying diagram. It is believed that this distribution might have resulted from the glaciation cycles during the Pleistocene, which caused the parent population to split into isolates which subsequently re-expanded their ranges when the climate warmed causing secondary contact. Jelmer Poelstra and coworkers sequenced almost the entire genomes of both species in populations at varying distances from the contact zone to find that the two species were nearly genetically identical, both in their DNA and in its expression (in the form of &quot;m&quot;RNA), except for the &quot;lack of expression&quot; of a small portion (&lt;0.28%) of the genome (situated on avian chromosome 18) in the hooded crow, which imparts the lighter plumage colouration on its torso. Thus the two species can viably hybridize, and occasionally do so at the contact zone, but the all-black carrion crows on the one side of the contact zone mate almost exclusively with other all-black carrion crows, while the same occurs among the hooded crows on the other side of the contact zone. They concluded that it was only the outward appearance of the two species that inhibits hybridization.

==Description==

Except for the head, throat, wings, tail, and thigh feathers, which are black and mostly glossy, the plumage of the hooded crow is ash-grey, with the dark shafts giving it a streaky appearance. The bill and legs are black; the iris dark brown. Only one moult occurs, in autumn, as in other crow species. Male hooded crows tend to be larger than females, although the two sexes are otherwise similar in appearance. Their flight is slow, heavy and usually straight. Their length varies from . When first hatched, the young are much blacker than the parents. Juveniles have duller plumage with bluish or greyish eyes, and initially possess a red mouth. Wingspan is and weight is on average 510 g.

The hooded crow, with its contrasted greys and blacks, is visually distinct from both the carrion crow and the rook, but the call notes of the hooded and carrion crows are almost indistinguishable.

==Distribution==
The hooded crow breeds in northern and eastern Europe, and closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and western Asia. Where its range overlaps with that of the carrion crow, as in northern Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds (one of the reasons behind its reclassification as a distinct species from the carrion crow). 

In the British Isles, the hooded crow breeds regularly in Scotland, the Isle of Man, and the Scottish Islands; it also breeds widely in Ireland. In autumn, some migratory birds arrive on the east coast of Britain. In the past, this was a more common visitor.

==Behaviour==
===Diet===
The hooded crow is omnivorous, with a diet similar to that of the carrion crow, and is a constant scavenger. It drops molluscs and crabs to break them after the manner of the carrion crow, to the point that an old Scottish name for empty sea urchin shells was &quot;crow&#x27;s cups&quot;. On coastal cliffs, the eggs of gulls, cormorants, and other birds are stolen when their owners are absent, and hooded crows will enter the burrows of puffins to steal eggs. It will also feed on small mammals, scraps, smaller birds, and carrion. The hooded crow often hides food to feed on later, especially meat, nuts, and any insects that may be present on these, in places such as rain gutters, flower pots, or in the earth under bushes. Other crows will often watch a crow that hides food and then search the hiding place later when the first crow has left.

===Nesting===

Nesting occurs later in colder regions: mid-May to mid-June in northwest Russia, Shetland, and the Faroe Islands, and late February in the Persian Gulf region. In warmer parts of the European Archipelago, the clutch is laid in April. The bulky stick nest is normally placed in a tall tree, but cliff ledges, old buildings, and pylons may be used. Nests are occasionally placed on or near the ground. The nest resembles that of the carrion crow, but on the coast, seaweed is often interwoven in the structure, and animal bones and wire are also frequently incorporated. The four to six brown-speckled blue eggs are in size and weigh , of which 6% is shell. The altricial young are incubated for 17–19 days by the female alone, that is fed by the male. They fledge after 32 to 36 days. Incubating females have been reported to obtain most of their own food and later that for their young.

The typical lifespan is unknown, but that of the carrion crow is four years. The maximum recorded age for a hooded crow is 16 years, and 9 months.

This species is a secondary host of the parasitic great spotted cuckoo, the European magpie being the preferred host. However, in areas where the latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the hooded crow becomes the normal corvid host.

This species, like its relative, is regularly killed by farmers and on grouse estates. In County Cork, Ireland, the county&#x27;s gun clubs shot over 23,000 hooded crows in two years in the early 1980s. Since 1981, they have been protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, meaning it is illegal to knowingly kill, injure, or capture them.

==Status==
The IUCN Red List does not distinguish the hooded crow from the carrion crow, but the two species together have an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as least concern. The carrion crow and hooded crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the hooded crow has on the order of three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia). This movement is also attested to by the fact that in April 2020 the hooded crow was redlisted in Sweden, where the Species Information Centre does distinguish between hooded and carrion crow.

==Cultural significance==
In Irish folklore, the bird appears on the shoulder of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.

The old name of Royston crow originates from the days when this bird was a common winter visitor to southern England, with the sheep fields around Royston, Hertfordshire providing carcasses on which the birds could feed. The local newspaper, founded in 1855, is called &quot;The Royston Crow&quot;, and the hooded crow also features on the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

The hooded crow is one of the 37 Norwegian birds depicted in the Bird Room of the Royal Palace in Oslo. Jethro Tull mentions the hooded crow on the song &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot; as a bonus track on the digitally remastered version of &quot;Broadsword and the Beast&quot; and on their &quot;The Christmas Album&quot;.

In January 2014, a hooded crow and a yellow-legged gull each attacked one of two peace doves which Pope Francis had allowed children to release in Vatican City.

<doc id="196117" wikidata="Q161386" url="?curid=196117" title="Prenuptial agreement">
<text>A prenuptial agreement, antenuptial agreement, or premarital agreement (commonly referred to as a prenup), is a written contract entered into by a couple before marriage or a civil union that enables them to select and control many of the legal rights they acquire upon marrying, and what happens when their marriage ends by death or divorce. Couples enter into a written prenuptial agreement to supersede many of the default marital laws that would otherwise apply in the event of divorce, such as the laws that govern the division of property, retirement benefits, savings, and the right to seek alimony (spousal support) with agreed-upon terms that provide certainty and clarify their marital rights. A premarital agreement may also contain waivers of a surviving spouse&#x27;s right to claim an elective share of the estate of the deceased spouse.

In some countries, including the United States, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the prenuptial agreement not only provides for what happens in the event of a divorce but also protects some property during the marriage, for instance in case of bankruptcy. Many countries, including Canada, France, Italy, and Germany, have matrimonial regimes, in addition to, or in some cases, instead of prenuptial agreements.

Postnuptial agreements are similar to prenuptial agreements, except that they are entered into after a couple is married. When divorce is imminent, postnuptial agreements are referred to as separation agreements.

==Legal recognition==
Laws vary between states and countries in what content they may contain and under what conditions and circumstances a prenuptial agreement may be declared unenforceable, such as an agreement signed under fraud, duress, or without adequate disclosure of assets.

===Africa===
====South Africa====

In South Africa, a civil marriage or civil union is, by default, a marriage in a community of property. To marry out of the community of property, the parties must sign an antenuptial contract in the presence of a notary public before their marriage and the contract must be registered in the Deeds Office within three months from the date of signature of the contract.

When marrying out of the community, the parties have a choice to marry &quot;with application of the accrual system&quot; or without application of the accrual system.

If the parties marry without accrual, the spouses&#x27; respective estates would always remain separate and neither party will have any proprietary claim against the other by the marriage.

If the parties marry with application of the accrual, their respective estates would remain separate during the subsistence of the marriage. Upon dissolution of the marriage, whether by death or divorce, the spouse with the lesser accrual would have a claim against the spouse with the larger accrual for half the difference between their accrual values.

===Asia===
====India====
In India, prenuptial agreements are very rare and do not have any governing laws. However, with rising divorce rates, people are showing increasing interest in them. Some lawyers think that prenups don&#x27;t have legal sanctity in India. However, some form of contract is signed in some cases, usually among affluent citizens. But, the agreements need to be reasonable and not violate pre-existing laws like the Hindu Marriage Act. Indian courts allow a memorandum of settlement to be signed during divorces. But, no court has yet been asked to enforce a prenup.

These agreements may come under the Indian Contract Act of 1872. Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act states that agreements are to be considered contracts if they are made with the free consent of the parties. However, Section 23 of the same act states that a contract may be void if they are immoral or against public policy.

Goa is the only Indian state where a prenuptial is legally enforceable, as it follows the Portuguese Civil Code, of 1867. A prenuptial agreement may be signed between the two parties at the time of marriage, stating the regime of ownership. If a prenuptial has not been signed, then the marital property is simply divided equally between the husband and wife.

====Hong Kong====
Pre and post-nuptial Agreements in Hong Kong can be of “magnetic importance” in deciding the parties’ claims for ancillary relief. The leading case of SPH v SA in Hong Kong’s highest court, the Court of Final Appeal followed the earlier English Supreme Court decision of &quot;Radmacher v Granatino&quot;. That was perhaps unsurprising as one of the Judges in Radmacher (Lord Collins) also sat in Hong Kong as an NPJ. (Similarly, the successful leading counsel for Frau Radmacher, Richard Todd QC was also leading counsel for Madame S. in SPH v SA).

====Thailand====

The prenuptial agreement in Thailand is concluded by mutual consent of the man and woman who want to marry. Under Thai law, a prenuptial agreement is recognized by the Commercial and Civil Code of Thailand. A valid and enforceable Thai prenuptial agreement legally requires that

* The content of the prenuptial made in Thailand cannot be against the law or good morals;
* Both the prospective husband and wife must understand the content of the prenuptial;
* The prenuptial in Thailand must be made before the marriage, a contract between husband and wife concerning personal and jointly owned property made after the marriage registration (post-nuptial) is void;
* Both the future husband and wife must sign the prenuptial in the presence of at least 2 witnesses and the agreement must be entered into the Marriage Register together with the marriage.

These conditions are found in clause 1466 of the Commercial and Civil Code of Thailand.&lt;br&gt;Following the laws on Thai marriage, the prenuptial agreement mainly relates to assets and financial implications of marriage and establishes conditions of ownership and management of personal and concrete joint property and potential division of marital assets, if the marriage will be dissolved. The prenuptial agreement also includes a list of each side&#x27;s assets at the time of the marriage and guarantees, that debts and property before the marriage remain in possession of the initial owner or debtor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personal property includes:
(Mostly described at clause 1471 of the Commercial and Civil Code of Thailand):
* property owned by spouses before the marriage;
* property for personal use — work instruments, clothes, etc.;
* gifts from third parties or property received through the testament (if it is not indicated in the testament, that property should transfer to joint property of spouses);
* &quot;khongman&quot; — real estate transmitted to the bride which is different from a dowry, or sinsod, which is paid to the parents of the bride.
* a transfer of personal property to another property during marriage will normally remain personal property. Just be careful about real estate as in Thailand, it causes a problem and the conflict of law act explain these.

The joint property includes:
* property acquired at the time of the marriage;
* property received by one of the spouses at the time of the marriage as a gift, if in the document attached to a gift or in the document compiled by the spouse, this property was declared as joint (Marital Assets);
* income acquired from personal property as stated by clause 1474 of the Thai and Commercial Civil Code.

===Europe===
Prenuptial agreements have long been recognized as valid in several European countries, such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. While in some of these countries, there are limits on what restrictions the courts will see as enforceable or valid (e.g. Germany after 2001, where appeals courts have indicated this) a written and properly initiated contract, freely agreed upon, cannot be challenged by, for instance, invoking the circumstances under which the marriage broke down or the conduct of either part. In France, The Netherlands and Belgium (as in Quebec, which has the same judicial tradition) prenuptial agreements must be set up in the presence of a notary.

In many of the countries mentioned, pre-nuptials may also protect the non-shared property and money from being pulled into bankruptcy and can serve to support lawsuits and settlements during the marriage (for instance if one part has sold or wrongfully mortgaged a piece of property that had been set aside by his/her partner).

====Ukraine====
Under provisions of Section 10 of the Family Code of Ukraine, marriage relationships, rights, and duties of spouses can be regulated by a marriage contract as well if spouses wish to settle their property relations in another manner then it is provided by the Family Code of Ukraine.

A marriage (prenuptial) contract can be concluded by a woman and a man, who applied for registration of their marriage as well as by spouses. An underaged person, who wants to conclude a marriage contract before registration of the marriage, is to have the signed consent of his/her parent or custodian certified by a notary.

Numerous provisions of this section of the Family Code of Ukraine provide quite extensive requirements regarding the form and contents of the marriage contract and the procedural issues of making the same are regulated by appropriate Instruction of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine regarding the procedure of notarization of marriage contracts as well as far as notarization is required.

Imperative requirements regarding the content of the marriage contract are provided by clause 93 of the Family Code of Ukraine, which states that the marriage contract governs property relations between spouses, and determines their property rights and duties. A marriage contract can also determine the property rights and duties of spouses as parents but with certain limitations. Personal relations of spouses cannot be regulated by the marriage contract, as well as personal relations between spouses and their children. This rule is also provided by clause 93 of the Family Code of Ukraine. Marriage contracts, which reduce the rights of children and put one of the spouses in a poor material state, are not permitted by the above imperative regulation. Within the framework of the marriage contract, none of the spouses can acquire any immovable property or other property, which requires state registration.

====United Kingdom====
A prenuptial agreement is distinct from the historic marriage settlement which was concerned not primarily with the effects of divorce but with the establishment and maintenance of dynastic families, or a divorce settlement entered into by parties in connection with dissolving their marriage.

=====England and Wales=====
Prenuptial agreements historically had not been considered legally enforceable in England and Wales due to a reluctance on the part of the judiciary for public policy reasons.

The 2010 Supreme Court test case of &quot;Radmacher v Granatino&quot;, overturned the previous legal framework on them to recognise changing societal and judicial views on the personal autonomy of married partners. Pre-nuptial agreements can now be enforced by the courts as part of their discretion in financial settlement cases under section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 so long as the three-stage &quot;Radmacher&quot; test is met and it is considered fair to do so, keeping in mind the interests of any child of the family. &quot;Radmacher&quot; holds that the courts will give effect to a nuptial agreement that is freely entered into by each party with a full appreciation of its implications unless in the circumstances prevailing, it would not be fair to hold the parties to their agreement. The case provided substantial amounts of guidance relevant to all nuptial agreement cases that have occurred since 2010.

The Law Commission&#x27;s 2014 report on Matrimonial Property generally accepted the decision in &quot;Radmacher&quot; and recommended the creation of a &#x27;qualifying nuptial agreement&#x27; regime by Parliament which would create a completely binding pre-nuptial agreement so long as certain requirements were met. The Commission&#x27;s recommendations have yet to be implemented.

=====Scotland=====
In contrast to the rest of the United Kingdom, prenuptial agreements are generally regarded as being legally enforceable in Scotland.

=====Northern Ireland=====
The legal status of prenuptial agreements in Northern Ireland is similar to that in England and Wales, in that they are generally regarded as not being legally enforceable. However, since the ruling in &quot;Radmacher v Granatino&quot;, which also applied in Northern Ireland, the judiciary are more likely to hold parties to the terms of such agreements, unless doing so would be obviously unfair.

===North America===
====Canada====
Prenuptial agreements in Canada are governed by provincial legislation. Each province and territory in Canada recognize prenuptial agreements. For instance, in Ontario, prenuptial agreements are called marriage contracts and they are recognized by section 52 of the Family Law Act.

====United States====
In the United States, prenuptial agreements are recognized in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and they are enforceable if prepared by state and federal law requirements. It has been reported that the demand for prenuptial agreements in the United States has increased in recent years, particularly among millennial couples. In a 2016 survey conducted by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML), member attorneys reported seeing an increase, with the strongest interest in protecting increases in the value of the separate property, inheritances, and division of community property.

In the past, couples entered into premarital agreements with a level of uncertainty about their validity. Today, the presumptive validity and enforceability of such agreements in states that have adopted the UPAA/UPMAA including Florida, Virginia, New Jersey, and California, is no longer in question.

Currently, 28 States and the District of Columbia have adopted a version of the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (UPAA) or the updated Uniform Premarital Agreements Act (UPMAA). The UPAA was passed in 1983 by the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) to promote more uniformity and predictability between state laws relating to these contracts in an increasingly transient society. The UPAA was partly enacted to ensure that a prenup that was validly entered into in one state would be honored by the courts of another state where the couple might get a divorce. The UPMAA was subsequently promulgated in 2012 by the ULC to clarify and modernize inconsistent state laws and create a uniform approach to all prenuptial agreements and postnuptial agreements that:

# Requires marital agreements to be in writing and declares them to be enforceable without consideration, modernizing existing state laws;
# Offers couples a flexible framework for premarital agreements that promote responsible planning and informed decision-making; and
# Provides courts in every state a framework for determining an agreement&#x27;s validity, regardless of where it was executed.

The laws enacted by states adopting the UPAA/UPMAA do have some variances from state to state, but this framework of laws has certainly made it much easier for legal practitioners to prepare enforceable marital agreements for clients by clearly stating the requirements. For instance, under Florida law, there is a very material difference in what is required to enter into a legally binding prenuptial agreement versus a postnuptial agreement. To validly waive the spousal rights that would ordinarily be available to a surviving spouse under Florida law (such as homestead, elective share, exempt property, family allowance, etc.), the parties have to make a full and fair disclosure of their assets and liabilities to each other &quot;before&quot; entering into a postnuptial agreement. In contrast, no financial disclosure is required to waive those same spousal rights in a premarital agreement executed &quot;before&quot; marriage. That said, if the lack of disclosure results in a prenup being unconscionable (unfair to one spouse) under Florida&#x27;s Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, it may not be enforceable on those grounds.

Even in states that have not enacted the UPAA/UPMAA like New York, duly executed prenuptial agreements are accorded the same presumption of legality as any other contract. A couple signing a prenuptial agreement doesn&#x27;t need to retain separate attorneys to represent them, as long as each party understands the agreement and signs it voluntarily intending to be bound to its terms. There is a strong public policy favoring parties ordering and deciding their interests through contracts. There are no state or federal laws that force adults with contractual capacity to have to hire legal counsel to be able to enter into a marital contract such as a prenuptial agreement, except for a California law that requires that the parties be represented by counsel if spousal support (alimony) is limited by the agreement. A prenuptial agreement may be challenged if there is evidence that the contract was signed under duress. Whether a premarital agreement was signed under duress must be proven by the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, it has been held that a spouse&#x27;s claim that she believed that there would be no wedding if she did not sign a prenuptial agreement, where the wedding was only two weeks away and wedding plans had been made, was &quot;insufficient&quot; to demonstrate duress.

Prenuptial agreements may limit the parties&#x27; property and spousal support rights but also guarantee either party the right to seek or receive spousal support up to a certain limit. It may be impossible to set aside a properly drafted and executed prenup. A prenup can dictate not only what happens if the parties divorce, but also what happens when they die. They can act as a contract to make a will and/or eliminate all of one&#x27;s rights to property, probate homestead, probate allowance, right to take as a predetermined heir, and the right to act as an executor and administrator of one&#x27;s spouse&#x27;s estate.

A prenuptial agreement is only valid if it is completed before marriage. After a couple is married, they may draw up a post-nuptial agreement.

In most jurisdictions in the United States, five elements are required for a valid prenuptial agreement:

# The agreement must be in writing (oral prenups are generally unenforceable);
# Must be executed voluntarily;
# Full and/or fair disclosure at the time of execution;
# The agreement cannot be unconscionable;
# It must be executed by both parties (not their attorneys) and often notarized and/or witnessed.

There are several ways that a prenuptial agreement can be attacked in court. These include a lack of voluntariness, unconscionability, and a failure to disclose assets. Prenuptial agreements in all U.S. states are not allowed to regulate issues relating to the children of the marriage, in particular, custody and access issues. The reason behind this is that matters involving children must be decided in the children&#x27;s best interests. However, this is controversial: some people believe that as custody battles are often the worst part of a divorce, couples should be able to settle this in advance.

Courts will not enforce personal lifestyle requirements such as that one person will do all housework. Courts will not enforce, per the prenuptial contract other parental decisions such as the children being raised a certain religion, but may take this agreement into account in regards to future separation agreements. In recent years, some couples have included social media provisions in their prenuptial agreements, setting forth rules as to what is permissible to be posted on social media networks during the marriage, as well as in the event the marriage is dissolved.

A sunset provision may be inserted into a prenuptial agreement, specifying that after a certain amount of time, the agreement will expire. In Maine, for prenuptial agreements executed before October 1, 1993, unless the parties renew the agreement, it automatically lapses after the birth of a child. In other states, a certain number of years of marriage will cause a prenuptial agreement to lapse. In states that have adopted the UPAA (Uniform Premarital Agreement Act), no sunset provision is provided by statute, but one could be privately contracted for. Note that states have different versions of the UPAA.

Unlike all other contract law, consideration is not required, although a minority of courts point to the marriage itself as the consideration. Through a prenup, a spouse can completely waive rights to property, alimony, or inheritance as well as the elective share, and get nothing in return. Choice of law provisions is critical in prenups. Parties to the agreement can elect to have the law of the state they are married in govern both the interpretation of the agreement and how property is divided at the time of divorce. In the absence of a choice of law clause, it is the law of the place the parties divorce, not the law of the state they were married that decides property and support issues.

In drafting an agreement, it is important to recognize that there are two types of state laws that govern divorceequitable distribution, practiced by 41 states, and community property, practiced in some variation by 9 states. An agreement written in a community property state may not be designed to govern what occurs in an equitable distribution state and vice versa. It may be necessary to retain attorneys in both states to cover the possible eventuality that the parties may live in a state other than the state they were married. Often people have more than one home in different states or they move a lot because of their work so it is important to take that into account in the drafting process.

To financial issues ancillary to divorce, prenuptial agreements are routinely upheld and enforced by courts in virtually all states. There are circumstances in which courts have refused to enforce certain portions/provisions of such agreements. For example, in North Dakota, the divorce courts retain jurisdiction to modify a limitation on the right to seek alimony or spousal support in a premarital agreement if it would cause the spouse who waived such right to need public assistance at the time of divorce. Florida and several other states contain similar limitations to avoid a divorcing spouse from becoming a ward of the state upon divorce under a prenuptial agreement. Moreover, in Florida where the inheritance (elective share) and homestead rights granted to surviving spouses by state law are so strong, its Premarital Agreement Act requires that a waiver of surviving spouse rights outlined in a prenuptial agreement be executed with the same formality as a will to be enforceable (notarized and witnessed by two disinterested parties).

=====Same-sex marriages=====
In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex marriages the same legal footing as marriage between opposite-gender couples, in the case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (decided June 26, 2015). This effect of the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling is that a premarital agreement entered into by a same-sex couple in one state is fully enforceable in another state in the event of a divorce.

=====Federal laws=====
Certain federal laws apply to the terms that may be included in a premarital agreement. The Retirement Equity Act (REA) of 1984, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on August 23, 1984, reconciled confusion over whether ERISA preempted state divorce laws, thereby preventing pension plans from complying with court orders giving a spouse a portion of the worker&#x27;s pension in a divorce decree. A prenuptial agreement can contain waivers by which each spouse agrees to release any claims against each other&#x27;s retirement benefits that arise under both state and federal laws by the marriage, like under the REA.

When a United States citizen chooses to marry an immigrant, that person frequently serves as a Visa sponsor to petition for their fiancé to enter or stay in the United States. The Dept. of Homeland Security requires people sponsoring their immigrant fiancé to come to the U.S. on a Visa to provide an Affidavit of Support, and it is important to take into account the Affidavit of Support obligation for a U.S. sponsor about to publish a prenuptial agreement. The Affidavit of Support creates a 10-year contract between the U.S. Government and the sponsor, requiring the sponsor to financially support the immigrant fiancé from the sponsor&#x27;s resources. As the I-864 form expressly states, divorce does not terminate the support obligations the sponsor owes to U.S. Government, and the immigrant spouse has rights as a third-party beneficiary of the support promise the sponsor makes in the I-864 Affidavit. As such, any waiver of alimony in their prenuptial agreement must be drafted in a way that does not violate the contract that the U.S. sponsor makes with the government by providing the Affidavit of Support, or it will be at risk of being declared unenforceable.

=====California=====
In a 1990 California case, the court of appeals enforced an oral prenuptial agreement in the probate of the estate of one of the parties because the surviving spouse had substantially changed her position in reliance on the oral agreement. However, following changes in the statutory law, it has become much more difficult to change the character of a community or separate property without a written agreement.

Parties can waive disclosure beyond that which is provided, and there is no requirement for notarization, but it is good practice. There are special requirements if parties sign the agreement without an attorney, and the parties must have independent counsel if they limit spousal support (also known as alimony or spousal maintenance in other states). Parties must wait seven days after the premarital agreement is first presented for review before they sign it, but there is no requirement that this be done a certain number of days before the marriage. Prenups often take months to negotiate so they should not be left until the last minute (as people often do). If the prenup calls for the payment of a lump sum at the time of divorce, it may be deemed to promote divorce. This concept has come under attack and a lawyer should be consulted to make sure the prenup does not violate this provision.

In California, through a prenuptial agreement, a couple may waive their rights to share property (community property). The agreement can limit spousal support (although a court at the divorce can set this aside if it deems that the limitation is unconscionable). The agreement can act as a contract to make a will requiring one spouse to provide for the other at death. It can also limit probate rights at death, such as the right to a probate allowance, the right to act as an executor, the right to take as a predetermined heir, and so forth.

=====North Carolina=====
Prenuptial agreements are codified in the North Carolina General Statutes and North Carolina Constitution. Chapter 52B of the North Carolina General Statues, titled The Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, covers definitions and enforcement of prenuptial agreements. In the North Carolina Constitution, in ARTICLE XIV MISCELLANEOUS, Sec. 6. Marriage., prenuptial agreements are constitutionally protected.

=====South Carolina=====
Prenuptial agreements are codified in the South Carolina Code of Laws and South Carolina Constitution. In Title 20 - Domestic Relations, CHAPTER 1, Marriage, ARTICLE 1, General Provisions, of the South Carolina Code of Laws, it covers the definitions and enforcement of prenuptial agreements. In the South Carolina Constitution, in ARTICLE XIV MISCELLANEOUS, Sec. 6. Marriage., prenuptial agreements are constitutionally protected. In the South Carolina Constitution, ARTICLE XVII, MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS, SECTION 15., prenuptial agreements are constitutionally protected.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Prenuptial agreements are recognised in Australia by the Family Law Act 1975 (Commonwealth). In Australia, a prenuptial agreement is referred to as a Binding Financial Agreement (BFA).

In Australia, a BFA can be entered into before, during or after the end of a de facto relationship or a marriage. For a BFA to be binding and enforceable, both parties must be provided with Independent Legal Advice from a legal practitioner about the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party and about the disadvantages and advantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to that party entering into the BFA.

==Premarital mediation==
Premarital mediation is an alternative way of creating a prenuptial agreement. In this process, a mediator facilitates an open discussion between the couple about all kinds of marital issues, like expectations about working after children are born and saving and spending styles as well as the traditional premarital discussions about property division and spousal support if the marriage is terminated. The engaged couple makes all of the decisions about what would happen in the event of a separation or divorce with the assistance of the mediator. They then draft either a deal memo or a premarital agreement and have it reviewed by their respective attorneys. An agreement developed via mediation is typically less expensive. After all, fewer hours are spent with attorneys because the couple has made all of the decisions together, rather than one side vs the other.

==By religion==
===Christianity===
In Catholic Christianity, prenuptial agreements are a matter of civil law, so Catholic canon law does not rule them out in principle (for example, to determine how the property would be divided among the children of a prior marriage upon the death of one spouse). In practice, pre-nuptials may run afoul of Church law in several ways. For example, they cannot subject a marriage to a condition concerning the future. The Code of Canon Law provides: &quot;A marriage subject to a condition about the future cannot be contracted validly&quot;. (CIC 1102) &quot;The Canon Law: Letter and Spirit&quot;, a commentary on canon law, explains that a condition may be defined as &quot;a stipulation by which an agreement is made contingent upon the verification or fulfillment of some circumstance or event that is not yet certain&quot;. It goes on to state that &quot;any condition concerning the future attached to matrimonial consent renders marriage invalid&quot;. For example, a marriage would be invalid if the parties stipulated that they must have children or they have the right to divorce and remarry someone else.

In Lutheran Christianity, &quot;The Lutheran Handbook on Marriage&quot; stipulates: &quot;Consider a prenuptial agreement, which helps you identify the value of gifts and inheritances you receive, protects you from your partner&#x27;s pre-marriage debt, and ensures that children from a prior marriage receive.&quot;

Independent Fundamental Baptists reflect a perspective that prenuptial agreements are contrary to Christian teaching regarding marriage as a covenant:
===Judaism===
In Judaism, the &quot;ketubah&quot;, a prenuptial contract, has long been established as an integral part of the Jewish marriage and is signed and read aloud at the marriage ceremony. It contains the husband&#x27;s requirement to support his wife by providing her with food, clothing and sex, as well as providing for the wife&#x27;s support in the case of divorce or the husband&#x27;s death. However, under this passage, a woman is free to leave if her husband doesn&#x27;t provide for her.

In 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a cherem against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by The Johannesburg Beth Din.

Recently, a movement supporting an additional prenuptial agreement has emerged in some Modern Orthodox circles. This is in response to a growing number of cases in which the husband refuses to grant &quot;gett&quot;, a religious divorce. In such matters, the local authorities are unable to intervene, both out of concerns regarding the separation of church and state and because certain &quot;halakhic&quot; problems would arise. This situation leaves the wife in a state of , in which she is unable to remarry. To remedy this situation, the movement promotes a prenuptial agreement in which the couple agrees to conduct their divorce, should it occur, in a rabbinical court.

===Islam===
A Muslim woman may lay down certain conditions in the taqliq (prenuptial agreement) before signing the marriage certificate to safeguard her welfare and rights, the man may do the same.

<text>In optics, a Fabry–Pérot interferometer (FPI) or etalon is an optical cavity made from two parallel reflecting surfaces (i.e.: thin mirrors). Optical waves can pass through the optical cavity only when they are in resonance with it. It is named after Charles Fabry and Alfred Perot, who developed the instrument in 1899. &quot;Etalon&quot; is from the French &quot;étalon&quot;, meaning &quot;measuring gauge&quot; or &quot;standard&quot;.

Etalons are widely used in telecommunications, lasers and spectroscopy to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Recent advances in fabrication technique allow the creation of very precise tunable Fabry–Pérot interferometers. The device is technically an interferometer when the distance between the two surfaces (and with it the resonance length) can be changed, and an etalon when the distance is fixed (however, the two terms are often used interchangeably).

== Basic description ==

The heart of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer is a pair of partially reflective glass optical flats spaced micrometers to centimeters apart, with the reflective surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot &quot;etalon&quot; uses a single plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) The flats in an interferometer are often made in a wedge shape to prevent the rear surfaces from producing interference fringes; the rear surfaces often also have an anti-reflective coating.

In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens after the pair of flats would produce an inverted image of the source if the flats were not present; all light emitted from a point on the source is focused to a single point in the system&#x27;s image plane. In the accompanying illustration, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is repeatedly reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A&#x27; on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor, monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. A Fabry–Pérot interferometer with high Q is said to have high &quot;finesse&quot;.

== Applications ==

=== Telecommunications ===

Telecommunications networks employing wavelength division multiplexing have add-drop multiplexers with banks of miniature tuned fused silica or diamond etalons. These are small iridescent cubes about 2 mm on a side, mounted in small high-precision racks. The materials are chosen to maintain stable mirror-to-mirror distances, and to keep stable frequencies even when the temperature varies. Diamond is preferred because it has greater heat conduction and still has a low coefficient of expansion. In 2005, some telecommunications equipment companies began using solid etalons that are themselves optical fibers. This eliminates most mounting, alignment and cooling difficulties.

=== Optical Instruments ===
Dichroic filters are made by depositing a series of etalonic layers on an optical surface by vapor deposition. These optical filters usually have more exact reflective and pass bands than absorptive filters. When properly designed, they run cooler than absorptive filters because they reflect unwanted wavelengths rather than absorbing them. Dichroic filters are widely used in optical equipment such as light sources, cameras, astronomical equipment, and laser systems.

Optical wavemeters and some optical spectrum analyzers use Fabry–Pérot interferometers with different free spectral ranges to determine the wavelength of light with great precision.

Laser resonators are often described as Fabry–Pérot resonators, although for many types of laser the reflectivity of one mirror is close to 100%, making it more similar to a Gires–Tournois interferometer. Semiconductor diode lasers sometimes use a true Fabry–Pérot geometry, due to the difficulty of coating the end facets of the chip. Quantum cascade lasers often employ Fabry–Pérot cavities to sustain lasing without the need for any facet coatings, due to the high gain of the active region.

Etalons are often placed inside the laser resonator when constructing single-mode lasers. Without an etalon, a laser will generally produce light over a wavelength range corresponding to a number of cavity modes, which are similar to Fabry–Pérot modes. Inserting an etalon into the laser cavity, with well-chosen finesse and free-spectral range, can suppress all cavity modes except for one, thus changing the operation of the laser from multi-mode to single-mode.

Stable Fabry–Pérot interferometers are often used to stabilize the frequency of light emitted by a laser (which often fluctuate due to mechanical vibrations or temperature changes) by means of locking it to a mode of the cavity. Many techniques exist to produce an error signal, such as the widely-used Pound–Drever–Hall technique.

=== Spectroscopy ===

Fabry–Pérot etalons can be used to prolong the interaction length in laser absorption spectrometry, particularly cavity ring-down, techniques. An etalon of increasing thickness can be used as a linear variable optical filter to achieve spectroscopy. It can be made incredibly small using thin films of nanometer thicknesses.

A Fabry–Pérot etalon can be used to make a spectrometer capable of observing the Zeeman effect, where the spectral lines are far too close together to distinguish with a normal spectrometer.

=== Astronomy ===

In astronomy an etalon is used to select a single atomic transition for imaging. The most common is the H-alpha line of the sun. The Ca-K line from the sun is also commonly imaged using etalons.

The methane sensor for Mars (MSM) aboard India&#x27;s Mangalyaan is an example of a Fabry–Pérot instrument. It was the first Fabry–Pérot instrument in space when Mangalyaan launched. As it did not distinguish radiation absorbed by methane from radiation absorbed by carbon dioxide and other gases, it was later called an albedo mapper.

In gravitational wave detection, a Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to &quot;store&quot; photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. This principle is used by detectors such as LIGO and Virgo, which consist of a Michelson interferometer with a Fabry–Pérot cavity with a length of several kilometers in both arms. Smaller cavities, usually called &quot;mode cleaners&quot;, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser.

== Theory ==
=== Resonator losses and outcoupled light ===

The spectral response of a Fabry–Pérot resonator is based on interference between the light launched into it and the light circulating in the resonator. Constructive interference occurs if the two beams are in phase, leading to resonant enhancement of light inside the resonator. If the two beams are out of phase, only a small portion of the launched light is stored inside the resonator. The stored, transmitted, and reflected light is spectrally modified compared to the incident light.

Assume a two-mirror Fabry–Pérot resonator of geometrical length formula_1, homogeneously filled with a medium of refractive index formula_2. Light is launched into the resonator under normal incidence. The round-trip time formula_3 of light travelling in the resonator with speed formula_4, where formula_5 is the speed of light in vacuum, and the free spectral range formula_6 are given by
:formula_7
The electric-field and intensity reflectivities formula_8 and formula_9, respectively, at mirror formula_10 are
:formula_11
If there are no other resonator losses, the decay of light intensity per round trip is quantified by the outcoupling decay-rate constant formula_12
:formula_13
and the photon-decay time formula_14 of the resonator is then given by
:formula_15

=== Resonance frequencies and spectral line shapes ===

With formula_16 quantifying the single-pass phase shift that light exhibits when propagating from one mirror to the other, the round-trip phase shift at frequency formula_17 accumulates to
:formula_18
Resonances occur at frequencies at which light exhibits constructive interference after one round trip. Each resonator mode with its mode index formula_19, where formula_19 is an integer in the interval formula_21, is associated with a resonance frequency formula_22 and wavenumber formula_23,
:formula_24
Two modes with opposite values formula_25 and formula_26 of modal index and wavenumber, respectively, physically representing opposite propagation directions, occur at the same absolute value formula_27 of frequency.

The decaying electric field at frequency formula_22 is represented by a damped harmonic oscillation with an initial amplitude of formula_29 and a decay-time constant of formula_30. In phasor notation, it can be expressed as
:formula_31
Fourier transformation of the electric field in time provides the electric field per unit frequency interval,
:formula_32
Each mode has a normalized spectral line shape per unit frequency interval given by
:formula_33
whose frequency integral is unity. Introducing the full width at half maximum (FWHM) linewidth formula_34 of the Lorentzian spectral line shape, we obtain
:formula_35
expressed in terms of either the half-width-at-half-maximum (HWHM) linewidth formula_36 or the FWHM linewidth formula_34. Calibrated to a peak height of unity, we obtain the Lorentzian lines:
:formula_38
When repeating the above Fourier transformation for all the modes with mode index formula_19 in the resonator, one obtains the full mode spectrum of the resonator.

Since the linewidth formula_34 and the free spectral range formula_6 are independent of frequency, whereas in wavelength space the linewidth cannot be properly defined and the free spectral range depends on wavelength, and since the resonance frequencies formula_22 scale proportional to frequency, the spectral response of a Fabry–Pérot resonator is naturally analyzed and displayed in frequency space.

=== Generic Airy distribution: The internal resonance enhancement factor ===

The response of the Fabry–Pérot resonator to an electric field incident upon mirror 1 is described by several Airy distributions (named after the mathematician and astronomer George Biddell Airy) that quantify the light intensity in forward or backward propagation direction at different positions inside or outside the resonator with respect to either the launched or incident light intensity. The response of the Fabry–Pérot resonator is most easily derived by use of the circulating-field approach. This approach assumes a steady state and relates the various electric fields to each other (see figure &quot;Electric fields in a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;).

The field formula_43 can be related to the field formula_44 that is launched into the resonator by
:formula_45
The generic Airy distribution, which considers solely the physical processes exhibited by light inside the resonator, then derives as the intensity circulating in the resonator relative to the intensity launched,
:formula_46
formula_47 represents the spectrally dependent internal resonance enhancement which the resonator provides to the light launched into it (see figure &quot;Resonance enhancement in a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;). At the resonance frequencies formula_22, where formula_49 equals zero, the internal resonance enhancement factor is
:formula_50

=== Other Airy distributions ===
Once the internal resonance enhancement, the generic Airy distribution, is established, all other Airy distributions can be deduced by simple scaling factors. Since the intensity launched into the resonator equals the transmitted fraction of the intensity incident upon mirror 1,
:formula_51

and the intensities transmitted through mirror 2, reflected at mirror 2, and transmitted through mirror 1 are the transmitted and reflected/transmitted fractions of the intensity circulating inside the resonator,
:formula_52

respectively, the other Airy distributions formula_53 with respect to launched intensity formula_54 and formula_55 with respect to incident intensity formula_56 are
:formula_57

The index &quot;emit&quot; denotes Airy distributions that consider the sum of intensities emitted on both sides of the resonator.

The back-transmitted intensity formula_58 cannot be measured, because also the initially back-reflected light adds to the backward-propagating signal. The measurable case of the intensity resulting from the interference of both backward-propagating electric fields results in the Airy distribution
:formula_59

It can be easily shown that in a Fabry–Pérot resonator, despite the occurrence of constructive and destructive interference, energy is conserved at all frequencies:
:formula_60

The external resonance enhancement factor (see figure &quot;Resonance enhancement in a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;) is
:formula_61

At the resonance frequencies formula_22, where formula_49 equals zero, the external resonance enhancement factor is
:formula_64

Usually light is transmitted through a Fabry–Pérot resonator. Therefore, an often applied Airy distribution is
:formula_65

It describes the fraction formula_66 of the intensity formula_56 of a light source incident upon mirror 1 that is transmitted through mirror 2 (see figure &quot;Airy distribution formula_68&quot;). Its peak value at the resonance frequencies formula_22 is
:formula_70

For formula_71 the peak value equals unity; i.e., all light incident upon the resonator is transmitted. Consequently, no light is reflected, formula_72, as a result of destructive interference between the fields formula_73 and formula_74.

formula_68 has been derived in the circulating-field approach by considering an additional phase shift of formula_76 during each transmission through a mirror,
:formula_77

resulting in
:formula_78

Alternatively, formula_68 can be obtained via the round-trip-decay approach by tracing the infinite number of round trips that the incident electric field formula_80 exhibits after entering the resonator and accumulating the electric field formula_81 transmitted in all round trips. The field transmitted after the first propagation and the smaller and smaller fields transmitted after each consecutive propagation through the resonator are
:formula_82

respectively. Exploiting
:formula_83

results in the same formula_84 as above, therefore the same Airy distribution formula_68 derives. However, this approach is physically misleading, because it assumes that interference takes place between the outcoupled beams after mirror 2, outside the resonator, rather than the launched and circulating beams after mirror 1, inside the resonator. Since it is interference that modifies the spectral contents, the spectral intensity distribution inside the resonator would be the same as the incident spectral intensity distribution, and no resonance enhancement would occur inside the resonator.

=== Airy distribution as a sum of mode profiles ===

Physically, the Airy distribution is the sum of mode profiles of the longitudinal resonator modes. Starting from the electric field formula_86 circulating inside the resonator, one considers the exponential decay in time of this field through both mirrors of the resonator, Fourier transforms it to frequency space to obtain the normalized spectral line shapes formula_87, divides it by the round-trip time formula_3 to account for how the total circulating electric-field intensity is longitudinally distributed in the resonator and coupled out per unit time, resulting in the emitted mode profiles,
:formula_89
and then sums over the emitted mode profiles of all longitudinal modes
:formula_90
thus equaling the Airy distribution formula_91.

The same simple scaling factors that provide the relations between the individual Airy distributions also provide the relations among formula_92 and the other mode profiles:
:formula_93
:formula_94
:formula_95

=== Characterizing the Fabry–Pérot resonator: Lorentzian linewidth and finesse ===
The Taylor criterion of spectral resolution proposes that two spectral lines can be resolved if the individual lines cross at half intensity. When launching light into the Fabry–Pérot resonator, by measuring the Airy distribution, one can derive the total loss of the Fabry–Pérot resonator via recalculating the Lorentzian linewidth formula_34, displayed (blue line) relative to the free spectral range in the figure &quot;Lorentzian linewidth and finesse versus Airy linewidth and finesse of a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;.
The underlying Lorentzian lines can be resolved as long as the Taylor criterion is obeyed (see figure &quot;The physical meaning of the Lorentzian finesse&quot;). Consequently, one can define the Lorentzian finesse of a Fabry–Pérot resonator:
:formula_97
It is displayed as the blue line in the figure &quot;The physical meaning of the Lorentzian finesse&quot;. The Lorentzian finesse formula_98 has a fundamental physical meaning: it describes how well the Lorentzian lines underlying the Airy distribution can be resolved when measuring the Airy distribution. At the point where
:formula_99
equivalent to formula_100, the Taylor criterion for the spectral resolution of a single Airy distribution is reached. Under this point, formula_101, two spectral lines cannot be distinguished. For equal mirror reflectivities, this point occurs when formula_102. Therefore, the linewidth of the Lorentzian lines underlying the Airy distribution of a Fabry–Pérot resonator can be resolved by measuring the Airy distribution, hence its resonator losses can be spectroscopically determined, until this point.

=== Scanning the Fabry–Pérot resonator: Airy linewidth and finesse ===


When the Fabry–Pérot resonator is used as a scanning interferometer, i.e., at varying resonator length (or angle of incidence), one can spectroscopically distinguish spectral lines at different frequencies within one free spectral range. Several Airy distributions formula_103, each one created by an individual spectral line, must be resolved. Therefore, the Airy distribution becomes the underlying fundamental function and the measurement delivers a sum of Airy distributions. The parameters that properly quantify this situation are the Airy linewidth formula_104 and the Airy finesse formula_105. The FWHM linewidth formula_106 of the Airy distribution formula_103 is
:formula_108
The Airy linewidth formula_104 is displayed as the green curve in the figure &quot;Lorentzian linewidth and finesse versus Airy linewidth and finesse of a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;.

The concept of defining the linewidth of the Airy peaks as FWHM breaks down at formula_110 (solid red line in the figure &quot;Airy distribution formula_111&quot;), because at this point the Airy linewidth instantaneously jumps to an infinite value for formula_112 function. For lower reflectivity values of formula_113, the FWHM linewidth of the Airy peaks is undefined. The limiting case occurs at
:formula_114
For equal mirror reflectivities, this point is reached when formula_115 (solid red line in the figure &quot;Airy distribution formula_111&quot;).

The finesse of the Airy distribution of a Fabry–Pérot resonator, which is displayed as the green curve in the figure &quot;Lorentzian linewidth and finesse versus Airy linewidth and finesse of a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot; in direct comparison with the Lorentzian finesse formula_98, is defined as
:formula_118
When scanning the length of the Fabry–Pérot resonator (or the angle of incident light), the Airy finesse quantifies the maximum number of Airy distributions created by light at individual frequencies formula_119 within the free spectral range of the Fabry–Pérot resonator, whose adjacent peaks can be unambiguously distinguished spectroscopically, i.e., they do not overlap at their FWHM (see figure &quot;The physical meaning of the Airy finesse&quot;). This definition of the Airy finesse is consistent with the Taylor criterion of the resolution of a spectrometer. Since the concept of the FWHM linewidth breaks down at formula_120, consequently the Airy finesse is defined only until formula_121, see the figure &quot;Lorentzian linewidth and finesse versus Airy linewidth and finesse of a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;.

Often the unnecessary approximation formula_122 is made when deriving from formula_111 the Airy linewidth formula_104. In contrast to the exact solution above, it leads to
:formula_125
This approximation of the Airy linewidth, displayed as the red curve in the figure &quot;Lorentzian linewidth and finesse versus Airy linewidth and finesse of a Fabry–Pérot resonator&quot;, deviates from the correct curve at low reflectivities and incorrectly does not break down when formula_126. This approximation is then typically also used to calculate the Airy finesse.

=== Frequency-dependent mirror reflectivities ===
The more general case of a Fabry–Pérot resonator with frequency-dependent mirror reflectivities can be treated with the same equations as above, except that the photon decay time formula_127 and linewidth formula_128 now become local functions of frequency. Whereas the photon decay time is still a well-defined quantity, the linewidth loses its meaning, because it resembles a spectral bandwidth, whose value now changes within that very bandwidth. Also in this case each Airy distribution is the sum of all underlying mode profiles which can be strongly distorted. An example of the Airy distribution formula_111 and a few of the underlying mode profiles formula_130 is given in the figure &quot;Example of a Fabry–Pérot resonator with frequency-dependent mirror reflectivity&quot;.

=== Fabry–Pérot resonator with intrinsic optical losses ===
Intrinsic propagation losses inside the resonator can be quantified by an intensity-loss coefficient formula_131 per unit length or, equivalently, by the intrinsic round-trip loss 
formula_132 such that

:formula_133

The additional loss shortens the photon-decay time formula_14 of the resonator:

:formula_135

where formula_136 is the light speed in cavity. The generic Airy distribution or internal resonance enhancement factor formula_47 is then derived as above by including the propagation losses via the amplitude-loss coefficient formula_138:

:formula_139
:formula_140

The other Airy distributions can then be derived as above by additionally taking into account the propagation losses. Particularly, the transfer function with loss becomes

:formula_141

=== Description of the Fabry–Pérot resonator in wavelength space ===





The varying transmission function of an etalon is caused by interference between the multiple reflections of light between the two reflecting surfaces. Constructive interference occurs if the transmitted beams are in phase, and this corresponds to a high-transmission peak of the etalon. If the transmitted beams are out-of-phase, destructive interference occurs and this corresponds to a transmission minimum. Whether the multiply reflected beams are in phase or not depends on the wavelength (λ) of the light (in vacuum), the angle the light travels through the etalon (θ), the thickness of the etalon (&quot;ℓ&quot;) and the refractive index of the material between the reflecting surfaces (&quot;n&quot;).

The phase difference between each successive transmitted pair (i.e. T and T in the diagram) is given by

: formula_142

If both surfaces have a reflectance &quot;R&quot;, the transmittance function of the etalon is given by

: formula_143

where

: formula_144

is the &quot;coefficient of finesse&quot;.

Maximum transmission (formula_145) occurs when the optical path length difference (formula_146) between each transmitted beam is an integer multiple of the wavelength. In the absence of absorption, the reflectance of the etalon &quot;R&quot;e is the complement of the transmittance, such that formula_147. The maximum reflectivity is given by

: formula_148

and this occurs when the path-length difference is equal to half an odd multiple of the wavelength.

The wavelength separation between adjacent transmission peaks is called the free spectral range (FSR) of the etalon, Δλ, and is given by:

: formula_149

where λ0 is the central wavelength of the nearest transmission peak and formula_150 is the group refractive index. The FSR is related to the full-width half-maximum, δλ, of any one transmission band by a quantity known as the &quot;finesse&quot;:

: formula_151

This is commonly approximated (for &quot;R&quot; &gt; 0.5) by

: formula_152

If the two mirrors are not equal, the finesse becomes

: formula_153

Etalons with high finesse show sharper transmission peaks with lower minimum transmission coefficients. In the oblique incidence case, the finesse will depend on the polarization state of the beam, since the value of &quot;R&quot;, given by the Fresnel equations, is generally different for p and s polarizations.

Two beams are shown in the diagram at the right, one of which (T0) is transmitted through the etalon, and the other of which (T1) is reflected twice before being transmitted. At each reflection, the amplitude is reduced by formula_154, while at each transmission through an interface the amplitude is reduced by formula_155. Assuming no absorption, conservation of energy requires &quot;T&quot; + &quot;R&quot; = 1. In the derivation below, &quot;n&quot; is the index of refraction inside the etalon, and &quot;n&quot;0 is that outside the etalon. It is presumed that &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;0. The incident amplitude at point a is taken to be one, and phasors are used to represent the amplitude of the radiation. The transmitted amplitude at point b will then be

: formula_156

where formula_157 is the wavenumber inside the etalon, and λ is the vacuum wavelength. At point c the transmitted amplitude will be

: formula_158

The total amplitude of both beams will be the sum of the amplitudes of the two beams measured along a line perpendicular to the direction of the beam. The amplitude &quot;t&quot;0 at point b can therefore be added to &quot;t″&quot;1 retarded in phase by an amount formula_159, where formula_160 is the wavenumber outside of the etalon. Thus

: formula_161

where ℓ0 is

: formula_162

The phase difference between the two beams is

: formula_163

The relationship between &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;θ&quot;0 is given by Snell&#x27;s law:

: formula_164

so that the phase difference may be written as

: formula_165

To within a constant multiplicative phase factor, the amplitude of the &quot;m&quot;th transmitted beam can be written as

: formula_166

The total transmitted amplitude is the sum of all individual beams&#x27; amplitudes:

: formula_167

The series is a geometric series, whose sum can be expressed analytically. The amplitude can be rewritten as

: formula_168

The intensity of the beam will be just &quot;t&quot; times its complex conjugate. Since the incident beam was assumed to have an intensity of one, this will also give the transmission function:

: formula_169

For an asymmetrical cavity, that is, one with two different mirrors, the general form of the transmission function is

: formula_170

A Fabry–Pérot interferometer differs from a Fabry–Pérot etalon in the fact that the distance &quot;ℓ&quot; between the plates can be tuned in order to change the wavelengths at which transmission peaks occur in the interferometer. Due to the angle dependence of the transmission, the peaks can also be shifted by rotating the etalon with respect to the beam.

Another expression for the transmission function was already derived in the description in frequency space as the infinite sum of all longitudinal mode profiles. Defining formula_171 the above expression may be written as

: formula_172

The second term is proportional to a wrapped Lorentzian distribution so that the transmission function may be written as a series of Lorentzian functions:

: formula_173

where

: formula_174

<text>Platelets or thrombocytes () are a blood component whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, thereby initiating a blood clot. Platelets have no cell nucleus; they are fragments of cytoplasm derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow or lung, which then enter the circulation. Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other vertebrates (e.g. birds, amphibians), thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells.

One major function of platelets is to contribute to hemostasis: the process of stopping bleeding at the site of interrupted endothelium. They gather at the site and, unless the interruption is physically too large, they plug the hole. First, platelets attach to substances outside the interrupted endothelium: &quot;adhesion&quot;. Second, they change shape, turn on receptors and secrete chemical messengers: &quot;activation&quot;. Third, they connect to each other through receptor bridges: &quot;aggregation&quot;. Formation of this platelet plug (primary hemostasis) is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade, with resultant fibrin deposition and linking (secondary hemostasis). These processes may overlap: the spectrum is from a predominantly platelet plug, or &quot;white clot&quot; to a predominantly fibrin, or &quot;red clot&quot; or the more typical mixture. Berridge adds &quot;retraction&quot; and &quot;platelet inhibition&quot; as fourth and fifth steps, while others would add a sixth step, &quot;wound repair&quot;. Platelets participate in both innate and adaptive intravascular immune responses.

In addition to facilitating the clotting process, platelets contain cytokines and growth factors which can promote wound healing and regeneration of damaged tissues.

== Term ==
The term &quot;thrombocyte&quot; (clot cell) came into use in the early 1900s and is sometimes used as a synonym for platelet; but not generally in the scientific literature, except as a root word for other terms related to platelets (e.g. &quot;thrombocytopenia&quot; meaning low platelets). The term thrombocytes are proper for mononuclear cells found in the blood of non-mammalian vertebrates: they are the functional equivalent of platelets, but circulate as intact cells rather than cytoplasmic fragments of bone marrow megakaryocytes.

In some contexts, the word &quot;thrombus&quot; is used interchangeably with the word &quot;clot&quot;, regardless of its composition (white, red, or mixed). In other contexts it is used to contrast a normal from an abnormal clot: &quot;thrombus&quot; arises from physiologic hemostasis, &quot;thrombosis&quot; arises from a pathologic and excessive quantity of clot. In a third context it is used to contrast the result from the process: &quot;thrombus&quot; is the result, &quot;thrombosis&quot; is the process.

==Morphology==

===Structure===
Structurally the platelet can be divided into four zones, from peripheral to innermost:
* Peripheral zone — rich in glycoproteins required for platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation. For example, GPIb/IX/V; GPVI; GPIIb/IIIa
* Sol-gel zone — rich in microtubules and microfilaments, allowing platelets to maintain a discoid shape
* Organelle zone — rich in platelet granules. Alpha granules contain clotting mediators such as factor V, factor VIII, fibrinogen, fibronectin, platelet-derived growth factor, and chemotactic agents. Delta granules, or dense bodies, contain ADP, calcium, and serotonin, which are platelet-activating mediators.
* Membranous zone — membranes derived from megakaryocyte smooth endoplasmic reticulum organized into a dense tubular system that is responsible for thromboxane A2 synthesis. This dense tubular system is connected to the surface platelet membrane to aid thromboxane A2 release.

===Shape===

Circulating inactivated platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped) structures, 2–3 μm in greatest diameter. Activated platelets have cell membrane projections covering their surface.

In a first approximation, the shape can be considered similar to oblate spheroids, with a semiaxis ratio of 2 to 8. This approximation can be used to model the hydrodynamic and optical properties of a population, as well as to restore the geometric parameters of individual measured platelets by flow cytometry. More accurate biophysical models of platelet surface morphology that model its shape from first principles, make it possible to obtain a more realistic platelet geometry in a calm and activated state.

===Development===

* Megakaryocyte and platelet production is regulated by thrombopoietin, a hormone produced in the kidneys and liver.
* Each megakaryocyte produces between 1,000 and 3,000 platelets during its lifetime.
* An average of 1011 platelets are produced daily in a healthy adult.
* Reserve platelets are stored in the spleen and are released when needed by splenic contraction induced by the sympathetic nervous system.

* The average life span of circulating platelets is 8 to 9 days. Life span of individual platelets is controlled by the internal apoptotic regulating pathway, which has a Bcl-xL timer.
* Old platelets are destroyed by phagocytosis in the spleen and liver.

==Hemostasis==

The fundamental function of platelets is to clump together to stop acute bleeding. This process is complex, as more than 193 proteins and 301 interactions are involved in platelet dynamics. Despite much overlap, platelet function can be modeled in three steps:

===Adhesion===
Thrombus formation on an intact endothelium is prevented by nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and CD39.

Endothelial cells attach to the subendothelial collagen by von Willebrand factor (VWF), which these cells produce. VWF is also stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of the endothelial cells and secreted constitutively into the blood. Platelets store vWF in their alpha granules.

When the endothelial layer is disrupted, collagen and VWF anchor platelets to the subendothelium. Platelet GP1b-IX-V receptor binds with VWF; and GPVI receptor and integrin α2β1 bind with collagen.

===Activation===
====Inhibition====
The intact endothelial lining &quot;inhibits&quot; platelet activation by producing nitric oxide, endothelial-ADPase, and PGI2 (prostacyclin). Endothelial-ADPase degrades the platelet activator ADP.

Resting platelets maintain active calcium efflux via a cyclic AMP-activated calcium pump. Intracellular calcium concentration determines platelet activation status, as it is the second messenger that drives platelet conformational change and degranulation. Endothelial prostacyclin binds to prostanoid receptors on the surface of resting platelets. This event stimulates the coupled Gs protein to increase adenylate cyclase activity and increases the production of cAMP, further promoting the efflux of calcium and reducing intracellular calcium availability for platelet activation.

ADP on the other hand binds to purinergic receptors on the platelet surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium efflux pump. The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 (PLCB2), resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces platelet activation. Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. Clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists. Data suggest that ADP activates the PI3K/Akt pathway during a first wave of aggregation, leading to thrombin generation and PAR‐1 activation, which evokes a second wave of aggregation.

====Trigger (induction)====
Platelet activation begins seconds after adhesion occurs. It is triggered when &quot;collagen&quot; from the subendothelium binds with its receptors (GPVI receptor and integrin α2β1) on the platelet. GPVI is associated with the Fc receptor gamma chain and leads via the activation of a tyrosine kinase cascade finally to the activation of PLC-gamma2 (PLCG2) and more calcium release.

Tissue factor also binds to factor VII in the blood, which initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin is a potent platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein-coupled receptors and they turn on calcium-mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade. Platelet plugging and coagulation occur simultaneously, with each inducing the other to form the final fibrin-crosslinked thrombus.

====Components (consequences)====

=====GPIIb/IIIa activation=====
Collagen-mediated GPVI signalling increases the platelet production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and decreases the production of prostacyclin. This occurs by altering the metabolic flux of platelet&#x27;s eicosanoid synthesis pathway, which involves enzymes phospholipase A2, cyclo-oxygenase 1, and thromboxane-A synthase. Platelets secrete thromboxane A2, which acts on the platelet&#x27;s own thromboxane receptors on the platelet surface (hence the so-called &quot;out-in&quot; mechanism), and those of other platelets. These receptors trigger intraplatelet signaling, which converts GPIIb/IIIa receptors to their active form to initiate &quot;aggregation&quot;.

=====Granule secretion=====

Platelets contain dense granules, lambda granules, and alpha granules. Activated platelets secrete the contents of these granules through their canalicular systems to the exterior. Bound and activated platelets degranulate to release platelet chemotactic agents to attract more platelets to the site of endothelial injury. Granule characteristics:
* α granules (alpha granules) — containing P-selectin, platelet factor 4, transforming growth factor-β1, platelet-derived growth factor, fibronectin, B-thromboglobulin, vWF, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors V and XIII
* δ granules (delta or dense granules) — containing ADP or ATP, calcium, and serotonin
* γ granules (gamma granules) — similar to lysosomes and contain several hydrolytic enzymes
* λ granules (lambda granules) — contents involved in resorption during later stages of vessel repair

=====Morphology change=====
As shown by flow cytometry and electron microscopy, the most sensitive sign of activation, when exposed to platelets using ADP, are morphological changes. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization is a key event in initiating morphology changes. Intraplatelet calcium concentration increases, stimulating the interplay between the microtubule/actin filament complex. The continuous changes in shape from the unactivated to the fully activated platelet are best seen via scanning electron microscopy. The three steps along this path are named &quot;early dendritic&quot;, &quot;early spread,&quot; and &quot;spread&quot;. The surface of the unactivated platelet looks similar to the surface of the brain–a wrinkled appearance from numerous shallow folds that increase the surface area; &quot;early dendritic&quot;, an octopus with multiple arms and legs; &quot;early spread&quot;, an uncooked frying egg in a pan, the &quot;yolk&quot; is the central body; and the &quot;spread&quot;, a cooked fried egg with a denser central body.

These changes are all brought about by the interaction of the microtubule/actin complex with the platelet cell membrane and open canalicular system (OCS), which is an extension and invagination of that membrane. This complex runs just beneath these membranes and is the chemical motor that pulls the invaginated OCS out of the interior of the platelet, like turning pants pockets inside out, creating the dendrites. This process is similar to the mechanism of contraction in a muscle cell. The entire OCS thus becomes indistinguishable from the initial platelet membrane as it forms the &quot;fried egg&quot;. This dramatic increase in surface area comes about with neither stretching nor adding phospholipids to the platelet membrane.

=====Platelet-coagulation factor interactions: coagulation facilitation=====
Platelet activation causes its membrane surface to become negatively charged. One of the signaling pathways turns on scramblase, which moves negatively charged phospholipids from the inner to the outer platelet membrane surface. These phospholipids then bind the tenase and prothrombinase complexes, two of the sites of interplay between platelets and the coagulation cascade. Calcium ions are essential for the binding of these coagulation factors.

In addition to interacting with vWF and fibrin, platelets interact with thrombin, Factors X, Va, VIIa, XI, IX, and prothrombin to complete formation via the coagulation cascade. Human platelets do not express tissue factor. Rat platelets do express tissue factor protein and carry both tissue factor pre-mRNA and mature mRNA.

===Aggregation===

Platelet aggregation begins minutes after activation, and occurs as a result of turning on the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, allowing these receptors to bind with vWF or fibrinogen. Each platelet has around 60,000 of these receptors. When any one or more of at least nine different platelet surface receptors are turned on during activation, intraplatelet signaling pathways cause existing GpIIb/IIIa receptors to change shape — curled to straight — and thus become capable of binding.

Since fibrinogen is a rod-like protein with nodules on either end capable of binding GPIIb/IIIa, activated platelets with exposed GPIIb/IIIa can bind fibrinogen to aggregate. GPIIb/IIIa may also further anchor the platelets to subendothelial vWF for additional structural stabilisation.

Classically it was thought that this was the only mechanism involved in aggregation, but three other mechanisms have been identified which can initiate aggregation, depending on the velocity of blood flow (i.e. shear range).

==Immune function==
Platelets have a central role in innate immunity, initiating and participating in multiple inflammatory processes, directly binding and even destroying pathogens. Clinical data show that many patients with serious bacterial or viral infections have thrombocytopenia, thus reducing their contribution to inflammation. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) found in circulation are typical in sepsis or inflammatory bowel disease, showing the connection between thrombocytes and immune cells.

The platelet cell membrane has receptors for collagen. Following rupture of the blood vessel wall, platelets are exposed and adhere to the collagen in the surrounding tissue.

===Immunothrombosis===
As hemostasis is a basic function of thrombocytes in mammals, it also has its uses in possible infection confinement. In case of injury, platelets, together with the coagulation cascade, provide the first line of defense by forming a blood clot. Hemostasis and host defense were thus intertwined in evolution. For example, in the Atlantic horseshoe crab (estimated to be over 400 million years old), the only blood cell type, the amebocyte, facilitates both the hemostatic function and the encapsulation and phagocytosis of pathogens by means of exocytosis of intracellular granules containing bactericidal defense molecules. Blood clotting supports immune function by trapping the bacteria.

Although thrombosis, blood coagulation in intact blood vessels, is usually viewed as a pathological immune response, leading to obturation of lumen of blood vessel and subsequent hypoxic tissue damage, in some cases, directed thrombosis, called immunothrombosis, can locally control the spread of an infection. The thrombosis is directed in concordance of platelets, neutrophils and monocytes. The process is initiated either by immune cells by activating their pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), or by platelet-bacterial binding. Platelets can bind to bacteria either directly through thrombocytic PRRs and bacterial surface proteins, or via plasma proteins that bind both to platelets and bacteria. Monocytes respond to bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by activating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Neutrophils facilitate the blood coagulation by NETosis, while platelets facilitate neutrophils&#x27; NETosis. NETs bind tissue factor, binding the coagulation centers to the location of infection. They also activate the intrinsic coagulation pathway by providing its negatively charged surface to the factor XII. Other neutrophil secretions, such as proteolytic enzymes which cleave coagulation inhibitors, also bolster the process.

In case of imbalance throughout the regulation of immunothrombosis, this process can become aberrant. Regulatory defects in immunothrombosis are suspected to be a major factor in pathological thrombosis in forms such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or deep vein thrombosis. DIC in sepsis is a prime example of both the dysregulated coagulation process as well as an undue systemic inflammatory response, resulting in a multitude of microthrombi of similar composition to that in physiological immunothrombosis — fibrin, platelets, neutrophils and NETs.

===Inflammation===
Platelets rapidly deploy to sites of injury or infection, and potentially modulate inflammatory processes by interacting with leukocytes and secreting cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. Platelets also secrete platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).

Platelets modulate neutrophils by forming platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs). These formations induce upregulated production of αmβ2 (Mac-1) integrin in neutrophils. Interaction with PLAs also induces degranulation and increased phagocytosis in neutrophils.

Platelets are the largest source of soluble CD40L which induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulate expression of adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, in neutrophils, activates macrophages and activates cytotoxic response in T and B lymphocytes.

Mammalian platelets lacking nucleus are able to conduct autonomous locomotion. Platelets are active scavengers, scaling walls of blood vessels and reorganising the thrombus. They are able to recognize and adhere to many surfaces, including bacteria, and can envelop them in their open canalicular system (OCP), leading to a proposal to name the process as &quot;covercytosis&quot; (OCS) rather than phagocytosis, as OCS is merely an invagination of outer plasma membrane. These platelet-bacteria bundles provide an interaction platform for neutrophils that destroy bacteria using the NETosis and phagocytosis.

Platelets also participate in chronic inflammatory disease, such as synovitis or rheumatoid arthritis. Platelets are activated by collagen receptor glycoprotein IV (GPVI). Proinflammatory platelet microvesicles trigger constant cytokine secretion from neighboring fibroblast-like synoviocytes, most prominently Il-6 and Il-8. Inflammatory damage to the surrounding extracellular matrix continuously reveals more collagen, maintaining microvesicle production.

===Adaptive immunity===
Activated platelets are able to participate in adaptive immunity, interacting with antibodies. They are able to specifically bind IgG through FcγRIIA, a receptor for IgG&#x27;s constant fragment (Fc). When activated and bound to IgG opsonised bacteria, platelets release reactive oxygen species (ROS), antimicrobial peptides, defensins, kinocidins and proteases, killing the bacteria directly. Platelets also secrete proinflammatory and procoagulant mediators such as inorganic polyphosphates or platelet factor 4 (PF4), connecting innate and adaptive immune responses.

==Signs and symptoms of disorders==
Spontaneous and excessive bleeding can occur because of platelet disorders. This bleeding can be caused by deficient numbers of platelets, dysfunctional platelets, or platelet densities over 1 million/microliter. (The excessive numbers create a relative von Willebrand factor deficiency due to sequestration.)

Bleeding due to a platelet disorder or a coagulation factor disorder can be distinguished by the characteristics and location of the bleeding. Platelet bleeding involves bleeding from a cut that is prompt and excessive, but can be controlled by pressure; spontaneous bleeding into the skin which causes a purplish stain named by its size: petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses; bleeding into mucous membranes causing bleeding gums, nose bleed, and gastrointestinal bleeding; menorrhagia; and intraretinal and intracranial bleeding.

Excessive numbers of platelets, and/or normal platelets responding to abnormal vessel walls, can result in venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. The symptoms depend on the thrombosis site.

==Measurement and testing==

===Measurement===
Platelet concentration in the blood (i.e. platelet count), can be measured manually using a hemocytometer, or by placing blood in an automated platelet analyzer using particle counting, such as a Coulter counter or optical methods. Most common blood testing methods include platelet count in their measurements, usually reported as PLT.

Platelet concentrations vary between individuals and over time, with the population average between 250,000 and 260,000 cells per mm3 (equivalent to per microliter), but the typical laboratory accepted normal range is between 150,000 and 400,000 cells per mm3 or 150–400 × 109 per liter.

On a stained blood smear, platelets appear as dark purple spots, about 20% of the diameter of red blood cells. The smear reveals size, shape, qualitative number, and clumping. A healthy adult typically has 10 to 20 times more red blood cells than platelets.

===Bleeding time===
Bleeding time was developed as a test of platelet function by Duke in 1910. Duke&#x27;s test measured the time taken for bleeding to stop from a standardized wound in the ear lobe that was blotted every 30 seconds, considering less than 3 minutes as normal. Bleeding time has low sensitivity and specificity for mild to moderate platelet disorders and is no longer recommended for screening.

===Multiple electrode aggregometry===

In multiple electrode aggregometry, anticoagulated whole blood is mixed with saline and a platelet agonist in a single-use cuvette with two pairs of electrodes. The increase in impedance between the electrodes as platelets aggregate onto them, is measured and visualized as a curve.

===Light transmission aggregometry===
In light transmission aggregometry (LTA), platelet-rich plasma is placed between a light source and a photocell. Unaggregated plasma allows relatively little light to pass through. After adding an agonist, the platelets aggregate, increasing light transmission, which is detected by a photocell.

===Whole blood impedance aggregometry===
Whole blood impedance aggregometry (WBA) measures the change in electrical impedance between two electrodes when platelet aggregation is induced by an agonist. Whole blood lumiaggregometry may increase the test sensitivity to impairment of platelet granule secretion.

===PFA-100===
The PFA-100 (Platelet Function Assay — 100) is a system for analysing platelet function in which citrated whole blood is aspirated through a disposable cartridge containing an aperture within a membrane coated with either collagen and epinephrine or collagen and ADP. These agonists induce platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation, leading to rapid occlusion of the aperture and cessation of blood flow termed the closure time (CT). An elevated CT with EPI and collagen can indicate intrinsic defects such as von Willebrand disease, uremia, or circulating platelet inhibitors. A follow-up test involving collagen and ADP is used to indicate if the abnormal CT with collagen and EPI was caused by the effects of acetyl sulfosalicylic acid (aspirin) or medications containing inhibitors. The PFA-100 is highly sensitive to von Willebrand disease, but is only moderately sensitive to defects in platelet function.

==Disorders==
Low platelet concentration is called thrombocytopenia, and is due to either decreased production or increased destruction. Elevated platelet concentration is called thrombocytosis, and is either congenital, reactive (to cytokines), or due to unregulated production: one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms or certain other myeloid neoplasms. A disorder of platelet function is called a thrombocytopathy or a platelet function disorder.

Normal platelets can respond to an abnormality on the vessel wall rather than to hemorrhage, resulting in inappropriate platelet adhesion/activation and thrombosis: the formation of a clot within an intact vessel. This type of thrombosis arises by mechanisms different from those of a normal clot: extending the fibrin of venous thrombosis; extending an unstable or ruptured arterial plaque, causing arterial thrombosis; and microcirculatory thrombosis. An arterial thrombus may partially obstruct blood flow, causing downstream ischemia, or may completely obstruct it, causing downstream tissue death.:

The three broad categories of platelet disorders are &quot;not enough&quot;, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, and &quot;too many&quot;.

==Pharmacology==

===Anti-inflammatory drugs===
Some drugs used to treat inflammation have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase because they have no DNA. Normal platelet function does not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin.

===Drugs that suppress platelet function===
These drugs are used to prevent thrombus formation.

====Oral agents====
* Aspirin
* Cilostazol
* Clopidogrel
* Prasugrel
* Ticagrelor
* Ticlopidine

===Drugs that stimulate platelet production===
* Desmopressin
* Factor VIIa
* Thrombopoietin mimetics

====Intravenous agents====
* Abciximab
* Eptifibatide
* Tirofiban
* Others: oprelvekin, romiplostim, eltrombopag, argatroban

==Therapies==

===Transfusion===
====Indications====
Platelet transfusion is most frequently used to correct unusually low platelet counts, either to prevent spontaneous bleeding (typically at counts below 10×109/L) or in anticipation of medical procedures that necessarily involve some bleeding. For example, in patients undergoing surgery, a level below 50×109/L is associated with abnormal surgical bleeding, and regional anaesthetic procedures such as epidurals are avoided for levels below 80×109/L. Platelets may also be transfused when the platelet count is normal but the platelets are dysfunctional, such as when an individual is taking aspirin or clopidogrel. Finally, platelets may be transfused as part of a massive transfusion protocol, in which the three major blood components (red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) are transfused to address severe hemorrhage. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as it fuels the coagulopathy. Platelet transfusion is generally ineffective, and thus contraindicated, for prophylaxis in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), because the transfused platelets are immediately cleared; however, it is indicated to treat bleeding.

====Collection====

Platelets are either isolated from collected units of whole blood and pooled to make a therapeutic dose, or collected by platelet apheresis: blood is taken from the donor, passed through a device which removes the platelets, and the remainder is returned to the donor in a closed loop. The industry standard is for platelets to be tested for bacteria before transfusion to avoid septic reactions, which can be fatal. Recently the AABB Industry Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services (5.1.5.1) has allowed use of pathogen reduction technology as an alternative to bacterial screenings in platelets.

Pooled whole-blood platelets, sometimes called &quot;random&quot; platelets, are separated by one of two methods. In the US, a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what is referred to as a &quot;soft spin&quot;. At these settings, the platelets remain suspended in the plasma. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is removed from the red cells, then centrifuged at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma. In other regions of the world, the unit of whole blood is centrifuged using settings that cause the platelets to become suspended in the &quot;buffy coat&quot; layer, which includes the platelets and the white blood cells. The &quot;buffy coat&quot; is isolated in a sterile bag, suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma, then centrifuged again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells. Regardless of the initial method of preparation, multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired therapeutic dose.

Apheresis platelets are collected using a mechanical device that draws blood from the donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected. The remaining blood is returned to the donor. The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, as opposed to the multiple donations for whole-blood platelets. This means that a recipient is exposed to fewer donors and has less risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and other complications. Sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets receives repeated donations from a specific donor to minimize risk. Pathogen reduction of platelets using for example, riboflavin and UV light treatments can reduce the infectious load of pathogens contained in donated blood products. Another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and UVA light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and leukocytes. In addition, apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than &quot;soft spin&quot; centrifugation.

====Storage====
Platelets collected by either method have a typical shelf life of five days. This results in supply shortages, as testing donations often requires up to a full day. No effective preservative solutions have been devised for platelets.

Platelets are stored under constant agitation at . Units cannot be refrigerated as this causes platelets to change shape and lose function. Storage at room temperature provides an environment where any introduced bacteria may proliferate and subsequently cause bacteremia. The United States requires products to be tested for the presence of bacterial contamination before transfusion.
====Delivery====
Platelets do not need to belong to the same A-B-O blood group as the recipient or be cross-matched to ensure immune compatibility between donor and recipient unless they contain a significant amount of red blood cells (RBCs). The presence of RBCs imparts a reddish-orange color to the product and is usually associated with whole-blood platelets. Some sites may type platelets, but this is not critical.

Prior to issuing platelets to the recipient, they may be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graft versus host disease or they may be washed to remove the plasma.

The change in the recipient&#x27;s platelet count after transfusion is termed the &quot;increment&quot; and is calculated by subtracting the pre-transfusion platelet count from the post-transfusion count. Many factors affect the increment including body size, the number of platelets transfused, and clinical features that may cause premature destruction of the transfused platelets. When recipients fail to demonstrate an adequate post-transfusion increment, this is termed platelet transfusion refractoriness.

Platelets, either apheresis-derived or random-donor, can be processed through a volume reduction process. In this process, the platelets are spun in a centrifuge and plasma is removed, leaving 10 to 100 mL of platelet concentrate. Such volume-reduced platelets are normally transfused only to neonatal and pediatric patients when a large volume of plasma could overload the child&#x27;s small circulatory system. The lower volume of plasma also reduces the chances of an adverse transfusion reaction to plasma proteins. Volume reduced platelets have a shelf life of four hours.

===Wound repair===
The blood clot is only a temporary solution to stop bleeding; tissue repair is needed. Small interruptions in the endothelium are handled by physiological mechanisms; large interruptions by a trauma surgeon. The fibrin is slowly dissolved by the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin, and the platelets are cleared by phagocytosis.

Platelets release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent; and TGF beta, which stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix; fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Local application of these factors in increased concentrations through platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is used as an adjunct in wound healing.

==Non-mammals==
Instead of platelets, non-mammalian vertebrates have nucleated thrombocytes, which resemble B lymphocytes in morphology. They aggregate in response to thrombin, but not to ADP, serotonin, nor adrenaline, as platelets do.

==History==
* George Gulliver in 1841 drew pictures of platelets using the twin lens (compound) microscope invented in 1830 by Joseph Jackson Lister. This microscope improved resolution sufficiently to make it possible to see platelets for the first time.
* William Addison in 1842 drew pictures of a platelet-fibrin clot.
* Lionel Beale in 1864 was the first to publish a drawing showing platelets.
* Max Schultze in 1865 described what he called &quot;spherules&quot;, which he noted were much smaller than red blood cells, occasionally clumped, and were sometimes found in collections of fibrin material.
* Giulio Bizzozero in 1882 studied the blood of amphibians microscopically &quot;in vivo&quot;. He named Schultze&#x27;s spherules (It.) &quot;piastrine&quot;: little plates. Bizzozero possibly proposed the name Blutplattchen.
* William Osler observed platelets and, in published lectures in 1886, called them a &quot;third corpuscle&quot; and a blood &quot;plaque&quot;; and described them as &quot;a colorless protoplasmic disc&quot;.
* James Wright examined blood smears using the stain named for him, and used the term &quot;plates&quot; in his 1906 publication, changing to platelets in his 1910 publication.

<text>Pierre Culliford (; 25 June 1928 – 24 December 1992) was a Belgian comics writer and artist who worked under the pseudonym Peyo (). His best-known works are the comic book series &quot;The Smurfs&quot; and &quot;Johan and Peewit&quot;, the latter in which the Smurfs made their first appearance.

==Early life==
Culliford was born in 1928 in the Belgian municipality Schaerbeek, Belgium. He was the son of an English father and a Belgian mother.

== Career ==
Culliford took on the name &quot;Peyo&quot; early in his professional career, based on an English cousin&#x27;s mispronunciation of Pierrot (a diminutive form of Pierre).

After working briefly at the Compagnie Belge d&#x27;Actualités (CBA), a small and short-lived Belgian animation studio, Peyo began making comic strips for daily newspapers such as &quot;Le Soir&quot; shortly after World War II. At the beginning of the 1950s, he brought his character Johan to the magazine &quot;Spirou&quot;, whom he soon gave a companion, the diminutive Peewit; the strip soon became a staple of the weeklies. Peyo introduced the Smurfs in the &quot;Johan and Peewit&quot; storyline &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in 1958; the characters quickly supplanted Johan and Peewit in popularity and left them behind for their own series.

In 1960, Peyo founded a studio to accommodate his assistants such as François Walthéry, Gos, and and created the series &quot;Steven Strong&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Peyo&#x27;s output diminished in the 1970s, at first due to the time he invested in &quot;The Smurfs and the Magic Flute&quot; (1976), a film adaptation of the &quot;Johan and Peewit&quot; story &quot;La flûte à six schtroumpfs&quot;; in the 1980s, he put in more time, despite recurring health problems, into an American adaptation of &quot;The Smurfs&quot; as an animated television series. After the series concluded, he left his publisher Dupuis to found his own publishing house, Cartoon Creation, and a cartoon magazine, &quot;Schtroumpf!&quot;, which soon folded due to management problems. He joined Le Lombard in 1992 but died a few months later.

Peyo began work, fresh from his coursework at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, at the (CBA), a small Belgian animation studio, where he met a few of his future colleagues and co-celebrities, like André Franquin, Morris, and Eddy Paape. When the studio folded after the war, the other artists went to work for Dupuis, but Peyo, a few years younger than the others, was not accepted. He made his first comics for the newspaper &quot;La Dernière Heure&quot; (The Latest Hour), but also accepted many promotional drawing jobs for income. From 1949 to 1952, he drew &quot;Poussy&quot;, a gag-a-day comic about a cat, for &quot;Le Soir&quot;. For the same newspaper, he also created &quot;Johan&quot;.

In 1952, Franquin introduced Peyo to &quot;Spirou&quot;, a children&#x27;s Franco-Belgian comics magazine published by Dupuis. Peyo wrote and drew a number of characters and storylines, including &quot;Pierrot&quot;, and &quot;Benoît Brisefer&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Steven Strong&quot;). But his favourite was &quot;Johan et Pirlouit&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Johan and Peewit&quot;), which was a continuation of the series &quot;Johan&quot; he had created earlier. He also continued &quot;Poussy&quot; in &quot;Spirou&quot;.

Set in the Middle Ages in Europe, &quot;Johan et Pirlouit&quot; stars a brave young page to the king, and his faithful, if boastful and cheating, dwarf sidekick. Johan rides off to defend the meek on his trusty horse, while Peewit gallops sporadically behind on his goat, named Biquette. The pair was driven by duty to their king and the courage to defend the underpowered. Peewit only appeared in the third adventure in 1954 but would stay for all later adventures.

== Smurfs ==
The first Smurf appeared in &quot;Johan and Peewit&quot; on 23 October 1958 in the album &quot;La Flûte à Six Schtroumpfs&quot; (&quot;The Six Smurfed Flute&quot;). As the Smurfs became increasingly popular, Peyo started a studio in the early 1960s, where a number of talented comics artists started to work. Peyo himself supervised the work and worked primarily on &quot;Johan and Peewit&quot;, leaving the Smurfs to the studio. The most notable artists to come out of this studio were Walthéry, , (Gos), Derib, , and .

In 1959, the Smurfs got their own series, and in 1960, two more began: &quot;Steven Strong&quot; and &quot;Jacky and Célestin&quot;. Many authors of the Marcinelle school collaborated on the writing, or on the artwork, including Willy Maltaite (aka &#x27;Will&#x27;), Yvan Delporte, and Roger Leloup. Peyo became more of a businessman and supervisor and was less involved in the actual creation of the comics. He let his son, Thierry Culliford, lead the studio, while his daughter Véronique was responsible for the merchandising (I.M.P.S. was established in 1985 by her).

The merchandising of the Smurfs began in 1959, with the PVC figurines as the most important aspect until the late 1970s. Then, with the success of The Smurfs records by Pierre Kartner, the Smurfs achieved more international success, with a new boom in toys and gadgets. Some of these reached the United States, where Hanna-Barbera created a Saturday morning animated series in 1981 for which Peyo served as story supervisor. Peyo&#x27;s health began to fail. In 1989, after his partnership with Dupuis ended, he established Cartoon Creation to publish new Smurf stories. In late 1991, the company was forced to shut down due to mismanagement. The publishing rights were soon sold to Le Lombard. 

== Personal life ==
In 1952, Culliford married Nine Culliford. They had two children.

== Death ==
Peyo died of a heart attack in Brussels on Christmas Eve 1992, at the age of 64. His studio still exists, and new stories for various series are regularly produced under his name.

== Legacy ==
Since his death, Peyo&#x27;s children have continued to promote his work under the brand &quot;Peyo&quot;. In the 2011 film &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, Peyo was included in the plot as a researcher who studied the myths concerning the Smurfs, who were made to be real-life legendary creatures in the film&#x27;s storyline.

==Awards and honours==
* He received the Youth Prize (9–12 years) award 1984 at the Angoulême International Comics Festival, France.
* The 50th anniversary of The Smurfs and the 80th anniversary of the birth of its creator was celebrated by issuing a high-value collectors&#x27; coin: the Belgian 5 euro 50th anniversary of The Smurfs commemorative coin, minted in 2008.

<doc id="196125" wikidata="Q846316" url="?curid=196125" title="Aplastic anemia">
<text>Aplastic anemia (AA) is a severe hematologic condition in which the body fails to make blood cells in sufficient numbers. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow by stem cells that reside there. Aplastic anemia causes a deficiency of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

It occurs most frequently in people in their teens and twenties but is also common among the elderly. It can be caused by immune disease, or by exposure to chemicals, drugs, or radiation. However, in about half of cases, the cause is unknown.

Aplastic anemia can be definitively diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. Normal bone marrow has 30–70% blood stem cells, but in aplastic anemia, these cells are mostly gone and are replaced by fat.

First-line treatment for aplastic anemia consists of immunosuppressive drugs—typically either anti-lymphocyte globulin or anti-thymocyte globulin—combined with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and ciclosporin. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also used, especially for patients under 30 years of age with a related, matched marrow donor.

Aplastic anemia is known to have caused the deaths of Marie Skłodowska-Curie, Eleanor Roosevelt, Luana Reyes, and Molly Holzschlag.

==Signs and symptoms==
Anemia may lead to fatigue, pale skin, severe bruising, and a fast heart rate.

Low platelets are associated with an increased risk of bleeding, bruising, and petechiae, with lower blood counts that impact the ability of the blood to clot. Low white blood cells increase the risk of infections.

==Causes==
Aplastic anemia can be caused by immune disease or exposure to certain chemicals, drugs, radiation, or infection; in about half the cases, a definitive cause is unknown. It is not contagious but can be hereditary (even though most are acquired).

Aplastic anemia is also sometimes associated with exposure to toxins such as benzene or with the use of certain drugs, including chloramphenicol, carbamazepine, felbamate, phenytoin, quinine, and phenylbutazone. However, the probability that these drugs will lead to aplastic anemia in a given patient is very low. Chloramphenicol treatment is associated with aplasia in less than one in 40,000 treatment courses, and carbamazepine aplasia is even rarer.

Exposure to ionizing radiation from radioactive materials or radiation-producing devices is also associated with the development of aplastic anemia. Marie Curie, famous for her pioneering work in the field of radioactivity, died of aplastic anemia after working unprotected with radioactive materials for a long period of time; the damaging effects of ionizing radiation were not then known.

Aplastic anemia is present in up to 2% of patients with acute viral hepatitis.

One known cause is an autoimmune disorder in which white blood cells attack the bone marrow. Acquired aplastic anemia is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease, in which regulatory T cells are decreased and T-bet, a transcription factor and key regulator of Th1 development and function, is upregulated in affected T-cells. As a result of active transcription of the interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) gene by T-bet, IFN-gamma levels are increased, which reduces colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow.

Short-lived aplastic anemia can also be a result of parvovirus infection. In humans, the P antigen (also known as globoside), one of many cellular receptors that contribute to a person&#x27;s blood type, is the cellular receptor for parvovirus B19, which causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children. Because it infects red blood cells as a result of the affinity for the P antigen, parvovirus causes complete cessation of red blood cell production. In most cases, this goes unnoticed, as red blood cells live on average 120 days, and the drop in production does not significantly affect the total number of circulating cells. However, in people with conditions where the cells die early (such as sickle cell disease), parvovirus infection can lead to severe anemia.

More frequently, parvovirus B19 is associated with aplastic crisis, which involves only red blood cells (despite the name). Aplastic anemia involves all cell lines.

Other viruses that have been linked to the development of aplastic anemia include hepatitis, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and HIV.

In some animals, aplastic anemia may have other causes. For example, in the ferret (&quot;Mustela putorius furo&quot;), it is caused by estrogen toxicity, because female ferrets are induced ovulators, so mating is required to bring the female out of heat. Intact females, if not mated, will remain in heat, and after some time the high levels of estrogen will cause the bone marrow to stop producing red blood cells.

==Diagnosis==
Aplastic anemia must be differentiated from pure red cell aplasia. In aplastic anemia, the patient has pancytopenia (i.e., also leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) resulting in a decrease of all formed elements. In contrast, pure red cell aplasia is characterized by a reduction in red cells only. The diagnosis can only be confirmed with a bone marrow examination.

Before this procedure is undertaken, a patient will generally have had other blood tests to find diagnostic clues, including a complete blood count, renal function and electrolytes, liver enzymes, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 and folic acid levels.

Tests that may aid in determining an etiology for aplastic anemia include:
# History of iatrogenic exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy: transient bone marrow suppression
# Vitamin B12 and folate levels: vitamin deficiency
# Liver tests: liver diseases
# Viral studies: viral infections
# Chest X-ray: infections
# X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or ultrasound imaging tests: enlarged lymph nodes (sign of lymphoma), kidneys, and bones in arms and hands (abnormal in Fanconi anemia)
# Antibody test: immune competency
# Blood tests for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
# Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: to rule out other causes of pancytopenia (i.e., neoplastic infiltration or significant myelofibrosis).

==Pathogenesis==
For many years, the cause of acquired aplastic anemia was not clear. Now, autoimmune processes are considered to be responsible. The majority of cases are hypothesized to be the result of T-cell-mediated autoimmunity and destruction of the bone marrow, which leads to defective or nearly absent hematopoiesis. It is suggested that unidentified antigens cause a polyclonal expansion of dysregulated CD4+ T cells and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Ex vivo bone marrow models show an expansion of dysregulated CD8+ T cell populations. Activated T cells also induce apoptosis in hematopoietic stem cells.

Aplastic anemia is associated with increased levels of Th17 cells—which produce pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17—and interferon-γ-producing cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Th17 cell populations also negatively correlate with regulatory T-cell populations, suppressing auto-reactivity to normal tissues, including the bone marrow. Deep phenotyping of regulatory T-cells showed two subpopulations with specific phenotypes, gene expression signatures, and functions.

Studies in patients who responded to immunosuppressive therapy found dominant subpopulations characterized by higher expression of HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR15 (mean age of two groups: 34 and 21 years), FOXP3, CD95, and CCR4; lower expression of CD45RA (mean age: 45 years); and expression of the IL-2/STAT5 pathway. Higher frequency of HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR15 may cause augmented presentation of antigens to CD4+ T-cells, resulting in immune-mediated destruction of the stem cells. In addition, HLA-DR2-expressing cells augment the release of tumor necrosis factor-α, which plays a role in disease pathology.

The hypothesis of aberrant, disordered T-cell populations as the initiators of aplastic anemia is supported by findings that immunosuppressive therapy for T-cells (for example, anti-thymocyte globulin and ciclosporin) results in a response in up to 80% of severe aplastic anemia patients.

CD34+ progenitor cells and lymphocytes in the bone marrow over-express the Fas receptor, the main element in apoptotic signaling. A significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells in the bone marrow of aplastic anemia patients has been demonstrated. This suggests that cytokine-induced and Fas-mediated apoptosis play roles in bone marrow failure because annihilation of CD34+ progenitor cells leads to hematopoietic stem cell deficiency.

===Frequently detected autoantibodies===
A study of blood and bone marrow samples obtained from 18 aplastic anemia patients revealed more than 30 potential specific candidate autoantigens after the serologic screening of a fetal liver library with sera from 8 patients. The human fetal liver cDNA library (chosen because of its high enrichment of CD34+ cells), compared with peripheral blood or the bone marrow, significantly increased the likelihood of detection of possible stem cell autoantigens.

ELISA and Western blot analysis revealed that an IgG antibody response to one of the candidate autoantigens, kinectin, was present in a significant number of patients (39%). In contrast, no antibody was detected in 35 healthy volunteers. Antibody was detected in both transfused and transfusion-naive patients, suggesting that antikinectin autoantibody development was not due to transfusion-related alloreactivity. Negative sera from patients with other autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis) showed a specific association of antikinectin antibodies with aplastic anemia. These results support the hypothesis that immune response to kinectin may be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease.

Kinectin is a large molecule (1,300 amino acid residues) expressed by CD34+ cells. Several kinectin-derived peptides can be processed and presented by HLA I and can induce antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses.

===Bone marrow microenvironment===
A critical factor for healthy stem cell production is the bone marrow microenvironment. Important components are stromal cells, the extracellular matrix, and local cytokine gradients. The hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic elements of the bone marrow closely interact with each other and sustain and maintain the balance of hematopoiesis.

In addition to low numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, aplastic anemia patients have altered hematopoietic niche
* cytotoxic T-cells (polyclonal expansion of dysregulated CD4+ T-cells) trigger apoptosis in bone marrow cells
* activated T-cells induce apoptosis in hematopoietic stem cells
* there is abnormal production of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor
* overexpression of Fas receptor leads to apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells
* poor quality and quantity of regulatory T-cells means failure in suppressing auto-reactivity, which leads to abnormal T-cell expansion
* due to higher amounts of interferon-γ, macrophages are more frequent in the bone marrow of aplastic anemia patients; interferon-mediated loss of hematopoietic stem cells occurs only in the presence of macrophages
* interferon-γ can cause direct exhaustion and depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and indirect reduction of their functions through cells that are part of the bone marrow microenvironment (e.g., macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells)
* increased numbers of B cells produce autoantibodies against hematopoietic stem cells
* increased numbers of adipocytes and decreased numbers of pericytes also play a role in suppressing hematopoiesis

==Treatment==
Treating immune-mediated aplastic anemia involves suppression of the immune system, an effect achieved by daily medicine or, in more severe cases, a bone marrow transplant, a potential cure. The transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor. The multipotent stem cells in the bone marrow reconstitute all three blood cell lines, giving the patient a new immune system, red blood cells, and platelets. However, besides the risk of graft failure, there is also a risk that the newly created white blood cells may attack the rest of the body (&quot;graft-versus-host disease&quot;).

In young patients with an HLA-matched sibling donor, bone marrow transplant can be considered as a first-line treatment. Patients lacking a matched sibling donor typically pursue immunosuppression as a first-line treatment, and matched, unrelated donor transplants are considered second-line therapy.

Treatment often includes a course of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and several months of treatment with ciclosporin to modulate the immune system. Chemotherapy with agents such as cyclophosphamide may also be effective but is more toxic than ATG. Antibody therapy such as ATG targets T cells, which are believed to attack the bone marrow. Corticosteroids are generally ineffective, though they are used to ameliorate serum sickness caused by ATG. Normally, success is judged by bone marrow biopsy six months after initial treatment with ATG.

One prospective study involving cyclophosphamide was terminated early due to a high incidence of mortality from severe infections as a result of prolonged neutropenia.

Before the above treatments became available, patients with low leukocyte counts were often confined to a sterile room or bubble (to reduce risk of infection), as in the case of Ted DeVita.

===Follow-up===
Full blood counts are required on a regular basis to determine whether the patient is still in remission.

Many patients with aplastic anemia also have clones of cells characteristic of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare disease that causes anemia with thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis and is sometimes referred to as AA/PNH. Occasionally PNH dominates over time, with the major manifestation of intravascular hemolysis. The overlap of AA and PNH has been speculated to be an escape mechanism by the bone marrow against destruction by the immune system. Flow cytometry testing is performed regularly in people with previous aplastic anemia to monitor for the development of PNH.

==Prognosis==
Untreated, severe aplastic anemia has a high risk of death. Modern treatment produces a five-year survival rate that exceeds 85%, with younger age associated with higher survival.

Survival rates for stem cell transplants vary depending on the age and availability of a well-matched donor. They are better for patients who have donors that are matched siblings and worse for patients who receive their marrow from unrelated donors. Overall, the five-year survival rate is higher than 75% among recipients of bone marrow transplantation.

Older people (who are generally too frail to undergo bone marrow transplants) and people who are unable to find a good bone marrow match have five-year survival rates of up to 35% when undergoing immune suppression.

Relapses are common. Relapse following ATG/ciclosporin use can sometimes be treated with a repeated course of therapy. In addition, 10–15% of severe aplastic anemia cases evolve into myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. According to one study, 15.9% of children who responded to immunosuppressive therapy eventually relapsed.

Milder disease may resolve on its own.

==Etymology==
&quot;Aplastic&quot; is a combination of two ancient Greek elements: &quot;a-&quot; (meaning &quot;not&quot;) and &quot;-plasis&quot; (&quot;forming into a shape&quot;). Anemia is a combination of the ancient Greek element &quot;an-&quot; (&quot;not&quot;) and &quot;-emia&quot; (Neo-Latin from the Greek &quot;-(h)aimia&quot;, meaning &quot;blood&quot;).

==Epidemiology==
Aplastic anemia is a rare, noncancerous disorder in which the blood marrow is unable to adequately produce blood cells required for survival. It is estimated that the incidence of aplastic anemia is 0.7–4.1 cases per million people worldwide, with the prevalence between men and women being approximately equal. The incidence rate of aplastic anemia in Asia is 2–3 times higher than it is in the West; the incidence in the United States is 300–900 cases per year. The disease most commonly affects adults aged 15–25 and over the age of 60, but it can be observed in all age groups.

The disease is usually acquired during life and not inherited. Acquired cases are often linked to environmental exposures such as chemicals, drugs, and infectious agents that damage the bone marrow and compromise its ability to generate new blood cells. However, in many instances the underlying cause for the disease is not found. This is referred to as idiopathic aplastic anemia and accounts for 75% of cases. This compromises the effectiveness of treatment since treatment of the disease is often aimed at the underlying cause.

Those with a higher risk for aplastic anemia include individuals who are exposed to high-dose radiation or toxic chemicals, take certain prescription drugs, have pre-existing autoimmune disorders or blood diseases, or are pregnant. No screening test currently exists for early detection of aplastic anemia.

<text>Bone marrow is a semi-solid tissue found within the spongy (also known as cancellous) portions of bones. In birds and mammals, bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production (or haematopoiesis). It is composed of hematopoietic cells, marrow adipose tissue, and supportive stromal cells. In adult humans, bone marrow is primarily located in the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and bones of the pelvis. Bone marrow comprises approximately 5% of total body mass in healthy adult humans, such that a person weighing 73 kg (161 lbs) will have around 3.7 kg (8 lbs) of bone marrow.

Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which join the systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birbrair n/a–n/a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; All types of hematopoietic cells, including both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, are created in bone marrow; however, lymphoid cells must migrate to other lymphoid organs (e.g. thymus) in order to complete maturation.

Bone marrow transplants can be conducted to treat severe diseases of the bone marrow, including certain forms of cancer such as leukemia. Several types of stem cells are related to bone marrow. Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow can give rise to hematopoietic lineage cells, and mesenchymal stem cells, which can be isolated from the primary culture of bone marrow stroma, can give rise to bone, adipose, and cartilage tissue.

==Structure==
The composition of marrow is dynamic, as the mixture of cellular and non-cellular components (connective tissue) shifts with age and in response to systemic factors. In humans, marrow is colloquially characterized as &quot;red&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; marrow (, , respectively) depending on the prevalence of hematopoietic cells vs fat cells. While the precise mechanisms underlying marrow regulation are not understood, compositional changes occur according to stereotypical patterns. For example, a newborn baby&#x27;s bones exclusively contain hematopoietically active &quot;red&quot; marrow, and there is a progressive conversion towards &quot;yellow&quot; marrow with age. In adults, red marrow is found mainly in the central skeleton, such as the pelvis, sternum, cranium, ribs, vertebrae and scapulae, and variably found in the proximal epiphyseal ends of long bones such as the femur and humerus. In circumstances of chronic hypoxia, the body can convert yellow marrow back to red marrow to increase blood cell production.

===Hematopoietic components===


At the cellular level, the main functional component of bone marrow includes the progenitor cells which are destined to mature into blood and lymphoid cells. Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day. Marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells which give rise to the three classes of blood cells that are found in circulation: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes).
===Stroma===
The stroma of the bone marrow includes all tissue not directly involved in the marrow&#x27;s primary function of hematopoiesis. Stromal cells may be indirectly involved in hematopoiesis, providing a microenvironment that influences the function and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. For instance, they generate colony stimulating factors, which have a significant effect on hematopoiesis. Cell types that constitute the bone marrow stroma include:
* fibroblasts (reticular connective tissue)
* macrophages, which contribute especially to red blood cell production, as they deliver iron for hemoglobin production.
* adipocytes (fat cells)
* osteoblasts (synthesize bone)
* osteoclasts (resorb bone)
* endothelial cells, which form the sinusoids. These derive from endothelial stem cells, which are also present in the bone marrow.

==Function==

=== Central hematopoietic and antigen-responsive organ ===
That bone marrow is a priming site for T-cell responses to blood-borne antigens was first described in 2003. Mature circulating naïve T cells home to bone marrow sinuses after they have passed through arteries and arterioles. They transmigrate sinus endothelium and enter the parenchyma which contains dendritic cells (DCs). These have a capacity of antigen uptake, processing, and presentation. Cognate interactions between antigen-specific T cells and antigen-presenting DCs (APCs) in parenchyma lead to rapid T-APC cluster formation followed by T cell activation, T cell proliferation and T cell re-circulation to blood. These findings were corroborated and extended in 2013 by in situ two-photon dynamic imaging of mice skulls.

=== Importance for storage and long-term survival of memory B and memory T cells ===
Bone marrow is a nest for migratory memory T cells and a sanctuary for plasma cells. This has implications for adaptive immunity and vaccinology. Memory B and T cells persist in the parenchyma in dedicated survival niches organized by stromal cells. This memory can be maintained over long time periods in the form of quiescent cells or by repeated antigenic restimulation. Bone marrow protects and optimizes immunological memory during dietary restriction. In cancer patients, cancer-reactive memory T cells can arise in bone marrow spontaneously or after specific vaccination. Bone marrow is a center of a variety of immune activities: i) hematopoiesis, ii) osteogenesis, iii) immune responses, iv) distinction between self and non-self antigens, v) central immune regulatory function, vi) storage of memory cells, vii) immune surveillance of the central nervous system, viii) adaptation to energy crisis, ix) provision of mesenchymal stem cells for tissue repair.

===Mesenchymal stem cells===

The bone marrow stroma contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are also known as marrow stromal cells. These are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. MSCs have been shown to differentiate, in vitro or in vivo, into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, marrow adipocytes and beta-pancreatic islets cells.

===Bone marrow barrier===
The blood vessels of the bone marrow constitute a barrier, inhibiting immature blood cells from leaving the marrow. Only mature blood cells contain the membrane proteins, such as aquaporin and glycophorin, that are required to attach to and pass the blood vessel endothelium. Hematopoietic stem cells may also cross the bone marrow barrier, and may thus be harvested from blood.

===Lymphatic role===
The red bone marrow is a key element of the lymphatic system, being one of the primary lymphoid organs that generate lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells. The bone marrow and thymus constitute the primary lymphoid tissues involved in the production and early selection of lymphocytes. Furthermore, bone marrow performs a valve-like function to prevent the backflow of lymphatic fluid in the lymphatic system.

===Compartmentalization===
Biological compartmentalization is evident within the bone marrow, in that certain cell types tend to aggregate in specific areas. For instance, erythrocytes, macrophages, and their precursors tend to gather around blood vessels, while granulocytes gather at the borders of the bone marrow.

==As food==

People have used animal bone-marrow in cuisine worldwide for millennia, as in the famed Milanese Ossobuco.

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===
The normal bone marrow architecture can be damaged or displaced by aplastic anemia, malignancies such as multiple myeloma, or infections such as tuberculosis, leading to a decrease in the production of blood cells and blood platelets. The bone marrow can also be affected by various forms of leukemia, which attacks its hematologic progenitor cells. Furthermore, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy will kill many of the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow, and will therefore result in a depressed immune system. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning are due to damage sustained by the bone marrow cells.

To diagnose diseases involving the bone marrow, a bone marrow aspiration is sometimes performed. This typically involves using a hollow needle to acquire a sample of red bone marrow from the crest of the ilium under general or local anesthesia.

===Imaging===
Medical imaging may provide a limited amount of information regarding bone marrow. Plain film x-rays pass through soft tissues such as marrow and do not provide visualization, although any changes in the structure of the associated bone may be detected. CT imaging has somewhat better capacity for assessing the marrow cavity of bones, although with low sensitivity and specificity. For example, normal fatty &quot;yellow&quot; marrow in adult long bones is of low density (-30 to -100 Hounsfield units), between subcutaneous fat and soft tissue. Tissue with increased cellular composition, such as normal &quot;red&quot; marrow or cancer cells within the medullary cavity will measure variably higher in density.

MRI is more sensitive and specific for assessing bone composition. MRI enables assessment of the average molecular composition of soft tissues and thus provides information regarding the relative fat content of marrow. In adult humans, &quot;yellow&quot; fatty marrow is the dominant tissue in bones, particularly in the (peripheral) appendicular skeleton. Because fat molecules have a high T1-relaxivity, T1-weighted imaging sequences show &quot;yellow&quot; fatty marrow as bright (hyperintense). Furthermore, normal fatty marrow loses signal on fat-saturation sequences, in a similar pattern to subcutaneous fat.

When &quot;yellow&quot; fatty marrow becomes replaced by tissue with more cellular composition, this change is apparent as decreased brightness on T1-weighted sequences. Both normal &quot;red&quot; marrow and pathologic marrow lesions (such as cancer) are darker than &quot;yellow&quot; marrow on T1-weight sequences, although can often be distinguished by comparison with the MR signal intensity of adjacent soft tissues. Normal &quot;red&quot; marrow is typically equivalent or brighter than skeletal muscle or intervertebral disc on T1-weighted sequences.

Fatty marrow change, the inverse of red marrow hyperplasia, can occur with normal aging, though it can also be seen with certain treatments such as radiation therapy. Diffuse marrow T1 hypointensity without contrast enhancement or cortical discontinuity suggests red marrow conversion or myelofibrosis. Falsely normal marrow on T1 can be seen with diffuse multiple myeloma or leukemic infiltration when the water to fat ratio is not sufficiently altered, as may be seen with lower grade tumors or earlier in the disease process.

===Histology===
Bone marrow examination is the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained via biopsy and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

The ratio between myeloid series and erythroid cells is relevant to bone marrow function, and also to diseases of the bone marrow and peripheral blood, such as leukemia and anemia. The normal myeloid-to-erythroid ratio is around 3:1; this ratio may increase in myelogenous leukemias, decrease in polycythemias, and reverse in cases of thalassemia.

===Donation and transplantation===

In a bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic stem cells are removed from a person and infused into another person (allogenic) or into the same person at a later time (autologous). If the donor and recipient are compatible, these infused cells will then travel to the bone marrow and initiate blood cell production. Transplantation from one person to another is conducted for the treatment of severe bone marrow diseases, such as congenital defects, autoimmune diseases or malignancies. The patient&#x27;s own marrow is first killed off with drugs or radiation, and then the new stem cells are introduced. Before radiation therapy or chemotherapy in cases of cancer, some of the patient&#x27;s hematopoietic stem cells are sometimes harvested and later infused back when the therapy is finished to restore the immune system.

Bone marrow stem cells can be induced to become neural cells to treat neurological illnesses, and can also potentially be used for the treatment of other illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel disease. In 2013, following a clinical trial, scientists proposed that bone marrow transplantation could be used to treat HIV in conjunction with antiretroviral drugs; however, it was later found that HIV remained in the bodies of the test subjects.

====Harvesting====
The stem cells are typically harvested directly from the red marrow in the iliac crest, often under general anesthesia. The procedure is minimally invasive and does not require stitches afterwards. Depending on the donor&#x27;s health and reaction to the procedure, the actual harvesting can be an outpatient procedure, or can require 1–2 days of recovery in the hospital.

Another option is to administer certain drugs that stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into circulating blood. An intravenous catheter is inserted into the donor&#x27;s arm, and the stem cells are then filtered out of the blood. This procedure is similar to that used in blood or platelet donation. In adults, bone marrow may also be taken from the sternum, while the tibia is often used when taking samples from infants. In newborns, stem cells may be retrieved from the umbilical cord.

===Fertility Aid===
One of the most damaged areas of the body following chemotherapy is typically the uterus. Following uterine damage due to cancer treatment, follicle damage makes it difficult for individuals to get pregnant even if viable ova are present. With bone marrow stem cell transplants, chemotherapy patients have been able to increase their fertility as follicle damage is repaired. As follicles are necessary for ovum attachment to the endometrium, it is important for these areas to be repaired in order to increase fertility. For individuals who have sustained egg and follicle damage, IVF has been found to be more effective following bone marrow stem cell transplantation.

One human clinical case has shown improvements of uterine lining thickness and overall endometrium repair following bone marrow stem cell transplantation. This repair allowed for the patient to successfully become pregnant and carry to term.

Additional repairs following bone marrow stem cell transplant to the endometrium include increased vascularity and iron levels, with egg implantation clustering around areas with high blood flow.

===Persistent viruses===
Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) a maximum of five DNA viruses per individual have been identified. Included were several herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and human papillomavirus 31. Given the reactivation and/or oncogenic potential of these viruses, their repercussion on hematopoietic and malignant disorders calls for further studies.

==Fossil record==

The earliest fossilised evidence of bone marrow was discovered in 2014 in &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot;, a lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period approximately 370 million years ago. Scientists from Uppsala University and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility used X-ray synchrotron microtomography to study the fossilised interior of the skeleton&#x27;s humerus, finding organised tubular structures akin to modern vertebrate bone marrow. &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot; is closely related to the early tetrapods, which ultimately evolved into the land-dwelling mammals and lizards of the present day.

<text>In photography, flash synchronization or flash sync is the synchronizing the firing of a photographic flash with the opening of the shutter admitting light to photographic film or electronic image sensor.

In cameras with mechanical (clockwork) shutters synchronization is supported by an electrical contact within the shutter mechanism, which closes the circuit at the appropriate moment in the shutter opening process. In electronic digital cameras, the mechanism is usually a programmable electronic timing circuit, which may, in some cameras, take input from a mechanical shutter contact. The flash is connected electrically to the camera either by a cable with a standardized coaxial PC (for Prontor/Compur) 3.5 mm (1/8&quot;) connector (as defined in ISO 519), or via contacts in an &quot;accessory mount&quot; (hot shoe) bracket.

Faster shutter speeds are often better when there is significant ambient illumination, and flash is used to flash fill subjects that are backlit without motion blur, or to increase depth of field by using a small aperture. In another creative use, the photographer of a moving subject may deliberately combine a slow shutter speed with flash exposure in order to record motion blur of the ambient-lit regions of the image superimposed on the flash-lit regions.

==X sync==

X-sync (for &quot;xenon sync&quot;) is the simplest mode; the xenon flash is fired at the instant the shutter is fully open. Electronic flash equipment produces a very short flash. X sync is a mode designed for use with electronic flash. In this mode, the timing of the contacts coincides exactly with the full opening of the shutter, since xenon flashes respond almost instantly.

Due to their construction, focal plane shutters, as used on most single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs), only allow normal xenon flash units to be used at shutter speeds slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, typically at shutter speeds of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon&#x27;s D40 DSLRs). Special electronic flash units for focal-plane shutters fire several times as the slit moves across the film. Electronic shutters used in some digital cameras do not have this limitation and may allow a very high X-sync speed.

==S, M, ME, F, FP, and V sync==

Cameras designed for use with flash bulbs generally had one or more of S (slow) sync, M (medium) sync, F (fast) sync, or FP/FPX (flat peak) sync, designed for use with corresponding bulb types. These sync modes close the contacts a few milliseconds before the shutter is open, to give the flashbulb time to reach peak brightness before exposing the film. Class M bulbs reach their peak illumination 20 milliseconds after ignition, and class F lamps reach their peak at approximately 5 milliseconds.

FP sync was used with FP (flat-peak) flash bulbs designed specifically for use with focal-plane shutters. In these shutters, although each part of the film is exposed for the rated exposure time, the film is exposed by a slit which moves across the film in a time (the &quot;X-sync speed&quot;) of the order of 1/100&quot;; although the exposure of each part of the film may be 1/2000&quot;, the last part of the film is exposed later by the X-sync time than the first part, and a brief flash will illuminate only a strip of film. FP bulbs burned close to full brightness for the full X-sync time, giving time for the moving slit to expose the whole frame with the light of the flash.

The Nikon F offered FP, M, and ME bulb synchronizations, in addition to the X sync.

The Friedrich Deckel Synchro-Compur leaf shutter of the Braun Paxette Reflex offered V, X, and M flash synchronization, whereby V (German: &quot;Vorlauf&quot;) was used in conjunction with self-timer.

==High-speed sync (HSS)==

Some modern xenon flash units have the ability to produce a longer-duration flash to permit flash synchronization at shorter shutter speeds, therefore called high-speed sync (HSS). Instead of delivering one burst of light, the units deliver several smaller bursts over a time interval as short as 1/125 of a second. This allows light to be delivered to the entire area of the film or image sensor even though the shutter is never fully open at any moment, similar to FP sync.

==Rear-curtain sync==
Many digital SLRs include an option to fire the flash just before the closing of the shutter, so that moving objects will show a streak where they came from and a sharp image where they were at the end of the exposure—useful for moving objects to convey a sense of speed. This mode is called &quot;rear-curtain sync&quot; or &quot;2nd-curtain sync&quot;.

<text>An electrician is a tradesperson specializing in electrical wiring of buildings, transmission lines, stationary machines, and related equipment. Electricians may be employed in the installation of new electrical components or the maintenance and repair of existing electrical infrastructure. Electricians may also specialize in wiring ships, airplanes, and other mobile platforms, as well as data and cable lines.

==Terminology==
&quot;Electricians&quot; were originally people who demonstrated or studied the principles of electricity, often electrostatic generators of one form or another. 
In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: lineperson, who work on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the lower voltages utilized inside buildings. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV. Other sub-specialties such as control wiring and fire-alarm may be performed by specialists trained in the devices being installed, or by inside wiremen.
Electricians are trained to one of three levels: Apprentice, Journeyperson, and Master Electrician. In the US and Canada, apprentices work and receive a reduced compensation while learning their trade. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid as a percentage of the Journeyperson&#x27;s pay. Journeymen are electricians who have completed their Apprenticeship and who have been found by the local, State, or National licensing body to be competent in the electrical trade. Master Electricians have performed well in the trade for a period of time, often seven to ten years, and have passed an exam to demonstrate superior knowledge of the National Electrical Code, or NEC.
Service electricians are tasked to respond to requests for isolated repairs and upgrades. They have skills troubleshooting wiring problems, installing wiring in existing buildings, and making repairs. Construction electricians primarily focus on larger projects, such as installing all new electrical system for an entire building, or upgrading an entire floor of an office building as part of a remodeling process. Other specialty areas are marine electricians, research electricians and hospital electricians. &quot;Electrician&quot; is also used as the name of a role in stagecraft, where electricians are tasked primarily with hanging, focusing, and operating stage lighting. In this context, the Master Electrician is the show&#x27;s chief electrician. Although theater electricians routinely perform electrical work on stage lighting instruments and equipment, they are not part of the electrical trade and have a different set of skills and qualifications from the electricians that work on building wiring.
In the film industry and on a television crew the head electrician is referred to as a &quot;Gaffer.&quot;
Electrical contractors are businesses that employ electricians to design, install, and maintain electrical systems. Contractors are responsible for generating bids for new jobs, hiring tradespeople for the job, providing material to electricians in a timely manner, and communicating with architects, electrical and building engineers, and the customer to plan and complete the finished product.

== Training and regulation of trade ==
Many jurisdictions have regulatory restrictions concerning electrical work for safety reasons due to the many hazards of working with electricity. Such requirements may be testing, registration or licensing. Licensing requirements vary between jurisdictions.

=== Australia ===
An electrician&#x27;s license entitles the holder to carry out all types of electrical installation work in Australia without supervision. However, to contract, or offer to contract, to carry out electrical installation work, a licensed electrician must also be registered as an electrical contractor. Under Australian law, electrical work that involves fixed wiring is strictly regulated and must almost always be performed by a licensed electrician or electrical contractor. A local electrician can handle a range of work including air conditioning, light fittings and installation, safety switches, smoke alarm installation, inspection and certification and testing and tagging of electrical appliances.

To provide data, structured cabling systems, home automation &amp; theatre, LAN, WAN and VPN data solutions or phone points, an installer must be licensed as a Telecommunications Cable Provider under a scheme controlled by Australian Communications and Media Authority

Electrical licensing in Australia is regulated by the individual states. In Western Australia, the Department of Commerce tracks licensee&#x27;s and allows the public to search for individually named/licensed Electricians.

Currently in Victoria the apprenticeship lasts for four years, during three of those years the apprentice attends trade school in either a block release of one week each month or one day each week. At the end of the apprenticeship the apprentice is required to pass three examinations, one of which is theory based with the other two practically based. Upon successful completion of these exams, providing all other components of the apprenticeship are satisfactory, the apprentice is granted an A Class licence on application to Energy Safe Victoria (ESV).

An A Class electrician may perform work unsupervised but is unable to work for profit or gain without having the further qualifications necessary to become a Registered Electrical Contractor (REC) or being in the employment of a person holding REC status. However, some exemptions do exist.

In most cases a certificate of electrical safety must be submitted to the relevant body after any electrical works are performed.

Safety equipment used and worn by electricians in Australia (including insulated rubber gloves and mats) needs to be tested regularly to ensure it is still protecting the worker. Because of the high risk involved in this trade, this testing needs to be performed regularly and regulations vary according to state. Industry best practice is the Queensland Electrical Safety Act 2002, and requires six-monthly testing.

=== Canada ===

Training of electricians follows an apprenticeship model, taking four or five years to progress to fully qualified journeyperson level. Typical apprenticeship programs consists of 80-90% hands-on work under the supervision of journeymen and 10-20% classroom training. Training and licensing of electricians is regulated by each province, however professional licenses are valid throughout Canada under Agreement on Internal Trade. An endorsement under the Red Seal Program provides additional competency assurance to industry standards.
In order for individuals to become a licensed electricians, they need to have 9000 hours of practical, on the job training. They also need to attend school for 4 terms and pass a provincial exam. This training enables them to become journeyperson electricians. Furthermore, in British Columbia, an individual can go a step beyond that and become a &quot;FSR&quot;, or field safety representative. This credential gives the ability to become a licensed electrical contractor and to pull permits. Notwithstanding this, some Canadian provinces only grant &quot;permit pulling privileges&quot; to current Master Electricians, that is, a journeyperson who has been engaged in the industry for three years and has passed the Master&#x27;s examination (i.e. Alberta). The various levels of field safety representatives are A, B and C. The only difference between each class is that they are able to do increasingly higher voltage and current work.

===United Kingdom===
The two qualification awarding organisations are City and Guilds and EAL. Electrical competence is required at Level 3 to practice as a &#x27;qualified electrician&#x27; in the UK. Once qualified and demonstrating the required level of competence an Electrician can apply to register for a Joint Industry Board Electrotechnical Certification Scheme card in order to work on building sites or other controlled areas.

Although partly covered during Level 3 training, more in depth knowledge and qualifications can be obtained covering subjects such as Design and Verification or Testing and Inspection among others. These additional qualifications can be listed on the reverse of the JIB card. Beyond this level is additional training and qualifications such as EV charger installations or training and working in specialist areas such as street furniture or within industry.

The Electricity at Work Regulations are a statutory document that covers the use and proper maintenance of electrical equipment and installations within businesses and other organisations such as charities. Parts of the Building Regulations cover the legal requirements of the installation of electrical technical equipment with Part P outlining most of the regulations covering dwellings

Information regarding design, selection, installation and testing of electrical structures is provided in the non-statutory publication &#x27;Requirements for Electrical Installations, IET Wiring Regulations, Eighteenth Edition, BS 7671:2018&#x27; otherwise known as the Wiring Regulations or &#x27;Regs&#x27;. Usual amendments are published on an ad hoc bases when minor changes occur. The first major update of the 18th Edition were published during February 2020 mainly covering the section covering Electric vehicles charger installations although an addendum was published during December 2019 correcting some minor mistakes and adding some small changes. The IET also publish a series of &#x27;Guidance Notes&#x27; in book form that provide further in-depth knowledge.

With the exception of the work covered by Part P of the Building Regulations, such as installing consumer units, new circuits or work in bathrooms, there are no laws that prevent anyone from carrying out some basic electrical work in the UK.

In British English, an electrician is colloquially known as a &quot;spark&quot;.

===United States===

The United States does not offer nationwide licensing and electrical licenses are issued by individual states. There are variations in licensing requirements, however, all states recognize three basic skill categories: level electricians. Journeyperson electricians can work unsupervised provided that they work according to a master&#x27;s direction. Generally, states do not offer journeyperson permits, and journeyperson electricians and other apprentices can only work under permits issued to a master electrician. Apprentices may not work without direct supervision.

Before electricians can work unsupervised, they are usually required to serve an apprenticeship lasting three to five years under the general supervision of a master electrician and usually the direct supervision of a journeyperson electrician. Schooling in electrical theory and electrical building codes is required to complete the apprenticeship program. Many apprenticeship programs provide a salary to the apprentice during training. A journeyperson electrician is a classification of licensing granted to those who have met the experience requirements for on the job training (usually 4,000 to 6,000 hours) and classroom hours (about 144 hours). Requirements include completion of two to six years of apprenticeship training and passing a licensing exam.

==== Reciprocity ====
An electrician&#x27;s license is valid for work in the state where the license was issued. In addition, many states recognize licenses from other states, sometimes called interstate reciprocity participation, although there can be conditions imposed. For example, California reciprocates with Arizona, Nevada, and Utah on the condition that licenses are in good standing and have been held at the other state for five years. Nevada reciprocates with Arizona, California, and Utah. Maine reciprocates with New Hampshire and Vermont at the master level, and the state reciprocates with New Hampshire, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon, Vermont, and Wyoming at the journeyperson level. Colorado maintains a journeyperson alliance with Alaska, Arkansas, the Dakotas, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming.

== Tools ==
Electricians use a range of hand and power tools and instruments.

Some of the more common tools are:
* Conduit Bender: Bender used to bend various types of Electrical Conduit. These come in many variations including hand, electrical, and hydraulic powered.
* Non-Contact Voltage Testers
* Lineperson&#x27;s Pliers: Heavy-duty pliers for general use in cutting, bending, crimping and pulling wire.
* Diagonal Pliers (also known as side cutters or Dikes): Pliers consisting of cutting blades for use on smaller gauge wires, but sometimes also used as a gripping tool for removal of nails and staples.
* Needle-Nose Pliers: Pliers with a long, tapered gripping nose of various size, with or without cutters, generally smaller and for finer work (including very small tools used in electronics wiring).
* Wire Strippers: Plier-like tool available in many sizes and designs featuring special blades to cut and strip wire insulation while leaving the conductor wire intact and without nicks. Some wire strippers include cable strippers among their multiple functions, for removing the outer cable jacket.
* Cable Cutters: Highly leveraged pliers for cutting larger cable.
* Armored Cable Cutters: Commonly referred to by the trademark &#x27;Roto-Split&#x27;, is a tool used to cut the metal sleeve on MC (Metal Clad) cable.
* Multimeter: An instrument for electrical measurement with multiple functions. It is available as analog or digital display. Common features include: voltage, resistance, and current. Some models offer additional functions.
* Unibit or Step-Bit: A metal-cutting drill bit with stepped-diameter cutting edges to enable convenient drilling holes in preset increments in stamped/rolled metal up to about 1.6mm (1/16 inch) thick. Commonly used to create custom knock-outs in a breaker panel or junction box.
* Cord, Rope or Fish Tape. Used to manipulate cables and wires through cavities. The fishing tool is pushed, dropped, or shot into the installed raceway, stud-bay or joist-bay of a finished wall or in a floor or ceiling. Then the wire or cable is attached and pulled back.
* Crimping Tools: Used to apply terminals or splices. These may be hand or hydraulic powered. Some hand tools have ratchets to insure proper pressure. Hydraulic units achieve cold welding, even for aluminum cable.
*Insulation Resistance Tester: Commonly referred to as a Megger, these testers apply several hundred to several thousand volts to cables and equipment to determine the insulation resistance value.
*Knockout Punch: For punching holes into boxes, panels, switchgear, etc. for inserting cable &amp; pipe connectors.
* GFI/GFCI Testers: Used to test the functionality of Ground-Fault Interrupting receptacles.
* Voltmeter: An electrician&#x27;s tool used to measure electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. 
* Other general-use tools include screwdrivers, hammers, reciprocating saws, drywall saws, flashlights, chisels, tongue and groove pliers (Commonly referred to as &#x27;Channellock®&#x27; pliers, a famous manufacturer of this tool) and drills.

==Safety==

In addition to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used to make sure that circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.

Electrical workers, which includes electricians, accounted for 34% of total electrocutions of construction trades workers in the United States between 1992 and 2003.

==Working conditions==
Working conditions for electricians vary by specialization. Generally an electrician&#x27;s work is physically demanding such as climbing ladders and lifting tools and supplies. Occasionally an electrician must work in a cramped space or on scaffolding, and may frequently be bending, squatting or kneeling, to make connections in awkward locations. Construction electricians may spend much of their days in outdoor or semi-outdoor loud and dirty work sites. Industrial electricians may be exposed to the heat, dust, and noise of an industrial plant. Power systems electricians may be called to work in all kinds of adverse weather to make emergency repairs.

==Trade organizations==
Some electricians are union members and work under their union&#x27;s policies.

===Australia===
Electricians can choose to be represented by the Electrical Trade Union (ETU). Electrical Contractors can be represented by the National Electrical &amp; Communications Association or Master Electricians Australia.

===North America===
Some electricians are union members. Some examples of electricians&#x27; unions include the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Canadian Union of Public Employees, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.&lt;br&gt;The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers provides its own apprenticeships through its National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee and the National Electrical Contractors Association. Many merit shop training and apprenticeship programs also exist, including those offered by such as trade associations as Associated Builders and Contractors and Independent Electrical Contractors. These organizations provide comprehensive training, in accordance with U.S. Department of Labor regulations.

===United Kingdom/Ireland===
In the United Kingdom, electricians are represented by several unions including Unite the Union

In the Republic of Ireland there are two self-regulation/self certification bodies RECI Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland and ECSSA.

==Auto electrician==
An auto electrician is a tradesperson specializing in electrical wiring of motor vehicles. Auto electricians may be employed in the installation of new electrical components or the maintenance and repair of existing electrical components. Auto electricians specialize in cars and commercial vehicles. The auto electrical trade is generally more difficult than the electrical trade due to the confined spaces, engineering complexity of modern automotive electrical systems, and working conditions (often roadside breakdowns or on construction sites, mines, quarries to repair machinery etc.) Also the presence of high-current DC electricity makes injury from burns and arc-flash injury possible.

<doc id="196147" wikidata="Q14683" url="?curid=196147" title="House sparrow">
<text>The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in most parts of the world. It is a small bird that has a typical length of and a mass of . Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25 species in the genus &quot;Passer&quot;, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.

The house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitation, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, polar regions, and hot, dry deserts far away from human development. For sustenance, the house sparrow routinely feeds at home and public bird feeding stations, but naturally feeds on the seeds of grains, flowering plants and weeds. However, it is an opportunistic, omnivorous eater, and commonly catches insects, their larvae, caterpillars, invertebrates and many other natural foods.

Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and association with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal&#x27;s conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Description==
===Measurements and shape===
The house sparrow is typically about long, ranging from . The house sparrow is a compact bird with a full chest and a large, rounded head. Its bill is stout and conical with a culmen length of , strongly built as an adaptation for eating seeds. Its tail is short, at long. The wing chord is , and the tarsus is . Wingspan ranges from .

In mass, the house sparrow ranges from . Females usually are slightly smaller than males. The median mass on the European continent for both sexes is about , and in more southerly subspecies is around . Younger birds are smaller, males are larger during the winter, and females are larger during the breeding season. Birds at higher latitudes, colder climates, and sometimes higher altitudes are larger (under Bergmann&#x27;s rule), both between and within subspecies.

===Plumage===
The plumage of the house sparrow is mostly different shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown from the top of its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes at the base of the head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and upper tail coverts are greyish brown.

The male is duller in fresh nonbreeding plumage, with whitish tips on many feathers. Wear and preening expose many of the bright brown and black markings, including most of the black throat and chest patch, called the &quot;bib&quot; or &quot;badge&quot;. The badge is variable in width and general size, and may signal social status or fitness. This hypothesis has led to a &quot;veritable &#x27;cottage industry of studies, which have only conclusively shown that patches increase in size with age. The male&#x27;s bill is dark grey, but black in the breeding season.

The female has no black markings or grey crown. Its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium. Its underparts are pale grey-brown. The female&#x27;s bill is brownish-grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching the black of the male&#x27;s bill.

Juveniles are similar to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and tend to have looser, scruffier plumage, like moulting adults. Juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while juvenile females tend to have white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male, and some juvenile females have male features. The bills of young birds are light yellow to straw, paler than the female&#x27;s bill. Immature males have paler versions of the adult male&#x27;s markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage. By their first breeding season, young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults, though they may still be paler during their first year.

===Voice===
Most house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and frequent chirping call. Transcribed as &quot;chirrup&quot;, &quot;tschilp&quot;, or &quot;philip&quot;, this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds; or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing. In the breeding season, the male gives this call repetitively, with emphasis and speed, but not much rhythm, forming what is described either as a song or an &quot;ecstatic call&quot; similar to a song. Young birds also give a true song, especially in captivity, a warbling similar to that of the European greenfinch.

Aggressive males give a trilled version of their call, transcribed as &quot;chur-&quot;chur-r-r-it-it-it-it&quot;&quot;. This call is also used by females in the breeding season, to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs. House sparrows give a nasal alarm call, the basic sound of which is transcribed as &quot;quer&quot;, and a shrill &quot;chree&quot; call in great distress. Another vocalisation is the &quot;appeasement call&quot;, a soft &quot;quee&quot; given to inhibit aggression, usually given between birds of a mated pair. These vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow, but are shared, with small variations, by all sparrows.

Some variation is seen in the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group, and the Palaearctic &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; group. Birds of the &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; group have grey cheeks, while &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies &quot;P. d. tingitanus&quot; differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. &quot;P. d. balearoibericus&quot; is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than &quot;P. d. bibilicus&quot;. &quot;P. d. bibilicus&quot; is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; group birds. The similar &quot;P. d. persicus&quot; is paler and smaller, and &quot;P. d. niloticus&quot; is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group subspecies, &quot;P. d. hyrcanus&quot; is larger than &quot;P. d. indicus&quot;, &quot;P. d. hufufae&quot; is paler, &quot;P. d. bactrianus&quot; is larger and paler, and &quot;P. d. parkini&quot; is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.

===Identification===
The house sparrow can be confused with a number of other seed-eating birds, especially its relatives in the genus &quot;Passer&quot;. Many of these relatives are smaller, with an appearance that is neater or &quot;cuter&quot;, as with the Dead Sea sparrow. The light brown-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females, and is nearly identical to those of the Spanish and Italian sparrows. The Eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and slenderer with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek. The male Spanish sparrow and Italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns. The Sind sparrow is very similar but smaller, with less black on the male&#x27;s throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

===Names===
The house sparrow was among the first animals to be given a scientific name in the modern system of biological classification, since it was described by Carl Linnaeus, in the 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It was described from a type specimen collected in Sweden, with the name &quot;Fringilla domestica&quot;. Later, the genus name &quot;Fringilla&quot; came to be used only for the common chaffinch and its relatives, and the house sparrow has usually been placed in the genus &quot;Passer&quot; created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.

The bird&#x27;s scientific name and its usual English name have the same meaning. The Latin word , like the English word &quot;sparrow&quot;, is a term for small active birds, coming from a root word referring to speed. The Latin word &quot;domesticus&quot; means &quot;belonging to the house&quot;, like the common name a reference to its association with humans. The house sparrow is also called by a number of alternative English names, including &quot;English sparrow&quot;, chiefly in North America; and &quot;Indian sparrow&quot; or &quot;Indian house sparrow&quot;, for the birds of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. Dialectal names include &quot;sparr&quot;, &quot;sparrer&quot;, &quot;spadger&quot;, &quot;spadgick&quot;, and &quot;philip&quot;, mainly in southern England; &quot;spug&quot; and &quot;spuggy&quot;, mainly in northern England; &quot;spur&quot; and &quot;sprig&quot;, mainly in Scotland; and &quot;spatzie&quot; or &quot;spotsie&quot;, from the German &quot;&quot;, in North America.

===Taxonomy===

The genus &quot;Passer&quot; contains about 25 species, depending on the authority, 26 according to the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;. Most &quot;Passer&quot; species are dull-coloured birds with short, square tails and stubby, conical beaks, between long. Mitochondrial DNA studies suggest that speciation in the genus occurred during the Pleistocene and earlier, while other evidence suggests speciation occurred 25,000 to 15,000 years ago. Within &quot;Passer&quot;, the house sparrow is part of the &quot;Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrows&quot; group and a close relative of the Mediterranean &quot;willow sparrows&quot;.

The taxonomy of the house sparrow and its Mediterranean relatives is complicated. The common type of &quot;willow sparrow&quot; is the Spanish sparrow, which resembles the house sparrow in many respects. It frequently prefers wetter habitats than the house sparrow, and it is often colonial and nomadic. In most of the Mediterranean, one or both species occur, with some degree of hybridisation. In North Africa, the two species hybridise extensively, forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure Spanish sparrows.

In most of Italy, the breeding species is the Italian sparrow, which has an appearance intermediate between those of the house and Spanish sparrows. Its specific status and origin are the subject of much debate, but it may be a case of long-ago hybrid speciation. In the Alps, the Italian sparrow intergrades over a narrow roughly strip with the house sparrow, and some house sparrows migrate into the Italian sparrow&#x27;s range in winter. On the Mediterranean islands of Malta, Gozo, Crete, Rhodes, and Karpathos, other apparently intermediate birds are of unknown status.

===Subspecies===
A large number of subspecies have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;. These subspecies are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; group, and the Oriental &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including &quot;P. d. biblicus&quot;, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; was described as a species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.

Migratory birds of the subspecies &quot;P. d. bactrianus&quot; in the &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group were recorded overlapping with &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; birds without hybridising in the 1970s, so the Soviet scientists Edward I. Gavrilov and M. N. Korelov proposed the separation of the &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group as a separate species. However, &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group and &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; group birds intergrade in a large part of Iran, so this split is rarely recognised.

In North America, house sparrow populations are more differentiated than those in Europe. This variation follows predictable patterns, with birds at higher latitudes being larger and darker and those in arid areas being smaller and paler. However, how much this is caused by evolution or by environment is not clear. Similar observations have been made in New Zealand and in South Africa. The introduced house sparrow populations may be distinct enough to merit subspecies status, especially in North America and southern Africa, and American ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser even gave the subspecies name &quot;P. d. plecticus&quot; to the paler birds of western North America.

;&quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; group
* &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; , the nominate subspecies, is found in most of Europe, across northern Asia to Sakhalin and Kamchatka. It is the most widely introduced subspecies.
* &quot;P. d. balearoibericus&quot; , described from Majorca, is found in the Balearic Islands, southern France, the Balkans, and Anatolia.
* &quot;P. d. tingitanus&quot; , described from Algeria, is found in the Maghreb from Ajdabiya in Libya to Béni Abbès in Algeria, and to Morocco&#x27;s Atlantic coast. It hybridises extensively with the Spanish sparrow, especially in the eastern part of its range.
* &quot;P. d. niloticus&quot; , described from Faiyum, Egypt, is found along the Nile north of Wadi Halfa, Sudan. It intergrades with &quot;bibilicus&quot; in the Sinai, and with &quot;rufidorsalis&quot; in a narrow zone around Wadi Halfa. It has been recorded in Somaliland.
* &quot;P. d. persicus&quot; , described from the Karun River in Khuzestan, Iran, is found in the western and central Iran south of the Alborz mountains, intergrading with &quot;indicus&quot; in eastern Iran, and Afghanistan.
* &quot;P. d. biblicus&quot; , described from Palestine, is found in the Middle East from Cyprus and southeastern Turkey to the Sinai in the west and from Azerbaijan to Kuwait in the east.
;&quot;P. d. indicus&quot; group
* &quot;P. d. hyrcanus&quot; , described from Gorgan, Iran, is found along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea from Gorgan to southeastern Azerbaijan. It intergrades with &quot;P. d. persicus&quot; in the Alborz mountains, and with &quot;P. d. bibilicus&quot; to the west. It is the subspecies with the smallest range.
* &quot;P. d. bactrianus&quot; , described from Tashkent, is found in southern Kazakhstan to the Tian Shan and northern Iran and Afghanistan. It intergrades with &quot;persicus&quot; in Baluchistan and with &quot;indicus&quot; across central Afghanistan. Unlike most other house sparrow subspecies, it is almost entirely migratory, wintering in the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. It is found in open country rather than in settlements, which are occupied by the Eurasian tree sparrow in its range. There is an exceptional record from Sudan.
* &quot;P. d. parkini&quot; , described from Srinagar, Kashmir, is found in the western Himalayas from the Pamir Mountains to southeastern Nepal. It is migratory, like &quot;P. d. bactrianus&quot;.
* &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; , described from Bangalore, is found in the Indian subcontinent south of the Himalayas, in Sri Lanka, western Southeast Asia, eastern Iran, southwestern Arabia and southern Israel.
* &quot;P. d. hufufae&quot; , described from Hofuf in Saudi Arabia, is found in northeastern Arabia.
* &quot;P. d. rufidorsalis&quot; , described from Khartoum, Sudan, is found in the Nile valley from Wadi Halfa south to Renk in northern South Sudan, and in eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia to the Red Sea coast in Eritrea. It has also been introduced to Mohéli in the Comoros.

==Distribution and habitat==

The house sparrow originated in the Middle East and spread, along with agriculture, to most of Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Since the mid-19th century, it has reached most of the world, chiefly due to deliberate introductions, but also through natural and shipborne dispersal. Its introduced range encompasses most of North America (including Bermuda), Central America, southern South America, southern Africa, part of West Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and islands throughout the world. It has greatly extended its range in northern Eurasia since the 1850s, and continues to do so, as was shown by its colonisation around 1990 of Iceland and Rishiri Island, Japan. The extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed wild bird on the planet.

===Introduction===
The house sparrow has become highly successful in most parts of the world where it has been introduced. This is mostly due to its early adaptation to living with humans, and its adaptability to a wide range of conditions. Other factors may include its robust immune response, compared to the Eurasian tree sparrow. Where introduced, it can extend its range quickly, sometimes at a rate over per year. In many parts of the world, it has been characterised as a pest, and poses a threat to native birds. A few introductions have died out or been of limited success, such as those to Greenland and Cape Verde.

The first of many successful introductions to North America occurred when birds from England were released in New York City, in 1852, intended to control the ravages of the linden moth. In North America, the house sparrow now occurs from the Northwest Territories of Canada to southern Panama, and it is one of the most abundant birds of the continent. The house sparrow was first introduced to Australia in 1863 at Melbourne and is common throughout the eastern part of the continent as far north as Cape York, but has been prevented from establishing itself in Western Australia, where every house sparrow found in the state is killed. House sparrows were introduced in New Zealand in 1859, and from there reached many of the Pacific islands, including Hawaii.

In southern Africa, birds of both the European subspecies (&quot;P. d. domesticus&quot;) and the Indian subspecies (&quot;P. d. indicus&quot;) were introduced around 1900. Birds of &quot;P. d. domesticus&quot; ancestry are confined to a few towns, while &quot;P. d. indicus&quot; birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this rapid spread, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur and thrive in urban habitats. In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common in most of the southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to the fringes of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.

===Habitat===
The house sparrow is closely associated with human habitation and cultivation. It is not an obligate commensal of humans as some have suggested: birds of the migratory Central Asian subspecies usually breed away from humans in open country, and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans. The only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra. Well adapted to living around humans, it frequently lives and even breeds indoors, especially in factories, warehouses, and zoos. It has been recorded breeding in an English coal mine below ground, and feeding on the Empire State Building&#x27;s observation deck at night. It reaches its greatest densities in urban centres, but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs, where insects are more abundant. On a larger scale, it is most abundant in wheat-growing areas such as the Midwestern United States.

It tolerates a variety of climates, but prefers drier conditions, especially in moist tropical climates. It has several adaptations to dry areas, including a high salt tolerance and an ability to survive without water by ingesting berries. In most of eastern Asia, the house sparrow is entirely absent, replaced by the Eurasian tree sparrow. Where these two species overlap, the house sparrow is usually more common than the Eurasian tree sparrow, but one species may replace the other in a manner that ornithologist Maud Doria Haviland described as &quot;random, or even capricious&quot;. In most of its range, the house sparrow is extremely common, despite some declines, but in marginal habitats such as rainforest or mountain ranges, its distribution can be spotty.

==Behaviour==
===Social behaviour===
The house sparrow is a very social bird. It is gregarious during all seasons when feeding, often forming flocks with other species of birds. It roosts communally while breeding nests are usually grouped together in clumps. House sparrows also engage in social activities such as dust or water bathing and &quot;social singing&quot;, in which birds call together in bushes. The house sparrow feeds mostly on the ground, but it flocks in trees and bushes. At feeding stations and nests, female house sparrows are dominant despite their smaller size, and they can fight over males in the breeding season.

===Sleep and roosting===
House sparrows sleep with the bill tucked underneath the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs before and after the birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.

===Body maintenance===
Dust or water bathing is common and often occurs in groups. Anting is rare. Head scratching is done with the leg over the drooped wing.

===Feeding===

As an adult, the house sparrow mostly feeds on the seeds of grains and weeds, but it is opportunistic and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.

Several studies of the house sparrow in temperate agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers corn: oats, wheat or maize. Rural birds tend to eat more waste seed from animal dung and seed from fields while urban birds tend to eat more commercial bird seed and weed seed. In urban areas, the house sparrow also feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.

Animals form another important part of the house sparrow&#x27;s diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, dipteran flies, and aphids are especially important. Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. Young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching. They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In most places, grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings. True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young. House sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.

The gut microbiota of house sparrows differs between chicks and adults, with Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria) decreasing in chicks when they get to around 9 days old, whilst the relative abundance of Bacillota increase.

===Locomotion===
The house sparrow&#x27;s flight is direct (not undulating) and flapping, averaging and about 15 wingbeats per second. On the ground, the house sparrow typically hops rather than walks. It can swim when pressed to do so by pursuit from predators. Captive birds have been recorded diving and swimming short distances under water.

=== Dispersal and migration ===
Most house sparrows do not move more than a few kilometres during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, &quot;P. d. bactrianus&quot; and &quot;P. d. parkini&quot;, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.

===Breeding===

House sparrows can breed in the breeding season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes attempt to do so. Some birds breeding for the first time in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.

Males take up nesting sites before the breeding season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by moving up and down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft &quot;dee-dee-dee&quot; call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.

The house sparrow is monogamous, and typically mates for life, but birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother&#x27;s mate. Males guard their mates carefully to avoid being cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds is tied to the holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.

House sparrows in natural small populations, as can occur on islands, exhibit inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is manifested as lower survival probability and production of fewer offspring, and can occur as a result of the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. However sparrows in such populations do not appear to avoid inbreeding.

====Nesting====
Nest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, and tree hollows, are also used. A sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches, but more frequently uses the nests of other birds such as those of swallows in banks and cliffs, and old tree cavity nests. It usually uses deserted nests, though sometimes it usurps active ones by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe, putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters, and thereby contributing to their population declines.

Especially in warmer areas, the house sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the branches of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.
Usually the couples repeat copulation many times. Every copulation is followed by some break of 3 to 4 seconds, and in that time both pair change their position by some distance.
The nest is usually domed, though it may lack a roof in enclosed sites. It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a middle layer of dead grass and leaves, and a lining of feathers, as well as of paper and other soft materials. Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30 cm (8 × 12 in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.

House sparrows&#x27; nests support a wide range of scavenging insects, including nest flies such as &quot;Neottiophilum praestum&quot;, &quot;Protocalliphora&quot; blowflies, and over 1,400 species of beetle.

====Eggs and young====

Clutches usually comprise four or five eggs, though numbers from one to 10 have been recorded. At least two clutches are usually laid, and up to seven a year may be laid in the tropics or four a year in temperate latitudes. When fewer clutches are laid in a year, especially at higher latitudes, the number of eggs per clutch is greater. Central Asian house sparrows, which migrate and have only one clutch a year, average 6.5 eggs in a clutch. Clutch size is also affected by environmental and seasonal conditions, female age, and breeding density.

Some intraspecific brood parasitism occurs, and instances of unusually large numbers of eggs in a nest may be the result of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.
The eggs are white, bluish white, or greenish white, spotted with brown or grey. Subelliptical in shape, they range from in length and in width, have an average mass of , and an average surface area of . Eggs from the tropical subspecies are distinctly smaller. Eggs begin to develop with the deposition of yolk in the ovary a few days before ovulation. In the day between ovulation and laying, egg white forms, followed by eggshell. Eggs laid later in a clutch are larger, as are those laid by larger females, and egg size is hereditary. Eggs decrease slightly in size from laying to hatching. The yolk comprises 25% of the egg, the egg white 68%, and the shell 7%. Eggs are watery, being 79% liquid, and otherwise mostly protein.

The female develops a brood patch of bare skin and plays the main part in incubating the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them. The female spends the night incubating during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14 days, and exceptionally for as many as 17 or as few as 9. The length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season.

Young house sparrows remain in the nest for 11 to 23 days, normally 14 to 16 days. During this time, they are fed by both parents. As newly hatched house sparrows do not have sufficient insulation, they are brooded for a few days, or longer in cold conditions. The parents swallow the droppings produced by the hatchlings during the first few days; later, the droppings are moved up to away from the nest.

The chicks&#x27; eyes open after about 4 days and, at an age of about 8 days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing intensive begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it during the same period of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after 1 or 2 days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.

House sparrows in natural small populations, as can occur on islands, exhibit inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is manifested as lower survival probability and production of fewer offspring, and can occur as a result of the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. However sparrows in such populations do not appear to avoid inbreeding.

==Survival==
In adult house sparrows, annual survival is 45–65%. After fledging and leaving the care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens as they grow older and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19 years and 9 months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23 years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.

===Predation===

The house sparrow&#x27;s main predators are cats and birds of prey, but many other animals prey on them, including corvids, squirrels, and even humans—the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people in many parts of the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations. The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.

===Parasites and disease===
The house sparrow is host to a huge number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The commonly recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. &quot;Salmonella&quot; is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. &quot;Salmonella&quot; epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare. House sparrows are also infected by haemosporidian parasites, but less so in urban than in rural areas &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; has been detected in sparrows in northwestern China where they pose a risk due to their meat being consumed in the region.

The house sparrow is infested by a number of external parasites, which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows. In Europe, the most common mite found on sparrows is &quot;Proctophyllodes&quot;, the most common ticks are &quot;Argas reflexus&quot; and &quot;Ixodes arboricola&quot;, and the most common flea on the house sparrow is &quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot;. &quot;Dermanyssus&quot; blood-feeding mites are also common ectoparasites of house sparrows, and these mites can enter human habitation and bite humans, causing a condition known as gamasoidosis. A number of chewing lice occupy different niches on the house sparrow&#x27;s body. &quot;Menacanthus&quot; lice occur across the house sparrow&#x27;s body, where they feed on blood and feathers, while &quot;Brueelia&quot; lice feed on feathers and &quot;Philopterus fringillae&quot; occurs on the head.

==Physiology==

House sparrows express strong circadian rhythms of activity in the laboratory. They were among the first bird species to be seriously studied in terms of their circadian activity and photoperiodism, in part because of their availability and adaptability in captivity, but also because they can &quot;find their way&quot; and remain rhythmic in constant darkness.

==Relationships with humans==

The house sparrow is closely associated with humans. They are believed to have become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. The Turkestan subspecies (&quot;P. d. bactrianus&quot;) is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. Usually, the house sparrow is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed.

The house sparrow has long been used as a food item. From around 1560 to at least the 19th century in northern Europe, earthenware &quot;sparrow pots&quot; were hung from eaves to attract nesting birds so the young could be readily harvested. Wild birds were trapped in nets in large numbers, and sparrow pie was a traditional dish, thought, because of the association of sparrows with lechery, to have aphrodisiac properties. A traditional Indian medicine, &quot;Ciṭṭukkuruvi lēkiyam&quot; in Tamil, was sold with similar aphrodisiac claims. Sparrows were also trapped as food for falconers&#x27; birds and zoo animals. During the 1870s, there were debates on the damaging effects of sparrows in the House of Commons in England. In the early part of the 20th century, sparrow clubs culled many millions of birds and eggs in an attempt to control numbers of this perceived pest, but with only a localised impact on numbers. Sparrows were also persecuted in Germany from at least 1650 until 1970. House sparrows have been kept as pets at many times in history, though they have no bright plumage or attractive songs, and raising them is difficult. The house sparrow has an extremely large range and population, so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on the IUCN Red List.

==Population decline==
The IUCN estimates for the global population runs up to nearly 1.4 billion individuals, second among all wild birds perhaps only to the red-billed quelea in abundance (although the quelea is, unlike the sparrow, restricted to a single continent and has never been subject to human introductions). However, populations have been declining in many parts of the world, especially near its Eurasian places of origin. These declines were first noticed in North America, where they were initially attributed to the spread of the house finch, but have been most severe in Western Europe. Declines have even occurred in Australia, where the house sparrow was introduced recently. While no serious declines had been reported from Eastern Europe by 2006, as of 2023, a 50% decrease of the sparrow population has been registered in Bulgaria.

In Great Britain, populations peaked in the early 1970s, but have since declined by 68% overall, and about 90% in some regions. The RSPB lists the house sparrow&#x27;s UK conservation status as red. In London, the house sparrow almost disappeared from the central city. The numbers of house sparrows in the Netherlands have dropped in half since the 1980s, so the house sparrow is even considered an endangered species. This status came to widespread attention after a female house sparrow, referred to as the &quot;dominomus&quot;, was killed after knocking down dominoes arranged as part of an attempt to set a world record. These declines are not unprecedented, as similar reductions in population occurred when the internal combustion engine replaced horses in the 1920s and a major source of food in the form of grain spillage was lost.

Declines have been particularly apparent even in North America, where the house sparrow is invasive in some states. Introduced to Philadelphia initially in 1852 the house sparrow rapidly spread across the nation. However, the bird has largely disappeared from the city nowadays and overall, it is estimated to have declined in North America by 84% since 1966.

In South Asia, the house sparrow has largely vanished from major cities such as Karachi, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, and Lahore. In general, the house sparrow population has been on the decline in many Asian countries, and this is quite evident in India. 

Various causes for the dramatic decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks, possibly facilitated by the elimination of bushes which the sparrows use to hide, electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases such as avian malaria. A shortage of nesting sites caused by changes in urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A primary cause of the decline seems to be an insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.

Protecting insect habitats on farms and planting native plants in cities benefit the house sparrow, as does establishing urban green spaces. To raise awareness of threats to the house sparrow, World Sparrow Day has been celebrated on 20 March across the world since 2010.
To promote the conservation of sparrow, in 2012, the house sparrow was declared as the state bird of Delhi.

===Cultural associations===
To many people across the world, the house sparrow is the most familiar wild animal and, because of its association with humans and familiarity, it is frequently used to represent the common and vulgar, or the lewd. One of the reasons for the introduction of house sparrows throughout the world was their association with the European homeland of many immigrants. Birds usually described later as sparrows are referred to in many works of ancient literature and religious texts in Europe and western Asia. These references may not always refer specifically to the house sparrow, or even to small, seed-eating birds, but later writers who were inspired by these texts often had the house sparrow in mind. In particular, sparrows were associated by the ancient Greeks with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, due to their perceived lustfulness, an association echoed by later writers such as Chaucer and Shakespeare. Jesus&#x27;s use of &quot;sparrows&quot; as an example of divine providence in the Gospel of Matthew also inspired later references, such as that in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the Gospel hymn &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&quot;.
G37
 The house sparrow is very rarely represented in ancient Egyptian art, but an Egyptian hieroglyph is based on it. The sparrow hieroglyph had no phonetic value and was used as a determinative in words to indicate small, narrow, or bad. An alternative view is that the hieroglyph meant &quot;a prolific man&quot; or &quot;the revolution of a year&quot;.

<text>The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) is a passerine bird in the sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it is known as the tree sparrow, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or German sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.

The Eurasian tree sparrow&#x27;s untidy nest is built in a natural cavity, a hole in a building, or the disused nest of a European magpie or white stork. The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.

The Eurasian tree sparrow is widespread in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe, it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow&#x27;s extensive range and large population ensure that it is not endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.

==Description==
The Eurasian tree sparrow is long, with a wingspan of about and a weight of , making it roughly 10% smaller than the house sparrow. The adult&#x27;s crown and nape are rich chestnut, and there is a kidney-shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek; the chin, throat, and the area between the bill and throat are black. The upperparts are light brown, streaked with black, and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars. The legs are pale brown, and the bill is lead-blue in summer, becoming almost black in winter.

This sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between the sexes; the juvenile also resembles the adult, although the colours tend to be duller. Its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages; the smaller size and brown, not grey, crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow. Adult and juvenile Eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete moult in the autumn, and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat. The change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth and a generally higher water content in the body.

The Eurasian tree sparrow has no true song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of &quot;tschip&quot; calls given by unpaired or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps are used in social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh &quot;teck&quot;. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from the small size of the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.

==Taxonomy==

The Old World sparrow genus &quot;Passer&quot; is a group of small passerine birds that is believed to have originated in Africa, and which contains 15–25 species depending on the authority. Its members are typically found in open, lightly wooded, habitats, although several species, notably the house sparrow (&quot;P. domesticus&quot;) have adapted to human habitations. Most species in the genus are typically long, predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks. They are primarily ground-feeding seed-eaters, although they also consume invertebrates, especially when breeding. The Eurasian species is not closely related to the American tree sparrow (&quot;Spizelloides arborea&quot;), which is in a different family, the New World sparrows.

The Eurasian tree sparrow&#x27;s binomial name is derived from two Latin words: &quot;passer&quot;, &quot;sparrow&quot;, and &quot;montanus&quot;, &quot;of the mountains&quot; (from &quot;mons&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;). The Eurasian tree sparrow was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Fringilla montana&quot;, but, along with the house sparrow, it was soon moved from the finches (family Fringillidae) into the new genus &quot;Passer&quot; created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The Eurasian tree sparrow&#x27;s common name is given because it prefers tree holes for nesting. This name, and the scientific name &quot;montanus&quot;, do not appropriately describe this species&#x27;s habitat preferences: the German name &quot;Feldsperling&quot; and the Hungarian name &quot;mezei veréb&quot; (&quot;field sparrow&quot;) comes closer to doing so.

===Subspecies===
This species varies little in appearance across its large range, and the differences between the seven extant subspecies recognised by Clement are slight. At least 15 other subspecies have been proposed, but they are considered to be intermediates of the listed subspecies.
* The European tree sparrow (&quot;P. m. montanus&quot;), the nominate subspecies, ranges across Europe except for the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, southern Greece and the former Yugoslavia. It also breeds in Asia east to the Lena River and south to the northern regions of Turkey, the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and Mongolia and in North Korea.
* The Caucasian tree sparrow (&quot;P. m. transcaucasicus&quot;), described by Sergei Aleksandrovich Buturlin in 1906, breeds from the southern regions of the Caucasus east to northern Iran. It is duller and greyer than the nominate subspecies.
* The Afghan tree sparrow (&quot;P. m. dilutus&quot;), described by Charles Wallace Richmond in 1856, is resident in extreme northeastern Iran, northern Pakistan and northwestern India. It also occurs further north, from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan east to China. Compared to &quot;P. m. montanus&quot;, it is paler, with sandy-brown upperparts.
* The Tibetan tree sparrow (&quot;P. m. tibetanus&quot;), the largest subspecies by size, was described by Stuart Baker in 1925. It is found in the northern Himalayas, from Nepal east through Tibet to northwestern China. It resembles &quot;P. m. dilutus&quot;, but is darker.
* &quot;P. m. saturatus&quot;, described by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1885, breeds in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. It is deeper brown than the nominate subspecies and has a larger bill.
* &quot;P. m. malaccensis&quot;, described by Alphonse Dubois in 1885, is found from the southern Himalayas east to Hainan and Indonesia. It is a dark-coloured subspecies, like &quot;P. m. saturatus&quot;, but is smaller and more heavily streaked on its upperparts.
* &quot;P. m. hepaticus&quot;, described by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1948, breeds from northeastern Assam to northwestern Burma. It is similar in appearance to &quot;P. m. saturatus&quot;, but redder on its head and upperparts.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eurasian tree sparrow&#x27;s natural breeding range comprises most of temperate Europe and Asia south of about latitude 68°N (north of this the summers are too cold, with July average temperatures below ) and through Southeast Asia to Java and Bali. It formerly bred in the Faroes, Malta and Gozo. In South Asia it is found mainly in the temperate zone. It is sedentary over most of its extensive range, but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for the winter, and small numbers leave southern Europe for North Africa and the Middle East. The eastern subspecies &quot;P. m. dilutus&quot; reaches coastal Pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern China in autumn.

The Eurasian tree sparrow has been introduced outside its native range but has not always become established, possibly due to competition with the house sparrow. It was introduced successfully to Sardinia, eastern Indonesia, the Philippines and Micronesia, but introductions to New Zealand and Bermuda did not take root. Ship-carried birds colonised Borneo. This sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to Gibraltar, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Iceland.
In North America, a population of about 15,000 birds has become established around St. Louis and neighbouring parts of Illinois and southeastern Iowa. These sparrows are descended from 12 birds imported from Germany and released in late April 1870 as part of a project to enhance the native North American avifauna. Within its limited US range of about , the Eurasian tree sparrow has to compete with the house sparrow in urban centres, and is therefore mainly found in parks, farms and rural woods. The American population is sometimes referred to as the &quot;German sparrow&quot;, to distinguish it from both the native American tree sparrow species and the much more widespread &quot;English&quot; house sparrow.

In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is present in Melbourne, towns in central and northern Victoria and some centres in the Riverina region of New South Wales. It is a prohibited species in Western Australia, where it often arrives on ships from Southeast Asia.

Despite its scientific name, &quot;Passer montanus&quot;, this is not typically a mountain species, and reaches only in Switzerland, although it has bred at in the northern Caucasus and as high as in Nepal. In Europe, it is frequently found on coasts with cliffs, in empty buildings, in pollarded willows along slow water courses, or in open countryside with small isolated patches of woodland. The Eurasian tree sparrow shows a strong preference for nest-sites near wetland habitats and avoids breeding on intensively managed mixed farmland.

When the Eurasian tree sparrow and the larger house sparrow occur in the same area, the house sparrow generally breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both &quot;Passer&quot; species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows may be found in settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird, and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats.
==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

The Eurasian tree sparrow reaches breeding maturity within a year from hatching, and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face. Some nests are not in holes as such, but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush. Roof cavities in houses may be used, and in the tropics, the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah can serve as a nest site. This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a European magpie, or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the white stork, white-tailed eagle, osprey, black kite or grey heron. It will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces, such as the barn swallow, house martin, sand martin or European bee-eater.

Pairs may breed in isolation or loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. In a Spanish study, boxes made from a mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5 °C warmer than their wooden counterparts.

The male calls from near the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate. He may also carry nest material into the nest hole. The display and nest building are repeated in autumn. The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests, particularly those where nestlings had hatched. Empty nest boxes, and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds, such as tits, pied flycatchers or common redstarts, are rarely used for the autumn display.

The untidy nest is composed of hay, grass, wool or other material and lined with feathers, which improve the thermal insulation. A complete nest consists of three layers; base, lining and dome. The typical clutch is five or six eggs (rarely more than four in Malaysia), white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots, small blotches, or speckling; they are in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12–13 days before the altricial, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15–18 days elapse before they fledge. Two or three broods may be raised each year; birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs, but the reverse is true for second and third clutches. Females that copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time, so within-pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs&#x27; reproductive ability. There is a significant level of promiscuity; in a Hungarian study, more than 9% of chicks were sired by extra-pair males, and 20% of the broods contained at least one extra-pair young.

Hybridisation between the Eurasian tree sparrow and the house sparrow has been recorded in many parts of the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (&quot;P. hispaniolensis&quot;) and Italian sparrows (&quot;P. italiae&quot;), was recorded in Malta in 1975.

===Feeding===
The Eurasian tree sparrow is a predominantly seed and grain-eating bird which feeds on the ground in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and goosefoot, spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts. It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.

Adults use a variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings, and aquatic sites play a key role in providing adequate diversity and availability of suitable invertebrate prey to allow successful chick rearing throughout the long breeding season of this multi-brooded species. Large areas of formerly occupied farmland no longer provide these invertebrate resources due to the effects of intensive farming, and the availability of supplementary seed food within of the nest site does not influence nest-site choice, or affect the number of young raised.

In winter, seed resources are most likely to be a key limiting factor. At this time of year, individuals in a flock form linear dominance hierarchies, but there is no strong relation between the size of the throat patch and position in that hierarchy. This is in contrast to the house sparrow; in that species, fights to establish dominance are reduced by the display of the throat patch, the size of which acts as a signalling &quot;badge&quot; of fitness. Although there is evidence that the black throat patch of male, but not female, tree sparrows predicts fighting success in foraging flocks.

The risk of predation affects feeding strategies. A study showed that increased distance between shelter and a food supply meant that birds visited a feeder in smaller flocks, spent less time on it and were more vigilant when far from shelter. Sparrows can feed as &quot;producers&quot;, searching for food directly, or &quot;scroungers&quot;, just joining other flock members who have already discovered food. Scrounging was 30% more likely at exposed feeding sites, although this is not due to increased anti-predator vigilance. A possible explanation is that riskier places are used by individuals with lower fat reserves.

===Prey===
Predators of the Eurasian tree sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and sometimes long-eared owl and white stork. It does not appear to be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats, and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.

Many species of bird lice are present on the birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus &quot;Knemidocoptes&quot; have been known to infest populations, resulting in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by &quot;Protocalliphora&quot; blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.

Eurasian tree sparrows are also subject to bacterial and viral infections. Bacteria have been shown to be an important factor in the failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality, and mass deaths due to &quot;Salmonella&quot; infection have been noted in Japan. Avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations, and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of H5N1 that was highly virulent to chickens.

The immune response of Eurasian tree sparrows is less robust than that of the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house sparrow and Eurasian tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.

=== Temperature regulation ===
Eurasian tree sparrows exhibit various physiological adaptations to seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod. When exposed to shorter photoperiods and colder temperatures in winter, Eurasian tree sparrows increased body mass, increased basal metabolic rate, increased cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity, and increased thyroid hormone activity, with temperature having a greater effect than photoperiod. Increasing body mass allows these birds to store more energy, while their increased basal metabolic rate is due to a higher amount of energy needed to maintain their body temperature in colder conditions. Another study also found that during the winter, Eurasian tree sparrows also exhibited higher levels of thyroid hormone T3, which helps regulate the body’s use of energy. The birds’ increased T3 levels was correlated with increased heat production. 

==Conservation status==

The Eurasian tree sparrow has a large range estimated as and a population of 190–310 million individuals. Although the population is declining, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30% in 10 years or three generations). For these reasons, the species&#x27; conservation status is evaluated at the global level as being of Least Concern.

Although the Eurasian tree sparrow has been expanding its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining in much of western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations seems to have been particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which Eurasian tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in Eurasian tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.

==Relationships with humans==

The Eurasian tree sparrow is seen as a pest in some areas. In Australia, it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its droppings. Quarantine rules prohibit the transport of this species into Western Australia.

In the 19th century, there were massive campaigns to catch and kill sparrows in several European countries, including France, Prussia, Hungary, Baden.

The Paramount leader of China, Mao Zedong attempted in April 1958 to reduce crop damage by Eurasian tree sparrows, which was estimated to be of grain per bird each year, by mobilising millions of people and many scarecrows to drive the birds to death by exhaustion. Although successful at reducing the sparrow population, the &quot;Four Pests campaign&quot; overlooked the numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by the birds. Crop yields collapsed, exacerbating a famine that led to the deaths of 30 million people between 1959 and 1961. The Eurasian tree sparrow&#x27;s consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and the common asparagus beetle (&quot;Crioceris aspergi&quot;).

The Eurasian tree sparrow has long been depicted in Chinese and Japanese art, often on a plant spray or in a flying flock, and representations by oriental artists including Hiroshige have featured on the postage stamps of Antigua and Barbuda, Central African Republic, China, and the Gambia. More straightforward illustrations were used on the stamps of Belarus, Belgium, Cambodia, Estonia, and Taiwan. The fluttering of the bird gave rise to a traditional Japanese dance, the &quot;Suzume Odori&quot;, developed in Sendai, which was depicted by artists such as Hokusai.

In the Philippines, where it is one of several species referred to as &quot;maya&quot;, and is sometimes specifically referred to as the &quot;mayang simbahan&quot; (&quot;church maya&quot; or &quot;church sparrow&quot;), the Eurasian tree sparrow is the most common bird in the cities. Many urban Filipinos confuse it with the former national bird of the Philippines, the black-headed munia – also called a &quot;maya&quot;, but specifically differentiated in folk taxa as the &quot;mayang pula&quot; (&quot;red maya&quot;).

<text>A presidency is an administration or the executive, the collective administrative and governmental entity that exists around an office of president of a state or nation. Although often the executive branch of government, and often personified by a single elected person who holds the office of &quot;president&quot;, in practice, the presidency includes a much larger collective of people, such as chiefs of staff, advisers and other bureaucrats. Although often led by a single person, presidencies can also be of a collective nature, such as the presidency of the European Union is held on a rotating basis by the various national governments of the member states. Alternatively, the term presidency can also be applied to the governing authority of some churches, and may even refer to the holder of a non-governmental office of president in a corporation, business, charity, university, etc. or the institutional arrangement around them. For example, &quot;the presidency of the Red Cross refused to support his idea.&quot; Rules and support to discourage vicarious liability leading to unnecessary pressure and the early termination of term have not been clarified. These may not be as yet supported by state let initiatives. Contributory liability and fraud may be the two most common ways to become removed from term of office and/or to prevent re-election.

==Presidency by country==

===American presidency===
In the United States, the presidency is headed by the president, who has many roles, such as:
* &quot;Chief of state&quot;: the chief public representative of a country, who may also be the head of government.
* &quot;Commander in chief of the Armed Forces&quot;: the civilian commander of a nation&#x27;s military forces.
* &quot;Chief legislator&quot;: gives information to Congress to consider through the state of the Union address and recommendations for consideration of new statutes.
* &quot;Chief diplomat&quot;: the president is both a national spokesman and a world leader. As representative of a country of immigrants with ties around the globe, the president is expected to defend America&#x27;s security and economic interests, and also to promote democratic principles and human rights internationally. Several presidents whose domestic policies were frustrated by an uncooperative Congress have focused their attention on foreign affairs, where their power and freedom to determine policy was less hindered.
* &quot;Chief executive&quot;: the president serves as the government&#x27;s chief administrative officer, with the responsibility to see that the laws are faithfully executed. The president also appoints officials, with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The United States holds their presidential election every four years. At the national convention, major and minor political parties nominate candidates for the president and vice president. Citizens then vote on the presidential and vice presidential candidate of their choice. However, these votes do not elect a candidate directly. Instead, the votes are sent to the Electoral College, and cast ballots for presidential electors. The candidate with a majority in the Electoral College will win the presidential or vice presidential election.

===Brazilian presidency===
As a republic with a presidential executive, Brazil grants significant powers to the president. According to the Federal Constitution, the president effectively controls the executive branch, represents the country abroad, and appoints the cabinet and, with the approval of the Federal Senate, the judges for the Supreme Federal Court. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The president also have significant lawmaking powers, exercised either by proposing laws to the National Congress, or else by using &quot;Medidas Provisórias&quot; (provisional measures), an instrument with the force of law that the president can enact in cases of urgency and necessity, except to make changes to some areas of law (provisional measures cannot be used to change criminal law, electoral law, to abolish individual rights or to alter the fundamental framework of the State — the Separation of Powers and the Federal Republic). A provisional measure comes into effect immediately, before Congress votes on it, and remains in force for up to 60 days unless Congress votes to rescind it. This 60-day period can be extended once, up to a maximum of 120 days. If Congress, on the other hand, votes to approve the provisional measure, it becomes an actual law, with changes decided by the legislative branch. The provisional measure expires at the end of the 60-day period (or 120-day, in case of extension), or sooner, if rejected by one of the Houses of Congress.

===Colombian presidency===
In Colombia the presidency is headed by the president, who has many roles, such as:
The head of state and head of government of the Republic of Colombia. The president heads the executive branch of the national government and is the commander-in-chief of the Colombian Armed Forces. The president is directly elected through Universal Suffrage for a period of four years, along with the vice president. According to article 125, ratified in 2018, no person who has been elected for a presidential term can be elected for a second.

===Finnish presidency===
The Finnish presidency is based on a Parliamentary republic system. The president&#x27;s powers were curtailed in the constitutional reform in 2000, and yet further in 2011. Currently the president leads the Finnish foreign policy together with the cabinet. EU affairs, however, fall to the prime minister&#x27;s authority. The president has little domestic power. The president can dissolve the parliament, but only at the prime minister&#x27;s request. The president can choose not to ratify a bill, but this only returns it to parliament, which must then approve the bill again in order for it to become a law without the president&#x27;s signature. The president&#x27;s power to appoint officials has been reduced, but still appoints all military officers as well as judges. The president is the commander-in-chief of the Finnish Defence Forces. The president also has the power to pardon anyone convicted of a crime. With the curtailment of the president&#x27;s formal powers, many analysts have emphasized the president&#x27;s position as a leader of values.

===French presidency===
The French presidency is based on a semi-presidential system where both a president and a prime minister are active participants in the day-to-day administration of the state. France&#x27;s president appoints a prime minister, who then forms a government. France&#x27;s presidency includes the three traditional branches: the Executive, Judicial and Legislative, but it also includes a fourth branch called the Constitutional Council, which determines the constitutionality of new laws.

Since the formation of the French Fifth Republic in 1958, France has had a semi-presidential system. Historically France has not had a semi-presidential system. For example, between 1875 and 1958 during the French Third Republic and French Fourth Republic, France&#x27;s presidency was based on a Parliamentary System.

===Irish presidency===

The Office of the President of Ireland () is outlined in Ireland&#x27;s constitution. The president is elected by direct popular vote. Suffrage is universal for anyone eighteen and older and is determined that anyone who is eligible to vote for members of Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament), is eligible to vote for the president. The vote is conducted by secret ballot. Every citizen who is thirty-five or older is eligible to be nominated for the presidency; and must be nominated by either twenty or more representatives from Houses of the Oireachtas (the national parliament) or four administrative counties. The term of office is for seven years and no president may serve more than two terms. The president must reside in or near Dublin. The president acts as chief diplomat and represents all the people of Ireland in their engagements home or abroad. The president does not have executive power, and only enacts their powers under the discretion of the rest of the government. However, the president has ultimate discretion in some instances, an example of which would be that the president can refer a bill to the Supreme Court to rule on its constitutionality. Another duty of the president is to appoint the Taoiseach (prime minister), as nominated by the Dáil Éireann. The president can then appoint other ministers to the government by the nomination of the Taoiseach. The president is the commander of the Defence Forces. The President of Ireland since 2012 is Michael D. Higgins, who was elected in October 2011.

===Italian presidency===
The Italian presidency is based on a Parliamentary republic system, where both a president and a prime minister are active participants in administration of the state, but where the de facto the prime minister holds the majority of power, while the president remains the nominal head of state.

The president is intended to represent national unity and guarantee that Italian politics complies with the Constitution. Although the prime minister is considered the head of government, the formal Italian order of precedence lists the office as being ceremonially the fourth most important Italian state office. It also is considered the de facto leader of the Italian government. The prime minister appoints Council of Ministers and Cabinet officials to their rightful area of office. The president of the Republic gives wide support across all political parties. The president of the Republic appoints Italy&#x27;s prime minister and accepts advice from the prime minister. The Italian government includes the traditional three branches: Executive, Judicial and Legislative.

===Australian chief executive===

Australia has a constitutional monarchy – a form of government in which a monarch acts as the head of state within the parameters of a constitution. The constitution could be written, unconfined or blended. It uses what is called a &quot;Parliamentary System of Government,&quot; one that administers the executive branch which then gets Democratic legitimacy from the Legislature. The Legislature in Australia is defined as a &quot;Bicameral Parliament.&quot; The Executive branch of the Australian government headed by a Federal Executive Council, in which the Governor General is advised by the prime minister and Ministers of State.

===German presidency===

The head of state is the president of Germany, where the president completes a five-year term and can be reelected after that five-year term for only one time. He has similar roles like to other countries. He represents Germany as the Commander-in-chief of the military, He has the role of being the Minister of Defense and Germany cannot declare a state of war without the approval of the president. The president then appoints what is called a chancellor, which is known as Germany&#x27;s Head of state. Which the role is pretty comparable to a prime minister like in other countries. There are many roles the chancellor has here are a few of them. The chancellor provides basic law and for their party, it determines the composition of the Federal Cabinet. But the president then gives recommendation on appointing and dismissing Cabinet Minister, through the Federal Cabinet. The chancellor then goes by three main principles. The first is called the Chancellor Principles, who is responsible for all government policies. The second one is called The Principle of ministerial autonomy in which the chancellor prepares everything for the legislative and proposes other laws threw the Cabinet and the third one is called Cabinet Principle were this calls for disagreements between federal ministers over Jurisdictional or Budgeting relative things, in which is settled by the Cabinet. Germany has what is called a Federal legislative power which is divided between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. The Bundestag is elected by the German people. To were the Bundestrat represents the regional states. It seems that Bundestag is more powerful than the Bundesrat. The reason is because bundestag has more powers and responsibilities of that the states given to it. The judicial branch of Germany has three courts which are the Ordinary Courts, Specialized Courts and the Constitutional Courts. Ordinary courts, deal with criminal and civil cases. Specialized Courts, deal with administrative, labor, social, fiscal, and patent law and Constitutional Courts deal with more of judicial review and constitutional interpretation. The big thing in Germany constitution is individual liberty, which gives protection to individual liberty in an extensive catalogue of human rights and also divides powers between the federal and state levels which are between the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.

===Icelandic presidency===

Iceland&#x27;s government is a constitutional republic, with three distinct separate branches. The head of the government is the prime minister, who makes up part of the executive branch. The chief of the state is the president, under the executive branch. The president of Iceland is elected to serve four years, however there are no term limits. This vote is conducted by direct popular vote. Iceland has universal suffrage for citizens eighteen and older. The last presidential vote was held in 2016.

In order to run for office of the president a person must be at least thirty-five years old and meet the requirements to be elected into the Althingi, the country&#x27;s parliament. However the president cannot hold a seat in the Althingi. The president&#x27;s term in office begins on the first of August. According to the twelfth article of Iceland&#x27;s Constitution, the president must live in or near Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. When taking office the president must take an oath to uphold the Constitution. The president appoints and empowers Ministers. The president also appoints some public officials. The president can either accept or reject a bill created by Althingi. If the president accepts the bill, it is signed into law. If the bill is rejected it is sent to the people for a vote as soon as possible.

===Russian presidency===
According to the Constitution of Russia, the country is a federation and semi-presidential republic, wherein the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government.
The President of the Russian Federation is the head of state, supreme commander-in-chief and holder of the highest office within the Russian Federation. Despite the fact that the Constitution of Russia does not explicitly determine the president as the head of the executive branch, executive power is de facto split between the president and the prime minister, who is the head of government.

=== Switzerland presidency ===

The unique aspect of Switzerland&#x27;s government and politics is that any one citizen can challenge any law voted by federal parliament and any citizen can introduce a new amendment to the federal constitution, which makes Switzerland the closest example of a direct democracy in the world today. In definition, a direct democracy is the extraordinary amount of participation a citizen can have in the legislation process. The adaption of direct democracy for Switzerland, however, dates all the way back to the 12th century during the Middle Ages.

The president of Switzerland is a current member of Switzerland&#x27;s executive branch, which is the seven-member Swiss Federal Council. Presidential power in Switzerland is limited, consistent with its commitment to direct democracy. Any Swiss citizen eligible to be a member of the National Council can be elected; candidates do not have to register for the election or to actually be members of the National Council. Unlike most countries, where the presidential term can be up to eight years (two four-year terms), the president of the Swiss Confederation is only appointed one year at a time. The President of the Confederation chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties, while continuing to head their department. The Swiss president is not the Head of State of the country; the Federal Council administers both the Head of State and the Head of Government, which emphasizes that the executive power is not concentrated on only one person. Traditionally the duty of presidency rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year&#x27;s vice president becomes president.

== Vice presidency ==

===American vice presidency ===
In the United States, the vice president is the second in command of the country and also presides as the president of the Senate. The vice president may break tie votes in the Senate chamber and also may be assigned additional duties by the president. The vice president is sometimes chosen for election purposes, to help counterbalance the presidential candidate&#x27;s weakness. For many vice presidents their duties have not been strenuous, but, more recently these duties have increased as more responsibilities are delegated by the president. In the case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice president. The vice president&#x27;s salary, as of 2011, is $230,700. The vice president position of the United States is unique in that &quot;it is the only office that participates in two of the three branches of government.&quot;

===Brazilian vice presidency===
The vice president assumes the presidency of the Federative Republic of Brazil in the event that the president can not carry out their duties. The vice president also becomes the &quot;acting president&quot; when the president is away or not available.

===British Deputy Prime Minister===

Like many parliamentary systems, the prime minister may appoint a deputy prime minister, who serves many of the duties of a traditional vice president. As the deputy prime minister possesses no de jure powers, they will not automatically assume the duties of the prime minister, in the event of their in-capitation or resignation. The position is often considered one of honor and hence holds many traditional vice presidency powers in a de facto manner.

===Colombian vice presidency===
The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of Colombia through the Universal suffrage. Since the passage of the Article 102 Amendment (in 1991) to the Colombian Constitution, the vice president may also be appointed by the president to fill a vacancy, upon leave of absence or death, resignation, or removal of the president.

===German vice chancellor===

The vice-chancellor of Germany does not assume the position of chancellor, but rather the president chooses a minister to succeed the chancellor position. The vice-chancellor is usually a member of the cabinet.

==Presidential transition in the United States==
In the United States, a presidential election is held every four years. While transitions between presidents are peaceful, they are highly complicated and expensive. After the president-elect is sworn in, one of his primary obligations is to build his administration. The most publicized of these duties is appointing members of his Cabinet (Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Defense, et cetera). In total, the president makes 6,000 to 9,000 appointments, although he has the right to appoint as many as 700,000 to the federal bureaucracy. Sometimes, a president will allow appointments from the previous administration to maintain their position. &quot;Normally these appointments include: Cabinet Officers and heads of other executive branch agencies; Under Secretaries; Assistant Secretaries; Directors of Bureaus and Services; and Chairpersons and Members of Boards, Commissions, and Committees. Theses appointments are often authorized by specific provisions of law or approved by the Senate. &quot;

Until 1963, the president-elect paid for his own smooth transition. In 1963, Congress passed the Presidential Transition Act, which allocates up to $900,000.

There are three different types of positions that the president can delegate. 
* PA - Presidential appoint officials unilaterally.
* PAS - President has the ability to appoint officials with the advice and assent of the Senate.
* SES- Non-career Senior Executive Service- are appointed &quot;based on their responsibility for advocating public policy.
::confidential character. (Sometimes referred to as &#x27;Schedule C&#x27; position)
::The average age of a SES is 54 and serves for 23 years.
There are different pay levels for Executive employees, ranging from $114,500 to $157,000. Civilian Payroll for Executive Agencies is nearly 12 million a year. Executive Direct Compensation was $129,923 million and personal benefits were $47,596 million. (As of September 2006)

== Impeachment or removal of a president ==

A president may be removed or impeached from their position in a nation&#x27;s government for breaking or disregarding various laws or procedures that are written by that nation. The removal or impeachment process varies depending on the nation and their specific form of government. For example, the impeachment process of the president of the United States is quite different from that of France. The president of France is granted what is called the power of immunity throughout their term as the president. This power of immunity states that the president cannot be prosecuted or requested to testify before any jurisdiction. However, they may still be impeached only by the High Court. The High Court is a court conveyed by both houses of Parliament. In the United States, the impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives, where the president is first accused of committing either bribery, treason, or other high crimes including misdemeanors. If the House passes a majority vote to impeach the president, the Senate then conducts the trial to remove them from office. If a president is found guilty, he is removed from office and replaced by the vice president for the remainder of the term. If the president is acquitted in court, he will continue to serve the rest of their term as president.

==Protection of the presidency==

===Protection for former Presidents of the United States===
For former presidents who had entered office before January 1, 1997, are entitled to lifetime protection carried out by The Secret Service. Protection of the president&#x27;s spouse is also granted until death or in the case of remarriage. In 1984 the ability to decline Secret Service protection was enacted by legislation enacted. The costs of protecting former presidents and dependents are not publicized by the Secret Service due to security reasoning. Former presidents who entered office after January 1, 1997, are limited to ten years of protection for themselves and their spouses. A spouse&#x27;s protection ends upon divorce, remarriage, or the former president&#x27;s death.
According to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the death of a president still active in office is automatically entitles his or hers spouse to one year of protective services. However, authorization of protection can be issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Children of former presidents, up to the age of 16, are guaranteed the same services as long as the time period does not surpass 10 years. In addition to direct protection, the Secret Service was entitled to investigate any potential threats against the former presidents and their dependents by the Presidential Threat Protection Act passed in 2000. The act passed by the 106th Congress can be deciphered as so: To amend section 879 of title 18, United States Code, to provide clearer coverage over threats against former presidents and members of their families, and for other purposes.

==Presidential line of succession==

===United States===

The original Constitution of the United States only provided for the vice president to succeed the president in the event that the president becomes incapacitated. In the case that both the president and vice president are incapacitated, Congress will appoint an acting president. In 1791, the founders of the United States provided for only the vice president to usurp the president and was in effect until 1885. In 1947, this changed with the passing of the Presidential Succession Act, which allows for the speaker of the House, the president pro tempore, and the cabinet to succeed the president. Before the passage of the Presidential Succession Act, succession was set up to keep the Executive branch of the presidency separate from the Legislative branch.

The first Presidential Succession Act (valid 1886–1947):
# Vice President
# Secretary of State
# Secretary of Treasury
# Secretary of War

Presidential line as of 1947

In the event that the president and vice president become incapacitated, the line of succession falls sequentially to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the president of the Senate, and the president of the Federal Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal—STF).
If less than half of the mandate has been completed, a supplementary election must be called within ninety days. If more than half the mandate has been completed, the Congress elects a new president and vice president within thirty days.

===Colombia===

# Vice President of Colombia
# Cabinet Members

The Constitution of Colombia establishes that the Vice President is the first person in the presidential line of succession. In the absence of both the president and the vice president, article 203 of the Colombian Constitution establishes that the presidential office will be assumed by a Cabinet Member, in the order of precedence.
that establishes the law. The assuming minister must be a member of the same party or movement to which the original president belonged, who will exercise the presidency within thirty days following the presidential vacancy, until Congress elects a new vice president who will assume the presidency.

== Presidential, vice presidential, and legislative compensation ==

=== United States ===
* Compensation of U.S. President
The United States presidential salary cap is $400,000 per year. The current salary cap was set in 2001, designed to account for cost-of-living increases. George W. Bush was the first U.S. president to receive this amount. Previous to 2001, the salary cap was set at $200,000 per year. In addition to the base salary, in 1949, the president began receiving a $50,000 expense account. Details and rules for the compensation of the U.S. presidency can be found in the United States Constitution under Article II, Section I and in the U.S. Code under Title III, Chapter II.

* Additional Expense Accounts
In addition to the $50,000 expense account for the president implemented in 1949, the president also receives numerous other expense reimbursements. These funds are set aside to cover expenses including official expenses of the White House office, entertainment expenses and traveling expenses for anyone who travels with the president. Also, there is an “Unanticipated Needs” account awarded. This account is not to exceed over $1 million per year and acts as a backup for an instance in which the president exceeds budgeting in other accounts.

* Retirement for the presidency

The president receives an annual pension of at least $150,000 after leaving office. The pension is to be equal to that of a current cabinet member. Additional perks are given to the former presidents, including free postal service and up to $96,000 for office space.

<doc id="196153" wikidata="Q241777" url="?curid=196153" title="Parklife">
<text>Parklife is the third studio album by the English rock band Blur, released on 25 April 1994, by Food Records. After moderate sales for their previous album &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; (1993), &quot;Parklife&quot; returned Blur to prominence in the UK, helped by its four hit singles: &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, &quot;To the End&quot;, the title track and &quot;End of a Century&quot;.

Certified four times platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the album came to define the emerging Britpop scene in the year following its release, along with the album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; by future rivals Oasis. Britpop in turn would form the backbone of the broader Cool Britannia movement. &quot;Parklife&quot; therefore has attained a cultural significance beyond its considerable sales and critical acclaim, cementing its status as a landmark in British rock music.

In 2010, &quot;Parklife&quot; was one of ten album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail. In 2015, &quot;Spin&quot; included the album in their list of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album number 438 in its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Recording==
In 1990, a year before Blur&#x27;s debut album, Damon Albarn, the band&#x27;s vocalist, had told a group of music journalists, &quot;When our third album comes out, our place as the quintessential English band of the &#x27;90s will be assured. That is a simple statement of fact. I intend to write it in 1994.&quot;

After the completion of recording sessions for Blur&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;, Albarn began to write prolifically. Blur demoed Albarn&#x27;s new songs in groups of twos and threes. Due to their precarious financial position at the time, Blur quickly went back into the studio with producer Stephen Street to record their third album. Blur met at the Maison Rouge recording studio in August 1993 to record their next album. The recording was a relatively fast process, apart from the song &quot;This Is a Low&quot;.

While the members of Blur were pleased with the final result, Food Records owner David Balfe was not, telling the band&#x27;s management &quot;This is a mistake&quot;. Soon afterwards, Balfe sold Food to EMI.

==Music==
Blur frontman Damon Albarn told &quot;NME&quot; in 1994, &quot;For me, &quot;Parklife&quot; is like a loosely linked concept album involving all these different stories. It&#x27;s the travels of the mystical lager-eater, seeing what&#x27;s going on in the world and commenting on it.&quot; Albarn cited the Martin Amis novel &quot;London Fields&quot; as a major influence on the album. Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher was once quoted saying that &quot;Parklife&quot; was, &quot;Like Southern England personified&quot;. The songs themselves span many genres, such as the synthpop-influenced hit single &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, the instrumental waltz interlude of &quot;The Debt Collector&quot;, the punk rock-influenced &quot;Bank Holiday&quot;, the spacey, Syd Barrett-esque &quot;Far Out&quot;, and the fairly new wave-influenced &quot;Trouble in the Message Centre&quot;. Journalist John Harris commented that while many of the album&#x27;s songs &quot;reflected Albarn&#x27;s claims to a bittersweet take on the UK&#x27;s human patchwork&quot;, several songs, including &quot;To the End&quot; (featuring Lætitia Sadier of Stereolab) and &quot;Badhead&quot; &quot;lay in a much more personal space&quot;.

==Title and cover==
The album was originally going to be entitled &quot;London&quot; and the album cover shot was going to be of a fruit-and-vegetable cart. Albarn stated tongue-in-cheek, &quot;That was the last time that Dave Balfe was, sort of, privy to any decision or creative process with us, and that was his final contribution: to call it &quot;London&quot;&quot;. The cover depicts the British pastime of greyhound racing. Most of the pictures in the CD booklet are of the band in the greyhound racing venue Walthamstow Stadium, although the actual cover was not shot there. The album cover for &quot;Parklife&quot; was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010.

==Reception==

&quot;Parklife&quot; was met with critical acclaim. Johnny Dee, reviewing &quot;Parklife&quot; for &quot;NME&quot;, called it &quot;a great pop record&quot;, adding &quot;On paper it sounds like hell, in practice it&#x27;s joyous.&quot; Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that with &quot;one of this year&#x27;s best albums&quot;, the band &quot;realize their cheeky ambition: to reassert all the style and wit, boy bonding and stardom aspiration that originally made British rock so dazzling.&quot; Conversely, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; indicated that the only good song on the album was &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;.

&quot;Parklife&quot; remains one of the most acclaimed albums of the 1990s. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented: &quot;By tying the past and the present together, Blur articulated the mid-&#x27;90s zeitgeist and produced an epoch-defining record.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
Upon release, &quot;Parklife&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for 90 weeks. It reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers album chart in the United States. In the UK it sold 27,000 copies in its first week and would see a resurgence in sales the week before Christmas of 1994, with weekly sales of 40,000. &quot;Parklife&quot; is Blur&#x27;s bestselling studio album in the UK, with just over a million copies sold.

===Accolades===
&quot;Parklife&quot; has received accolades since its official release and is largely seen as one of the best albums of the 1990s. The album was nominated to the 1994 Mercury Prize, but it lost to M People&#x27;s &quot;Elegant Slumming&quot;. Blur also won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best British Album for &quot;Parklife&quot;. The album was listed as one of the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2000 it was voted number 95 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. He stated &quot;&quot;Parklife&quot; was a stunning album of high-quality, undeniably English pop.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number 54 on their &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot; list. In 2006, &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; organised a poll of which, 40,000 people worldwide voted for the 100 best albums ever and &quot;Parklife&quot; was placed at number 34 on the list. The album has been hailed as a &quot;Britpop classic&quot;.

In April 2014, American LGBT magazine &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; ranked the album at number 29 in its list of the &quot;50 Best Alternative Albums of the 90s&quot;. In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;Parklife&quot; in its &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. The album was ranked at number 171 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)&quot; list. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed the album at number two in its list &quot;The 50 Best Britpop Albums&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 438 in their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="196154" wikidata="Q913633" url="?curid=196154" title="Exodus (Bob Marley and the Wailers album)">
<text>Exodus is the ninth studio album by Jamaican reggae band Bob Marley and the Wailers, first released in June 1977 through Island Records, following &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot; (1976). The album&#x27;s production has been characterized as laid-back with pulsating bass beats and an emphasis on piano, trumpet and guitar. Unlike previous albums from the band, &quot;Exodus&quot; thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sexuality. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of making love and keeping faith.

On 3 December 1976, an assassination attempt was made on Bob Marley&#x27;s life in which his chest was grazed and his arm was struck with a bullet, but he survived. Following the assassination attempt, Marley left Jamaica and moved to London, where &quot;Exodus&quot; was recorded.

The album was a success both critically and commercially; it received gold certifications in the US, UK and Canada, and was the album that propelled Marley to international stardom. In 2017, &quot;Exodus&quot; was remastered and re-released for its 40th anniversary. There are more tracks from &quot;Exodus&quot; on Marley’s greatest hits compilation &quot;Legend&quot; than from any of his other records. &quot;Exodus&quot; was his tenth album since the debut album &quot;The Wailing Wailers&quot; in 1965, including the live album &quot;Live!&quot; (1975).

==Background==
In 1974, two of the original Wailers, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, left the band. The band continued releasing material as &quot;Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers,&quot; as had sometimes been the case in the Lee Perry era (as with the Soul Rebels and Soul Revolution LPs). His current backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Al Anderson and Junior Marvin on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl &quot;Wya&quot; Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin &quot;Seeco&quot; Patterson on percussion. The I Threes, consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley&#x27;s wife Rita Marley provided backing vocals. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, from the &quot;Natty Dread&quot; album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot; (1976), which became the 48th best-selling album on the Billboard Soul Charts in 1978.

==Conception==
Marley had conceived &quot;Exodus&quot; as the album title before even writing the song.

In December 1976, Jamaica was going through elections, generating substantial political discourse. In his campaign, Prime Minister Michael Manley used the campaign slogan &quot;We know where we&#x27;re going.&quot; In response Marley wrote &quot;Exodus&quot;, which is the of the album. The song became a No. 1 hit in Jamaica as well as the United Kingdom and Germany.

On 3 December 1976, while he was in his house in Jamaica, an assassination attempt on Marley&#x27;s life drove him out of his native country: two days after the assassination attempt, Marley performed in the previously scheduled Smile Jamaica concert, then subsequently fled to England where he later recorded the song &quot;Exodus&quot;. In addition to the assassination attempt on Marley, his wife Rita was also shot and survived.

==No. 1 hit single==
The song &quot;Exodus&quot; became a No. 1 hit in Jamaica as well as a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom where it reached number 14, and Germany.

==Music==
&quot;Exodus&quot; is a reggae album that features a &quot;laid-back&quot; production and a &quot;stoned atmosphere that&#x27;s simultaneously funky and political&quot; according to Cam, an Emeritus from Sputnikmusic.

Cam described the album&#x27;s musical style as being &quot;different&quot;, noting that Marley&#x27;s style of reggae was not what was prominent in Jamaica during the time, and that the album&#x27;s music sounds unlike any reggae that came before its release. Emeritus continued to describe the album&#x27;s sound as being rooted in the blues and soul, with elements of British Rock with a reggae &quot;façade thrown on top&quot; however Emeritus praised this saying &quot;if Exodus was straight reggae, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be as good as it is.&quot;

&quot;Exodus&quot; contains elements of pulsating bass beats, pianos and funk along with a &quot;liquid-y bass&quot;, drumming and guitars with the inclusion of trumpets in the title track. Unlike previous albums Exodus lyrical content moves away from cryptic story-telling and instead is clearer and more straight forward, the lyrics touch upon themes of change, religious politics and sex. Vocally, Marley provides a minimalist approach, trying not to reach his falsettos.

The album&#x27;s track listing is split over two halves; the first half features songs of religious politics and opens with &quot;Natural Mystic&quot;, which is a slow tempo &quot;fade up&quot; song, followed by &quot;So Much Things to Say&quot;, which was described by the BBC as being &quot;exuberant&quot; and features a reggae scat. The following two songs &quot;Guiltiness&quot; and &quot;The Heathen&quot; explore darker territory, before ending on the album&#x27;s title track.

The second half of the album features songs revolving around sex and keeping faith.

==Critical reception==
Cam from Sputnikmusic gave the album five out of five stars, calling it a &quot;classic&quot;. Emeritus praised the album&#x27;s &quot;laid-back tones&quot; and commended Marley&#x27;s vocals and lyrical content. As described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;Exodus&quot; is an album with &quot;the magnificent rhythm section of Aston Barrett, bass, and Carlton Barrett, drums, and the spidery lead guitar of Julian &quot;Junior&quot; Marvin – and the flatness of the material Bob Marley has given them to work with&quot;

&quot;Jamming&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot;, &quot;One Love/People Get Ready&quot;, and &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; were all major international hits. &quot;Exodus&quot; peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number 15 on the Black Albums chart, as well as remaining in the UK charts for 56 consecutive weeks, where it peaked at number 8.

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Exodus&quot; the best album of the 20th century. In 2001, the TV network VH1 named it the 26th greatest album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 169 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and re-ranking at number 48 in a 2020 revised list.

<doc id="196158" wikidata="Q7760207" url="?curid=196158" title="The Report from Iron Mountain">
<text>The Report from Iron Mountain is a 1967 anti-war satire written by Leonard C. Lewin. The book purports to be a leaked report authored by a Special Study Group tasked by the Kennedy Administration to plan the transition from a wartime economy and assess the potential social impacts of a &quot;condition of general world peace.&quot; It details the analyses of the panel, which concludes that world peace could cause the United States to collapse; war, or some alternative outside threat, is necessary for social stability, the Study Group finds, and recommends the establishment of &quot;a permanent War/Peace Research Agency&quot; to improve &quot;the effectiveness of [war&#x27;s] major stabilizing functions&quot; and to plan substitutes for war should &quot;a viable general peace&quot; emerge. The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and has been translated into fifteen languages.

==Publishing history==
The idea for the report came from Victor Navasky and other editors of Monocle, an American political satire magazine, after reading a newspaper account about a stock market decline attributed to a &quot;peace scare.&quot; Leonard Lewin wrote the book with the help of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith and three Monocle editors Marvin Kitman, Richard Lingeman, and Victor Navasky. E. L. Doctorow, who was then editor-in-chief at The Dial Press, agreed to publish the book as non-fiction. To lend credibility to the hoax, Galbraith wrote a review of the book under the pen name Herschel McLandress, &quot;former professor of Psychiatric Measurement at the Harvard Medical School and now chief consultant to the Noonan Psychiatric Clinic in Boston,&quot; the title character of Galbraith&#x27;s earlier 1964 satire, The McLandress dimension. The Report from Iron Mountain went out of print in 1980.

The book subsequently began circulating on the Internet among militia groups. Buccaneer Books, a small publisher of out-of-print books, brought out an edition in 1993. In the early 1990s, Liberty Lobby with the Noontide Press, a publisher notable for its many antisemitic and white supremacist texts, released an edition, claiming that it was a U.S. government document, and therefore inherently in the public domain, as is conventional for works created by the federal government. Lewin sued them for copyright infringement, which resulted in a settlement in 1994. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Neither side would reveal the full terms of the settlement, but Lewin received more than a thousand copies of the bootlegged version.&quot;

In response to the bootleg editions, Simon &amp; Schuster brought out a new hardcover edition in 1996 under their Free Press imprint, authorized by Lewin, with a new introduction by Navasky and afterword by Lewin both insisting the book was fictional and satire, and discussing the original controversy over the book and the more recent interest in it by conspiracy theorists.

A new paperback edition was published in 2008.

== Synopsis ==
The book is named for Iron Mountain, a decommissioned iron mine near Germantown, New York, in the Hudson Valley, which houses an enormous storage facility mostly holding important documents but also government records, musical instruments, antiques, and other valuables, as well as fallout shelters for executives of large oil corporations. The book&#x27;s forward describes how the Special Study Group&#x27;s last meeting before drafting the final report was held at Iron Mountain (hence the name).

The book is a satiric parody of Rand Corporation projects which summarizes the results of a two-and-a-half-year study and recommends maintaining a state of permanent war. The first part of the book deals with its scope. The second is a review of previous studies considering the effects of disarmament on the economy. (&quot;The first factor is that of size. The &quot;world war industry, ... accounts for approximately a tenth of the output of the world&#x27;s total economy.&quot;) The third assesses various &quot;disarmament scenarios&quot; that have been proposed. The main part of the book examines the non-military economic, political, sociological, cultural, and scientific functions of war and the problems that these raise for the transition to peace. These include war&#x27;s role in regulating the economy&#x27;s inevitable boom and bust cycles, defining any given &quot;nation&#x27;s existence vis-a-vis any other nation,&quot; rationalizing &quot;nonmilitary killing&quot; by habituating people to &quot;pay a blood price for institutions,&quot; such as the sacrifice of 40,000 people per year to automobiles, and so on. The report next suggests some substitutes for the non-military functions of war, including medical research, health care for all citizens, improved education, housing, public transportation, poverty reduction, and so forth, but ultimately notes that these do not answer the need for an external threat to maintain social stability. The report suggests some alternative enemy could be manufactured, such as hostile space aliens or the threat of environmental pollution, which, the authors say, is not yet dire enough yet but could be &quot;increased selectively for this purpose.&quot; The report ultimately concludes &quot;that the war system cannot responsibly be allowed to disappear.&quot; The report suggests the establishment of a &quot;permanent War/Peace Research Agency&quot; tasked, in part, with better rationalizing war to better address its non-military functions and developing a &quot;quantification of existing application of the non-military functions of war.&quot;

== Reception ==

When it was first published, some readers questioned whether it was a work of fiction or an actual report. In its November 20, 1967 issue, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; claimed to have confirmation of the reality of the report from an unnamed government official, who added that when President Johnson read the report, he &#x27;hit the roof&#x27; and ordered it to be suppressed for all time. Sources were alleged to have revealed that orders were sent to U.S. embassies, instructing them to emphasize that the book had no relation to U.S. Government policy. On November 26, 1967, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a book review by Herschel McLandress, the pen name for Harvard professor John Kenneth Galbraith, in which McLandress claimed firsthand knowledge of the report&#x27;s authenticity. He stated that he had been invited to help write the report, and although he was unable to participate in the official group, he was consulted from time to time and was asked to keep the project secret. He said that he doubted the wisdom of letting the public know about the report, but agreed with its conclusions. Six weeks later, in an Associated Press dispatch from London, Galbraith went even further and jokingly admitted that he was a member of the conspiracy. However, the following day, Galbraith backed off of his initial claims. When asked about his &#x27;conspiracy&#x27; statement, he replied, &quot;For the first time since Charles II, &quot;The Times&quot; has been guilty of a misquotation... Nothing shakes my conviction that it was written by either Dean Rusk or Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce.&quot; The original reporter reported the following six days later: &quot;Misquoting seems to be a hazard to which Professor Galbraith is prone. The latest edition of the Cambridge newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; quotes the following (tape recorded) interchange: Interviewer: &#x27;Are you aware of the identity of the author of Report from Iron Mountain?&#x27;
Galbraith: &#x27;I was in general a member of the conspiracy, but I was not the author. I have always assumed that it was the man who wrote the foreword – Mr. Lewin&#x27;.&quot;

In an article in the March 19, 1972, edition of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Lewin said that he had written the book. The book was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;Most Successful Literary Hoax.&quot; Some people claim that the book is genuine and has only been called a hoax as a means of damage control. &quot;Trans-Action&quot; devoted an issue to the debate over the book. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine published a 28,000-word excerpt. In an article published in &quot;New York&quot; in 2013, Victor Navasky confirmed that Galbraith was indeed McLandress, and that he was &quot;in on the hoax from the beginning.&quot;

Some conspiracy theorists reject the statement made in 1972 by the author that the book was satire and that he was its author.

In a remembrance of E. L. Doctorow published in 2015 in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Victor Navasky asserted his involvement in creating &quot;Report from Iron Mountain&quot;, naming Leonard Lewin as the main writer with &quot;input&quot; from economist John Kenneth Galbraith, two editors of the satirical magazine &quot;Monocle&quot; (Marvin Kitman and Richard Lingeman) and himself.

<doc id="196161" wikidata="Q283221" url="?curid=196161" title="Kind of Blue">
<text>Kind of Blue is a studio album by the American jazz trumpeter and composer Miles Davis. It was released on August17,1959, by Columbia Records. For the recording, Davis led a sextet featuring saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb, with new band pianist Wynton Kelly replacing Evans on one track, &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot;. The album was recorded in two sessions on March2 and April22,1959, at Columbia&#x27;s 30th Street Studio in New York City.
Influenced in part by Evans, who had been a member of the ensemble in 1958 and was called back for this album, Davis departed further from his early hard bop style in favor of greater experimentation with musical modes, as on the title track of his previous album, &quot;Milestones&quot; (1958). Basing &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; entirely on modality, he gave each performer a set of scales that encompassed the parameters of their improvisation and style and consequently more creative freedom with melodies; Coltrane later expanded on this modal approach in his own solo career.
&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is regarded by many critics as Davis&#x27;s masterpiece, the greatest jazz album ever recorded, and one of the greatest albums of all time. Its impact on music, including jazz, rock, and classical genres, has led writers to also deem it one of the most influential albums ever made. The album was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress for the inaugural year of the National Recording Registry, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked number 12 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, repositioned to number 31 in the 2020 revision. In 2019, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of at least five million copies in the United States.

==Background==
By late 1958, trumpeter Miles Davis employed one of the most acclaimed and profitable hard bop bands in the business. Bassist Paul Chambers had been with the group from its beginning in 1955, alto saxophonist Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley joined in late 1957, and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane returned in early 1958. Drummer Jimmy Cobb replaced Philly Joe Jones in May 1958, and pianist Wynton Kelly replaced Bill Evans in November 1958.

The Davis band played a mixture of pop standards, blues, and bebop originals by composers such as Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Tadd Dameron, and Davis himself. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis&#x27;s groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, however, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity.

In 1953, the composer and theorist George Russell published his &quot;Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization&quot;, which offered an alternative to improvisation based on chords. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships, his concept introduced the idea of chord/scale unity and was the first theory to explore the vertical relationship between chords and scales. These insights helped lead the way to modal jazz. Influenced by Russell&#x27;s ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of his studio album &quot;Milestones&quot; (1958). Satisfied with the results, Davis prepared an entire album based on modality. Evans, who had studied and recorded with Russell but had left the Davis group to pursue his own career, was drafted back into the project.

==Recording==
&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was recorded on three-track tape in two sessions at Columbia Records&#x27; 30th Street Studio in New York City. On March 2, 1959, the tracks &quot;So What&quot;, &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot;, and &quot;Blue in Green&quot; were recorded for side one of the original LP, and on April 22 the tracks &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; were recorded, making up side two.

As was Davis&#x27;s penchant, he called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, which is not the master, was added to the 1997 CD reissue of the album as a bonus track. The five master takes issued were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; was recorded, but was not used for release or on the issues of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; prior to the 1997 reissue.

Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist&#x27;s feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album&#x27;s most blues-oriented number, &quot;Freddie Freeloader.&quot; The live album &quot;Miles Davis at Newport 1958&quot; documents the sextet during Evans&#x27;s tenure; however, it is in a hard bop style, rather than the modal approach of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. The more ruminative side of Evans&#x27;s playing while he was a member of the band can best be heard on his lengthy solo on &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; from &quot;Jazz at the Plaza Vol. I&quot;.

=== Production credit ===
&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was produced by Columbia staff producer Irving Townsend. However, over the years there has been confusion, with Davis&#x27;s subsequent producer Teo Macero getting partial or full credit. &quot;In the case of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; there were two producers: Teo Macero and Irving Townsend&quot;, said jazz historian Eric Nisenson. &quot;Macero&#x27;s role, however, was clearly that of an apprentice and observer.&quot; The recording session was also cited by Nisenson as Macero&#x27;s first experience with &quot;the highs and lows of working with Miles.&quot; From Macero&#x27;s own recollection, his involvement in the recording included &quot;box[ing] everyone in so that there would be a physical closeness among the musicians, not like today when the musicians are spread all over the place.&quot; According to &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, &quot;though his role in &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has been disputed&quot;, the recording was &quot;made under the auspices&quot; of Macero. However, it is Townsend&#x27;s voice heard on the session tapes, who became Davis&#x27;s producer after the departures of George Avakian and Cal Lampley. Macero did not produce Davis until after Townsend took over West Coast production duties for Columbia Records, when Macero took his place. Macero&#x27;s first Davis production was his next record, &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot;.

The original LP did not credit a producer. The first release with a producer credit was the 1987 CD, which credited only Macero. However, this was in error; Macero only produced that reissue, not the sessions for the original album. The 1997 MiniDisc reissue credited both Townsend and Macero, but the subsequent 1997, 1999, 2004, 2008, and 2015 reissues all correctly credit only Townsend.

==Composition==
&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is based entirely on modality, diverging from Davis&#x27;s earlier hard bop style of jazz with its complex chord progression and improvisation. The entire album was a series of &quot;modal sketches&quot;, with each performer given a set of scales that encompassed the parameters of their improvisation and style. This recording style contrasted with the typical preparation of providing musicians with the complete score or, for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with a chord progression or series of harmonies.

Modal jazz was not unique to this album. Davis himself had previously used the same method on his 1958 &quot;Milestones&quot; album, the &quot;&#x27;58 Sessions&quot;, and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans&#x27;s third stream compositions. Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, &quot;a return to melody&quot;. In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of &quot;The Jazz Review&quot;, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating:

No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don&#x27;t have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [melody] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you&#x27;re based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there&#x27;s nothing to do but repeat what you&#x27;ve just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords ... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them.

Bill Evans wrote in the LP liner notes, &quot;Miles conceived these settings only hours before the recording dates.&quot; Evans continued with an introduction concerning the modes used in each composition on the album. &quot;So What&quot; consists of two modes: sixteen measures of the first, followed by eight measures of the second, and then eight again of the first. &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; is a standard twelve-bar blues form. &quot;Blue in Green&quot; consists of a ten-measure cycle following a short four-measure introduction. &quot;All Blues&quot; is a twelve-bar blues form in time. &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; consists of five scales, which are each played &quot;as long as the soloist wishes until he has completed the series&quot;.

The liner notes list Davis as author of all compositions, but many scholars and fans believe that Bill Evans wrote part or the whole of &quot;Blue in Green&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;. Bill Evans assumed co-credit with Davis for &quot;Blue in Green&quot; when recording it on his &quot;Portrait in Jazz&quot; album, and the Davis estate acknowledged Evans&#x27; authorship in 2002.

==Reception and legacy==

Since its release on August 17, 1959, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has been regarded by critics as Davis&#x27;s greatest work. It is his most acclaimed album, and became, along with Davis&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, his best-selling record, cementing him as one of the most successful jazz artists in history. Music writer Chris Morris cited &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; as &quot;the distillation of Davis&#x27;s art.&quot; Cobb said the album &quot;must have been made in heaven&quot;.

&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has been lauded as one of the most influential albums in the history of jazz. One reviewer has called it a &quot;defining moment of twentieth century music&quot;. Several of the pieces from the album have become jazz standards. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is consistently ranked among the greatest albums of all time. In a review of the album, AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated:

In 1959, the arrival of Ornette Coleman on the jazz scene via his fall residency at the Five Spot club, consolidated by the release of his &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot; LP in 1959, muted the initial impact of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, a happenstance that irritated Davis greatly. Though Davis and Coleman both offered alternatives to the rigid rules of bebop, Davis would never reconcile himself to Coleman&#x27;s free jazz innovations, although he would incorporate musicians amenable to Coleman&#x27;s ideas with his great quintet of the mid-1960s, and offer his own version of &quot;free&quot; playing with his jazz fusion outfits in the 1970s. The influence of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; did build, and all of the sidemen from the album went on to achieve success on their own. Evans formed his influential jazz trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian; &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley fronted popular bands with his brother Nat; Kelly, Chambers and Cobb continued as a touring unit, recording under Kelly&#x27;s name as well as in support of Coltrane and Wes Montgomery, among others; and Coltrane went on to become one of the most revered and innovative of all jazz musicians. Even more than Davis, Coltrane took the modal approach and ran with it during his career as a leader in the 1960s, leavening his music with Coleman&#x27;s ideas as the decade progressed.

&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has appeared on professional listings of the greatest albums. In 1994, it was ranked number one in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Jazz Albums&quot;. Larkin described it as &quot;the greatest jazz album in the world&quot;. In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen for the very first year of induction by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. In selecting the album as number 12 on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine stated: &quot;This painterly masterpiece is one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz&quot;. The rating descended to number 31 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; revised list in 2020. On December 16, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and &quot;reaffirming jazz as a national treasure&quot;. It is included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, described by reviewer Seth Jacobson as &quot;a genre-defining moment in twentieth-century music, period&quot;.. It was voted number 14 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot; lists the album as part of its suggested &quot;core collection&quot;, and also awards it a crown, indicating a recording of particular merit.

&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; remains popular with listeners. Between 1991 (when Nielsen SoundScan started tracking sales) and 2016, the album sold 3.6 million copies in the US. In 2019, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album five-times platinum, indicating five million units recorded there.

===Influence===
The album&#x27;s influence has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical have been influenced by it, while critics have written about it as one of the most influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane&#x27;s modal records &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (1961) and &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,&quot; &quot;comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. I&#x27;ve listened to that album so many times that for the past couple of years, I haven&#x27;t hardly listened to anything else.&quot; Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song &quot;Breathe&quot; on the album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973). In his book &quot;Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece&quot;, writer Ashley Kahn wrote &quot;still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized&quot;. Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis&#x27;s longtime friends, wrote: &quot;That [&quot;Kind of Blue&quot;] will always be my music, man. I play &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; every day—it&#x27;s my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday&quot;. Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles&#x27;s acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it&#x27;s another thing to practically create a new language of music, which is what &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; did.&quot;

Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, noted the consistent innovation present throughout the album, stating: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just one tune that was a breakthrough, it was the whole record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; [the sextet] all sound like they&#x27;re fully into it.&quot; Along with &quot;Time Out&quot; by the Dave Brubeck Quartet (1959) and Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Giant Steps&quot; (1960), &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon the release of the 50th anniversary collector&#x27;s edition of the album, a columnist for &quot;All About Jazz&quot; stated &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; continues to transport listeners to a realm all its own while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable.&quot; Renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album&#x27;s reputation and influence when discussing the significance of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, stating &quot;It&#x27;s like the Bible—you just have one in your house.&quot; The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums and &quot;an important record&quot; for him. The 2014 album &quot;Blue&quot; by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.

The &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; musicians appeared together in further recorded ventures through the 1960s. Davis had made a rare post-1953 sideman appearance in 1958 on Adderley&#x27;s &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; album; Evans and Adderley collaborated on the latter&#x27;s LP &quot;Know What I Mean?&quot; from 1961. Kelly and Chambers backed Hank Mobley on &quot;Soul Station&quot; in 1960, and Evans and Chambers played on the sessions for &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot; by Oliver Nelson in 1961. The rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb played on &quot;Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago&quot;, supported Benny Golson on &quot;Turning Point&quot; and Coltrane for &quot;Coltrane Jazz&quot; and one track on Coltrane&#x27;s landmark &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, which featured Chambers throughout. That trio stayed with Davis for the recordings &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; and the live sets at the Blackhawk and at Carnegie Hall.

===Davis in retrospect===
Late in his life, from the electric period on, Davis repeatedly disregarded his earlier work, such as the music of &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; or &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. In Davis&#x27;s view, remaining static stylistically was the wrong option.

When Shirley Horn insisted, in 1990, that Davis reconsider playing the gentle ballads and modal tunes of his &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; period, he demurred: &quot;Nah, it hurts my lip.&quot;

==Release history==

&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was released as a 12-inch vinyl record, in both stereo and mono. There have been multiple reissues of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, with additional pressings throughout the vinyl era. On some editions, the label switched the order for the two tracks on side two, &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;. The album has been remastered many times during the compact disc era, including in 1982 by CBS/Sony Japan catalog number 35DP 62 and the 1986 Columbia &quot;Jazz Masterpieces&quot; reissue. The significant 1992 remaster corrected the original recording speed for side one, which had caused all prior releases to be slightly off-pitch. The 1997 reissue added the alternative take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;. In 2005, a DualDisc release included the original album, a digital remastering in 5.1 Surround Sound and LPCM Stereo, and a 25-minute documentary &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; about the making and influence of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was re-issued on a rare 24-carat gold CD collectors version. A two-disc CD box set &quot;50th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was released on September 30, 2008, by Columbia and Legacy.

The album was released in other audio formats, which are only available second hand.
* Two-track open-reel tape (US only), Columbia GCB 60, from which &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; were omitted to reduce cost. This release was on the market less than a year and was discontinued some time after July 1961, after &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; had been released as four-track only. Sonically, it was reportedly better than the four-track counterpart that replaced it. The rumor that the two-track version was the only one to be issued at correct speed for the tracks from the first album side is false. It was not issued at the correct speed.
* Four-track open-reel tape (US only), Columbia CQ 379, as the complete five-track album. This release replaced the two-track release and remained in the Columbia catalog for a few years. Some tracks are available on other reel tapes issued current at the time of or following the original release of the album, as by Various Artists. None issued were at the correct speed. &quot;All Blues&quot; is included on the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.
* Armed Forces Radio and Television Service 16-inch transcription discs. These are monaural and the track on side P-6925 marked &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; actually holds &quot;All Blues&quot;. None issued were at the correct speed.
* Philips Compact Cassette versions of the original album prior to the Jazz Masterpiece remaster, and of the 1987 Jazz Masterpiece remaster. Neither are at the correct speed.
* MiniDisc, Columbia CM 40579 (US) from a master prior to 1997, but not the Jazz Masterpiece remaster. It was unavailable by the end of the 1990s when production of Jazz Masterpiece series had ceased. It was not issued at the correct speed.

<doc id="196163" wikidata="Q766984" url="?curid=196163" title="Mothership Connection">
<text>Mothership Connection is the fourth album by American funk band Parliament, released on December 15, 1975, on Casablanca Records. This concept album is often rated among the best Parliament-Funkadelic releases, and was the first to feature horn players Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley, previously of James Brown&#x27;s backing band the J.B.&#x27;s.

&quot;Mothership Connection&quot; became Parliament&#x27;s first album to be certified gold and later platinum. It was supported by the hit &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker),&quot; the band&#x27;s first million-selling single. The Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry in 2011, declaring that it &quot;has had an enormous influence on jazz, rock and dance music.&quot;

==Concept==

The album is held together by an outer-space theme. Describing the concept, George Clinton said &quot;We had put black people in situations nobody ever thought they would be in, like the White House. I figured another place you wouldn&#x27;t think black people would be was in outer space. I was a big fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, so we did a thing with a pimp sitting in a spaceship shaped like a Cadillac, and we did all these James Brown-type grooves, but with street talk and ghetto slang.&quot; The album&#x27;s concept would form the backbone of P-Funk&#x27;s concert performances during the 1970s, in which a large spaceship prop known as the Mothership would be lowered onto the stage.

&quot;BBC Music&quot; described the album as a pioneering work of Afrofuturism &quot;set in a future universe where black astronauts interact with alien worlds.&quot; Journalist Frasier McAlpine stated: &quot;As a reaction to an increasingly fraught 1970s urban environment in which African-American communities faced the end of the optimism of the civil rights era, this flamboyant imagination (and let&#x27;s be frank, exceptional funkiness) was both righteous and joyful.&quot;

==Reception==

On release, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album a &quot;parody of modern funk&quot; and stated that &quot;unlike the Ohio Players or Commodores, the group refuses to play it straight. Instead, Clinton spews his jive, conceived from some cosmic funk vision.&quot; In a positive review, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau stated that Clinton &quot;keeps the beat going with nothing but his rap, some weird keyboard, and cymbals for stretches of side one,&quot; and described &quot;Give Up the Funk&quot; as &quot;galactic.&quot;

Retrospectively, &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; has been widely acclaimed, and it is typically considered to be one of the best albums by the Parliament-Funkadelic collective. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2003 review gave the record 5 stars: &quot;The masterpiece, the slang creator, the icon builder, the master narrative--or &#x27;the bomb,&#x27; as Clinton succinctly put it before anyone else.&quot; Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called it &quot;the definitive Parliament-Funkadelic album,&quot; in which &quot;George Clinton&#x27;s revolving band lineups, differing musical approaches, and increasingly thematic album statements reached an ideal state, one that resulted in enormous commercial success as well as a timeless legacy.&quot; Dr. Dre famously sampled &quot;Mothership Connection (Star Child)&quot; on &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; and &quot;P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)&quot; on &quot;The Roach (The Chronic Outro)&quot;, both from his 1992 album &quot;The Chronic&quot;.

The album has received many retrospective accolades, including being named VH1&#x27;s 55th greatest album of all time. In 2012, it was ranked at number 276 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it was featured again on the 2020 edition, at number 363. &quot;Vibe&quot; listed &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; in their &quot;Essential Black Rock Recordings&quot; list, and it was included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>The Angénieux retrofocus photographic lens is a wide-angle lens design that uses an inverted telephoto configuration. The popularity of this lens design made the name retrofocus synonymous with this type of lens. The Angénieux retrofocus for still cameras was introduced in France in 1950 by Pierre Angénieux.

==Inverted telephoto concept==
The telephoto lens configuration combines positive and negative lens groups with the negative at the rear, serving to magnify the image, which reduces the back focal distance of the lens (the distance between the back of the lens and the image plane) to a figure shorter than the focal length. This is for practical, not optical reasons, because it allows telephoto lenses to be made shorter and less cumbersome. The first practical telephoto lens was developed by Peter Barlow in the early 1800s, with the eponymous Barlow lens referring to the negative achromat inserted between the eye and a telescope.

The inverted telephoto configuration does the reverse, employing one or more negative lens groups at the front to increase the back focal distance of the lens – possibly to a figure greater than the focal length – in order to allow for additional optical or mechanical parts to fit behind the lens. The negative front group also serves to increase peripheral illumination; some symmetric wide-angle lenses require a radially-graduated filter or other means to make the exposure even across the frame.

The inverted telephoto design was first employed in the 1930s by Taylor-Hobson for the early Technicolor &quot;3-strip&quot; cameras since the beam splitter unit behind the lens required significant space, so that a long back focal distance was essential. Horace Lee patented an inverted telephoto lens design in 1930 with an angle of view of 50° and maximum aperture of 2 which afforded a distance between the rear element and the film plane approximately 10% greater than the focal length. Joseph Ball showed how a beam-splitting apparatus could be fitted in the space gained. Also, wide-angle lenses for narrow-gauge movie cameras had to be of this type because of the shutter mechanism that had to fit in between.

In still photography, a single-lens reflex camera requires a space for the reflex mirror, imposing a limit on the use of wide-angle lenses of symmetric designs. The retrofocus lens addressed this situation by increasing the distance between the rear element and the focal plane, thus making wider-angle lenses usable while retaining normal viewing and focusing. Unless the reflex mirror were locked in the &quot;up&quot; position, blacking out the viewfinder, the rearmost element(s) of a non-retrofocus (symmetric wide-angle) lens would interfere with the movement of the mirror as it flipped up and down during exposure.

==Implementation==
Rudolf Kingslake and Paul Stevens filed for a patent in 1941 for the &quot;WA Ektanar&quot;, which featured a negative meniscus element facing the object, followed by a &quot;Tessar&quot;-derived four-element/three-group lens. However, the spacing between the first element and the following lens was relatively small and so the back focus was approximately equal to the focal length.

On 13 August 1949 Harry Zöllner and Rudolf Solisch completed the computation of the first version of the Zeiss Jena Flektogon 35 mm f/2.8. This lens was presented at the Leipzig Spring Fair from 5 to 12 March 1950 and serial production started in July 1950.

Pierre Angénieux applied for a patent in 1950. In the original patent, he presented two lenses with an angle of view of 65°, approximately equal to the view of a f=35 mm lens on the 35mm format for still cameras; the first example had a maximum aperture of 2.5, while the second example had a maximum aperture of 2.2. The Angénieux corporation coined the name &quot;Retrofocus&quot; for its line of inverted telephoto wide-angles, and the name has become synonymous as a generic trademark for similar lens designs.

The Angénieux &quot;Retrofocus&quot; lens line inspired other manufacturers to produce similar wide-angle lenses of this type&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikkor-28/3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for almost every 35mm SLR, helping to make it the definitive camera type of the late 20th century.

Similar lenses with prominent object-facing meniscus lenses were patented a few years after the original &quot;Retrofocus&quot; patent. For example, Albrecht Tronnier used the &quot;Tessar&quot;-derived &quot;Skopar&quot; lens with a single negative meniscus for the Voigtländer &quot;Skoparon&quot; of 1952. Carl Zeiss Oberkochen also created an inverted telephoto design branded &quot;Distagon&quot; (5.6/60 mm) for the Hasselblad 1000F in 1952. In 1955, Harry Zöllner and Rudolf Solisch applied for a similar patent on an inverted telephoto lens design, branded &quot;Flektogon&quot;, for Carl Zeiss Jena, which uses a single negative meniscus element ahead of a Double-Gauss lens.
Angénieux were not content to rest on their laurels, continuing to develop the inverted telephoto scheme by shortening the focal length from 35 mm with the original &quot;Retrofocus R-1&quot; (1950) to 28 mm with the &quot;Retrofocus R-11&quot; (1952) and &quot;R-61&quot; (24 mm , 1958). These used multiple negative meniscus elements in the front group, a trend that would continue with the Zeiss (Jena) &quot;Flektogon&quot; 20 mm design of 1963, with three negative meniscus elements and an angle of view expanded to 94° from 62° (with the original &quot;Retrofocus R-1&quot;).

===Further development===
The highly symmetric super-wide angle lenses developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including the &quot;Biogon&quot;, are sometimes described as a mirrored pair of inverted telephoto objectives, as first presented by Roosinov in 1946.

Pincushion distortion is common with inverted telephoto designs because they are so highly asymmetric. Lee suggested using an air space in the negative group to control this distortion. By removing the constraint for rectilinear projection and deliberately introducing barrel distortion, the illumination of the field can be made more even; the resulting fisheye lenses can be considered a subset of the inverted telephoto lens design, with strong negative front elements.

<text>The 1984–1985 United Kingdom miners&#x27; strike was a major industrial action within the British coal industry in an attempt to prevent closures of pits that the government deemed &quot;uneconomic&quot; in the coal industry, which had been nationalised in 1947. It was led by Arthur Scargill of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the National Coal Board (NCB), a government agency. Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.

The NUM was divided over the action, which began in Yorkshire, and some mineworkers, especially in the Midlands, worked through the dispute. Few major trade unions supported the NUM, primarily using the argument of the absence of a vote at national level. Violent confrontations between flying pickets and police characterised the year-long strike, which ended in a decisive victory for the Conservative government and allowed the closure of most of Britain&#x27;s collieries (coal mines). Many observers regard the strike as &quot;the most bitter industrial dispute in British history&quot;. The number of person-days of work lost to the strike was over 26 million, making it the largest since the 1926 General Strike. The journalist Seumas Milne said of the strike that &quot;it has no real parallel – in size, duration and impact – anywhere in the world&quot;.

The NCB was encouraged to gear itself towards reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, which led to the NUM&#x27;s Yorkshire Area&#x27;s sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The NUM President, Arthur Scargill, made the strike official across Britain on 12 March 1984, but the lack of a national ballot beforehand caused controversy. The NUM strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM&#x27;s failure to hold a national strike ballot.

The strike was ruled illegal in September 1984, as no national ballot of NUM members had been held. It ended on 3 March 1985. It was a defining moment in British industrial relations, the NUM&#x27;s defeat significantly weakening the trade union movement. It was a major victory for Thatcher and the Conservative Party, with the Thatcher government able to consolidate their economic programme. The number of strikes fell sharply in 1985 as a result of the &quot;demonstration effect&quot; and trade union power in general diminished. Three deaths resulted from events related to the strike.

The much-reduced coal industry was privatised in December 1994, ultimately becoming UK Coal. In 1983, Britain had 175 working pits, all of which had closed by the end of 2015. Poverty increased in former coal mining areas, and in 1994 Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire was the poorest settlement in the country.

==Background==
While more than 1,000 collieries were working in the UK during the first half of the 20th century, by 1984 only 173 were still operating and employment had dropped from its peak of 1 million in 1922, down to 231,000 for the decade to 1982. This long-term decline in coal employment was common across the developed world; in the United States, employment in the coal-mining industry continued to fall from 180,000 in 1985 to 70,000 in the year 2000.

Coal mining, nationalised by Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government in 1947, was managed by the National Coal Board (NCB) under Ian MacGregor in 1984. As in most of Europe, the industry was heavily subsidised. In 1982–1983, the operating loss per tonne was £3.05, and international market prices for coal were about 25% cheaper than that charged by the NCB. The calculation of these operating losses was disputed, with the Marxist historian John Saville declaring costs other than operating losses were included in the data as part of a scheme to undermine trade unions.

By 1984, the richest seams of coal had been increasingly worked out and the remaining coal was more and more expensive to reach. The solution was mechanisation and greater efficiency per worker, making many miners redundant due to overcapacity of production. The industry was restructured between 1958 and 1967 in cooperation with the unions, with a halving of the workforce; offset by government and industry initiatives to provide alternative employment. Stabilisation occurred between 1968 and 1977, when closures were minimised with the support of the unions even though the broader economy slowed. The accelerated contraction imposed by Thatcher after 1979 was strenuously opposed by the unions. In the post-war consensus, policy allowed for closures only where agreed to by the workers, who in turn received guaranteed economic security. Consensus did not apply when closures were enforced and redundant miners had severely limited employment alternatives.

The NUM&#x27;s strike in 1974 played a major role in bringing down Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government. The party&#x27;s response was the Ridley Plan, an internal report that was leaked to &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine and appeared in its 27 May 1978 issue. Ridley described how a future Conservative government could resist and defeat a major strike in a nationalised industry. In Ridley&#x27;s opinion, trade union power in the UK was interfering with market forces, pushing up inflation, and the unions&#x27; undue political power had to be curbed to restore the UK&#x27;s economy.

===National Union of Mineworkers===
The mining industry was effectively a closed shop. Although not official policy, employment of non-unionised labour would have led to a mass walkout of mineworkers.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) came into being in 1945 and in 1947 most collieries in Britain were nationalised (958 nationalised, 400 private). Demand for coal was high in the years following the Second World War, and Polish refugees were drafted to work in the pits. Over time, coal&#x27;s share in the energy market declined relative to oil and nuclear. Large-scale closures of collieries occurred in the 1960s, which led to migration of miners from the run-down coalfields (Scotland, Wales, Lancashire, the north-east of England) to Yorkshire and the Midlands coalfields. After a period of inaction from the NUM leadership over employment cuts, there was an unofficial strike in 1969, after which many more militant candidates were elected to NUM leadership. The threshold for endorsement of strike action in a national ballot was reduced from two-thirds in favour to 55% in 1971. There was then success in the national strike in 1972, an overtime ban, and the subsequent strike in 1974 (which led to the Three-Day Week). The NUM&#x27;s success in bringing down the Heath government demonstrated its power, but it caused resentment at their demand to be treated as a special case in wage negotiations.

The NUM had a decentralised regional structure and certain regions were seen as more militant than others. Scotland, South Wales and Kent were militant and had some communist officials, whereas the Midlands were much less militant. The only nationally coordinated actions in the 1984–1985 strike were the mass pickets at Orgreave.

In the more militant mining areas, strikebreakers were reviled and never forgiven for betraying the community. In 1984, some pit villages had no other industries for many miles around. In South Wales, miners showed a high degree of solidarity, as they came from isolated villages where most workers were employed in the pits, had similar lifestyles, and had an evangelical religious style based on Methodism that led to an ideology of egalitarianism. The dominance of mining in these local economies led Oxford professor Andrew Glyn to conclude that no pit closure could be beneficial for government revenue.

From 1981, the NUM was led by Arthur Scargill, a militant trade unionist and socialist, with strong leanings towards communism. Scargill was a vocal opponent of Thatcher&#x27;s government. In March 1983, he stated &quot;The policies of this government are clear – to destroy the coal industry and the NUM&quot;. Scargill wrote in the NUM journal &quot;The Miner&quot;: &quot;Waiting in the wings, wishing to chop us to pieces, is Yankee steel butcher MacGregor. This 70-year-old multi-millionaire import, who massacred half the steel workforce in less than three years, is almost certainly brought in to wield the axe on pits. It&#x27;s now or never for Britain&#x27;s mineworkers. This is the final chance – while we still have the strength – to save our industry&quot;. On 12 May 1983, in response to being questioned on how he would respond if the Conservatives were re-elected in the general election, Scargill replied: &quot;My attitude would be the same as the attitude of the working class in Germany when the Nazis came to power. It does not mean that because at some stage you elect a government that you tolerate its existence. You oppose it&quot;. He also said he would oppose a second-term Thatcher government &quot;as vigorously as I possibly can&quot;. After the election, Scargill called for extra-parliamentary action against the Conservative government in a speech to the NUM conference in Perth on 4 July 1983:

&quot;A fight back against this Government&#x27;s policies will inevitably take place outside rather than inside Parliament. When I talk about &#x27;extra-parliamentary action&#x27; there is a great outcry in the press and from leading Tories about my refusal to accept the democratic will of the people. I am not prepared to accept policies elected by a minority of the British electorate. I am not prepared quietly to accept the destruction of the coal industry, nor am I willing to see our social services decimated. This totally undemocratic Government can now easily push through whatever laws it chooses. Faced with possible parliamentary destruction of all that is good and compassionate in our society, extra-parliamentary action will be the only course open to the working class and the Labour movement.&quot;

Scargill also rejected the idea that pits that did not make a profit were &quot;uneconomic&quot;: he claimed there was no such thing as an uneconomic pit and argued that no pits should close except due to geological exhaustion or safety.

===National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers===
No mining could legally be done without being overseen by an overman or deputy. Their union, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) with 17,000 members in 1984, was less willing to take industrial action. Its constitution required a two-thirds majority for a national strike. During the 1972 strike, violent confrontations between striking NUM and non-striking NACODS members led to an agreement that NACODS members could stay off work without loss of pay if they were faced with aggressive picketing. Thus solidarity with striking NUM members could be shown by claims of violence preventing the crossing of picket lines even without a NACODS union vote for strike action. Initially the threshold for striking was not met; although a majority had voted for strike action, it was not enough. However, later during the strike 82% did vote for strike action.

==Sequence of events==

===Calls for action===
In January 1981, the Yorkshire area of the NUM held a successful ballot to approve strike action over any pit threatened with closure on economic grounds. This led to a two-week local strike over the closure of Orgreave Colliery, but the ballot result was later invoked to justify strikes over other closures, including Cortonwood in 1984. In February 1981, the government announced plans to close 23 pits across the country but the threat of a national strike was enough to force a back down. Coal stocks would last only six weeks, after which Britain would shut down and people would demand concessions. Thatcher realised she needed at least a six-month supply of coal to win a strike. In 1982, NUM members accepted a 9.3% pay rise, rejecting their leaders&#x27; call for a strike.

Most pits proposed for closure in 1981 were closed on a case-by-case basis by the colliery review procedure, and the NCB cut employment by 41,000 between March 1981 and March 1984. The effect of closures was lessened by transfers to other pits and the opening up of the Selby Coalfield where working conditions and wages were relatively favourable. Localised strikes occurred at Kinneil Colliery in Scotland and Lewis Merthyr Colliery in Wales. The industry&#x27;s Select Committee heard that 36,040 of the 39,685 redundancies between 1973 and 1982 were of men aged 55 and over, and redundancy pay was increased substantially in 1981 and 1983.

The NUM balloted its members for national strikes in January 1982, October 1982 and March 1983 regarding pit closures and restrained wages and each time a minority voted in favour, well short of the required 55% majority. In protest at a pay offer of 5.2%, the NUM instituted an overtime ban in November 1983, which remained in place at the onset of the strike.

===Thatcher&#x27;s strategy===

Thatcher expected Scargill to force a confrontation, and in response she set up a defence in depth. She believed that the excessive costs of increasingly inefficient collieries had to end in order to grow the economy. She planned to close inefficient pits and depend more on imported coal, oil, gas and nuclear. She appointed hardliners to key positions, set up a high level planning committee, and allocated funds from the highly profitable electrical supply system to stockpile at least six months&#x27; worth of coal. Thatcher&#x27;s team set up mobile police units so that forces from outside the strike areas could neutralise efforts by flying pickets to stop the transport of coal to power stations. It used the National Recording Centre (NRC), set up in 1972 by the Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales linking 43 police forces to enable police forces to travel to assist in major disturbances. Scargill played into her hands by ignoring the buildup of coal stocks and calling the strike at the end of winter when demand for coal was declining.

In 1983, Thatcher appointed Ian MacGregor to head the National Coal Board. He had turned the British Steel Corporation from one of the least efficient steel-makers in Europe to one of the most efficient, bringing the company into near profit. Success was achieved at the expense of halving the workforce in two years and he had overseen a 14-week national strike in 1980. His tough reputation raised expectations that coal jobs would be cut on a similar scale and confrontations between MacGregor and Scargill seemed inevitable.

===Debate over a national ballot===
On 19 April 1984 a Special National Delegate Conference was held where there was a vote on whether to hold a national ballot or not. The NUM delegates voted 69–54 not to have a national ballot, a position argued for by Arthur Scargill. Scargill states: &quot;Our special conference was held on 19 April. McGahey, Heathfield and I were aware from feedback that a slight majority of areas favoured the demand for a national strike ballot; therefore, we were expecting and had prepared for that course of action with posters, ballot papers and leaflets. A major campaign was ready to go for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in a national strike ballot.&quot; McGahey said: &quot;We shall not be constitutionalised out of a strike...Area by area will decide and there will be a domino effect&quot;.

Without a national ballot, most miners in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, South Derbyshire, North Wales and the West Midlands kept on working during the strike, along with a sizeable minority in Lancashire. The police provided protection for working miners from aggressive picketing.

===Pit closures announced===

On 6 March 1984, the NCB announced that the agreement reached after the 1974 strike was obsolete, and that to reduce government subsidies, 20 collieries would close with a loss of 20,000 jobs. Many communities in Northern England, Scotland and Wales would lose their primary source of employment.

Scargill said the government had a long-term strategy to close more than 70 pits. The government denied the claim and MacGregor wrote to every NUM member claiming Scargill was deceiving them and there were no plans to close any more pits than had already been announced. Cabinet papers released in 2014 indicate that MacGregor wished to close 75 pits over a three-year period. Meanwhile, the Thatcher government had prepared against a repeat of the effective 1974 industrial action by stockpiling coal, converting some power stations to burn heavy fuel oil, and recruiting fleets of road hauliers to transport coal in case sympathetic railwaymen went on strike to support the miners.

===Action begins===
Sensitive to the impact of proposed closures, miners in various coalfields began strike action. In Yorkshire, miners at Manvers, Cadeby, Silverwood, Kiveton Park and Yorkshire Main were on unofficial strike for other issues before official action was called. More than 6,000 miners were on strike from 5 March at Cortonwood and Bullcliffe Wood, near Wakefield. Neither pit&#x27;s reserves were exhausted. Bullcliffe Wood had been under threat, but Cortonwood had been considered safe. Action was prompted on 5 March by the NCB&#x27;s announcement that five pits would be subject to &quot;accelerated closure&quot; in just five weeks; the other three were Herrington in County Durham, Snowdown in Kent and Polmaise in Scotland. The next day, pickets from Yorkshire appeared at pits in Nottinghamshire and Harworth Colliery closed after a mass influx of pickets amid claims that Nottinghamshire was &quot;scabland in 1926&quot;. On 12 March 1984, Scargill declared the NUM&#x27;s support for the regional strikes in Yorkshire and Scotland, and called for action from NUM members in all other areas but decided not to hold a nationwide vote which was used by his opponents to delegitimise the strike.

===Picketing===

The strike was almost universally observed in South Wales, Yorkshire, Scotland, North East England and Kent, but there was less support across the Midlands and in North Wales. Nottinghamshire became a target for aggressive and sometimes violent picketing as Scargill&#x27;s pickets tried to stop local miners from working. Lancashire miners were reluctant to strike, but most refused to cross picket lines formed by the Yorkshire NUM. Picketing in Lancashire was less aggressive and is credited with a more sympathetic response from the local miners.

On 14 March 1984 David Gareth Jones, a South Kirkby miner from Acton Hall Colliery was killed whilst picketing at Ollerton Colliery. The &#x27;Battle of Orgreave&#x27; took place on 18 June 1984 at the Orgreave Coking Plant near Rotherham, which striking miners were attempting to blockade. The confrontation, between about 5,000 miners and the same number of police, broke into violence after police on horseback charged with truncheons drawn – 51 picketers and 72 policemen were injured. Other less well known, but bloody, battles between pickets and police took place, for example, in Maltby, South Yorkshire.

During the strike, 11,291 people were arrested, mostly for breach of the peace or obstructing roads whilst picketing, of whom 8,392 were charged and between 150 and 200 were imprisoned. At least 9,000 mineworkers were dismissed after being arrested whilst picketing even when no charges were brought.

After the 1980 steel strike, many hauliers blacklisted drivers who refused to cross picket lines to prevent them obtaining work, and so more drivers crossed picket lines in 1984–1985 than in previous disputes. Picketing failed to have the widespread impact of earlier stoppages that led to blackouts and power cuts in the 1970s and electricity companies maintained supplies throughout the winter, the time of biggest demand.

From September, some miners returned to work even where the strike had been universally observed. It led to an escalation of tension, and riots in Easington in Durham and Brampton Bierlow in Yorkshire.

===Strike ballots by NACODS===
In April 1984, NACODS voted to strike but was short of the two-thirds majority that their constitution required. In areas where the strike was observed, most NACODS members did not cross picket lines and, under an agreement from the 1972 strike, stayed off work on full pay. When the number of strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, said he expected NACODS members to cross picket lines to supervise their work threatening the 1972 agreement which led to a second ballot. MacGregor suggested that deputies could be replaced by outsiders as Ronald Reagan had done during the 1981 airline strike. In September, for the first time, NACODS voted to strike with a vote of 81% in favour. The government then made concessions over the review procedure for unprofitable collieries, much to the anger of MacGregor, and a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action.

The results of the review procedure were not binding on the NCB, and the NUM rejected the agreement. Reviews for Cadeby in Yorkshire and Bates in Northumberland concluded that the pits could stay open but the NCB overruled and closed them. The abandonment of strike plans when most of their demands had not been met led to conspiracy theories on the motives of NACODS leaders.

MacGregor later admitted that if NACODS had gone ahead with a strike, a compromise would probably have been forced on the NCB. Files later made public showed that the government had an informant inside the Trades Union Congress (TUC), passing information about negotiations.

In 2009, Scargill wrote that the settlement agreed with NACODS and the NCB would have ended the strike and said, &quot;The monumental betrayal by NACODS has never been explained in a way that makes sense.&quot;

===Court judgments on legality of strike===
In the first month of the strike, the NCB secured a court injunction to restrict picketing in Nottinghamshire, but the Energy Minister, Peter Walker forbade MacGregor from invoking it as the government considered it would antagonise the miners and unite them behind the NUM. Legal challenges were brought by groups of working miners, who subsequently organised as the Working Miners&#x27; Committee. David Hart, a farmer and property developer with libertarian political beliefs, did much to organise and fund working miners. On 25 May, a writ issued in the High Court by Colin Clark from Pye Hill Colliery, sponsored by Hart, was successful in forbidding the Nottinghamshire area from instructing that the strike was official and to be obeyed. Similar actions were successful in Lancashire and South Wales.

In September, Lord Justice Nicholls heard two cases, in the first, North Derbyshire miners argued that the strike was illegal both at area level, as a majority of its miners had voted against, and at national level, as there had been no ballot. In the second, two miners from Manton Colliery, in the Yorkshire area but geographically in North Nottinghamshire, argued that the area-level strike in Yorkshire was illegal. Miners at Manton had overwhelmingly voted against the strike, but police had advised that their safety could not be guaranteed. The NUM was not represented at the hearing. The High Court ruled that the NUM had breached its constitution by calling a strike without holding a ballot. Although Nicholls did not order the NUM to hold a ballot, he forbade the union from disciplining members who crossed picket lines.

The strike in Yorkshire relied on a ballot from January 1981, in which 85.6% of the members voted to strike if any pit was threatened with closure on economic grounds. The motion was passed with regard to the closure of Orgreave Colliery, which prompted a two-week strike. The NUM executive approved the decision in Yorkshire to invoke the ballot result as binding on 8 March 1984. Nicholls ruled that the 1981 ballot result was &quot;too remote in time [with]... too much change in the branch membership of the Area since then for that ballot to be capable of justifying a call to strike action two and a half years later.&quot; He ruled that the Yorkshire area could not refer to the strike as &quot;official&quot;, although he did not condemn the strike as &quot;illegal&quot; as he did in the case of the national strike and the North Derbyshire strike.

Scargill referred to the ruling as &quot;another attempt by an unelected judge to interfere in the union&#x27;s affairs.&quot; He was fined £1,000 (paid by an anonymous businessman), and the NUM was fined £200,000. When the union refused to pay, an order was made to sequester the union&#x27;s assets, but they had been transferred abroad. In October 1984, the NUM executive voted to cooperate with the court to recover the funds, despite opposition from Scargill, who stated in court that he was only apologising for his contempt of court because the executive voted for him to do so. By the end of January 1985, around £5 million of NUM assets had been recovered.

A Court of Session decision in Edinburgh ruled that Scottish miners had acted within their rights by taking local ballots on a show of hands and so union funds in Scotland could not be sequestered. &quot;During the strike, the one area they couldn&#x27;t touch was Scotland. They were sequestering the NUM funds, except in Scotland, because the judges deemed that the Scottish area had acted within the rules of the Union&quot; – David Hamilton MP, Midlothian.

Scargill claims &quot;It was essential to present a united response to the NCB and we agreed that, if the coal board planned to force pit closures on an area by area basis, then we must respond at least initially on that same basis. The NUM&#x27;s rules permitted areas to take official strike action if authorised by our national executive committee in accordance with Rule 41.&quot;

===Breakaway union===
The Nottinghamshire NUM supported the strike, but most of its members continued to work and many considered the strike unconstitutional given their majority vote against a strike and absence of a ballot for a national strike. As many working miners felt the NUM was not doing enough to protect them from intimidation from pickets, a demonstration was organised on May Day in Mansfield, in which the representative Ray Chadburn was shouted down, and fighting ensued between protesters for and against the strike.

In NUM elections in summer 1984, members in Nottinghamshire voted out most of the leaders who had supported the strike, so that 27 of 31 newly elected were opposed to the strike. The Nottinghamshire NUM then opposed the strike openly and stopped payments to local strikers. The national NUM attempted to introduce &quot;Rule 51&quot;, to discipline area leaders who were working against national policy. The action was nicknamed the &quot;star chamber court&quot; by working miners (in reference to the Star Chamber in English history). It was prevented by an injunction from the High Court.

Working miners in Nottinghamshire and South Derbyshire set up a new union: the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM). It attracted members from many isolated pits in England – including Agecroft and Parsonage in Lancashire, Chase Terrace and Trenton Workshops in Staffordshire, and Daw Mill in Warwickshire.

Although most Leicestershire miners continued working, they voted to stay in the NUM. Unlike Nottinghamshire, the leadership in Leicestershire never attempted to enforce the strike, and an official, Jack Jones, had publicly criticised Scargill. At some pits in Nottinghamshire – Ollerton, Welbeck and Clipstone – roughly half the workforce stayed in the NUM.

The TUC neither recognised nor condemned the new union. The UDM was eventually &quot;de facto&quot; recognised when the NCB included it in wage negotiations. MacGregor strongly encouraged the UDM. He announced that NUM membership was no longer a prerequisite for mineworkers&#x27; employment, ending the closed shop.

===The formal end===
The number of strikebreakers, sometimes referred to pejoratively as &quot;scabs&quot;, increased from the start of January, as the strikers struggled to pay for food as union pay ran out. They were not treated with the same contempt by strikers as those who had returned to work earlier, but in some collieries, fights broke out between hunger scabs who had been active pickets, and those who had broken the strike earlier.

The strike ended on 3 March 1985, nearly a year after it had begun. The South Wales area called for a return to work on condition that men sacked during the strike would be reinstated, but the NCB rejected the proposal when its bargaining position was improved by miners returning to work. Only the Yorkshire and Kent regions voted against ending the strike. One of the few concessions made by the NCB was to postpone the closure of the five pits: Cortonwood, Bullcliffe Wood, Herrington, Polmaise and Snowdown.

The issue of sacked miners was important in Kent, where several men had been sacked for a sit-in at Betteshanger Colliery. Kent NUM leader Jack Collins said after the decision to go back without any agreement of amnesty for the sacked men, &quot;The people who have decided to go back to work and leave men on the sidelines are traitors to the trade-union movement.&quot; The Kent NUM continued picketing across the country, delaying the return to work at many pits for two weeks. Some sources claim that the Scottish NUM continued the strike alongside Kent.

At several pits, miners&#x27; wives groups organised the distribution of carnations, the flower that symbolises the hero, at the pit gates on the day the miners went back. Many pits marched back to work behind brass bands, in processions dubbed &quot;loyalty parades&quot;. Scargill led a procession accompanied by a Scots piper, back to work at Barrow Colliery in Worsborough but then it was stopped by a picket of Kent miners. Scargill said, &quot;I never cross a picket line,&quot; and turned the procession away.

==Issues==

===Ballots===
The role of ballots in NUM policy had been disputed over a number of years, and a series of legal disputes in 1977 left their status unclear. In 1977, the implementation of an incentive scheme proved controversial, as different areas would receive different pay rates. After the NUM&#x27;s National Executive Conference rejected the scheme, NUM leader Joe Gormley arranged a national ballot. The Kent area who opposed the scheme sought a court injunction to prevent it, but Lord Denning ruled that &quot;the conference might not have spoken with the true voice of all the members and in his view a ballot was a reasonable and democratic proposal&quot;. The scheme was rejected by 110,634 votes to 87,901. The Nottinghamshire, South Derbyshire and Leicestershire areas resolved to adopt the incentive scheme as their members would benefit from increased pay. The Yorkshire, Kent and South Wales areas sought an injunction to prevent these actions on the grounds of the ballot result. Mr. Justice Watkins ruled that, &quot;The result of a ballot, nationally conducted, is not binding upon the National Executive Committee in using its powers in between conferences. It may serve to persuade the committee to take one action or another, or to refrain from action, but it has no great force or significance.&quot;

Scargill did not call a ballot for national strike action, perhaps due to uncertainty over the outcome. Instead, he started the strike by allowing each region to call its own strikes, imitating Gormley&#x27;s strategy over wage reforms; it was argued that &#x27;safe&#x27; regions should not be allowed to ballot other regions out of jobs. The decision was upheld by a vote by the NUM executive five weeks into the strike.

The NUM had held three ballots on national strikes: 55% voted against in January 1982, and 61% voted against in October 1982 and March 1983. Before the March 1983 vote, the Kent area, one of the most militant, argued for national strikes to be called by conferences of delegates rather than by ballot, but the proposal was rejected. As the strike began in 1984 with unofficial action in Yorkshire, there was pressure from strikers to make it official, and NUM executives who insisted on a ballot were attacked by pickets at an executive meeting in Sheffield in April. In contrast, a sit-in down the pit was held by supporters of a ballot at Hem Heath in Staffordshire. Although the Yorkshire area had a policy of opposing a national ballot, there was support for a ballot expressed by Yorkshire branches at Glasshoughton, Grimethorpe, Shireoaks and Kinsley.

Two polls by MORI in April 1984 found that the majority of miners supported a strike. Ken Livingstone wrote in his memoirs that Scargill had interpreted a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; poll that suggested a comfortable majority of miners favoured a national strike to be a trick and that he would actually lose a national ballot.

In ballots in South Wales on 10 March 1984, only 10 of the 28 pits voted in favour of striking, but the arrival of pickets from Yorkshire the next day led to virtually all miners in South Wales going on strike in solidarity. The initial vote against strike action by most lodges in South Wales was interpreted as an act of retaliation for a lack of support from Yorkshire in years when numerous pits in Wales were closing, especially following the closure of the Lewis Merthyr colliery in March 1983 and only 54% of Yorkshire miners voting for a national strike that month, a full 14% below the vote for a national strike in both South Wales and Kent.

Area ballots on 15 and 16 March 1984 saw verdicts against a strike in Cumberland, Midlands, North Derbyshire (narrowly), South Derbyshire, Lancashire, Leicestershire (with around 90% against), Nottinghamshire and North Wales. The Northumberland NUM voted by a small majority in favour, but below the 55% needed for official approval. NUM leaders in Lancashire argued that, as 41% had voted in favour of a strike, all its members should strike &quot;in order to maintain unity&quot;.

The Conservative government under Thatcher enforced a law that required unions to ballot members on strike action. On 19 July 1984, Thatcher said in the House of Commons that giving in to the miners would be surrendering the rule of parliamentary democracy to the rule of the mob. She referred to union leaders as &quot;the enemy within&quot; and claimed they did not share the values of other British people; advocates of the strike misinterpreted the quote to suggest that Thatcher had used it as a reference to all miners.

Thatcher on 19 July 1984 delivered a speech in which she spoke to backbench MPs and compared the Falklands War to the strike:

She claimed that the miners&#x27; leader was making the country witness an attempt at preventing democracy.

On the day after the Orgreave picket of 18 June, which saw five thousand pickets clash violently with police, she remarked:

I must tell you... that what we have got is an attempt to substitute the rule of the mob for the rule of law, and &quot;it must not succeed&quot;. &quot;[cheering]&quot; It must not succeed. There are those who are using violence and intimidation to impose their will on others who do not want it... The rule of law must prevail over the rule of the mob.

Neil Kinnock supported the call for a national ballot in April 1984. Scargill&#x27;s response to the Orgreave incident was:

We&#x27;ve had riot shields, we&#x27;ve had riot gear, we&#x27;ve had police on horseback charging into our people, we&#x27;ve had people hit with truncheons and people kicked to the ground... The intimidation and the brutality that has been displayed are something reminiscent of a Latin American state.

At the Battle of Orgreave on 18 June 1984, the NUM pickets failed to stop the movement of lorries amid police violence and subsequent retaliation by the pickets, with the footage controversially reversed by the BBC on their news broadcast. The violence was costing the NUM public support in the country as a whole, as a Gallup poll showed 79% disapproval of NUM methods. While it was now clear that the government had the equipment, the forces, the organisation, and the will to prevail against pickets, the strong pro-strike solidarity outside of the Midlands and the possibility of extended strike action by other trade unions, especially the NACODS which could shut down every pit in the country if NACODS members went on strike, was a constant threat for the government and had the outcome of who would be likely to win the miners&#x27; strike dispute hanging in the balance for many months.

The number of miners at work grew to 53,000 by late June.

====Votes for strike action by area====
The table shows a breakdown by area of the results of strike ballots of January 1982, October 1982 and March 1983, and the results of area ballots in March 1984. The table is taken from Callinicos &amp; Simons (1985). Cases from 1984 where lodges voted separately (as in South Wales and Scotland) are not shown.

===Mobilisation of police===
The government mobilised police forces from around Britain including the Metropolitan Police in an attempt to stop pickets preventing strikebreakers from working. They attempted to stop pickets travelling from Yorkshire to Nottinghamshire which led to many protests. On 26 March 1984, pickets protested against the police powers by driving very slowly on the M1 and the A1 around Doncaster. The government claimed the actions were to uphold the law and safeguard individual civil rights. The police were given powers to halt and reroute traffic away from collieries, and some areas of Nottinghamshire became difficult to reach by road.

In the first 27 weeks of the strike, 164,508 &quot;presumed pickets&quot; were prevented from entering the county. When pickets from Kent were stopped at the Dartford Tunnel and preventing from travelling to the Midlands, the Kent NUM applied for an injunction against use of this power. Sir Michael Havers initially denied the application outright, but Mr Justice Skinner later ruled that the power may only be used if the anticipated breach of the peace were &quot;in close proximity both in time and place&quot;.
On 16 July 1984, Thatcher convened a ministerial meeting to consider declaring a state of emergency, with the option to use 4,500 military drivers and 1,650 tipper trucks to keep coal supplies available. This backup plan was not needed and was not implemented.

During the strike 11,291 people were arrested and 8,392 were charged with breach of the peace or obstructing the highway. In many former mining areas antipathy towards the police remained strong for many years. Bail forms for picketing offences set restrictions on residence and movement in relation to NCB property. Tony Benn compared the powers to the racial pass laws in South Africa.

===No welfare benefit payments===
Welfare benefits had never been available to strikers but their dependents had been entitled to make claims in previous disputes. Clause 6 of the Social Security Act 1980 banned the dependents of strikers from receiving &quot;urgent needs&quot; payments and applied a compulsory deduction from the benefits of strikers&#x27; dependents. The government viewed the legislation not as concerned with saving public funds but &quot;to restore a fairer bargaining balance between employers and trade unions&quot; by increasing the necessity to return to work. The Department of Social Security assumed that striking miners were receiving £15 per week from the union (equivalent to £49 in 2019), based on payments early in the strike that were not made in the later months when funds had become exhausted.

===MI5 &quot;counter-subversion&quot;===
The Director General of MI5 from 1992 to 1996, Dame Stella Rimington, wrote in her autobiography in 2001 that MI5 &#x27;counter-subversion&#x27; exercises against the NUM and striking miners included tapping union leaders&#x27; phones. She denied the agency had informers in the NUM, specifically denying its chief executive Roger Windsor had been an agent.

===Public opinion and the media===
According to John Campbell &quot;though there was widespread sympathy for the miners, faced with the loss of their livelihoods, there was remarkably little public support for the strike, because of Scargill&#x27;s methods&quot;. When asked in a Gallup poll in July 1984 whether their sympathies lay mainly with the employers or the miners, 40% said employers; 33% were for the miners; 19% were for neither and 8% did not know. When asked the same question during 5–10 December 1984, 51% had most sympathy for the employers; 26% for the miners; 18% for neither and 5% did not know. When asked in July 1984 whether they approved or disapproved of the methods used by the miners, 15% approved; 79% disapproved and 6% did not know. When asked the same question during 5–10 December 1984, 7% approved; 88% disapproved and 5% did not know. In July 1984, when asked whether they thought the miners were using responsible or irresponsible methods, 12% said responsible; 78% said irresponsible and 10% did not know. When asked the same question in August 1984, 9% said responsible; 84% said irresponsible and 7% did not know.



&quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper took a very anti-strike position, as did the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and even the Labour Party-supporting &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; became hostile as the strike became increasingly violent. The &quot;Morning Star&quot; was the only national daily newspaper that consistently supported the striking miners and the NUM.

Socialist groups saw the mainstream media as deliberately misrepresenting the miners&#x27; strike, with Mick Duncan of the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty saying of &quot;The Sun&quot;″s reporting of the strike: &quot;The day-to-day reporting involved more subtle attacks, or a biased selection of facts and a lack of alternative points of view. These things arguably had a far bigger negative effect on the miners&#x27; cause&quot;.

Writing in the &quot;Industrial Relations Journal&quot; immediately after the strike in 1985, Professor Brian Towers of the University of Nottingham commented on the way the media had portrayed strikers, stating that there had been &quot;the obsessive reporting of the &#x27;violence&#x27; of generally relatively unarmed men and some women who, in the end, offered no serious challenge to the truncheons, shields and horses of a well-organised, optimally deployed police force.&quot;

The stance of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; varied. Having initially been uninterested in the dispute, the paper&#x27;s owner Robert Maxwell took a supportive stance in July 1984 by organising a seaside trip for striking miners and meeting with NUM officials to discuss tactics. However, Maxwell insisted that Scargill should condemn the violence directed against strike-breakers, which he was unwilling to do. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; then adopted a more critical stance, and journalist John Pilger published several articles on the violence directed against strike-breakers.

===NUM links with Libya and the Soviet Union===
As the courts seized the NUM&#x27;s assets, it began to look abroad for money, and found supplies in the Soviet bloc and, it was mistakenly thought, also from Libya. These countries were highly unpopular with the British public. The Soviet Union&#x27;s official trade union federation donated £1.5 million to the NUM.

Media reports alleged that senior NUM officials were personally keeping some of the funds. In November 1984, it was alleged that senior NUM officials had travelled to Libya for money. Cash from the Libyan government was particularly damaging coming seven months after the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London by Libyan agents. In 1990, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and TV programme &quot;The Cook Report&quot; claimed that Scargill and the NUM had received money from the Libyan government. The allegations were based on allegations by Roger Windsor, who was the NUM official who had spoken to Libyan officials. Roy Greenslade, the editor of the &quot;Mirror&quot;, said 18 years later he was &quot;now convinced that Scargill didn&#x27;t misuse strike funds and that the union didn&#x27;t get money from Libya.&quot; This was long after an investigation by Seumas Milne described the allegations as wholly without substance and a &quot;classic smear campaign&quot;.

MI5 surveillance on NUM vice-president Mick McGahey found he was &quot;extremely angry and embarrassed&quot; about Scargill&#x27;s links with the Libyan regime, but did not express his concerns publicly; however he was happy to take money from the Soviet Union. Stella Rimington, wrote, &quot;We in MI5 limited our investigations to those who were using the strike for subversive purposes.&quot;

Polish trade union Solidarity criticised Scargill for &quot;going too far and threatening the elected government&quot;, which influenced some Polish miners in Britain to oppose the strike. Scargill opposed Solidarity as an &quot;anti-socialist organisation which desires the overthrow of a socialist state&quot;. The supply of Polish coal to British power stations during the strike led to a brief picket of the embassy of Poland in London.

===Violence===
====Against strikebreakers====
The strike was the most violent industrial dispute in Britain of the 20th century. Strikes in the British coal industry had a history of violence, but the 1984–1985 strike exceeded even the 1926 strike in the levels of violence. Nevertheless, the majority of pickets lines were non-violent. Instances of violence directed against working miners were reported from the start. The BBC reported that pickets from Polmaise Colliery had punched miners at Bilston Glen Colliery who were trying to enter their workplace on 12 March. Property, families and pets belonging to working miners were also attacked. Ted McKay, the North Wales secretary who supported a national ballot before strike action, said he had received death threats and threats to kidnap his children. The intimidation of working miners in Nottinghamshire, vandalism to cars and pelting them with stones, paint or brake fluid, was a major factor in the formation of the breakaway UDM.

Occasionally, attacks were made on working members of NACODS and administrative staff. In March 1984 the NCB announced it would abandon Yorkshire Main Colliery after a deputy engineer suffered a split chin from being stoned and administrative staff had to be escorted out by the police. Some pits continued working without significant disruption. In Leicestershire only 31 miners went on strike for the full 12 months and in South Derbyshire only 17, but these areas were not targeted by pickets in the same way as Nottinghamshire.

On 9 July 1984 pickets at Rossington Colliery attempted to trap 11 NCB safety inspectors inside the colliery. Camera teams were present as two police vans arrived to assist the safety inspectors and were attacked by missiles from the pickets.

Following the breakdown of relations between the NUM and the ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation), NUM pickets threw bricks, concrete and eggs full of paint at lorries transporting coal and iron ore to South Wales. In September 1984, Viv Brook, assistant chief constable of South Wales Police, warned that throwing concrete from motorway bridges was likely to kill someone. Taxi driver, David Wilkie, was killed on 30 November 1984 while driving a non-striking miner to Merthyr Vale Colliery, in South Wales. Two striking miners dropped a concrete post onto his car from a road bridge and he died at the scene. The miners served a prison sentence for manslaughter. Police reported that the incident had a sobering effect on many of the pickets and led to a decrease in aggression.

In Airedale, Castleford where most miners were on strike, a working miner, Michael Fletcher, was savagely beaten in November 1984. A masked gang waving baseball bats invaded his house and beat him for five minutes, whilst his pregnant wife and children hid upstairs. Fletcher suffered a broken shoulder blade, dislocated elbow and two broken ribs. Two miners from Wakefield were convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and four others were acquitted of riot and assault.

Scargill said in December 1984 that those who returned to work after taking the NCB&#x27;s incentives for strikebreaking should be treated as &quot;lost lambs&quot; rather than traitors. When questioned by the media, Scargill refused to condemn the violence, which he attributed to the hardship and frustration of pickets, with the one exception being the killing of David Wilkie. There was criticism of picket-line violence from lodges at striking pits, such as the resolution by the Grimethorpe and Kellingley lodges in Yorkshire that condemned throwing bricks.

Even amongst supporters, picketing steel plants to prevent deliveries of coal and coke caused great divisions. Local branches agreed to deals with local steel plants on the amounts to be delivered. In June 1984, the NUM area leader for South Wales, Emlyn Williams, defied orders from Scargill to stop deliveries of coal by rail to steel plants, but he capitulated after a vote by the national executive to end dispensations.
====Against strikers and pickets====
Violence in Nottinghamshire was directed towards strikers and supporters of the NUM national line. NUM secretary Jimmy Hood reported his car was vandalised and his garage set on fire. In Leicestershire, &quot;scab&quot; was chanted by the working majority against the few who went on strike, on the grounds that they had betrayed their area&#x27;s union.

Two pickets, David Jones and Joe Green, were killed in separate incidents, and three teenagers (Darren Holmes, aged 15, and Paul Holmes and Paul Womersley, both aged 14) died picking coal from a colliery waste heap in the winter. The NUM names its memorial lectures after the pickets. Jones&#x27;s death raised tensions between strikers and those who continued to work. On 15 March 1984, he was hit in the chest by a half-brick thrown by a youth who opposed the strike when he confronted him for vandalising his car, but the post-mortem ruled that this had not caused his death and it was more likely to have been caused by being pressed against the pit gates earlier in the day. News of his death led to hundreds of pickets staying in Ollerton town centre overnight. At the request of Nottinghamshire Police, Scargill appeared and called for calm in the wake of the tragedy. Several working miners in Ollerton reported that their gardens and cars had been vandalised during the night. Ollerton Colliery closed for a few days as a mark of respect for Jones.

Policing was extensive from the start, a policy to avoid the problems of 1972, when the police were overwhelmed by the number of pickets at the Battle of Saltley Gate. Many families in South Yorkshire complained that the police were abusive and damaged property needlessly whilst pursuing pickets.

During the Battle of Orgreave, television cameras caught a policeman repeatedly lashing out at a picket on his head with a truncheon but no charges were made against the officer, identified as a member of Northumbria Police. The heavy-handed policing at Orgreave, including from some senior officers was criticised. At the 1985 Police Federation conference, Ronald Carroll from West Yorkshire Police argued that, &quot;The police were used by the Coal Board to do all their dirty work. Instead of seeking the civil remedies under the existing civil law, they relied completely on the police to solve their problems by implementing the criminal law.&quot; A motion at the 1984 Labour Party conference won heavy support for blaming all the violence in the strike on the police, despite opposition from Kinnock.

===Fundraising===
Union funds struggled to cover the year-long strike, so strikers had to raise their own funds. The Kent area&#x27;s effective fundraising from sympathisers in London and in continental Europe was resented by other areas. The Yorkshire area&#x27;s reliance on mass picketing led to a neglect of fundraising, and many Yorkshire strikers were living in poverty by the winter of 1984. A soup kitchen opened in Yorkshire in April 1984, for the first time since the 1920s. Wakefield Council provided free meals for children during school holidays. The Labour-dominated councils of Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Wakefield reduced council-house rents and local tax rates for striking miners, but the Conservative Selby Council refused any assistance, although the Selby pits had higher numbers of commuters.

In Leicestershire, the area&#x27;s NUM made no payments to the few who went on strike, on the grounds that the area had voted against industrial action. Fundraising for the so-called &quot;Dirty Thirty&quot; striking Leicestershire miners was extensive and they redirected some of their excess aid to other parts of the NUM. Many local businesses in pit villages donated money to NUM funds, although some claimed they were threatened with boycotts or vandalism if they did not contribute.

Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners held &quot;Pits and Perverts&quot; concerts to raise money which led the NUM to become supportive of gay rights in subsequent years. Some groups prioritised aid to pits in South Wales, as they felt that Scargill was distributing donations to his most favoured pits in Kent and Yorkshire. The ISTC donated food parcels and toys during the summer, but gave no money as they did not want to be accused of financing the aggressive picketing.

Chesterfield FC gave discounted tickets to striking miners until the start of 1985, when it abandoned the policy as most North Derbyshire miners had returned to work.

Bruce Springsteen donated $20,000 to the Northumberland and Durham Miners Support Group in the aftermath of the strike.

====Women Against Pit Closures====
In the early weeks of the strike, the media reported that miners&#x27; wives in Nottinghamshire were encouraging their husbands to defy the flying pickets and were against the strike. In response, a group of miners&#x27; wives and girlfriends who supported the strike set up a network that became known as Women Against Pit Closures. The support groups organised collections outside supermarkets, communal kitchens, benefit concerts and other activities. The strike marked an important development in the traditional mining heartlands, where feminist ideas had not been strong.

==Variation in observing the strike==
The figures below are given in Richards (1996). The figures of working and striking miners were an issue of controversy throughout the dispute, and some other sources give figures that contradict Richards&#x27;s table.

No figures are available for the 1,000 NCB staff employees.

Some of the above areas were large and had high internal variances. Within the large geographical Yorkshire area, there was still something of a regional variation in observing the strike despite the still high 97.3% overall Yorkshire solidarity rate in observing the strike in November 1984, as miners from South Yorkshire were considerably more militant than miners from North Yorkshire. This was something which became clearer still in the last three months of the strike with the number of North Yorkshire miners drifting back to work.

At the South Leicester colliery, there was reportedly only one miner who stayed on strike for the full 12 months.

===Analysis of the situation in Nottinghamshire===
A number of reasons have been advanced for the lack of support by the Nottinghamshire miners for the strike. It was compared to the return to work led by George Spencer in Nottinghamshire during the 1926 coal strike, but Nottinghamshire had gone on strike alongside other regions in 1972 and 1974. Other explanations include the perception that Nottinghamshire pits were safe from the threat of closure, as they had large reserves, and the area-level incentive scheme introduced by Tony Benn caused them to be amongst the best-paid in Britain.

David Amos noted that some pits in Nottinghamshire closed in the early 1980s. He argues that Nottinghamshire miners reacted in the same way in 1984 as they did to the unofficial strikes in 1969 and 1970, both of which saw blockading of Nottinghamshire pits by striking miners from South Yorkshire and both of which were regarded as unconstitutional under NUM rules.

As the Nottinghamshire collieries had attracted displaced miners from Scotland and the north-east in the 1960s, it has been argued that they were reluctant to strike to stop pit closures when there had been no action to save their home pits from closure. A large Polish community in Nottinghamshire (especially Ollerton) had been alienated by Scargill&#x27;s policy of supporting the Communist government in Poland against the Solidarity union, which the NUM previously had supported. David John Douglass, a branch delegate at Hatfield Colliery dismissed the suggestions as the Doncaster pits also had large numbers of displaced and Polish miners, yet it was amongst the most militant areas of the NUM.

Nottinghamshire NUM executive Henry Richardson argued that the Nottinghamshire miners would have probably voted for strike had they not been subjected to so much intimidation within days of the walk-out in Yorkshire, which prompted many to defy the Yorkshire pickets as a matter of principle. At some pits, most miners initially refused to cross picket lines formed by Welsh miners but returned to work when more aggressive pickets arrived from Yorkshire. After the strike, Mick McGahey, one of the most prominent voices against a national ballot, said that he accepted &quot;some responsibility&quot; for alienating the Nottinghamshire miners through aggressive picketing. Jonathan and Ruth Winterton have suggested that the greater success of picketing in Lancashire, a region with little tradition of mining militancy but where the majority of its miners were on strike for the majority of the 1984–85 national strike, might be ascribed to the more diplomatic tactics of the North Yorkshire NUM pickets that went to Lancashire, and to the North Yorkshire NUM officials who worked with the Lancashire NUM to coordinate more respectful picketing, in contrast to the aggressive tactics adopted by South Yorkshire pickets in Nottinghamshire. The Marxist academic Alex Callinicos has suggested that the NUM officials had failed to make the case to their members adequately and believes that the Nottinghamshire miners were simply ignorant of the issues.

==Responses to the strike==
The opposition Labour Party was divided in its attitude, its leader Neil Kinnock, whose late father had been a miner, was critical of the government&#x27;s handling of the strike, but distanced himself from the leadership of the NUM over the issues of the ballot and violence against strikebreakers. Kinnock later said that it was &quot;the greatest regret of [his] whole life&quot; that he did not call for a national ballot at an earlier stage. He condemned the actions of pickets and police as &quot;violence&quot;, which prompted a statement from the Police Federation that some officers would struggle to work under a Labour government. He appeared on a picket line on 3 January 1985, after having said in November that he was &quot;too busy&quot;.

Kinnock appeared at a Labour Party rally alongside Scargill in Stoke-on-Trent on 30 November 1984 – the day of the killing of David Wilkie. His speech developed into an argument with hecklers who saw him as having betrayed the NUM by failing to support the strike. Kinnock began by saying, &quot;We meet here tonight in the shadow of an outrage.&quot; When interrupted, Kinnock accused the hecklers of &quot;living like parasites off the struggle of the miners.&quot; As Kinnock denounced the lack of the ballot, violence against strikebreakers and Scargill&#x27;s tactical approach, he was asked by hecklers what he had done for the striking miners. Kinnock shouted back, &quot;Well, I was not telling them lies. That&#x27;s what I was not doing during that period.&quot; It was a thinly-veiled attack on Scargill, whom he later admitted he detested. Kinnock later blamed Scargill for the failure of the strike.

Former party leader and prime minister James Callaghan said that a ballot was needed to decide when to end the strike and return to work. Tony Benn was vocal in support of Scargill&#x27;s leadership during the strike. In addition, 12 left-wing MPs refused to sit down in the Commons in January in an attempt to force a debate on the strike.

The Communist Party supported the strike and opposed Thatcher&#x27;s government, but expressed reservations about Scargill&#x27;s tactics. Peter Carter said that Scargill had &quot;the idea that the miners could win the strike alone through a re-run of Saltley Gate&quot;. The 39th congress of the party passed a motion that the strike could not succeed without sympathy from the wider public and other unions, and that the aggressive picketing was dividing the working class and alienating public support.

In contrast to the close cooperation with the TUC in the 1970s, the NUM never asked the TUC to support the strike and wrote at the outset to say that, &quot;No request is being made by this union for the intervention or assistance of the TUC.&quot; Scargill disliked Len Murray and blamed the TUC for the failure of the 1926 General Strike. Part way through the strike, Norman Willis took over from Murray as general secretary of the TUC. He attempted to repair relations between Scargill and Kinnock, but to no avail. When speaking in a miners&#x27; hall in November 1984, Willis condemned the violence and advocated a compromise, which led to a noose being lowered slowly from the rafters until it rested close to his head.

The NUM had a &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; with the ISTC and the railway unions. Solidarity action was taken by railway workers and few crossed picket lines, but the NUM never asked the railway unions to strike. In contrast, Scargill demanded that steel workers not cross miners&#x27; picket lines and only work to keep furnaces in order. Bill Sirs of the ISTC felt that Scargill was reneging on an agreement to deliver coke. British Steel was planning to close a steel plant and steel workers feared that support for the strikers might make closure more likely.
The National Union of Seamen supported the strike and limited the transport of coal. The decision was taken by a delegates&#x27; conference and not authorised by an individual ballot. Transport leaders, Ross Evans and Ron Todd, supported the NUM &quot;without reservation&quot;, but an increasing proportion of drivers were not unionised and they failed to have much influence. The Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, actively opposed the strike; Ian MacGregor&#x27;s autobiography detailed how its leaders supplied the government with information that allowed the strike to be defeated. The EETPU was supportive of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers and met with its leaders before the TUC had extended formal recognition.

==Long-term impact==
During the strike, many pits lost their customers and the immediate problem facing the industry was due to the economic recession of the early-1980s. There was extensive competition in the world coal market and a concerted move towards oil and gas for power production. The government&#x27;s policy, the Ridley Plan, was to reduce Britain&#x27;s reliance on coal on the grounds that it could be imported from Australia, the United States and Colombia more cheaply than it could be produced in Britain. The strike emboldened the NCB to accelerate the closure of pits on economic grounds.

Tensions between strikers and those who worked continued after the return to work. Many strikebreakers left the industry and were shunned or attacked by other miners. Almost all the strikebreakers in Kent had left the industry by April 1986, after suffering numerous attacks on their homes. At Betteshanger Colliery, posters were put up with photographs and names of the thirty strikebreakers. A wildcat strike at South Kirkby Colliery was supported by neighbouring Ferrymoor-Riddings on 30 April 1985 after four men were dismissed for attacks on strikebreakers, and another wildcat strike occurred at Hatfield Colliery in April 1986 after it emerged that there was a strikebreaker had not been transferred away from the pit. In contrast, other pits that had been divided by the strike managed to work without any harassment.

The NCB was accused of deserting the strikebreakers, as abuse, threats and assaults continued, and requests for transfers to other pits were declined. Michael Eaton argued that &quot;a decision to return to work was a personal decision on the part of the individual.&quot;

Miners were demoralised and sought work in other industries. Scargill&#x27;s authority in the NUM was challenged and his calls for another strike in 1986 were ignored. Mick McGahey, who was loyal to Scargill during the strike, became critical of him. McGahey claimed the leadership was becoming separated from its membership, the violence had gone too far and argued for reconciliation with the UDM. Scargill said that it was a &quot;tragedy that people from the far north should pontificate about what we should be doing to win back members for the NUM.&quot; Scargill became president of the NUM for life in 1985.

In the aftermath of the strike, miners were offered large redundancy payments in ballots organised by the NCB and the offers were accepted even at the most militant pits. The manager of the militant Yorkshire Main Colliery said at the time of the pit&#x27;s vote to close in October 1985, &quot;I know people who abused us and threatened us on the picket line and then were the first to put in for redundancy.&quot;

In 1991, the South Yorkshire Police paid compensation of £425,000 to 39 miners who were arrested during the incident. This was for &quot;assault, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution&quot;.

The coal industry was privatised in December 1994 creating &quot;R.J.B. Mining&quot;, subsequently known as UK Coal. Between the end of the strike and privatisation, pit closures continued with many closures in the early-1990s. There were 15 British Coal deep mines left in production at the time of privatisation, but by March 2005, there were only eight deep mines left. Since then, the last pit in Northumberland, Ellington Colliery has closed whilst pits at Rossington and Harworth have been mothballed. In 1983, Britain had 174 working collieries; by 2009 there were six. The last deep colliery in the UK, Kellingley Colliery, known locally as &quot;The Big K&quot; closed for the last time on 18 December 2015, bringing an end to centuries of deep coal mining.

The 1994 European Union inquiry into poverty classified Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire as the poorest settlement in the country and one of the poorest in the EU. South Yorkshire became an Objective 1 development zone and every ward in the City of Wakefield district was classified as in need of special assistance.

In 2003, the reduced mining industry was reportedly more productive in terms of output per worker than the coal industries in France, Germany and the United States.

A murder in Annesley, Nottinghamshire in 2004 was believed to be the result of an argument between former members of the NUM and UDM, indicating continued tensions, but was subsequently found to be unrelated.

In the 2016 Brexit referendum, cities and regions at the heart of the dispute voted by a majority to leave. Scargill, a supporter of leaving the EU, said that the Brexit vote presented an opportunity to re-open closed coal mines.

In 2021 Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, argued the policing of the strike was politically motivated and &quot;took policing a long time to recover&quot; from, and warned that the proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill risked drawing policing into politics once more.

===Pardons===
In October 2020, the Scottish Government announced plans to introduce legislation to pardon Scottish miners convicted of certain offences during the strike. The announcement, by Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, followed the recommendation of an independent review on the impact of policing on communities during the strike.

==Historical assessments==
Many historians have provided interpretations and explanations of the defeat, largely centring on Scargill&#x27;s decisions.

* Numerous scholars have concluded that Scargill&#x27;s decisive tactical error was to substitute his famous flying picket for the holding of a national strike ballot. His policy divided the NUM membership, undermined his position with the leaders of the trade union movement, hurt the union&#x27;s reputation in British public opinion, and led to violence along the picket line. That violence strengthened the stature of the Coal Board and the Thatcher government.
* Robert Taylor depicts Scargill as an &#x27;industrial Napoleon&#x27; who called a strike &#x27;at the wrong time&#x27; on the &#x27;wrong issue&#x27;, and adopted strategies and tactics that were &#x27;impossibilist&#x27;, with &#x27;an inflexible list of extravagant non-negotiable demands&#x27; that amounted to &#x27;reckless adventurism&#x27; that was &#x27;a dangerous, self-defeating delusion&#x27;.
* Journalist Andrew Marr argues that:
* In a book published by the National Coal Mining Museum for England, David John Douglass argues that too much focus has been put on the personality of Scargill and not enough on the decision of the Yorkshire NUM to invoke the area&#x27;s 1981 ballot result to strike against economic closures.

In January 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron stated, &quot;I think if anyone needs to make an apology for their role in the miners&#x27; strike it should be Arthur Scargill for the appalling way that he led the union.&quot; This was in the Prime Minister&#x27;s rejection of Labour calls for an apology for government actions during the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike. His comments followed a question in the Commons from Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who said the miners and their families deserved an apology for the mine closures.

==Cultural references==
===Films and television===
Independent filmmakers documented the strike including the behaviour of the police, the role of miners&#x27; wives and the role of the media. The outcome was the Miner&#x27;s Campaign Tapes.

Ken Loach made three films about the strike. &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; focussed on music and poetry was made for The South Bank Show but was rejected on the grounds that it was too politically partial for an arts programme. After winning an award at an Italian film festival, it was broadcast on Channel 4 on 9 January 1985. &quot;End of the Battle... Not the End of the War?&quot; (1985) suggested that the Conservative Party planned tactics for defeating the NUM from the early 1970s. &quot;The Arthur Legend&quot;, broadcast for &quot;Dispatches&quot; on Channel 4 in 1991, analysed allegations of financial impropriety and links with Libya against Arthur Scargill, and argued that the claims made by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Cook Report&quot; were baseless.

The setting for the 1986 anime film &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; was inspired by the Welsh strikes. Director Hayao Miyazaki was visiting Wales at the time, and was impressed by the way the Welsh miners fought to save their way of life, and their sense of community.

The 2000 film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, set in 1984, was based around mining communities in Easington Colliery and Seaham. The father and brother of the title character are striking miners. Several scenes depict the chaos at picket lines, clashes between armies of police and striking miners, and the shame associated with crossing the picket line. It showed the abject poverty associated with the strike and the harshness and desperation of not having coal for heat in winter. The film was turned into a musical, &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot; with music by Elton John and book and lyrics by Lee Hall, who wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay.

The 1996 film &quot;Brassed Off&quot; was set 10 years after the strike in the era when numerous pits closed before the privatisation of British Coal. The film refers to the strike and some of the dialogue contrasts the resistance in 1984 with the resignation with which most miners responded to the pit closures of the early 1990s. It was set in the fictional town of Grimley, a thin disguise for the hard-hit ex-mining village of Grimethorpe, where some of it was filmed.

The satirical &quot;Comic Strip Presents&quot; episode &quot;The Strike&quot; (1988) depicts an idealistic Welsh screenwriter&#x27;s growing dismay as his hard-hitting and grittily realistic script about the strike is mutilated by a Hollywood producer into an all-action thriller. The film parodies Hollywood films by overdramatising the strike and changing most of the important historic facts. It won a Golden Rose and Press Reward at the Montreux Festival.

The &quot;1984&quot; episode of the 1996 BBC television drama serial &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; revolves around the strike, and scenes of clashes between the police and strikers were re-created using many men who had taken part in the real-life events on the miners&#x27; side. In 2005, BBC One broadcast the one-off drama &quot;Faith&quot;, written by William Ivory. Many of the social scenes were filmed in the former colliery town of Thorne, near Doncaster. It viewed the strike from the perspective of both the police and the miners.

The British film &quot;The Big Man&quot; casts Liam Neeson as a Scottish coalminer who has been unemployed since the strike. His character has been blacklisted due to striking a police officer and has served a six-month prison sentence for the offence.

The 2014 film &quot;Pride&quot;, directed by Matthew Warchus, is based on a true story of a group of LGBT activists who raised funds to assist and support families in a Welsh mining village.

David Peace&#x27;s novel &quot;GB84&quot; is set during the strike.

Val McDermid&#x27;s novel &quot;A Darker Domain&quot; (2008) has a plotline set in the strike. Multiple reviewers gave the book acclaim for exploring its social and emotional repercussions.

Kay Sutcliffe, the wife of a striking miner at Aylesham, wrote the poem &quot;Coal not Dole&quot;, which became popular with the &quot;Women Against Pit Closures&quot; groups across the country and was later made into a song by Norma Waterson.

The verse novel &quot;Hope Now&quot; by A. L. Richards, published 2013 by Landfox Press, is set in the South Wales Valleys and is based on events during the strike.

In 2001, British visual artist Jeremy Deller worked with historical societies, battle re-enactors, and people who participated in the violent 1984 clashes between picketers and police to reconstruct and re-enact the Battle of Orgreave. A documentary about the re-enactment was produced by Deller and director Mike Figgis and was broadcast on British television; and Deller published a book called &quot;The English Civil War Part II&quot; documenting both the project and the historical events it investigates.

On 5 March 2010, the 25th anniversary of the strike, an artwork by visual artist Dan Savage was unveiled in Sunderland Civic Centre. Commissioned by Sunderland City Council, Savage worked with the Durham Miners Association to create the large scale commemorative window, which features images and symbols of the strike and the North East&#x27;s mining heritage.

In August 1984, photographer Keith Pattison was commissioned by Sunderland&#x27;s Artists&#x27; Agency to photograph the strike in Easington Colliery for a month. He remained there on and off until it ended in March 1985, photographing from behind the lines a community rallying together against implacable opposition. Twenty-five years later, on 6 May 2010, Election Day, Pattison took David Peace to Easington to interview three of the people caught up in the strike. A selection of the photographs together with the interviews were published in book form – &#x27;No Redemption&#x27; (Flambard Press).

Premiering on 13 June 2022, the BBC One series Sherwood (2022 TV series) is a fictionalized murder mystery set both in 1984 and in the present day in the Ashfield area of Nottinghamshire surrounding deep divisions in the community between striking miners, police officers, non-striking miners, and their descendants.

In 2024 a documentary film about the strikes was shown on BBC Two, called &quot;Miners&#x27; Strike: A Frontline Story&quot;. The documentary was directed by Ben Anthony and presented both archive footage and stories from individuals directly involved in the strike.

===Music===
The Clash staged two benefit concerts for the striking miners at Brixton Academy in London. The strike is the subject of songs by many music groups including the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; &quot;A Design for Life&quot;, and &quot;1985&quot;, from the album &quot;Lifeblood&quot;; Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Last Day of the Miners&#x27; Strike&quot;; Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, and Ewan MacColl&#x27;s cassette of pro-NUM songs &quot;Daddy, What Did You Do In The Strike?&quot;. Sting recorded a song about the strike called &quot;We Work the Black Seam&quot; for his first solo album, &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot;, in 1985.

Billy Bragg&#x27;s version of &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot;, encapsulated the strikers&#x27; feeling of betrayal by the perceived indifference of wider elements within British society. Bragg raised awareness through his music and disagreement with the Thatcher government.

Crowd sounds from the strike feature at the start of The Smiths&#x27; 1987 song &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot;. However, this version only appears on the album &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; and not the single edit which has made subsequent compilation albums.

Throughout the strike, the South London group Test Dept travelled on their &quot;battle bus&quot; to Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland, Paddington and Glasgow. They filmed images of the strike in one town and showed at their next gig, where they met the miners, joined pickets and raised funds. The songs of the South Wales Striking Miners&#x27; Choir and the speeches of Kent miner Alan Sutcliffe are included on their 1985 album &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot;.

Chris Cutler, Tim Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow, along with Robert Wyatt and poet Adrian Mitchell recorded &quot;The Last Nightingale&quot; in October 1984 to raise money for the strikers and their families.

&quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;, by U2 is about the breakdown of relationships during the strike.

The storyline of Radio K.A.O.S., a 1987 album by Roger Waters, makes several references to the strike and its repercussions.

The strike saw the resurgence of traditional folk songs about coal mining. Dick Gaughan released a mixture of old and new songs on his LP &quot;True and Bold&quot;. An old Northumbrian folk song, &quot;Blackleg Miner&quot; gained attention when recorded by Steeleye Span in 1970 and was played to show support for the NUM and intimidate strikebreakers.

The album &quot;Every Valley&quot; from Public Service Broadcasting is based on the history of the mining industry in Wales, more specifically chronicling the rise and decline of the country&#x27;s coal industry, the miners&#x27; strike plays a huge role on the album.

&quot;The Charge&quot;, from New Model Army (on &quot;Thunder and Consolation&quot;, 1989) compares the Miners&#x27; strike to &quot;The charge of the Light Brigade&quot;.

=== Video games ===
The first entry in the &quot;Monty Mole&quot; series of games, &quot;Wanted: Monty Mole&quot;, published for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 in 1984, was directly inspired by reports of miners&#x27; families&#x27; stealing coal during the strike: the game involves Monty Mole stealing coal to heat his home.

=== Literature ===
The historical fiction novel &quot;Minor Miner&quot; by Matthew Morgan is a conspiracy drama in which the Thatcher government intentionally escalates tensions with Libya in 1984 to draw attention away from the controversial UK Miners&#x27; Strikes in an attempt to improve the political party&#x27;s approval ratings ahead of an election.

<doc id="196176" wikidata="Q1163628" url="?curid=196176" title="Straw Dogs (1971 film)">
<text>Straw Dogs is a 1971 psychological thriller film directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George. The screenplay, by Peckinpah and David Zelag Goodman, is based on Gordon M. Williams&#x27;s 1969 novel, &quot;The Siege of Trencher&#x27;s Farm&quot;. The film&#x27;s title derives from a discussion in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; that likens people to the ancient Chinese ceremonial straw dog, being of ceremonial worth, but afterwards discarded with indifference.

The film is noted for its violent concluding sequences and two complicated rape scenes, which were censored by numerous film rating boards. Released theatrically the same year as &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot; and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, the film sparked heated controversy over a perceived increase of violence in films generally.

The film premiered in the U.K. in November 1971. Although controversial at the time, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; is considered by some critics to be one of Peckinpah&#x27;s greatest films, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music (Original Dramatic Score). A remake directed by Rod Lurie and starring James Marsden and Kate Bosworth was released on September 16, 2011.

==Plot==

After securing a research grant to study stellar structures, American applied mathematician David Sumner moves with his wife Amy to a house near her home village of Wakely on the Cornish moorland. Amy&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Charlie Venner, along with his friends Norman Scutt, Chris Cawsey and Phil Riddaway, immediately resent the fact that an apparently meek outsider has married one of their own. Scutt, a former convict, confides in Cawsey his jealousy of Venner&#x27;s past relationship with Amy. David meets Venner&#x27;s uncle, Tom Hedden, a violent drunkard whose teenage daughter Janice flirts with Henry Niles, a mentally deficient man despised by the entire town.

The Sumners have taken an isolated farmhouse, Trenchers Farm, that once belonged to Amy&#x27;s father. They hire Scutt and Cawsey to re-roof its garage, and when impatient with lack of progress add Venner and his cousin Bobby to the workforce. Tensions in their marriage soon become apparent. Amy criticises David&#x27;s condescension toward her and suggests that cowardice was his true reason for leaving a volatile, politicized university campus in America. David withdraws deeper into his studies, ignoring both the hostility of the locals and Amy&#x27;s dissatisfaction. His aloofness results in Amy&#x27;s attention-gathering pranks and provocative demeanor toward the workmen, particularly Venner. David also struggles to be accepted by the educated locals, as seen in conversations with the vicar Reverend Barney Hood and his wife and Major John Scott, who is the local magistrate.

When David finds their cat hanging dead in their bedroom, Amy believes that Cawsey or Scutt is responsible. She presses David to confront the workmen, but he is too intimidated. The men invite David to go hunting; they take him to the moor and leave him there with the promise of driving birds toward him. With David away from home, Venner goes to Trenchers Farm and pressures Amy sexually; after a time, she submits. While they are still together, Scutt enters silently, motions Venner at gunpoint to move away, and rapes Amy, with Venner reluctantly holding her down. David returns much later, smarting from the men abandoning him. Amy says nothing about the rape, apart from a cryptic comment that escapes his attention.

David fires the workmen for their slow progress. Later, the Sumners attend a church social evening where Amy becomes distraught on seeing her rapists. Janice invites Henry to leave with her, and in a building hidden away from the crowd, she begins to seduce him. When Janice&#x27;s brother notices she is missing, he is sent to search for her, and as he calls out for her, Henry panics and accidentally suffocates Janice. The Sumners leave the social early, driving through thick fog, and accidentally hit Henry as he is escaping the scene. They take the injured Henry to their home and phone the pub to report the accident. The locals, who, in the meantime, have learned that Janice was last seen with Henry, are thereby alerted to his whereabouts. Soon, Hedden, Scutt, Venner, Cawsey and Riddaway are drunkenly pounding on the Sumners&#x27; door. Deducing their intention to lynch Henry, David refuses to let them take him, despite Amy&#x27;s pleas. The standoff seems to unlock a territorial instinct in David: &quot;I will not allow violence against this house.&quot;

Scott arrives to defuse the situation, but is accidentally shot dead by Hedden during a struggle. Realising the danger to him in witnessing this killing, David improvises various traps and weapons to fend off the attackers. He inadvertently forces Hedden to shoot himself in the foot, knocks Riddaway unconscious, and then bludgeons Cawsey to death with a poker. Venner holds him at gunpoint, but Amy&#x27;s screams alert both men when Scutt assaults her again. Scutt suggests Venner join him in another rape, but Venner shoots him dead. David disarms Venner and, in the ensuing fight, snaps his neck with a mantrap. Reviewing the resulting carnage and surprised by his own violence, David mutters to himself, &quot;Jesus, I got &#x27;em all&quot;. A recovering Riddaway brutally attacks him, but is shot by Amy.

David gets into his car to drive Henry back to the village. Henry says he does not know his way home; David says he does not either.

==Cast==
==Production==
Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s two previous films, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;, had been made for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. His connection with the company ended after the chaotic filming of &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; wrapped 19 days over schedule and $3 million over budget (equivalent to $ million in ). Left with a limited number of directing jobs, Peckinpah was forced to travel to England to direct &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. Produced by Daniel Melnick, who previously worked with Peckinpah on his 1966 television film &quot;Noon Wine&quot;, the screenplay began from Gordon Williams&#x27; novel, &quot;The Siege of Trencher&#x27;s Farm&quot;, with Peckinpah saying, &quot;David Goodman and I sat down and tried to make something of validity out of this rotten book. We did. The only thing we kept was the siege itself.&quot;

===Casting===
Beau Bridges, Stacy Keach, Sidney Poitier, Jack Nicholson and Donald Sutherland were considered for the lead role of David Sumner before Dustin Hoffman was cast. Hoffman agreed to do the film because he was intrigued by the character, a pacifist unaware of his feelings and potential for violence that were the same feelings he abhorred in society. Judy Geeson, Jacqueline Bisset, Diana Rigg, Helen Mirren, Carol White, Charlotte Rampling and Hayley Mills were considered for the role of Amy before Susan George was finally selected. Hoffman disagreed with the casting, as he felt his character would never marry such a &quot;Lolita-ish&quot; kind of girl. Peckinpah insisted on George, a relatively unknown actress in the U.S. at that time.

===Filming===

Location shooting took place around St Buryan, near Penzance in Cornwall, including at St Buryan&#x27;s Church. Interiors were shot at Twickenham Studios in London. The exterior shots for the siege scenes were filmed during night shoots in Cornwall, while the interior shots for the same scenes were filmed in London. The film&#x27;s production design was by Ray Simm.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
The film earned rentals of $4.5 million in North America, and $3.5 million in other countries. By 1973, it had recorded an overall profit of $1,425,000.

By 1983 the film earned $11,148,828. 
===Critical response===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Peckinpah is able to dispense with extraneous fantasy – no supernaturalism, no dream sequence – and instead set a tone of meticulous realism which relies on the recurrence of vindictive incident, escalating from the comic to the sinister to the shocking, to create a mounting air of menace. But if Peckinpah has dispensed with explicit fantasy, he none the less employs several techniques to unsettle the spectator&#x27;s hold on &#x27;reason&#x27;; most notably, swift cross-cutting between simultaneous but geographically separate incidents to suggest some causal relationship between them and link them in the same plot momentum. ... Equally dramatic is Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s gradual mutation from his comic, bookish &quot;Graduate&quot; persona to the white-faced fanatic of the climax. His role is another variant on a formula – the little man with reserves of heroism in a crisis.  ... &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; promises to emerge as a classic of the horror film and an indispensable Peckinpah masterpiece. &quot;

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 stars out of 4, and described the film as &quot;a major disappointment in which Peckinpah&#x27;s theories about violence seem to have regressed to a sort of 19th-Century mixture of Kipling and machismo&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a special disappointment&quot; that is &quot;an intelligent movie, but interesting only in the context of his other works&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The script (from Gordon M. Williams&#x27; novel &quot;The Siege of Trencher&#x27;s Farm&quot;) relies on shock and violence to tide it over weakness in development, shallow characterization and lack of motivation.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;People who are sensitive to both the sight and the implications of violence will probably be disgusted and angered by &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; because there is no credible motivation for the violence. For the first time Peckinpah really seems to be specializing in violence rather than exploring its effects and meanings ... I would have walked out of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; at several points if I&#x27;d been anything but a professional critic.&quot;

Other reviews were positive. Paul D. Zimmerman of &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated, &quot;It is hard to imagine that Sam Peckinpah will ever make a better movie than &quot;Straw Dogs.&quot; It flawlessly expresses his primitive vision of violence — his belief that manhood requires rites of violence, that home and hearth are inviolate and must be defended by blood, that a man must conquer other men to prove his courage and hold on to his woman.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and wrote that, even though he disagreed with Peckinpah&#x27;s apparent worldview that &quot;Man is an animal, and his passion for destroying his own kind lies just beneath his skin,&quot; it was nevertheless &quot;a superbly made movie. Peckinpah creates a mood of impending violence with great skill.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an overpowering piece of storytelling, certain to remind every viewer of the wells of primal emotion lurking within himself, beneath the fragile veneer of civilized control. It is, I think, a better picture than &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, less ritualistic and less appallingly graphic in its violence, and in fact less cynical.&quot;

Among later assessments, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote in 1997 that the contemporary interpretation was that of a &quot;serious exploration of humanity&#x27;s ambivalent relationship with the dark side&quot;, but it now seems an &quot;exploitation bloodbath&quot;.

Nick Schager of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; rated it four stars out of four, and wrote, &quot;Sitting through Peckinpah&#x27;s controversial classic is not unlike watching a lit fuse make its slow, inexorable way toward its combustible destination — the taut build-up is as shocking and vicious as its fiery conclusion is inevitable.&quot;

Philip Martin of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; wrote, &quot;Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; is a movie that has remained important to me for 40 years. Along with Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; stands as a transgressively violent, deeply &#x27;70s film; one that still retains its power to shock after all these years.&quot;

Film director Quentin Tarantino considers &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; one of Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;masterpieces&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that of surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is . The consensus reads: &quot;A violent, provocative meditation on manhood, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; is viscerally impactful — and decidedly not for the squeamish.&quot;

===Accolades===
The original score by Jerry Fielding was nominated at the 44th Academy Awards in 1971 for Best Music (Original Dramatic Score), his second nomination for a Sam Peckinpah film, following &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; in 1969.

== Controversy ==
The film was controversial on its 1971 release, mostly because of the prolonged rape scene that is the film&#x27;s centerpiece. Critics accused Peckinpah of glamorizing and eroticising rape, and of engaging in misogynistic sadism and male chauvinism. They were especially disturbed by the scene&#x27;s intended ambiguity — after initially resisting, Amy appears to enjoy parts of the first rape, kissing and holding her attacker, although she later has traumatic flashbacks. Author Melanie Williams, in her 2005 book, &quot;Secrets and Laws: Collected Essays in Law, Lives and Literature&quot;, stated, &quot;The enactment purposely catered to entrenched appetites for desired victim behavior and reinforces rape myths.&quot; Another criticism is that all the main female characters depict straight women as perverse, in that every appearance of Janice and Amy is used to highlight excessive sexuality.

The violence provoked strong reactions, many critics seeing it an endorsement of violence as redemption, and the film as fascist celebration of violence and vigilantism. Others see it as anti-violence, describing the bleak ending consequent to the violence. Dustin Hoffman viewed David as deliberately, yet subconsciously, provoking the violence, his concluding homicidal rampage being the emergence of his true self. This view was not shared by director Sam Peckinpah.

The village of St Buryan was used as a location for the filming, with some of the locals appearing as extras. Local author Derek Tangye reports in one of his books that they were not aware of the nature of the film at the time of filming, and on its release, were most upset to discover that they had been used in a film of a nature so inconsistent with their own moral values.

== Censorship ==
The studio edited the first rape scene before releasing the film in the United States, to earn an R rating from the MPAA.

In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification banned it, in accordance with the newly introduced Video Recordings Act. The film had been released theatrically in the United Kingdom, with the uncut version gaining an X rating in 1971, and the slightly cut U.S. R-rated print being rated &#x27;18&#x27; in 1995. In March 1999, a partially edited print of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; that removed most of the second rape was refused a video certificate when the distributor lost the rights to the film after agreeing to make the requested BBFC cuts, and the full uncut version was also rejected for video three months later, on the grounds that the BBFC could not pass the uncut version so soon after rejecting a cut one.

On July 1, 2002, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; was released unedited on VHS and DVD. This version was uncut, and therefore included the second rape scene, which showed, in the BBFC&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Amy is clearly demonstrated not to enjoy the act of violation&quot;. The BBFC wrote: 

== Influence ==
*&quot;Home Alone&quot; production designer John Muto identified that film as a &quot;kids version of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;&quot;.
*Director Jacques Audiard cited &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; as the basis for his 2015 film &quot;Dheepan&quot;.

==Remake==

In 2011, there was a remake of the film, which relocated the story to Mississippi, and changed the lead male&#x27;s profession from mathematician to screenwriter. It was directed by Rod Lurie and starred James Marsden and Kate Bosworth.

&quot;Varathan&quot; (Newcomer) is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language action thriller film written by Suhas-Sharfu and directed by Amal Neerad. Set in Kerala, it is an adaptation of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, and stars Fahadh Faasil and Aishwarya Lekshmi in the lead roles.

<doc id="196180" wikidata="Q117647" url="?curid=196180" title="Edward the Exile">
<text>Edward the Exile (c. 1016 – 19 April 1057), also called Edward Ætheling, was the son of King Edmund Ironside and of Ealdgyth. He spent most of his life in exile in the Kingdom of Hungary following the defeat of his father by Cnut.

==Exile==
After the Danish conquest of England in 1016, Canute had Edward, said to be only a few months old, and his brother Edmund, sent to the Swedish court of Olof Skötkonung (who was either Canute&#x27;s half-brother or his stepbrother), supposedly with instructions to have the children murdered. However, Olof was an old ally of Æthelred the Unready, the princes&#x27; grandfather, and he declined to kill them. From this point their fate is subject to speculation. Some reconstructions have them being sent by Olaf to the Hungarian royal court of King Stephen I, while others have the Kievan court of Yaroslav the Wise as their next destination, being sent not by Olaf but by one of his sons after Canute conquered Norway and a part of Sweden in 1028. Whether going there directly or indirectly they are thought to have been joined in the Kievan principality in the 1030s by another exiled prince, Andrew of Hungary. Prince Andrew returned to Hungary in 1046 to retake the throne; Edward and Edmund are likely to have accompanied him and fought with his army and it is possible that they were present at his coronation. A Hungarian estate with Réka Castle in the middle is called , and local tradition attributes this name to a grant made by King Stephen of Hungary to the English Edward, which if true would place him in Hungary before Stephen&#x27;s death in 1038.

==Return==
On hearing that Edward was alive, Edward the Confessor recalled him to England in 1056 and made him his heir. Edward the Ætheling offered the last chance of an undisputed succession within the Saxon royal house. News of Edward&#x27;s existence came at a time when the old Anglo-Saxon monarchy, restored after a long period of Danish domination, was heading for catastrophe. The Confessor, personally devout but politically weak and childless, was unable to make an effective stand against the steady advance of the powerful and ambitious sons of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. From across the Channel William, Duke of Normandy also had an eye on the succession. Edward the Exile appeared at just the right time. Approved both by the king and by the Witan, the Council of the Realm, he offered a way out of the impasse, a counter both to the Godwinsons and to William, and one with a legitimacy that could not be readily challenged.

In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester, to the court of the German emperor to set in train negotiations with the king of Hungary for the return of Edward the Exile. Ealdred was not at first successful, and in 1056 Earl Harold Godwinson&#x27;s journey to Flanders, and possibly on to Germany and Hungary, was probably undertaken to further negotiations. The Exile finally arrived in England in 1057 with his wife and children, but died within a few days, on 19 April, without meeting the King. He was buried in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Family==
Edward&#x27;s wife was named Agatha; her origins are disputed. Their children were:

*Edgar Ætheling (c. 1126) - Elected King of England after the Battle of Hastings but submitted to William the Conqueror.
*Saint Margaret of Scotland (c. 104516 November 1093) - Married King Malcolm III of Scotland.
*Cristina (c. 1040c. 1093) - Abbess at Romsey Abbey.

Edward&#x27;s granddaughter Edith of Scotland, also called Matilda, married King Henry I of England, continuing the Anglo-Saxon line into the post-Conquest English monarchy.

==Ancestry==
Edward the Exile was a direct descendant of a line of Wessex kings dating back, at least on the pages of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, to the arrival of Cerdic of Wessex in AD 495, nearly a century after the withdrawal of the Western Roman Empire army legions from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and including Alfred the Great in the English monarchs family tree.

<text>Joseph Marie Quérard (25 December 1797 – 3 December 1865) was a French bibliographer.

He was born at Rennes, where he was apprenticed to a bookseller. Sent abroad on business, he remained in Vienna from 1819 to 1824, where he drew up the first volumes of his great work, &quot;La France littéraire, ou Dictionnaire bibliographique des savants, historiens, et gens de lettres de la France, &amp;c.&quot; (14 vols., 1826–1842). This bibliography dealt with the 18th and early 19th centuries, and he was enabled to complete it by a government subsidy granted by Guizot in 1830, and using the assistance of the Russian bibliophile Serge Poltoratzky.

His final volume of contemporary French literature, with which he hoped to complete his work, was cancelled by his publisher, the firm of Didot, without a kill fee. Didot then gave his &quot;Littérature française contemporaine&quot; to the bibliographers Ch. Louandre and F. Bourquelot. Financially ruined and without an income, Quérard avenged himself by pointing out the errors of his successors. In spite of his claims and the value of the work he had done, Quérard was unable to secure a position in any of the public libraries. He died in Paris.

Among his other works are: &quot;Les supercheries littéraires dévoilées&quot; (5 vols., 1845–56); &quot;Bibliographie La Menaisienne&quot; (1849); &quot;Dictionnaire des ouvrages-polyonymes et anonymes de la littérature française, 1700–1850&quot; (1846–47); an additional volume to &quot;La France littéraire&quot; entitled &quot;Écrivains pseudonymes,&quot; etc. (1854–56).

<text>Pierre Victor, baron Malouet (11 February 1740 – 7 September 1814) was a French politician, colonial administrator and writer. As an émigré, he signed the Whitehall Accord with Great Britain in 1794.

==Life==
Malouet was born in Riom as the son of a bailli in Puy-de-Dôme. He was educated at the College of Juilly (1754–1756) before studying law. Then he opted for a career in the diplomatic service and in 1758 he was sent to the French Embassy in Lisbon and met with the Marquis de Pombal. When he returned to France he was given an administrative role in the French Royal Army under Victor François de Broglie, 2nd Duke of Broglie. In 1763 he was appointed intendant at Rochefort and became commissary in Saint-Domingue in 1767. There he married and acquired a significant number of sugar plantations. He returned to France in 1774, and took up the role of commissary-general of the navy. In 1776 he was entrusted to carry out plans of improving the colonization of French Guiana. The next year Malouet and his wife made a 7-week trip to Paramaribo, to discuss the 200 Maroon that had fled from Surinam to Guiana. Malouet criticized the way the Dutch treated their slaves after he had visited 26 plantations. To improve relations between the owners and the slaves, Malouet &quot;promoted&quot; religion. He was almost taken prisoner during the American Revolutionary War by a British privateer on his return to Cayenne.

Back in France he was well received at court, and the execution of his plans in Guiana was assured. Malouet was appointed intendant of the port of Toulon. In 1788 he published his &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;esclavage des négres&quot; opposing Abbé Raynal, who advocated the abolition of slavery. Malouet took a seat as representative of the Third Estate for his home town in the Estates General of 1789, where he soon became well known as a defender of the monarchy. In September 1792, after the besiege of the Tuileries palace, he emigrated to England and met with Edmund Burke. On behalf of Saint-Domingue he signed the Whitehall Accord, which placed the colony (along with Guadeloupe and Martinique) under the authority of the British Empire, whilst ensuring the profitability of the sugar plantations by overturning the recent Law of 4 February 1794. Around December 1792 he sought in vain permission to return to assist in the defence of Louis XVI. 

After the Coup of 18 Brumaire he returned to France. In 1801 his name was erased from the list of &quot;émigrés&quot; by Napoleon; in 1803, after the Saint-Domingue expedition he was sent to Antwerp as commissioner-general and maritime prefect to supervise the erection of defence works, and the creation of a fleet. Malouet left the city in 1807. He was peered and entered the council of state for the navy in 1810. Having offended the emperor by his criticism of the campaign in Russia, he was disgraced and left office in 1812. At the Restoration, Louis XVIII made him Minister of the Navy, but Malouet died the same year. His memoires were published in 1868.

Malouet was the author of a lengthy prose poem with a nautical theme, &quot;Les quatre parties du jour à la mer&quot;, published in 1783.

<text>Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship ( ), also known as Holy Cross Voivodeship, is a voivodeship (province) in southeastern Poland, in the historical region of Lesser Poland. The province&#x27;s capital and largest city is Kielce.

Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship is bounded by six other voivodeships: Masovian to the north, Lublin to the east, Subcarpathian to the south-central, Lesser Poland to the south, Silesian to the southwest, and Łódź to the northwest.

The province covers an area of , making it the second smallest province (after Opole). As at 2019, the total population of Świętokrzyskie Province was 1,237,369.

==History==

Inhabited since pre-historic times, the area of Skarżysko-Kamienna and Wąchock contains several hundred former Paleolithic sites from 13,000-10,000 years ago, now known as the Rydno Archaeological Reserve. From 3900 BC to 1600 BC, striped flint was mined at Krzemionki, one of the largest known complexes of prehistoric flint mines in Europe, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Historic Monument of Poland.

The territory formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century. Sandomierz was mentioned as one of three centers of the Kingdom of Poland, along Kraków and Wrocław, in the early-12th-century &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; chronicle. Sandomierz and Wiślica, whose historic landmarks are designated Historic Monuments of Poland, are former medieval ducal seats of the Piast dynasty. In the early modern period the Old-Polish Industrial Region developed in the region. Following the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland, the region witnessed several uprisings against foreign rule, i.e. the November Uprising of 1830–1831 and January Uprising of 1863–1864. In the interbellum, the region was part of reborn independent Poland. Its industry was developed as part of the Central Industrial Region of Poland.

During World War II, it was occupied by Germany, with the occupiers committing their genocidal policies against Poles and Jews in the region, massacring civilians, including at Skarżysko-Kamienna and Michniów, and operating numerous prisons and forced labour camps. The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, with the short-lived Republic of Pińczów liberated in 1944.

Holy Cross Province was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Kielce Voivodeship, eastern Częstochowa Voivodeship, and western Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

==Cities and towns==

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 11.6 billion € in 2018, accounting for 2.3% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 15,400 € or 51% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 58% of the EU average. Świętokrzyskie Voivodship is the province with the fifth lowest GDP per capita in Poland.

<text>Rolle () is a municipality in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It was the seat of the district of Rolle until 2006, when it became part of the district of Nyon. It is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Geneva (&quot;Lac Léman&quot;) between Nyon and Lausanne. Rolle is approximately northeast of Geneva (Genève) in the La Côte wine-growing region, and has views of the high Alps.

Rolle is also the birthplace of Frédéric-César de la Harpe (1754–1838), who was the tutor of Alexander I of Russia and was largely responsible for the independence of the Canton of Vaud from the Bernese.

==History==

Rolle is first mentioned in 1294 as &quot;Rotuli&quot;. In 1295 it was known as Ruello and as Ruelloz, the city, in 1330 after it passed into the hands of Jean De Grailly the 1st, a Knight entrusted to care for the future King Edward the 2nd.

===Prehistoric settlements===
A late Bronze Age lake side settlement was discovered and partially destroyed in 1835 during construction of the artificial island of &quot;Île de la Harpe&quot;. A second settlement from the same period was found in Fleur d&#x27;Eau. In 1984, in La Combe, a first to third century AD Gallo-Roman estate was discovered. The remains of the moat and the ramparts of Rolle Castle were uncovered in 1985. Fragments of a medieval city wall were found in the Champ de verse which may have come from the village of Saint-Nicolas de Ver.

===Medieval Rolle===
In 1261, the Lords of Mont planned to build a city along the lake that would compete with the Aubonne and Saint-Prex. By around 1264, Rolle Castle was built to protect the pier at the lake. However, the planned city was never built by the Mont family. In 1291, the castle was in possession of Count Amadeus V of Savoy, who granted it to several different families as a fief. In 1295 it passed to the Knight Jean De Grailly the 1st who named it Ruello changed centuries later to Rolle. In the course of the rivalry between the Counts of Savoy and the Lords of Vaud, in 1319 Amadeus V of Savoy finally built a city around the castle. This new city closed a gap in the savoy settlements on the northern shores of Lake Geneva. The layout of the town, a large main street running parallel to the lake shore with a cross street that connects the port with the hinterland, follow the construction patterns of typical Zähringer towns.

The residents of Saint-Nicolas de Ver, possibly an unsuccessful town founded by the Lords de Mont, settled in Rolle. The new city, which was built with a palisade, was granted a city charter along the lines of the charter of Moudon. As compensation, Jean de Mont became a deputy ruler and received a dairy farm and half of the furnaces and mills. Starting in 1366, the citizens became exempt from tolls in Aubonne. The Duke of Savoy granted the right to hold a weekly market in 1425. In 1484, he elevated it from a feudal property to a free city.

The fief of Le Rosey in the district of Rolle belonged to the lord of Vufflens in the middle of the 14th Century. It later passed into the possession of the lord of Avenches and the Praroman family.

During the Bernese invasion of 1536, both Le Rosey Castle and Rolle Castle were attacked and burned.

===Under Bernese rule===
Under Bernese rule (1536–1798) Rolle was part of the bailiwick of Morges. In 1558, the Bernese merchant Hans Steiger, who was already the lord of Mont-le-Grand, acquired the barony of Rolle. His family retained the property until the French Revolution. The barony included the town of Rolle (except the fief of Les Uttins which belonged until the 18th century to the La Harpe family), Tartegnin, Vinzel, Luins, half of Essertines-sur-Rolle, some homes in Begnins, the region of Vincy, and Saint-Vincent (now in Gilly), Bursinel and in 1615 they acquired Le Rosey Castle, Dully and Le Vaud. The judicial court was composed of the lord, his deputy, a court clerk, and ten members from Rolle and villages in the district. One of ten members governed the city. In 1740, the town bought itself out from under some taxes and duties.

===The end of Bernese rule and modern Rolle===
Rolle was the birthplace of Frédéric-César de La Harpe and Amédée de La Harpe, two important figures in the French Revolution and the end of the Ancien Régime of Switzerland. Toward the end of the 18th Century, it was a center of revolutionary fervor. Amédée de La Harpe presided, in Rolle on 15 July 1791, over a revolutionary banquet. Following the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798, Rolle became the seat of a district of the same name. In 1799 the Helvetic Republic bought the castle from the municipality and used it until 1974 as the seat of government. In 1802, during the Bourla-papey uprising, patrician land titles and tax records were burned in the archives at Rolle Castle.
