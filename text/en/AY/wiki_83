<text>A sequel is a work of literature, film, theatre, television, music, or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work, usually chronologically following the events of that work.

In many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with the same characters and settings. A sequel can lead to a series, in which key elements appear repeatedly. The difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary.

Sequels are attractive to creators and publishers because there is less risk involved in returning to a story with known popularity rather than developing new and untested characters and settings. Audiences are sometimes eager for more stories about popular characters or settings, making the production of sequels financially appealing.

In film, sequels are very common. There are many name formats for sequels. Sometimes, they either have unrelated titles or have a letter added to the end. More commonly, they have numbers at the end or have added words at the end. It is also common for a sequel to have a variation of the original title or a subtitle. In the 1930s, many musical sequels had the year included in the title. Sometimes sequels are released with different titles in different countries, because of the perceived brand recognition. There are several ways that subsequent works can be related to the chronology of the original. Various neologisms have been coined to describe them.

==Classifications==
The most common approach is for the events of the second work to directly follow the events of the first one, either continuing the remaining plot threads or introducing a new conflict to drive the events of the second story. They can either pick up right where the first work left off, or continue sometime after the events of the first work ended. This is often called a . Examples include &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980).

A prequel is an installment that is made following the original product which portrays events occurring chronologically before those of the original work. Although its name is based on the word &quot;sequel&quot;, not all prequels are true prequels that are part of a main series. Prequels that are not part of a main series are called &quot;spin-off prequels&quot;, while prequels that are part of a main series are called &quot;true prequels&quot;. Examples of prequels include the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy (1999-2005), &quot;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&quot; (2004) which took place chronologically before the events of the previous &quot;Tremors&quot; films, &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2015–2022) taking place mainly before &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; but also having some scenes after and during it, &quot;The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Beginning&quot; (2008) occurring chronologically before the events of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; TV series (1992-1994), the animated &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; film (1989), and &quot;The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea&quot; (2000), and &quot;&quot; (2024), which took place before &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), and &quot;&quot; (2024), which took place before &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019).

A &#x27; is a term used to refer to works which take place between events. Types include interquels and intraquels. An &#x27; is a story that takes place in between two previously published or released stories. For example, if &#x27;movie C&#x27; is an interquel of &#x27;movies A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27;, the events of &#x27;movie C&#x27; take place after the events of &#x27;movie A&#x27;, but before the events of &#x27;movie B&#x27;. Examples can include &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2018) of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, some films of the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise, and &quot;Saw X&quot;. An , on the other hand, is a work which focuses on events within a previous work. Examples include &quot;Bambi 2&quot; (2005) and &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021).

A threequel is the third work of a series. They act as a continuation and sometimes a conclusion of plot threads from the first two works. Examples include &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), and &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982). 

A &#x27; is a work that follows the continuity of the original works, but takes place much further along the timeline, often focusing on new characters with the original ones still present in the plot. They are often made many years after the original works were made. Legacy sequels are sometimes also direct sequels that ignore previous installments entirely, effectively retconning preceding events. &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018), &quot;Candyman&quot; (2021), &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (2018-2025), &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy (2015-2019), &quot;&quot; (2021), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;&quot; (2010), &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (2022), &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; (2019), &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006), the &quot;Creed&quot; films (2015–present), &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018), &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Gladiator II&quot; (2024), and the &quot;Jurassic World&quot; trilogy (2015–2022) are examples of legacy sequels. Another term for these types of movies is &#x27;, meaning reboot sequel, a term originally coined by Bruce Campbell to describe &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; (1987) in relation to &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981). Film journalist Pamela McClintock describes a requel as something that &quot;exploits goodwill toward the past while launching a new generation of actors and stories&quot;.

A is a work set in the same universe, yet has little or no narrative connection to its predecessor, and can stand on its own without a thorough understanding of the series. &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964), &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988), &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; (1982), &quot;Home Alone 3&quot; (1997), &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006), &quot;Species - The Awakening&quot; (2007), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; (2011), &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot; (2011), &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; (2015), &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; (2020), &quot;Spirit Untamed&quot; (2021), &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021), &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot; (2022), &quot;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2024), &quot;Twisters&quot; (2024), and &quot;Jurassic World Rebirth&quot; (2025) are examples of standalone sequels.

A plot reset, or is a work set in the same universe of its predecessor that resets the plot in a different premise or setting of the work&#x27;s predecessor with more than one of the same predecessor characters to appease the audience due to extremely negative reception of the predecessor. An example: &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (2021) to &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016).

A spiritual sequel, also known as a spiritual successor is a work inspired by its predecessor. It shares the same styles, genres and elements as its predecessor, but has no direct connection to it at all. Most spiritual sequels are also set in different universes from their predecessors, and some spiritual sequels aren&#x27;t even a part of their predecessor&#x27;s franchise, making them &quot;non-franchise sequels&quot;. Spiritual sequels can sometimes be repurposed from material originally intended to be direct sequels. An example of this is &quot;Mute&quot; (2018), a spiritual sequel to the film &quot;Moon&quot; (2009).

A parallel, , or sidequel is a story that runs at the same point in time as the original story. For instance, three different novels by John Morressy — &quot;Starbrat&quot; (1972), &quot;Stardrift&quot; (1973; also known as &quot;Nail Down the Stars&quot;), and &quot;Under a Calculating Star&quot; (1975) — involve different lead characters, mostly in different places, but overlap at one dramatic event to which each novel provides a different perspective. Strict legacy parallels are Kirill Eskov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Ringbearer&quot; (1999) retelling the events of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1955) from the viewpoint of benevolent Mordorians combatting the malevolent West. Likewise, Alice Randall&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; (2001), contemporary to Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1936), tells the life story of a mulatto woman born enslaved on the O&#x27;Hara plantation and &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; (2004), featuring the origins of characters Timon and Pumbaa occurring simultaneously within the original 1994 film. 

==Relatives==
Alongside sequels, there are also other types of continuation or inspiration of a previous work.

A spin-off is a work that is not a sequel to any previous works, but is set in the same universe. It is a separate work-on-its-own in the same franchise as the series of other works. Spin-offs are often focused on one or more of the minor characters from the other work or new characters in the same universe as the other work. &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, &quot;Planes&quot;, &quot;Minions&quot;, &quot;Hobbs &amp; Shaw&quot; and &quot;Lightyear&quot; are examples of spin-off movies while &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;&quot; are examples of spin-off television series.

A crossover is a work where characters or events from two previous works from different franchises are meeting in the same universe. &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004), &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; (2014) are examples of a crossover film. Crossovers can also function as sequels if plotlines from the two previous works continue into them, like with &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024), and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; (2003).&quot;

A reboot is a start over from a previous work. It could either be a film set in a new universe resembling the old one or it could be a regular spin-off film that starts a new film series. Reboots are usually a part of the same media franchise as the previous works, but not always. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Børning&quot; (2014), &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), and &quot;&quot; (2015) are examples of reboot films. Kathleen Loock has written that traditional reboots tended to stray away from depicting direct narrative or stylistic correlations to the previous versions of the franchise. Contemporary reboots lean into the nostalgia factor and create new stories that simultaneously revel in the aspects of the original franchise that made it notable in the first place.

==History==
In &quot;The Afterlife of a Character&quot;, David Brewer describes a reader&#x27;s desire to &quot;see more&quot;, or to know what happens next in the narrative after it has ended.

Film director Francis Ford Coppola claims to have started the trend of including numbers in film sequel titles with &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;.

===Sequels of the novel===
The origin of the sequel as it is conceived in the 21st century developed from the novella and romance traditions in a slow process that culminated towards the end of the 17th century. 

The substantial shift toward a rapidly growing print culture and the rise of the market system by the early 18th-century meant that an author&#x27;s merit and livelihood became increasingly linked to the number of copies of a work he or she could sell. This shift from a text-based to an author-centered reading culture led to the &quot;professionalization&quot; of the author – that is, the development of a &quot;sense of identity based on a marketable skill and on supplying to a defined public a specialized service it was demanding.&quot; In one sense, then, sequels became a means to profit further from previous work that had already obtained some measure of commercial success. As the establishment of a readership became increasingly important to the economic viability of authorship, sequels offered a means to establish a recurring economic outlet.

In addition to serving economic profit, the sequel was also used as a method to strengthen an author&#x27;s claim to his literary property. With weak copyright laws and unscrupulous booksellers willing to sell whatever they could, in some cases the only way to prove ownership of a text was to produce another like it. Sequels in this sense are rather limited in scope, as the authors are focused on producing &quot;more of the same&quot; to defend their &quot;literary paternity&quot;. As is true throughout history, sequels to novels provided an opportunity for authors to interact with a readership. This became especially important in the economy of the 18th century novel, in which authors often maintained readership by drawing readers back with the promise of more of what they liked from the original. With sequels, therefore, came the implicit division of readers by authors into the categories of &quot;desirable&quot; and &quot;undesirable&quot;—that is, those who interpret the text in a way unsanctioned by the author. Only after having achieved a significant reader base would an author feel free to alienate or ignore the &quot;undesirable&quot; readers.

This concept of &quot;undesirable&quot; readers extends to unofficial sequels with the 18th century novel. While in certain historical contexts unofficial sequels were actually the norm (for an example, see Arthurian literature), with the emphasis on the author function that arises in conjunction with the novel many authors began to see these kinds of unauthorized extensions as being in direct conflict with authorial authority. In the matter of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (an early novel, perhaps better classified as a satirical romance), for example, Cervantes disapproved of Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda&#x27;s use of his characters in &quot;Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha&quot;, an unauthorized sequel. In response, Cervantes very firmly kills the protagonist at the end of the Second Part to discourage any more such creative liberties. Another example is Samuel Richardson, an 18th-century author who responded particularly strongly against the appropriation of his material by unauthorized third parties. Richardson was extremely vocal in his disapproval of the way the protagonist of his novel &quot;Pamela&quot; was repeatedly incorporated into unauthorized sequels featuring particularly lewd plots. The most famous of these is Henry Fielding&#x27;s parody, entitled &quot;Shamela&quot;.

In &quot;To Renew Their Former Acquaintance: Print, Gender, and Some Eighteenth Century Sequels&quot;, Betty Schellenberg theorizes that whereas for male writers in the 18th century sequels often served as &quot;models of paternity and property&quot;, for women writers these models were more likely to be seen as transgressive. Instead, the recurring readership created by sequels let female writers function within the model of &quot;familiar acquaintances reunited to enjoy the mutual pleasures of conversation&quot;, and made their writing an &quot;activity within a private, non-economic sphere&quot;. Through this created perception women writers were able to break into the economic sphere and &quot;enhance their professional status&quot; through authorship.

Dissociated from the motives of profit and therefore unrestrained by the need for continuity felt by male writers, Schellenberg argues that female-authored sequel fiction tended to have a much broader scope. He says that women writers showed an &quot;innovative freedom&quot; that male writers rejected to &quot;protect their patrimony&quot;. For example, Sarah Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of David Simple&quot; and its sequels &quot;Familiar Letters between the Principal Characters in David Simple&quot; and &quot;David Simple, Volume the Last&quot; are extremely innovative and cover almost the entire range of popular narrative styles of the 18th century.

===Video games===
The cost of developing AAA video games has increased significantly over recent years, often reaching tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars due to high expectations for detailed graphics, expansive worlds, and advanced gameplay. Video game companies have turned to sequels as a dependable business strategy. Sequels are now a dominant trend in the industry, making up a large proportion of new releases from major publishers. 

One reason they are prevalent is their ability to provide a stable revenue stream in a volatile market. Building on an existing brand with an established fan base, sequels are perceived as safer investments than new intellectual properties (IP). They allow companies to capitalize on previous successes, ensuring a built-in audience and reducing the financial risk associated with launching a new and unproven concept. Additionally, sequels of a formula that players already enjoy, balancing familiarity with new features or improvements, which can increase player retention and positive reception.

==Media franchises==

In some cases, the characters or the settings of an original film or video game become so valuable that they develop into a series, lately referred to as a media franchise. Generally, a whole series of sequels is made, along with merchandising. Multiple sequels are often planned well in advance, and actors and directors may sign extended contracts to ensure their participation. This can extend into a series/franchise&#x27;s initial production&#x27;s plot to provide story material to develop for sequels called sequel hooks. Examples of major media franchises include the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Pokemon, Harry Potter, and Disney Princess.

===Box office===
Movie sequels do not always do as well at the box office as the original, but they tend to do better than non-sequels, according to a study in the July 2008 issue of the &quot;Journal of Business Research&quot;. The shorter the period between releases, the better the sequel does at the box office. Sequels also show a faster drop in weekly revenues relative to non-sequels. A quantitative mega-analysis of box office earnings from all the major movie studios revealed that franchise movies dominate the highest grossing films lists, establishing sequels as reliable kinds of movies to make. All studios have come to rely on releasing sequels as they increase the studios&#x27; profitability, yield to the consumer demand for simultaneous novelty and familiarity, and help manage risk and uncertainty within studio production and release.

===Sequels in other media===
Sequels are most often produced in the same medium as the previous work (e.g. a film sequel is usually a sequel to another film). Producing sequels to a work in another medium has also become common, especially when the new medium is less costly or time-consuming to produce.

A sequel to a popular but discontinued television series may be produced in another medium, thereby bypassing whatever factors led to the series&#x27; cancellation such as Serenity (sequel to Firefly (TV series)), Downton Abbey: A New Era (sequel to Downton Abbey), and Veronica Mars (sequel to Veronica Mars). 

Some highly popular movies and television series have inspired the production of multiple novel sequels, sometimes rivaling or even dwarfing the volume of works in the original medium.

For example, the 1956 novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, its 1961 animated adaptation and that film&#x27;s 1996 live-action remake each have a sequel unrelated to the other sequels: respectively &quot;The Starlight Barking&quot; (1967), &quot;101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot; (2003, direct to video) and &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (2000).

==Unofficial sequels==
Sometimes sequels are produced without the consent of the creator of the original work. These may be dubbed unofficial, informal, unauthorized, or illegitimate sequels. In some cases, the work is in the public domain, and there is no legal obstacle to producing sequels. An example would be books and films serving as sequels to the book &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,&quot; which is in the public domain (as opposed to its 1939 film adaptation). In other cases, the original creator or their heirs may assert copyrights, and challenge the creators of the sequels.

===Literary===

*&quot;Old Friends and New Fancies: An Imaginary Sequel to the Novels of Jane Austen&quot; (1913) is a novel by Sybil G. Brinton that is generally acknowledged to be the first sequel to the works of Jane Austen and as such the first piece of Austen fan fiction.
*&quot;Porto Bello Gold&quot; (1924), a prequel by A. D. Howden Smith to &quot;Treasure Island&quot; that was written with explicit permission from Stevenson&#x27;s executor, tells the origin of the buried treasure and recasts many of Stevenson&#x27;s pirates in their younger years, giving the hidden treasure some Jacobite antecedents not mentioned in the original.
*&quot;Back to Treasure Island&quot; (1935) is a sequel by H. A. Calahan, the introduction of which argues that Robert Louis Stevenson wanted to write a continuation of the story.

<doc id="196513" wikidata="Q904528" url="?curid=196513" title="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">
<text>The Grammy Award for Album of the Year is an award presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales, chart position, or critical reception.&quot; Commonly known as &quot;The Big Award&quot;, Album of the Year is the most prestigious award category at the Grammy Awards, and is one of the general field categories alongside Best New Artist, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year that have been presented annually since the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959.

==Credit rules==
Over the years, the rules on who was presented with an award have changed:

*1959–1965: Artist only.
*1966–1998: Artist and producer.
*1999–2002: Artist, producer, and recording engineer or mixer.
*2003–2017: Artist, featured artist, producer, mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer.
*2018–2020: Artist, featured artist, producer, songwriter (of new material), mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer (only those who were credited on at least 33% playing time of the album)
*2021–2023: Artist, featured artist, producer, songwriter (of new material), mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer (regardless of credited playing time)
*2024–future: Artist, featured artist, producer, songwriter (of new material), mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer (only those who were credited on at least 20% playing time of the album)

The category expanded to include eight nominees in 2019 and ten in 2022. Beginning with the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced back to eight.

Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, featured artist, producer, songwriter, mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer with significant contributions to that album. The similarly titled Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the artist, producer, mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer for that song.

==Achievements==





Serban Ghenea (as engineer/mixer) is the most frequent winner in this category with five awards. Taylor Swift (as performer); John Hanes (as engineer/mixer); and Tom Coyne and Randy Merrill (as mastering engineers) have won the award four times. They are followed by Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, and Paul Simon (as performers); Jack Antonoff, David Foster, Daniel Lanois, Phil Ramone, and Ryan Tedder (as album producers); Tom Elmhirst and Mike Piersante and Laura Sisk (as engineers/mixers); and Bob Ludwig (as mastering engineer) with three victories each. Coyne, Ghenea, Hanes, and Ludwig are the only people to win the award in three consecutive years. Paul McCartney leads all performers with nine nominations: five as a member of The Beatles, three for solo albums, and one as a member of Wings. McCartney&#x27;s former bandmate George Harrison has a total of eight nominations: five as a member of The Beatles, one for a solo album, one for a live album with friends, and one as a member of the Traveling Wilburys. Sinatra leads solo performers with eight nominations: seven for solo albums and one for a duet album. Taylor Swift has the most nominations amongst female artists with seven, followed by Barbra Streisand with six.

The first woman to win the award was Judy Garland in 1962, for &quot;Judy at Carnegie Hall&quot;. Taylor Swift is the first solo female artist to win the award two, three, and four times. Adele has won twice as main credited artist, and Lauryn Hill, Norah Jones, and Alison Krauss also won two times each, first as lead artists for their respective albums, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, and &quot;Raising Sand&quot; (Krauss&#x27; collaboration album with Robert Plant); Hill won her second Album of the Year as a producer of her collaboration on Santana&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot; (featured artists on non-soundtrack albums did not share in the award before 2008), while Jones won again as a featured artist on Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and Krauss won again having been a featured artist on the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou? – Soundtrack&quot;.

Billie Eilish is the youngest main credit artist to win in the category, winning for her debut album &quot;When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?&quot; in 2020 at age 18. The Peasall Sisters, Sarah, Hannah, and Leah, are the category&#x27;s youngest credited winners, winning for their contributions to the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou? – Soundtrack&quot; at ages 13, 9, and 7 respectively. Leah Peasall is the youngest winner of any Grammy in any category. The youngest person to make an appearance on an Album of the Year is Stevie Wonder&#x27;s daughter Aisha Morris, who appeared as an infant for &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Lovely?&quot; on the album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;.

Christopher Cross and Billie Eilish are the only artists to receive Grammys for Album of the Year as well as Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, each winning all four &quot;general field&quot; categories in a single ceremony year. Adele was the first artist to win awards for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist on separate occasions. Five artists have won both Album of the Year and Best New Artist in the same year: Bob Newhart (&quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; in 1961), Lauryn Hill (&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in 1999), and Norah Jones (&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; in 2003) along with Christopher Cross (&quot;Christopher Cross&quot; in 1981) and Billie Eilish (&quot;When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?&quot; in 2020) mentioned above.

Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Come Dance with Me!&quot; was the first album by a traditional pop artist to win, Stan Getz&#x27;s &amp; João Gilberto&#x27;s &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; was the first by jazz artists, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was the first by rock and roll artists, Glen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; was the first by a country artist, Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was the first by a hip hop artist, Santana&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot; was the first by a Hispanic artist, Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;The Suburbs&quot; was the first by indie rock artists, and Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; was the first by electronic music artists.

Only Frank Sinatra and Stevie Wonder have won in two consecutive years as main artists: Sinatra won in 1966 (&quot;September of My Years&quot;) and 1967 (&quot;A Man and His Music&quot;) and Wonder won in 1974 (&quot;Innervisions&quot;) and 1975 (&quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot;). Lauryn Hill and Bruno Mars have also won in consecutive years, with one win credited as producer rather than artist. Hill won as a producer in 2000 after winning in 1999 as artist and producer. Bruno Mars won as a producer in 2017 before winning as both artist and producer in 2018.

The Beatles were the first and only artists to date to receive Album of the Year nominations in five consecutive years (1966–1970). Frank Sinatra was the first to receive four nominations in consecutive years, 1959 - 1961 (two nominations at the first ceremony in 1959), receiving 3 more consecutive nominations for 1966–1968. Barbra Streisand (1964–1967) and Kendrick Lamar (2016–2019) also received nominations in four consecutive years while Lady Gaga (2010–2012) was nominated in three consecutive years.

Beyoncé, Billy Joel, Kendrick Lamar, and Taylor Swift are the only performers with Album of the Year nominations for four consecutive studio albums, while The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Steely Dan, Bonnie Raitt, Dixie Chicks, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Adele and Billie Eilish each received nominations for three consecutive studio albums.

Stevie Wonder and Adele are the only artists to win the award for consecutive studio albums in this category, winning for &quot;Innervisions&quot; and &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot; and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;; and &quot;21&quot; and &quot;25&quot;, respectively.

Quincy Jones, Lauryn Hill and Bruno Mars are the only performers to win the award both as main-credit artists and as record producers, winning as lead artists for their albums &quot;Back on the Block&quot;, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and &quot;24K Magic&quot;, and as producers for &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson, &quot;Supernatural&quot; by Santana, and &quot;25&quot; by Adele, respectively. Mars&#x27; work on the album 25 is credited under his production team name The Smeezingtons.

To date, there have been four &quot;live&quot; albums to win the award: &quot;Judy at Carnegie Hall&quot;, &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, and two &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; albums (Eric Clapton&#x27;s and Tony Bennett&#x27;s), which were performed in front of a small live audience. One television soundtrack recording,&quot;The Music from Peter Gunn&quot;, has won. Two comedy albums have also won this category: &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; and &quot;The First Family&quot;.

=== Artists and bands with multiple wins ===
Eight artists have received the award more than once (either as a main-credit artist, duo or band; not counting wins solely as a producer, mixer or engineer).

Notes
==Process==
From 1995 to 2021, members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences nominated their choices for album of the year. A list of the top twenty records was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then selected the top five records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot. The rest of the members then voted on a winner from the five nominees. In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated albums would be increased to eight. In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for album of the year would be decided by votes from members. Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Evermore&quot; and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Donda&quot; to be nominated as they were the albums that received the highest number of votes besides the other eight nominees. As of the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced back to eight.

<doc id="196519" wikidata="Q179912" url="?curid=196519" title="Legalize It">
<text>Legalize It is the debut studio album by Jamaican singer-songwriter and former Wailer Peter Tosh, released in June 1976. It was recorded at Treasure Isle and Randy&#x27;s, Kingston.

&quot;Legalize It&quot; is one of the two solo albums released in 1976 by Wailers members, along with Bunny Wailer&#x27;s album &quot;Blackheart Man&quot;. Bob Marley and his new Wailers also released &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot;.

The song was written in response to his ongoing victimization by the Jamaican police and as a political piece pushing for the legalization of cannabis, particularly for medical use. In 1977, Tosh backed this up by saying &quot;We are the victims of Rasclot circumstances. Victimization, colonialism, gonna lead to bloodbath&quot;. Tosh also said &quot;Herb will become like cigarettes&quot;, in an &quot;NME&quot; interview in 1978.

==Reception==

The title track was banned when released in Jamaica in 1975. Attempts to suppress the song failed, however, catapulting Tosh to international fame.

The album was released in the United States in June 1976 and appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for two weeks, peaking at No. 199. In 1999, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for over one million copies sold.

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Unlike most sidemen who go on to pursue their own artistic interests, ex-Wailer Tosh has managed to gather about half an album for his solo debut, which ain&#x27;t bad. &#x27;Ketchy Shuby&#x27; even has the makings of a novelty hit. But oh, how his light heart and romantic spirit are missed among his old mates.&quot;

The album was included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="196520" wikidata="Q1033316" url="?curid=196520" title="Ehrlichiosis (canine)">
<text>Ehrlichiosis (; also known as canine rickettsiosis, canine hemorrhagic fever, canine typhus, tracker dog disease, and tropical canine pancytopenia) is a tick-borne disease of dogs usually caused by the rickettsial agent &quot;Ehrlichia canis&quot;. &quot;Ehrlichia canis&quot; is the pathogen of animals. Humans can become infected by &quot;E. canis&quot; and other species after tick exposure. German Shepherd Dogs are thought to be susceptible to a particularly severe form of the disease; other breeds generally have milder clinical signs. Cats can also be infected.

==&quot;Ehrlichia&quot;==

&quot;Ehrlichia&quot; is a rickettsial genus of bacteria belonging to the family Ehrlichiaceae. There are several species of &quot;Ehrlichia&quot;, but the one that most commonly affects dogs and causes the most severe clinical signs is &quot;Ehrlichia canis&quot;. This species infects monocytes in the peripheral blood. The brown dog tick, or &quot;Rhipicephalus sanguineous&quot;, which passes the organism to the dog, is prevalent throughout most of the United States, but most cases tend to occur in the Southwest and Gulf Coast regions, where there is a high concentration of the tick. &quot;Ehrlichia&quot; is found in many parts of the world and was first recognized in Algeria in 1935. During the Vietnam War ehrlichiosis became well known as a dog disease due to the infection and death of many military working dogs. Two types of human ehrlichiosis have been identified in the United States: human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.

==Disease overview==
Dogs get ehrlichiosis from the brown dog tick, which passes an ehrlichia organism into the bloodstream when it bites. It is also possible for dogs to become infected through a blood transfusion from an infected dog. There are three stages of ehrlichiosis, each varying in severity. The acute stage, occurring several weeks after infection and lasting for up to a month, can lead to fever and lowered peripheral blood cell counts due to bone marrow suppression. The second stage, called the subclinical phase, has no outward signs and can last for the remainder of the dog&#x27;s life, during which the dog remains infected with the organism. Some dogs are able to successfully eliminate the disease during this time. In some dogs the third and most serious stage of infection, the chronic phase, will commence. Very low blood cell counts (pancytopenia), bleeding, bacterial infection, lameness, neurological and ophthalmic disorders, and kidney disease can result. Chronic ehrlichiosis can be fatal.

==Signs and symptoms==
The acute stage of the disease, occurring most often in the spring and summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.

Although people can get ehrlichiosis, dogs do not transmit the bacteria to humans; rather, ticks pass on the &quot;ehrlichia&quot; organism. Clinical signs of human ehrlichiosis include fever, headache, eye pain, and gastrointestinal upset. It is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but rash is not seen in patients.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is achieved most commonly by serologic testing of the blood for the presence of antibodies against the ehrlichia organism. Many veterinarians routinely test for the disease, especially in enzootic areas. During the acute phase of infection, the test can be falsely negative because the body will not have had time to make antibodies to the infection. As such, the test should be repeated. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can be performed during this stage to detect genetic material of the bacteria. The PCR test is more likely to yield a negative result during the subclinical and chronic disease phases. In addition, blood tests may show abnormalities in the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and most commonly platelets, if the disease is present. Uncommonly, a diagnosis can be made by looking under a microscope at a blood smear for the presence of the &quot;ehrlichia&quot; morulae, which sometimes can be seen as intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within a white blood cell.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is good for dogs with acute ehrlichiosis. For dogs that have reached the chronic stage of the disease, the prognosis is guarded. When bone marrow suppression occurs and there are low levels of blood cells, the animal may not respond to treatment.

==Treatment==
Supportive care must be provided to animals that have clinical signs. Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are given to dehydrated animals, and severely anemic dogs may require a blood transfusion. Treatment for ehrlichiosis involves the use of antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline for a period of three to four weeks; Alternatively minocycline or rifampicin can be used as a second option. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin and azithromycin is being studied. In addition, steroids may be indicated in severe cases in which the level of platelets is so low that the condition is life-threatening.

==Prevention==
Tick control is the most effective method of prevention, but tetracycline at a lower dose can be given daily for 200 days during the tick season in endemic regions.

<doc id="196523" wikidata="Q131003" url="?curid=196523" title="Toxoplasma gondii">
<text>Toxoplasma gondii () is a species of parasitic alveolate that causes toxoplasmosis. Found worldwide, &quot;T. gondii&quot; is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, but felids are the only known definitive hosts in which the parasite may undergo sexual reproduction.

In rodents, &quot;T. gondii&quot; alters behavior in ways that increase the rodents&#x27; chances of being preyed upon by felids. Support for this &quot;manipulation hypothesis&quot; stems from studies showing that &quot;T. gondii&quot;-infected rats have a decreased aversion to cat urine while infection in mice lowers general anxiety, increases explorative behaviors and increases a loss of aversion to predators in general. Because cats are one of the only hosts within which &quot;T. gondii&quot; can sexually reproduce, such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations that increase the parasite&#x27;s reproductive success since rodents that do not avoid cat habitations will more likely become cat prey. The primary mechanisms of &quot;T. gondii&quot;–induced behavioral changes in rodents occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons that govern the relevant behaviors (e.g. hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala, which greatly decrease predator aversion).

In humans, particularly infants and those with weakened immunity, &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection is generally asymptomatic but may lead to a serious case of toxoplasmosis. &quot;T. gondii&quot; can initially cause mild, flu-like symptoms in the first few weeks following exposure, but otherwise, healthy human adults are asymptomatic. This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a latent infection, and it has been associated with numerous subtle behavioral, psychiatric, and personality alterations in humans. Behavioral changes observed between infected and non-infected humans include a decreased aversion to cat urine (but with divergent trajectories by gender) and an increased risk of schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence has suggested that &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection may induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in rodents. Many of these associations have been strongly debated and newer studies have found them to be weak, concluding:

However, there is evidence that &quot;T. Gondii&quot; may cause suicidal ideation and suicide in humans.

&quot;T. gondii&quot; is one of the most common parasites in developed countries; serological studies estimate that up to 50% of the global population has been exposed to, and may be chronically infected with, &quot;T. gondii&quot;; although infection rates differ significantly from country to country. Estimates have shown the highest IgG seroprevalence to be in Ethiopia, at 64.2%, as of 2018.

== Structure ==
&quot;T. gondii&quot; contains organelles called rhoptries and micronemes. They contain proteins for invasion and effectors for manipulating the hosts immune response. To inject them into host cells, &quot;T. gondii&quot; uses the apical complex located in the tip of the cell to puncture the host membrane and discharge the contents of these organelles. The two microtubulins and their associated proteins inside the conoid of the apical complex facilitate this by organizing and docking the rhoptries to the complex. The mechanism underlying this is yet to be discovered fully but the roles of the microtubulins and the four associated proteins have been identified.

== Life cycle ==

The life cycle of &quot;T. gondii&quot; may be broadly summarized into two components: a sexual component that occurs only within cats (felids, wild or domestic), and an asexual component that can occur within virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, cats, and birds. Because &quot;T. gondii&quot; can sexually reproduce only within cats, cats are therefore the definitive host of &quot;T. gondii&quot;. All other hosts – in which only asexual reproduction can occur – are intermediate hosts.

=== Sexual reproduction in the feline definitive host ===
When a feline is infected with &quot;T. gondii&quot; (e.g. by consuming an infected mouse carrying the parasite&#x27;s tissue cysts), the parasite survives passage through the stomach, eventually infecting epithelial cells of the cat&#x27;s small intestine. Inside these intestinal cells, the parasites undergo sexual development and reproduction, producing millions of thick-walled, zygote-containing cysts known as oocysts. Felines are the only definitive host because they lack expression of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase (D6D) in their intestine. This enzyme converts linoleic acid; the absence of expression allows systemic linoleic acid accumulation. Recent findings showed that this excess of linoleic acid is essential for &quot;T. gondii&quot; sexual reproduction.

=== Feline shedding of oocysts ===

Infected epithelial cells eventually rupture and release oocysts into the intestinal lumen, whereupon they are shed in the cat&#x27;s feces. Oocysts can then spread to soil, water, food, or anything potentially contaminated with the feces. Highly resilient, oocysts can survive and remain infective for many months in cold and dry climates.

Ingestion of oocysts by humans or other warm-blooded animals is one of the common routes of infection. Humans can be exposed to oocysts by, for example, consuming unwashed vegetables or contaminated water, or by handling the feces (litter) of an infected cat. Although cats can also be infected by ingesting oocysts, they are much less sensitive to oocyst infection than are intermediate hosts.

=== Initial infection of the intermediate host ===

Intermediate hosts found include pigs, chickens, goats, sheep and &quot;Macropus rufus&quot; by Moré et al. 2010. Cattle and horses are resistant and thought to be incapable of significant infection. &quot;T. gondii&quot; is considered to have three stages of infection; the tachyzoite stage of rapid division, the bradyzoite stage of slow division within tissue cysts, and the oocyst environmental stage. Tachyzoites are also known as &quot;tachyzoic merozoites&quot; and bradyzoites as &quot;bradyzoic merozoites&quot;. When an oocyst or tissue cyst is ingested by a human or other warm-blooded animal, the resilient cyst wall is dissolved by proteolytic enzymes in the stomach and small intestine, freeing sporozoites from within the oocyst. The parasites first invade cells in and surrounding the intestinal epithelium, and inside these cells, the parasites differentiate into tachyzoites, the motile and quickly multiplying cellular stage of &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Tissue cysts in tissues such as brain and muscle tissue, form about 7–10 days after initial infection. Although severe infection of &quot;M. rufus&quot; has been observed it is unknown whether this is common.

=== Asexual reproduction in the intermediate host ===

Inside host cells, the tachyzoites replicate inside specialized vacuoles (called the parasitophorous vacuoles) created from host cell membrane during invasion into the cell. Tachyzoites multiply inside this vacuole until the host cell dies and ruptures, releasing and spreading the tachyzoites via the bloodstream to all organs and tissues of the body, including the brain.

=== Growth in tissue culture ===

The parasite can be easily grown in monolayers of mammalian cells maintained in vitro in tissue culture. It readily invades and multiplies in a wide variety of fibroblast and monocyte cell lines. In infected cultures, the parasite rapidly multiplies and thousands of tachyzoites break out of infected cells and enter adjacent cells, destroying the monolayer in due course. New monolayers can then be infected using a drop of this infected culture fluid and the parasite indefinitely maintained without the need of animals.

=== Formation of tissue cysts ===

Following the initial period of infection characterized by tachyzoite proliferation throughout the body, pressure from the host&#x27;s immune system causes &quot;T. gondii&quot; tachyzoites to convert into bradyzoites, the semidormant, slowly dividing cellular stage of the parasite. Inside host cells, clusters of these bradyzoites are known as tissue cysts. The cyst wall is formed by the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Although bradyzoite-containing tissue cysts can form in virtually any organ, tissue cysts predominantly form and persist in the brain, the eyes, and striated muscle (including the heart). However, specific tissue tropisms can vary between intermediate host species; in pigs, the majority of tissue cysts are found in muscle tissue, whereas in mice, the majority of cysts are found in the brain.

Cysts usually range in size between five and 50&quot; &quot;μm in diameter, (with 50 μm being about two-thirds the width of the average human hair).

Consumption of tissue cysts in meat is one of the primary means of &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection, both for humans and for meat-eating, warm-blooded animals. Humans consume tissue cysts when eating raw or undercooked meat (particularly pork and lamb). Tissue cyst consumption is also the primary means by which cats are infected.

An exhibit at the San Diego Natural History Museum states urban runoff with cat feces transports &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; into the ocean, which can kill sea otters.

=== Chronic infection ===

Tissue cysts can be maintained in host tissue for the lifetime of the animal. However, the perpetual presence of cysts appears to be due to a periodic process of cyst rupturing and re-encysting, rather than a perpetual lifespan of individual cysts or bradyzoites. At any given time in a chronically infected host, a very small percentage of cysts are rupturing, although the exact cause of this tissue cyst rupture is, as of 2010, not yet known.

Theoretically, &quot;T. gondii&quot; can be passed between intermediate hosts indefinitely via a cycle of consumption of tissue cysts in meat. However, the parasite&#x27;s life cycle begins and completes only when the parasite is passed to a feline host, the only host within which the parasite can again undergo sexual development and reproduction.

=== Population structure in the wild ===
In 2006, researchers reviewed evidence that &quot;T. gondii&quot; has an unusual population structure dominated by three clonal lineages called Types I, II and III that occur in North America and Europe, despite the occurrence of a sexual phase in its life cycle. They estimated that a common ancestor existed about 10,000 years ago. Authors of a subsequent and larger study on 196 isolates from diverse sources including &quot;T. gondii&quot; in the bald eagle, gray wolf, Arctic fox and sea otter, also found that &quot;T. gondii&quot; strains infecting North American wildlife have limited genetic diversity with the occurrence of only a few major clonal types. They found that 85% of strains in North America were of one of three widespread genotypes II, III and Type 12. Thus &quot;T. gondii&quot; has retained the capability for sex in North America over many generations, producing largely clonal populations, and matings have generated little genetic diversity.

== Cellular stages ==

During different periods of its life cycle, individual parasites convert into various cellular stages, with each stage characterized by a distinct cellular morphology, biochemistry, and behavior. These stages include the tachyzoites, merozoites, bradyzoites (found in tissue cysts), and sporozoites (found in oocysts).

Some stages are motile and some calcium-dependent protein kinases (s) are involved in this parasite&#x27;s motility. Gaji et al. 2015 find is required to begin the action of motility because it phosphorylates &quot;T. gondii&quot;″s myosin&quot; &quot;A (). TgCDPK3 is the functional orthologue of CDPK1 in this parasite.

=== Tachyzoites ===
Motile, and quickly multiplying, tachyzoites are responsible for expanding the population of the parasite in the host. When a host consumes a tissue cyst (containing bradyzoites) or an oocyst (containing sporozoites), the bradyzoites or sporozoites stage-convert into tachyzoites upon infecting the intestinal epithelium of the host. During the initial acute period of infection, tachyzoites spread throughout the body via the blood stream. During the later, latent (chronic) stages of infection, tachyzoites stage-convert to bradyzoites to form tissue cysts. To survive in the host, tachyzoites manipulate the immune response by injecting the contents of rhoptries into host cells. This seems to be vital for their survival, as knock-out strains of &quot;T. gondii&quot; are unable to inject hosts with rhoptries have been shown to be avirulent &quot;in vivo&quot;.

=== Merozoites ===
Like tachyzoites, merozoites divide quickly and are responsible for expanding the population of the parasite inside the cat&#x27;s intestine before sexual reproduction. When a feline definitive host consumes a tissue cyst (containing bradyzoites), bradyzoites convert into merozoites inside intestinal epithelial cells. Following a brief period of rapid population growth in the intestinal epithelium, merozoites convert into the noninfectious sexual stages of the parasite to undergo sexual reproduction, eventually resulting in zygote-containing oocysts.

Studying the sexual phases of the &quot;T. gondii&quot; life cycle remains challenging and determining the precise triggers and molecular mechanisms governing this developmental program remains an ongoing area of research. Major challenges associated with the ability to cultivate presexual and sexual stages of &quot;T. gondii&quot; &quot;in vitro&quot; have limited our understanding of this developmental program and how it is triggered by the parasite in response to the infection of the cat. Multiple studies , revealed distinct differences in the transcriptomes of the asexual and sexual stages of &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Additionally, metabolic disparities within the feline host have been identified as key factors influencing the transition to sexual stages. However, linking gene expression patterns to stage transitions and deciphering the genetic triggers driving the switch from asexual to sexual development remain unresolved.

Important recent advancements in the field have shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms governing sexual development in &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Farhat and colleagues showed that chromatin modifiers MORC and HDAC3 play critical roles in silencing sexual development-specific genes. In MORC-depleted parasites, a broad activation of sexual gene expression was observed. In a later study, it was suggested that MORC-depleted parasites have disrupted sub-telomeric gene silencing. The disorganization in telomeres may have led to the misregulation of sexual development.

Moreover, the discovery of specific transcription factors essential for sexual commitment has provided invaluable insights into the intricate regulatory network orchestrating stage specificity in &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Multiple parasite transcription factors have been identified as critical suppressors of presexual development, permitting the study of presexual stages and opening new avenues for using genetics to drive the full sexual cycle &quot;in vitro&quot;. Specifically, the depletion of AP2XI-2 and AP2XII-1 in &quot;T. gondii&quot; induces merozoite-specific gene expression, raising the possibility for cultivating &quot;T. gondii&quot; sexual development in laboratory settings.

Crucial questions still persist regarding the genetic determinants that dictate whether parasites develop into macrogametes or microgametes. The development of new molecular and genomic approaches, such as single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, should be useful to those in the field working towards unraveling the molecular intricacies of this process.

=== Bradyzoites ===

Bradyzoites are the slowly dividing stage of the parasite that make up tissue cysts. When an uninfected host consumes a tissue cyst, bradyzoites released from the cyst infect intestinal epithelial cells before converting to the proliferative tachyzoite stage. Following the initial period of proliferation throughout the host body, tachyzoites then convert back to bradyzoites, which reproduce inside host cells to form tissue cysts in the new host.

=== Sporozoites ===

Sporozoites are the stage of the parasite residing within oocysts. When a human or other warm-blooded host consumes an oocyst, sporozoites are released from it, infecting epithelial cells before converting to the proliferative tachyzoite stage.

== Immune response ==
Initially, a &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection stimulates production of IL-2 and IFN-γ by the innate immune system. Continuous IFN-γ production is necessary for control of both acute and chronic &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection. These two cytokines elicit a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell mediated immune response. Thus, T-cells play a central role in immunity against &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; infection. T-cells recognize &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; antigens that are presented to them by the body&#x27;s own Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. The specific genetic sequence of a given MHC molecule differs dramatically between individuals, which is why these molecules are involved in transplant rejection. Individuals carrying certain genetic sequences of MHC molecules are much more likely to be infected with &quot;Toxoplasma&quot;. One study of &gt;1600 individuals found that Toxoplasma infection was especially common among people who expressed certain MHC alleles (HLA-B*08:01, HLA-C*04:01, HLA-DRB 03:01, HLA-DQA*05:01 and HLA-DQB*02:01).

IL-12 is produced during &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection to activate natural killer (NK) cells. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for &quot;T. gondii,&quot; which it scavenges from host cells. IFN-γ induces the activation of indole-amine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), two enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of tryptophan. Immune pressure eventually leads the parasite to form cysts that normally are deposited in the muscles and in the brain of the hosts.

=== Immune response and behavior alterations ===
The IFN-γ-mediated activation of IDO and TDO is an evolutionary mechanism that serves to starve the parasite, but it can result in depletion of tryptophan in the brain of the host. IDO and TDO degrade tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine. Administration of L-kynurenine is capable of inducing depressive-like behavior in mice. &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection has been demonstrated to increase the levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the brains of infected mice and in the brain of schizophrenic persons. Low levels of tryptophan and serotonin in the brain were already associated with depression.

== Risk factors for human infection ==

The following have been identified as being risk factors for &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection in humans and warm-blooded animals:
* by consuming raw or undercooked meat containing &quot;T. gondii&quot; tissue cysts. The most common threat to citizens in the United States is from eating raw or undercooked pork.
* by ingesting water, soil, vegetables, or anything contaminated with oocysts shed in the feces of an infected animal. Cat fecal matter is particularly dangerous: Just one cyst consumed by a cat can result in thousands of oocysts. This is why physicians recommend pregnant or ill persons do not clean the cat&#x27;s litter box at home. These oocysts are resilient to harsh environmental conditions and can survive over a year in contaminated soil.
* from a blood transfusion or organ transplant
* from transplacental transmission from mother to fetus, particularly when &quot;T. gondii&quot; is contracted during pregnancy
* from drinking unpasteurized goat milk
* from raw and treated sewage and bivalve shellfish contaminated by treated sewage

A common argument in the debate about whether cat ownership is ethical involves the question of &quot;T. gondii&quot; transmission to humans. Even though &quot;living in a household with a cat that used a litter box was strongly associated with infection,&quot; and that living with several kittens or any cat under one year of age has some significance, several other studies claim to have shown that living in a household with a cat is not a significant risk factor for &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection.

Specific vectors for transmission may also differ based on geographic location. &quot;The seawater in California is thought to be contaminated by &quot;T. gondii&quot; oocysts that originate from cat feces, survive or bypass sewage treatment, and travel to the coast through river systems. &quot;T. gondii&quot; has been identified in a California mussel by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. In light of the potential presence of &quot;T. gondii&quot;, pregnant women and immunosuppressed persons should be aware of this potential risk associated with eating raw oysters, mussels, and clams.&quot;

In warm-blooded animals, such as brown rats, sheep, and dogs, &quot;T. gondii&quot; has also been shown to be sexually transmitted. Although &quot;T. gondii&quot; can infect, be transmitted by, and asexually reproduce within humans and virtually all other warm-blooded animals, the parasite can sexually reproduce only within the intestines of members of the cat family (felids). Felids are therefore the definitive hosts of &quot;T. gondii&quot;; all other hosts (such as human or other mammals) are intermediate hosts.

== Preventing infection ==

The following precautions are recommended to prevent or greatly reduce the chances of becoming infected with &quot;T. gondii&quot;. This information has been adapted from the websites of United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.

=== From food ===
Basic food-handling safety practices can prevent or reduce the chances of becoming infected with &quot;T. gondii&quot;, such as washing unwashed fruits and vegetables, and avoiding raw or undercooked meat, poultry, and seafood. Other unsafe practices such as drinking unpasteurized milk or untreated water can increase odds of infection. As &quot;T. gondii&quot; is commonly transmitted through ingesting microscopic cysts in the tissues of infected animals, meat that is not prepared to destroy these presents a risk of infection. Freezing meat for several days at subzero temperatures (0 °F or −18 °C) before cooking may break down all cysts, as they rarely survive these temperatures. During cooking, whole cuts of red meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least . Medium rare meat is generally cooked between , so cooking meat to at least medium is recommended. After cooking, a rest period of 3 min should be allowed before consumption. However, ground meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least with no rest period. All poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least . After cooking, a rest period of 3 min should be allowed before consumption.

=== From environment ===

Oocysts in cat feces take at least a day to sporulate (to become infectious after they are shed), so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chance of infectious oocysts developing. As these can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of cat litter. These precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes/play sand pits, which should be covered when not in use. Cat feces should never be flushed down a toilet.

Pregnant women are at higher risk of transmitting the parasite to their unborn child and immunocompromised people of acquiring a lingering infection. Because of this, they should not change or handle cat litter boxes. Ideally, cats should be kept indoors and fed only food that has low to no risk of carrying oocysts, such as commercial cat food or well-cooked table food.

=== Vaccination ===
No approved human vaccine exists against &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. Research on human vaccines is ongoing.

For sheep, an approved live vaccine sold as Toxovax (from MSD Animal Health) provides lifetime protection.

There is currently no commercially available vaccine to prevent &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection in cats. However, research into feline vaccines for toxoplasmosis is ongoing, with several candidates showing positive results in clinical trials.

== Treatment ==
In humans, active toxoplasmosis can be treated with a combination of drugs such as pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, plus folinic acid. Immune-compromised patients may need continuous treatment until/unless their immune system is restored.

== Environmental effects ==
In many parts of the world, where there are high populations of feral cats, there is an increased risk to the native wildlife due to increased infection of &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. It has been found that the serum concentrations of &quot;T. gondii&quot; in the wildlife population were increased where there are high amounts of cat populations. This creates a dangerous environment for organisms that have not evolved in cohabitation with felines and their contributing parasites.

=== Impact on marine species ===
==== Cetaceans ====
Toxoplasmosis has been implicated in the deaths of various cetaceans species, such as the critically endangered Māui dolphin and Hector&#x27;s dolphin found in New Zealand. With only 54 Māui dolphins over the age of one remaining, &quot;T. gondii&quot; is considered a significant human-caused threat to the dolphins’ populations. Fatal cases of &quot;T. gondii&quot; have also been confirmed among spinner dolphins off the coast of Hawaii, among bottlenose dolphins, Risso&#x27;s dolphins, and striped dolphins along the Mediterranean coast, among Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Australia, and again among free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in Brazil.

A 2011 study of 161 Pacific Northwest marine mammals ranging from a sperm whale to harbor porpoises that had either become stranded or died found that 42 percent tested positive for both &quot;T. gondii&quot; and &quot;S. neurona&quot;. Approximately 14 per cent of the western Arctic beluga whale population is believed to asymptomatically carry &quot;T. gondii&quot; with a few deaths attributed to the infection.

==== Minks and otters ====
Toxoplasmosis is one of the contributing factors toward mortality in southern sea otters, especially in areas where there is large urban run-off. In their natural habitats, sea otters control sea urchin populations and, thus indirectly, control sea kelp forests. By enabling the growth of sea kelp, other marine populations are protected as well as CO2 emissions are reduced due to the kelp&#x27;s ability to absorb atmospheric carbon. An examination on 105 beachcast otters revealed that 38.1% had parasitic infections, and 28% of said infections had resulted in protozoal meningoencephalitis deaths. &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; was found to be the root cause in 16.2% of these deaths, while 6.7% of the deaths were due to a closely related protozoan parasite known as &quot;Sarcocystis neurona&quot;.

Minks, being semiaquatic, are also susceptible to infection and being antibody-positive toward &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Minks can follow a similar diet as otters and feasts on crustaceans, fish, and invertebrates, thus the transmission route follows a similar pattern to otters. Because of the mink&#x27;s ability to transverse land more frequently, and often seen as an invasive species itself, minks are a bigger threat in transporting &quot;T. gondii&quot; to other mammalian species, rather than otters who have a more restrictive breadth.

==== Other marine mammals ====
&quot;T. gondii&quot; has killed at least twelve endangered Hawaiian monk seals. There has been a documented fatal case in a West Indian manatee.

==== Black-footed penguins ====
Although under-studied, penguin populations, especially those that share an environment with the human population, are at-risk due to parasite infections, mainly &quot;Toxoplasmosis gondii&quot;. The main subspecies of penguins found to be infected by &quot;T. gondii&quot; include wild Magellanic and Galapagos penguins, as well as blue and African penguins in captivity. In one study, 57 (43.2%) of 132 serum samples of Magellanic penguins were found to have &quot;T. gondii&quot;. The island that the penguin is located, Magdalena Island, is known to have no cat populations, but a very frequent human population, indicating the possibility of transmission.

==== Histopathology ====
Examination of black-footed penguins with toxoplasmosis reveals hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cranial hemorrhage, and necrotic kidneys. Alveolar and hepatic tissue presents a high number of immune cells such as macrophages containing tachyzoites of &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Histopathological features in other animals affected with toxoplasmosis had tachyzoites in eye structures such as the retina which lead to blindness.

== Water transmission ==
The transmission of oocysts has been unknown, even though there have many documented cases of infection in marine species. Researchers have found that the oocytes of &quot;T. gondii&quot; can survive in seawater for at least six months, with the amount of salt concentration not affecting its life cycle. There have been no studies on the ability of &quot;T. gondii&quot; oocysts life cycle within freshwater environments, although infections are still present. One possible hypothesis of transmission is via amoeba species, particularly &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; spp., a species that is found in all water environments (fresh, brackish, and full-strength seawater). Normally, amoebas function as a natural filter, phagocytizing nutrients and bacteria found within the water. Some pathogens have used this to their advantage, however, and evolved to be able to avoid being broken down and, thus, survive encased in the amoeba – this includes Holosporaceae, Pseudomonaceae, Burkholderiacceae, among others. Overall, this aids the pathogen in transportation but, also, protection from drugs and sterilizers that would, otherwise, cause death in the pathogen. Studies have shown that &quot;T. gondii&quot; oocysts can live within amoebas after being engulfed for at least 14 days without significant obliteration of the parasite. The ability of the microorganism to survive in vitro is dependent on the microorganism itself, but there are a few overarching mechanisms present. &quot;T. gondii&quot; oocysts have been found to resist an acidic pH and, thus, are protected by the acidification found in endocytic vacuoles and lysosomes. Phagocytosis further increases with the carbohydrate-rich surface membrane located on the amoebae. The pathogen can be released either by lysis of the amoebae or by exocytosis, but this is understudied 

== Impact on wild birds ==
Almost all species of birds that have been tested for &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; have shown to be positive. The only bird species not reported with clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis would be wild ducks, and there has only been one report found on domesticated ducks occurring in 1962. Species with resistance toward &quot;T. gondii&quot; include domestic turkeys, owls, red tail hawks, and sparrows, depending on the strain of &quot;T. gondii&quot;. &quot;T. gondii&quot; is considerably more severe in pigeons, particularly crown pigeons, ornamental pigeons, and pigeons originating from Australia and New Zealand. Typical onset is quick and usually results in death. Those that do survive often have chronic conditions of encephalitis and neuritis. Similarly, canaries are observed to be just as severe as pigeons, but the clinical symptoms are more abnormal when compared to other species. Most of the infection affects the eye, causing blindness, choroidal lesions, conjunctivitis, atrophy of the eye, blepharitis, and chorioretinitis Most of the time, the infection leads to death. Research by Michael Grigg, chief of the molecular parasitology unit at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found that more than one half of dead raptors and more than one third of dead seabirds examined had the &quot;T. gondii&quot; parasite.

== Current environmental efforts ==
Urbanization and global warming are extremely influential in the transmission of &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Temperature and humidity are huge factors in the sporulation stage: low humidity is always fatal to the oocysts, and they are also vulnerable to extreme temperatures. Rainfall is also an important factor for survival of waterborne pathogens. Because increased rainfall directly increases the flow rate in rivers, the amount of flow into coastal areas is increased as well. This can spread waterborne pathogens over wide areas.
There is no effective vaccine for &quot;T. gondii&quot;, and research on a live vaccine is ongoing. Feeding cats commercially available food, rather than raw, undercooked meat, prevents felines from becoming a host for oocysts, as higher prevalence is in areas where raw meat is fed. Researchers also suggest that owners restrict cats to live indoors and to be neutered or spayed to decrease stray cat populations and to reduce intermediate host interactions. It is suggested that fecal matter from litter boxes be collected daily, placed in a sealable bag, and disposed of in the trash rather than flushed in the toilet, so that water contamination is limited.
Studies have found that wetlands with a high density of vegetation decrease the concentration of oocysts in water through two possible mechanisms. Firstly, vegetation decreases flow velocities, which enables more settling because of increased transport time. Secondly, the vegetation can remove oocysts through its ability to mechanically strain the water, as well as through the process of adhesion (i.e. attachment to biofilms). Areas of erosion and destruction of coastal wetlands have been found to harbour increased concentrations of &quot;T. gondii&quot; oocysts, which then flow into open coastal waters. Current physical and chemical treatments typically utilized in water treatment facilities have been proven to be ineffective against &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Research has shown that UV-C disinfection of water containing oocysts results in inactivation and possible sterilization.

== Genome ==
The genomes of more than 60 strains of &quot;T. gondii&quot; have been sequenced. Most are 60–80&quot; &quot;Mb in size and consist of 11–14 chromosomes. The major strains encode 7,800–10,000 proteins, of which about 5,200 are conserved across RH, GT1, ME49, VEG. A database, ToxoDB, has been established to document genomic information on &quot;Toxoplasma&quot;.

== History ==
In 1908, while working at the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, Charles Nicolle and Louis Manceaux discovered a protozoan organism in the tissues of a hamster-like rodent known as the gundi, &quot;Ctenodactylus gundi&quot;. Although Nicolle and Manceaux initially believed the organism to be a member of the genus &quot;Leishmania&quot; that they described as &quot;Leishmania gondii&quot;, they soon realized they had discovered a new organism entirely; they renamed it &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. The new genus name &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; is a reference to its morphology: &quot;Toxo&quot;, from Greek (&#x27;, &#x27;arc, bow&#x27;), and (&#x27;, &#x27;shape, form&#x27;) and the host in which it was discovered, the gundi (gondii). The same year Nicolle and Mancaeux discovered &quot;T. gondii&quot;, Alfonso Splendore identified the same organism in a rabbit in Brazil. However, he did not give it a name. In 1914, Italian tropicalist Aldo Castellani &quot;was first to suspect that toxoplasmosis could affect humans&quot;.

The first conclusive identification of &quot;T. gondii&quot; in humans was in an infant girl delivered full term by Caesarean section on May 23, 1938, at Babies&#x27; Hospital in New York City. The girl began having seizures at three days of age, and doctors identified lesions in the maculae of both of her eyes. When she died at one month of age, an autopsy was performed. Lesions discovered in her brain and eye tissue were found to have both free and intracellular &quot;T. gondii&quot;. Infected tissue from the girl was homogenized and inoculated intracerebrally into rabbits and mice; they then developed encephalitis. Later, congenital transmission was confirmed in many other species, particularly infected sheep and rodents.

The possibility of &quot;T. gondii&quot; transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was first proposed by D. Weinman and A.H. Chandler in 1954. In 1960, the relevant cyst wall were shown to dissolve in the proteolytic enzymes found in the stomach, releasing infectious bradyzoites into the stomach (which pass into the intestine). The hypothesis of transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was tested on children hospitalized in a sanatorium in Paris in 1965 by Georges Desmonts et al.; incidence of &quot;T. gondii&quot; rose from 10% to 50% after a year of adding two portions of cooked-rare beef or horse meat to many children&#x27;s daily diets, and to 100% among those fed cooked-rare lamb chops.

A 1959 Mumbai-based study found there prevalence in strict vegetarians was similar to that of non-vegetarians. This raised the possibility of a third major route of infection, beyond congenital and non well-cooked meat carnivorous transmission.

In 1970, oocysts were found in (cat) feces. The fecal–oral route of infection via oocysts was demonstrated. In the 1970s and 1980s feces of a vast range of infected animal species was tested to see if it contained oocysts—at least 17 species of felids shed oocysts, but no non-felid has been shown to allow &quot;T. gondii&quot; sexual reproduction (leading to oocyst shedding).

In 1984 Elmer R. Pfefferkorn published his discovery that treatment of human fibroblasts with human recombinant interferon gamma blocks the growth of &quot;T. gondii&quot;.

== Behavioral differences of infected hosts ==
There are many instances where behavioural changes were reported in rodents with &quot;T. gondii&quot;. The changes seen were a reduction in their innate dislike of cats, which made it easier for cats to prey on the rodents. In an experiment conducted by Berdoy and colleagues, the infected rats showed preference for the cat odour area versus the area with the rabbit scent, therefore making it easier for the parasite to take its final step in its definitive feline host. This is an example of the extended phenotype concept, that is, the idea that the behaviour of the infected animal changes in order to maximize survival of the genes that increase predation of the intermediate rodent host.

* Differences in sex-dependent behavior observed in infected hosts compared to non-infected individuals can be attributed to differences in testosterone. Infected males had higher levels of testosterone while infected females had significantly lower levels, compared to their non-infected equivalents.
* Looking at humans, studies using the Cattell&#x27;s 16 Personality Factor questionnaire found that infected men scored lower on Factor G (superego strength/rule consciousness) and higher on Factor&quot; &quot;L (vigilance) while the opposite pattern was observed for infected women. Such men were more likely to disregard rules and were more expedient, suspicious, and jealous. On the other hand, women were more warm-hearted, outgoing, conscientious, and moralistic. 
* Published research has also indicated that &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection could potentially promote changes in a person&#x27;s political beliefs and values. Those who are infected with the parasite tend to exhibit a higher degree of &quot;us versus them&quot; thinking.

* Mice infected with &quot;T. gondii&quot; have a worse motor performance than non-infected mice. Thus, a computerized simple reaction test was given to both infected and non-infected adults. It was found that the infected adults performed much more poorly and lost their concentration more quickly than the control group. But, the effect of the infection only explains less than 10% of the variability in performance (i.e., there could be other confounding factors).

* Correlation has also been observed between seroprevalence of &quot;T. gondii&quot; in humans and increased risk of traffic accidents. Infected subjects have a 2.65 times higher risk of getting into a traffic accident. A Turkish study confirmed this holds true among drivers.
* This parasite has been associated with many neurological disorders such as schizophrenia. In a meta-analysis of 23 studies that met inclusion criteria, the seroprevalence of antibodies to &quot;T. gondii&quot; in people with schizophrenia is significantly higher than in control populations (OR=2.73, P&lt;0.000001).
* A 2009 summary of studies found that suicide attempters had far more indicative (IgG) antibodies than mental health inpatients without a suicide attempt. Infection was also shown to be associated with suicide in women over the age of 60. (P&lt;0.005) 
* Research on the linkage between &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection and entrepreneurial behavior showed that students who tested positive for &quot;T. gondii&quot; exposure were 1.4 times more likely to major in business and 1.7 times more likely to have an emphasis in &quot;management and entrepreneurship&quot;. Among 197 participants of entrepreneurship events, &quot;T. gondii&quot; exposure was correlated with being 1.8 times more likely to have started their own business.
* Another population-representative study with 7440 people in the United States found that &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; infection was 2.4 fold more common in people who had a history of manic and depression symptoms (bipolar disorder Type 1) compared to the general population.

As mentioned before, these results of increased proportions of people seropositive for the parasite in cases of these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It is also important to mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that toxoplasmosis is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of &quot;T. gondii&quot; antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between &quot;T. gondii&quot; seropositivity and schizophrenia. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low statistical power because of small sample sizes but against this weights that their setup should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation. They concluded that further studies should be performed.

The mechanism behind behavioral changes is partially attributed to increased dopamine metabolism, which can be neutralized by dopamine antagonist medications. &quot;T. gondii&quot; has two genes that code for a bifunctional phenylalanine and tyrosine hydroxylase, two important and rate-limiting steps of dopamine biosynthesis. One of the genes is constitutively expressed, while the other is only produced during cyst development. In addition to additional dopamine production, &quot;T. gondii&quot; infection also produces long-lasting epigenetic changes in animals that increase the expression of vasopressin, a probable cause of alterations that persist after the clearance of the infection.

In 2022, a study published in &quot;Communications Biology&quot; of a well-documented population of wolves studied throughout their lives, suggested that &quot;T. gondii&quot; also may have a significant effect on their behavior. It suggested that infection with this parasite emboldened infected wolves into behavior that determined leadership roles and influenced risk-taking behavior, perhaps even motivating establishment of new independent packs that they would establish and lead in behavior patterns differing from that of the packs into which they were born. The study determined that at times, an infected wolf would become the only breeding male in a pack, leading to a significant effect on another species by &quot;T. gondii&quot;.

==Potential medical use==
In July 2024, a study published in &quot;Nature Microbiology&quot; showed that &quot;T. gondii&quot; can be engineered to deliver the MECP2 protein, a therapeutic target of Rett syndrome, to the brain of infected mice.

<text>Asaph Hall III (October 15, 1829 – November 22, 1907) was an American astronomer who is best known for having discovered the two moons of Mars, Deimos and Phobos, in 1877. He determined the orbits of satellites of other planets and of double stars, the rotation of Saturn, and the mass of Mars.

==Biography==
Hall was born in Goshen, Connecticut, the son of Asaph Hall II (1800–42), a clockmaker, and Hannah Palmer (1804–80). His paternal grandfather Asaph Hall I (June 11, 1735 – March 29, 1800) was a Revolutionary War officer and Connecticut state legislator. His father died when he was 13, leaving the family in financial difficulty, so Hall left school at 16 to become an apprentice to a carpenter. He later enrolled at the New-York Central College in McGrawville, New York, where he studied mathematics. There he took classes from an instructor of geometry and German, Angeline Stickney. In 1856 they married.

In 1856, Hall took a job at the Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and turned out to be an expert computer of orbits. Hall became assistant astronomer at the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. in 1862, and within a year of his arrival he was made professor.

On June 5, 1872 Hall published an article entitled &quot;On an experimental determination of formula_1&quot; in the journal &quot;Messenger of Mathematics&quot;. In this article, Hall reported the results of an experiment in random sampling that Hall had persuaded his friend, Captain O.C. Fox, to perform when Fox was recuperating from a wound received at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The experiment involved repetitively throwing at random a fine steel wire onto a plane wooden surface ruled with equidistant parallel lines. An approximation of formula_1 was then computed as formula_3, where formula_4 is the number of trials, formula_5 is the length of the steel wire, formula_6 is the distance between parallel lines, and formula_7 is the number of intersections. This paper, an experiment on Buffon&#x27;s needle problem, is a very early documented use of random sampling (which Nicholas Metropolis would name the Monte Carlo method during the Manhattan Project of World War II) in scientific inquiry.

In 1875 Hall was given responsibility for the USNO 26-inch (66-cm) telescope, the largest refracting telescope in the world at the time. It was with this telescope that he discovered Phobos and Deimos in August 1877. Hall also noticed a white spot on Saturn which he used as a marker to ascertain the planet&#x27;s rotational period. In 1884, Hall showed that the position of the elliptical orbit of Saturn&#x27;s moon, Hyperion, was retrograding by about 20° per year. Hall also investigated stellar parallaxes and the positions of the stars in the Pleiades star cluster.

Hall was responsible for apprenticing Henry S. Pritchett at the Naval Observatory in 1875.

===Discovery of Phobos and Deimos===
During Mars&#x27; closest approach in 1877, Hall was encouraged by Angeline Stickney, his wife, to search for the Martian moons. His calculations had shown that the orbit should be very close to the planet. Hall wrote &quot;The chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the encouragement of my wife.&quot;

Asaph Hall discovered Deimos on August 12, 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on August 18, 1877, at the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon, give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively). At the time, he was deliberately searching for Martian moons. Hall had previously seen what appeared to be a Martian moon on August 10, but due to bad weather, he could not definitively identify them until later.

Hall recorded his discovery of Phobos in his notebook as follows:


Hall retired from the Navy in 1891. He became a lecturer in celestial mechanics at Harvard University in 1896, and continued to teach there until 1901.

==Family==
The Halls had four children. Asaph Hall, Jr. (1859–1930) became an astronomer, Samuel Stickney Hall (1864–1936) worked for Mutual Life Insurance Company, Angelo Hall (1868–1922) became a Unitarian minister and professor of mathematics at the US Naval Academy, and Percival Hall (1872–1953) became president of Gallaudet University. Angeline Hall died in 1892. Hall married Mary Gauthier after he fully retired to Goshen, Connecticut in 1901.

Hall died in November 1907 while visiting his son Angelo in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Awards and honors==

Hall was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1878. He won the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1878, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1879, the Arago Medal in 1893, and was made a Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d&#x27;honneur (French Legion of Honor) in 1896. In 1885, he was President of the Philosophical Society of Washington. Hall crater on the Moon as well as Hall crater on the Martian moon Phobos are named in his honor.

<doc id="196528" wikidata="Q430839" url="?curid=196528" title="Miroslav Filipović">
<text>Miroslav Filipović (5 June 1915 – 29 June 1946), also known as Tomislav Filipović and Tomislav Filipović-Majstorović, was a Croatian Franciscan friar and Ustashe military chaplain who participated in atrocities during World War II in Yugoslavia. Convicted as a war criminal in a Yugoslav civil court, he was executed by hanging in 1946.

For the duration of the war, the Vatican continued to recognize the Yugoslav Government-in-exile, following the principle of not recognizing new states in time of war. However, it also developed relations with the Independent State of Croatia and was briefed on the efforts of the Ustaše to convert ethnic Serbs to Catholicism. Some former priests, mostly Franciscans, particularly in, but not limited to, Herzegovina and Bosnia, took part in the atrocities themselves. Filipović-Majstorović joined the Ustaše on 7 February 1942, and participated in the Banja Luka massacre. He was reportedly subsequently dismissed from his order. He became the Chief Guard of the Jasenovac concentration camp where he was nicknamed &quot;Fra Sotona&quot; (&quot;Brother Satan&quot;) due to his sadism. When he was hanged for war crimes, he wore his clerical garb, although he had been reportedly defrocked in 1942.

==Early life==
Filipović&#x27;s date of birth was 5 June 1915, but little else about his early years has been recorded. In 1938 he joined the Franciscan Order at Petrićevac monastery, Banja Luka, and took &quot;Tomislav&quot; as his religious name.

In 1941, following establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a puppet state installed by the Axis Powers embracing Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as most of Croatia by the Ustaše, an organisation of extremist Croatian nationalists, Filipović was assigned to a chaplaincy in the Rama region in northern Herzegovina but did not take up the assignment. In January 1942, after completing his theological exams in Sarajevo, he became a military chaplain with the Ustaša. A report by the State Commission of Croatia for the Investigation of the Crimes of the Occupation Forces and their Collaborators (SCC), marks his acts clearly within the Ustaše members and high ranks.

==Ustaša chaplain==
Filipović (later known as Tomislav Filipović-Majstorović) was assigned to II Poglavnik Bodyguard Battalion. Statements by two eyewitnesses and a senior German general say that on 7 February 1942, Filipović accompanied elements of his battalion in an operation aimed at wiping out Serbs in the settlement of Drakulić, on the northern outskirts of Banja Luka, and in two neighbouring villages, Motike and Šargovac. A few Serbs survived, but overwhelmingly the operation achieved its objective; more than 2,300 Serb civilians, including men, women and children were killed, usually with axes or pick-axes.

Reports sent to Eugen Dido Kvaternik, head of the state internal security service, from his Banja Luka office and dated 9 and 11 February 1942, noted that the victims at Šargovac included 52 children killed at the village primary school. The first of these reports gives death tolls at the mine, the school and the three villages which together total 2,287. The second revises the death toll at the school from 37 to 52, bringing the toll to 2,302, 13 fewer than the immediately preceding estimate of 2,315.

Filipović was court-martialed by the Wehrmacht for his involvement, possibly at the request of the Italian Royal Army which was then occupying part of the ISC territory. On 4 April 1942, Filipović&#x27;s priestly faculties were reportedly suspended by order of the Papal Nuncio in Zagreb and he was jailed in Croatia. While there is no evidence that Filipović was ever excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church, he was expelled from the Order of Friars Minor on 22 October 1942, the date on which he was transferred to Stara Gradiška.

In his testimony to a Croatian state commission set up after World War II to investigate war crimes &quot;by the occupation forces and their collaborators&quot;, Filipović alleged that he neither participated in, nor attended, the 7 February massacres.
However, General Edmund Glaise-Horstenau, the senior Wehrmacht officer in the region, accused Filipović in a report of being present at a planning meeting prior to the massacres, along with certain other Catholic military chaplains and, &quot;during the slaughtering&quot;. General Glaise-Horstenau further alleged that the Ustaša&#x27;s former mayor of Banja Luka, Viktor Gutić, and the city&#x27;s Chief justice, a Dr Stilinović, were also present at the meeting.

==Responsibilities at the Jasenovac camps complex==

===Appointment===

Through the direct intervention of Vjekoslav &quot;Maks&quot; Luburić, who then headed Section III of the ISC internal security service (&quot;Ustaška nadzorna služba&quot;, literally: Ustaše Surveillance Service), which was responsible for administering the puppet state&#x27;s system of prison camps, Filipović was quickly released and posted to the Jasenovac complex of labour and death camps where he was at first an inmate with benefited status, who aided the Ustase, and later appointed Ustase, commanding a small transit camp near Jasenovac, in early 1942, he reportedly killed an inmate there for hiding a loaf of bread.

Shortly thereafter he became chief-guard, responsible for mass-executions and lieutenant of the commander Ljubo Miloš and administrator Ivica Matković, and later, on 10 June 1942, administrator of the main camp in their stead, until the return of Matković, in March 1942. Luburić gave Filipović a new surname, &quot;Majstorović&quot;, derived from a local word meaning &quot;master&quot; or &quot;craftsman&quot;. From then on documents referred to him sometimes by that name and sometimes as Filipović-Majstorović. He won an apparent bet placed by him, Marinko Polić and Jerko Maričić, both infamous NCOs in the camp. Witness Josip Riboli stated:

Another particularly vicious killing was described by the former Jewish prisoner, Egon Berger, in his book, &quot;44 months in Jasenovac&quot;:

===Commandant of Jasenovac===
After the war Filipović admitted that he had personally killed about 100 prisoners and had attended mass executions of many more. He estimated that under his command some 20–30,000 prisoners were murdered at the main Jasenovac camp. He said prisoners would often be made to stand in prepared trenches where each was then killed with a sledgehammer blow. He went on to describe his tenure in command of Stara Gradiška, a prison camp primarily for women which was designated Camp V within the Jasenovac system:

After hearing from 62 Jasenovac survivors, whom it listed usually with complete addresses, the war-crimes commission in 1946 counted Filipović among 13 Ustaše who &quot;stood out&quot; for their brutality and direct involvement in the killing. It reported that even the cruelty of Ljubo Miloš, notorious for slashing prisoners to death in a mock clinic, was &quot;surpassed in sadism&quot; by Filipović. The commission saw Filipović&#x27;s statement as a &quot;crucial&quot; acknowledgement of his participation in atrocities, but with respect to the numbers he had given, it noted: &quot;All witnesses interviewed, who were prisoners themselves, speak with complete consistency and certainty of a far greater number, especially in regards to the number of victims killed by Majstorovic himself&quot;. The commission cited one witness, Tomo Krkac, who had described seeing Filipović &quot;very often&quot; shooting prisoners during so-called public executions and forcing prisoners to kill other prisoners with sledgehammers.

In one of the first published memoirs about life and death in the Jasenovac complex, a Croatian medical doctor and academic, Dr Nikola Nikolić, who had been imprisoned in Camp III, described his first meeting with Filipović: &quot;His voice had an almost feminine quality which was at odds with his physical stature and coarse face&quot;. Nikolić recalled standing in the second row of a group of prisoners who had been lined up to watch as another group of prisoners were herded in front of Filipović, who summoned Nikolić to the front so that, as a doctor, he could witness &quot;our surgery being performed without anaesthetic&quot;. Filipović then shot dead two prisoners and told a colleague to &quot;finish off the rest&quot;.

Nikolić quotes another survivor, Josip Riboli:

Riboli also gave evidence to the Croatian war-crimes commission. According to the accounts of some survivors, Filipović continued to act as a chaplain while commanding the camp and sometimes wore his Franciscan robes while carrying out his crimes. As a result, he came to be known as &quot;Fra Sotona&quot; (&quot;Friar Satan&quot;). According to Ronald Rychlak, Filopovic was &quot;tried, laicized, and expelled from the Franciscan order before the war even ended&quot;, reportedly on 22 October 1942, the date on which he was transferred to Stara Gradiška.

In September 1944, Filipović, along with Dinko Šakić and others, was appointed to sit on an ad hoc court-martial convened to try prisoners accused of forging links with the partisans and plotting an escape. The Croatian War Crimes Commission in its report was at a loss to explain why such a process had been deemed necessary when Ustaše had already killed thousands of people &quot;by heinous means, without any justification or procedure&quot;. It reported that all 31 accused prisoners were hanged after undergoing severe torture including blindings, crushed fingers and blow-lamp burns. Filipović in his testimony said: &quot;We [the court-martial] didn&#x27;t investigate anything, we only signed the verdicts&quot;.

===Commandant of Stara Gradiška===
As chief of camp Stara Gradiška, which predominantly housed women and children, Miroslav Filipović-Majstorović excelled in sadism. A Jewish survivor of Jasenovac, Egon Berger, described Filipović&#x27;s sadistic killing of Serbian children, while, according to two other witnesses, Simo (or Sime) Klaić and Dragutin Škrgatić: Klaić recalls that in Christmas 1942, Miroslav [Filipović-Majstorović] ordered mass and later a muster, where he killed four inmates with a knife, while forcing a Jew of Sarajevo, Alkalaj, to sing, then ordering Alkalaj to near [approach] him, stabbing him in the chest and slashing his throat. Then he killed 56 Bosnian Jews by tying them with wire, hitting them with an axe so they all fell into a well. Then he shot around 40 Bosniak villagers in the head. Škrgatić confirmed that Filipović shot the villagers in the head after mass, adding:&quot;In Majstorović&#x27;s time, musters and executions were frequent. Friar Majstorović favored a mystical approach to the killings... After he killed them, sat on a chair and said &#x27;justice has been done&#x27;&quot;.

Ivan Placec, a witness, added that Filipović shot nine inmates that day for an escape attempt. Josip Erlih also viewed a similar occasion, when, he claimed, eight inmates were shot by Filipović.

==Other activities==
As a member of the Ustasha defense, he had the rank of major. During 1943 and 1944, he acted as an intelligence officer in Herzegovina and Central Bosnia, and as an assistant commander of IV. Ustasha association in Lika. In early May 1945, he fled to Austria, where he was captured by the British and extradited to the Yugoslavia.

==Post-war==
In 1946 Filipović stood trial in Belgrade for war crimes. He gave evidence consistent with his statement to the Croatian war-crimes commission, admitting his participation in some crimes and denying involvement in others. He was found guilty, sentenced to death and hanged. Despite his expulsion in 1942, Filipović was executed while wearing the habit of the Franciscan Order.

<text>A sniggle is a type of fish hook used for catching eels (known as snigs), using the method of sniggling.
Also, much like the clasp on a front hooking bra. A ‘’’sniggle’’’. 
A typical method of sniggling is to tie a fishing line to the middle of a large needle or fish hook. The needle is then inserted along the body of an earthworm which is used as bait. The needle is then stuck into a slender sniggling pole such as a hazel wand, eight to ten feet long. This is used to insert the bait into promising holes or crannies in which eels tend to lurk. When an eel takes the bait then, after a minute or two, the bait will have been swallowed whole and the line is then pulled to rotate the needle or hook within the body of the eel so snagging and catching it. Eels of two or three pounds weight may be caught by this method but may require a protracted tug of war to pull them from their hole. This provides better sport and amusement than the use of traps or clod-fishing and is a good alternative for the angler when game fish such as trout will not rise.

<doc id="196556" wikidata="Q2249769" url="?curid=196556" title="Postmodernity">
<text>Postmodernity (post-modernity or the postmodern condition) is the economic or cultural state or condition of society which is said to exist &quot;after&quot; modernity. Some schools of thought hold that modernity ended in the late 20th century – in the 1980s or early 1990s – and that it was replaced by postmodernity, and still others would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity. The idea of the postmodern condition is sometimes characterized as a culture stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state like regressive isolationism, as opposed to the progressive mind state of modernism.

Postmodernity can mean a personal response to a postmodern society, the conditions in a society which make it postmodern or the state of being that is associated with a postmodern society as well as a historical epoch. In most contexts it should be distinguished from postmodernism, the adoption of postmodern philosophies or traits in the arts, culture and society. In fact, today&#x27;s historical perspectives on the developments of postmodern art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship like post-postmodernism, the result of which is the evolving culture of the contemporary world.

Some commentators deny that modernity ended, and consider the post-WWII era to be a continuation of modernity, which they refer to as late modernity.

== Uses of the term ==
&quot;Postmodernity&quot; is the state or condition of being postmodern – after or in reaction to that which is modern, as in postmodern art (&quot;see postmodernism&quot;). Modernity is defined as a period or condition loosely identified with the Progressive Era, the Industrial Revolution, or the Enlightenment. In philosophy and critical theory &quot;postmodernity&quot; refers to the state or condition of society which is said to exist &quot;after&quot; modernity, a historical condition that marks the reasons for the end of modernity. This usage is ascribed to the philosophers Jean-François Lyotard and Jean Baudrillard.

One &quot;project&quot; of modernity is said by Jürgen Habermas to have been the fostering of progress by incorporating principles of rationality and hierarchy into public and artistic life. (See also post-industrial, Information Age) Lyotard understood modernity as a cultural condition characterized by constant change in the pursuit of progress. Postmodernity then represents the culmination of this process where constant change has become the &quot;status quo&quot; and the notion of progress obsolete. Following Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s critique of the possibility of absolute and total knowledge, Lyotard further argued that the various metanarratives of progress such as positivist science, Marxism, and structuralism were defunct as methods of achieving progress.

The literary critic Fredric Jameson and the geographer David Harvey have identified postmodernity with &quot;late capitalism&quot; or &quot;flexible accumulation&quot;, a stage of capitalism following finance capitalism, characterised by highly mobile labor and capital and what Harvey called &quot;time and space compression&quot;. They suggest that this coincides with the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system which, they believe, defined the economic order following the Second World War. (See also consumerism, critical theory.) Other academics, such as the archaeologist Artur Ribeiro, also identify postmodernity with late capitalism. Though in the case of Ribeiro, he places the start of modernity at the beginning of the Bretton Woods system.

Those who generally view modernity as obsolete or an outright failure, a flaw in humanity&#x27;s evolution leading to disasters like Auschwitz and Hiroshima, see postmodernity as a positive development. Other philosophers, particularly those seeing themselves as within the Modern Project, see the state of postmodernity as a negative consequence of holding postmodernist ideas. For example, Jürgen Habermas and others contend that postmodernity represents a resurgence of long running Counter-Enlightenment ideas, that the modern project is not finished and that universality cannot be so lightly dispensed with. Postmodernity, the consequence of holding postmodern ideas, is generally a negative term in this context.

==Postmodernism==

Postmodernity is a condition or a state of being associated with changes to institutions and creations and with social and political results and innovations, globally but especially in the West since the 1950s, whereas postmodernism is an aesthetic, literary, political or social philosophy, the &quot;cultural and intellectual phenomenon&quot;, especially since the 1920s&#x27; new movements in the arts. Both of these terms are used by philosophers, social scientists and social critics to refer to aspects of contemporary culture, economics and society that are the result of features of late 20th century and early 21st century life, including the fragmentation of authority and the commoditization of knowledge (&quot;see&quot; &quot;Modernity&quot;).

The relationship between postmodernity and critical theory, sociology and philosophy is fiercely contested. The terms &quot;postmodernity&quot; and &quot;postmodernism&quot; are often hard to distinguish, the former being often the result of the latter. The period has had diverse political ramifications: its &quot;anti-ideological ideas&quot; appear to have been associated with the feminist movement, racial equality movements, LGBT movements, most forms of late 20th century anarchism and even the peace movement as well as various hybrids of these in the current anti-globalization movement. Though none of these institutions entirely embraces all aspects of the postmodern movement in its most concentrated definition they all reflect, or borrow from, some of its core ideas.

== History ==

Some authors, such as Lyotard and Baudrillard, believe that modernity ended in the late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely postmodernity, while others, such as Zygmunt Bauman and Anthony Giddens, would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity. Others still contend that modernity ended with the Victorian Age at the turn of the 20th century.

Postmodernity has gone through two relatively distinct phases: the first beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s and ending with the Cold War (when analog media with limited bandwidth encouraged a few, authoritative media channels), and the second beginning at the end of the Cold War (marked by the spread of cable television and &quot;new media&quot; based on digital means of information dissemination and broadcast).

The first phase of postmodernity overlaps the end of modernity and is part of the modern period &quot;(see lumpers/splitters, periodization)&quot;. Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the baby boom generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the Algerian War and the Vietnam War, to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to divorce, increased use of marijuana and psychedelics, the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including rock music and the ubiquity of stereo, television and radio helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of Marshall McLuhan, a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a media culture and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.

The second phase of postmodernity is &quot;digitality&quot; – the increasing power of personal and digital means of communication including fax machines, modems, cable and high speed internet, which has altered the condition of postmodernity dramatically: digital production of information allows individuals to manipulate virtually every aspect of the media environment. This has brought producers into conflict with consumers over intellectual capital and intellectual property and led to the creation of a new economy whose supporters argue that the dramatic fall in information costs will alter society fundamentally.

Digitality, or what Esther Dyson referred to as &quot;being digital&quot;, emerged as a separate condition from postmodernity. The ability to manipulate items of popular culture, the World Wide Web, the use of search engines to index knowledge, and telecommunications were producing a &quot;convergence&quot; marked by the rise of &quot;participatory culture&quot; in the words of Henry Jenkins.

One demarcation point of this era is the liberalization of China in the early 1980s and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Francis Fukuyama wrote &quot;The End of History?&quot; in 1989 in anticipation of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. He predicted that the question of political philosophy had been answered, that large scale wars over fundamental values would no longer arise since &quot;all prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs satisfied.&quot; This is a kind of &#x27;endism&#x27; also taken up by Arthur Danto who in 1964 acclaimed that Andy Warhol&#x27;s Brillo boxes asked the right question of art and hence art had ended.

=== Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory ===
The debate on postmodernity has two distinct elements that are often confused; (1) the nature of contemporary society and (2) the nature of the critique of contemporary society. The first of these elements is concerned with the nature of changes that took place during the late 20th century. There are three principal analyses. Theorists such as Alex Callinicos and Craig Calhoun offer a conservative position on the nature of contemporary society, downplaying the significance and extent of socio-economic changes and emphasizing a continuity with the past. Second a range of theorists have tried to analyze the present as a development of the &quot;modern&quot; project into a second, distinct phase that is nevertheless still &quot;modernity&quot;: this has been termed the &quot;second&quot; or &quot;risk&quot; society by Ulrich Beck, &quot;late&quot; or &quot;high&quot; modernity by Giddens, &quot;liquid&quot; modernity by Bauman, and the &quot;network&quot; society by Manuel Castells. Third are those who argue that contemporary society has moved into a literally post-modern phase distinct from modernity. The most prominent proponents of this position are Lyotard and Baudrillard.

Another set of issues concerns the nature of critique, often replaying debates over (what can be crudely termed) universalism and relativism, where modernism is seen to represent the former and postmodernity the latter. Seyla Benhabib and Judith Butler pursue this debate in relation to feminist politics, Benhabib arguing that postmodern critique comprises three main elements; an anti-foundationalist concept of the subject and identity, the death of history and of notions of teleology and progress, and the death of metaphysics defined as the search for objective truth. Benhabib argues forcefully against these critical positions, holding that they undermine the bases upon which feminist politics can be founded, removing the possibility of agency, the sense of self-hood and the appropriation of women&#x27;s history in the name of an emancipated future. The denial of normative ideals removes the possibility for utopia, central for ethical thinking and democratic action.

Butler responds to Benhabib by arguing that her use of postmodernism is an expression of a wider paranoia over anti-foundationalist philosophy, in particular, post-structuralism.

Butler uses the debate over the nature of the post-modernist critique to demonstrate how philosophy is implicated in power relationships and defends poststructuralist critique by arguing that the critique of the subject itself is the beginning of analysis, not the end, because the first task of enquiry is the questioning of accepted &quot;universal&quot; and &quot;objective&quot; norms.

The Benhabib-Butler debate demonstrates that there is no simple definition of a postmodern theorist as the very definition of postmodernity itself is contested. Michel Foucault rejected the label of postmodernism explicitly in interviews yet is seen by many, such as Benhabib, as advocating a form of critique that is &quot;postmodern&quot; in that it breaks with utopian and transcendental &quot;modern&quot; critiques by calling universal norms of the Enlightenment into question. Giddens rejects this characterisation of &quot;modern critique&quot;, pointing out that a critique of Enlightenment universals was central to philosophers of the modern period, most notably Nietzsche.

=== Postmodern society ===
Jameson views a number of phenomena as distinguishing postmodernity from modernity. He speaks of &quot;a new kind of superficiality&quot; or &quot;depthlessness&quot; in which models that once explained people and things in terms of an &quot;inside&quot; and an &quot;outside&quot; (such as hermeneutics, the dialectic, Freudian repression, the existentialist distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity, and the semiotic distinction of signifier and signified) have been rejected.

Second is a rejection of the modernist &quot;Utopian gesture&quot;, evident in Van Gogh, of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has undergone a &quot;fundamental mutation&quot; so that it has &quot;now become a set of texts or simulacra&quot;. Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world (we might say, following Graff, to give the world back the enchantment that science and the decline of religion had taken away from it), postmodernist art bestows upon the world a &quot;deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer in a way that would seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the death anxiety on the level of content&quot; (ibid.). Graff sees the origins of this transformative mission of art in an attempted substitution of art for religion in giving meaning to the world that the rise of science and Enlightenment rationality had removed – but in the postmodern period this is seen as futile.

The third feature of the postmodern age that Jameson identifies is the &quot;waning of affect&quot; – not that all emotion has disappeared from the postmodern age but that it lacks a particular kind of emotion such as that found in &quot;Rimbaud&#x27;s magical flowers &#x27;that look back at you&#x27;&quot;. He notes that &quot;pastiche eclipses parody&quot; as &quot;the increasing unavailability of the personal style&quot; leads to pastiche becoming a universal practice.

Jameson argues that distance &quot;has been abolished&quot; in postmodernity, that we &quot;are submerged in its henceforth filled and suffused volumes to the point where our now postmodern bodies are bereft of spatial co-ordinates&quot;. This &quot;new global space&quot; constitutes postmodernity&#x27;s &quot;moment of truth&quot;. The various other features of the postmodern that he identifies &quot;can all now be seen as themselves partial (yet constitutive) aspects of the same general spatial object&quot;. The postmodern era has seen a change in the social function of culture. He identifies culture in the modern age as having had a property of &quot;semi-autonomy&quot;, with an &quot;existence… above the practical world of the existent&quot; but, in the postmodern age, culture has been deprived of this autonomy, the cultural has expanded to consume the entire social realm so that all becomes &quot;cultural&quot;. &quot;Critical distance&quot;, the assumption that culture can be positioned outside &quot;the massive Being of capital&quot; upon which left-wing theories of cultural politics are dependent, has become outmoded. The &quot;prodigious new expansion of multinational capital ends up penetrating and colonizing those very pre-capitalist enclaves (Nature and the Unconscious) which offered extraterritorial and Archimedean footholds for critical effectivity&quot;.

=== Social sciences ===
Postmodern sociology can be said to focus on conditions of life which became increasingly prevalent in the late 20th century in the most industrialized nations, including the ubiquity of mass media and mass production, the rise of a global economy and a shift from manufacturing to service economies. Jameson and Harvey described it as consumerism, where manufacturing, distribution and dissemination have become exceptionally inexpensive but social connectedness and community have become rarer. Other thinkers assert that postmodernity is the natural reaction to mass broadcasting in a society conditioned to mass production and mass politics. The work of Alasdair MacIntyre informs the versions of postmodernism elaborated by such authors as Murphy (2003) and Bielskis (2005), for whom MacIntyre&#x27;s postmodern revision of Aristotelianism poses a challenge to the kind of consumerist ideology that now promotes capital accumulation.

The sociological view of postmodernity ascribes it to more rapid transportation, wider communication and the ability to abandon standardization of mass production, leading to a system which values a wider range of capital than previously and allows value to be stored in a greater variety of forms. Harvey argues that postmodernity is an escape from &quot;Fordism&quot;, a term coined by Antonio Gramsci to describe the mode of industrial regulation and accumulation which prevailed during the Keynesian era of economic policy in OECD countries from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Fordism for Harvey is associated with Keynesianism in that the first concerns methods of production and capital-labor relations while the latter concerns economic policy and regulation. Post-Fordism is therefore one of the basic aspects of postmodernity from Harvey&#x27;s point of view.

Artifacts of postmodernity include the dominance of television and popular culture, the wide accessibility of information and mass telecommunications. Postmodernity also exhibits a greater resistance to making sacrifices in the name of progress discernible in environmentalism and the growing importance of the anti-war movement. Postmodernity in the industrialised core is marked by increasing focus on civil rights and equal opportunity as well as movements such as feminism and multiculturalism and the backlash against these movements. The postmodern political sphere is marked by multiple arenas and possibilities of citizenship and political action concerning various forms of struggle against oppression or alienation (in collectives defined by sex or ethnicity) while the modernist political arena remains restricted to class struggle.

Theorists such as Michel Maffesoli believe that postmodernity is corroding the circumstances that provide for its subsistence and will eventually result in a decline of individualism and the birth of a new neo-Tribal era.

According to theories of postmodernity, economic and technological conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only simulacra, inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation is often cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that intersubjective, not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of discourse under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.

=== Postmodernity as a shift of epistemology ===
Another conception of postmodernity is as an epistemological shift. This perspective suggests that the way people communicate and justify knowledge (i.e. epistemology) changes in conjunction with other societal changes, that the cultural and technological changes of the 1960s and 1970s included such a shift, and that this shift should be denoted as from modernity to postmodernity. [See French (2016), French &amp; Ehrman (2016), or Sørensen (2007)].

== Criticisms ==

Criticisms of the postmodern condition can broadly be put into four categories: criticisms of postmodernity from the perspective of those who reject modernism and its offshoots, criticisms from supporters of modernism who believe that postmodernity lacks crucial characteristics of the modern project, critics from within postmodernity who seek reform or change based on their understanding of postmodernism, and those who believe that postmodernity is a passing, and not a growing, phase in social organization.

<text>A mora (plural &quot;morae&quot; or &quot;moras&quot;; often symbolized μ) is a smallest unit of timing, equal to or shorter than a syllable, that theoretically or perceptually exists in some spoken languages in which phonetic length (such as vowel length) matters significantly. For example, in the Japanese language, the name of the city &quot;Ōsaka&quot; () consists of three syllables (&quot;O-sa-ka&quot;) but four morae (), since the first syllable, &quot;Ō&quot;, is pronounced with a long vowel (the others being short). Thus, a short vowel contains one mora and is called &quot;monomoraic&quot;, while a long vowel contains two and is called &quot;bimoraic&quot;. Extra-long syllables with three morae (&quot;trimoraic&quot;) are relatively rare. Such metrics based on syllables are also referred to as syllable weight. In Japanese, certain consonants also stand on their own as individual morae and thus are monomoraic. 

The term comes from the Latin word for &#x27;linger, delay&#x27;, which was also used to translate the Greek word : (&#x27;time&#x27;) in its metrical sense.

==Formation==
The general principles for assigning moras to segments are as follows (see Hayes 1989 and Hyman 1985 for detailed discussion):

# A syllable onset (the first consonant or consonants of the syllable) does not represent any mora.
# The syllable nucleus represents one mora in the case of a short vowel, and two morae in the case of a long vowel or diphthong. Consonants serving as syllable nuclei also represent one mora if short and two if long. Slovak is an example of a language that has both long and short consonantal nuclei.
# In some languages (for example, Latin and Japanese), the coda represents one mora, and in others (for example, Irish) it does not.
# In some languages, a syllable with a long vowel or diphthong in the nucleus and one or more consonants in the coda is said to be trimoraic (syllables exhibiting pluti in Sanskrit).

In general, monomoraic syllables are called &quot;light syllables&quot;, bimoraic syllables are called &quot;heavy syllables&quot;, and trimoraic syllables (in languages that have them) are called &quot;superheavy syllables&quot;. Some languages, such as Old English and potentially present-day English, can have syllables with up to four morae.

A prosodic stress system in which moraically heavy syllables are assigned stress is said to have the property of quantity sensitivity.

==Languages==
===Ancient Greek===

For the purpose of determining accent in Ancient Greek, short vowels have one mora, and long vowels and diphthongs have two morae. Thus long &quot;ē&quot; (eta: ) can be understood as a sequence of two short vowels: &quot;ee&quot;.

Ancient Greek pitch accent is placed on only one mora in a word. An acute (, ) represents high pitch on the only mora of a short vowel or the last mora of a long vowel (&quot;é&quot;, &quot;eé&quot;). A circumflex () represents high pitch on the first mora of a long vowel (&quot;ée&quot;).

===Gilbertese===
Gilbertese, an Austronesian language spoken mainly in Kiribati, is a trimoraic language. The typical foot in Gilbertese contains three morae. These trimoraic constituents are units of stress in Gilbertese. These &quot;ternary metrical constituents of the sort found in Gilbertese are quite rare cross-linguistically, and as far as we know, Gilbertese is the only language in the world reported to have a ternary constraint on prosodic word size.&quot;

===Hawaiian===
In Hawaiian, both syllables and morae are important. Stress falls on the penultimate mora, though in words long enough to have two stresses, only the final stress is predictable. However, although a diphthong, such as &quot;oi,&quot; consists of two morae, stress may fall only on the first, a restriction not found with other vowel sequences such as &quot;io.&quot; That is, there is a distinction between &quot;oi,&quot; a bimoraic syllable, and &quot;io,&quot; which is two syllables.

===Japanese===

Most dialects of Japanese, including the standard, use morae, known in Japanese as () or (), rather than syllables, as the basis of the sound system. Writing Japanese in kana (hiragana and katakana) demonstrates a moraic system of writing. For example, in the two-syllable word &quot;&quot;, the &quot;ō&quot; is a long vowel and counts as two morae. The word is written in three symbols, , corresponding here to , each containing one mora. Therefore, the 5/7/5 pattern of the &quot;haiku&quot; in modern Japanese is of morae rather than syllables.

The Japanese syllable-final &quot;n&quot; is also moraic, as is the first part of a geminate consonant. For example, the Japanese name for &quot;Japan&quot;, , has two different pronunciations, one with three morae () and one with four (). In the hiragana spelling, the three morae of are represented by three characters (), and the four morae of need four characters to be written out as . The latter can also be analysed as , with the Q representing a full mora of silence. In this analysis, っ (the &quot;sokuon&quot;) indicates a one-mora period of silence.

Similarly, the names &quot;Tōkyō&quot; (, ), &quot;Ōsaka&quot; (, ), and &quot;Nagasaki&quot; (, ) all have four morae, even though, on this analysis, they have two, three and four syllables, respectively. The number of morae in a word is not always equal to the number of graphemes when written in kana; for example, even though it has four morae, the Japanese name for () is written with five graphemes, because one of these graphemes () represents a &quot;yōon&quot;, a feature of the Japanese writing system that indicates that the preceding consonant is palatalized.

The &quot;contracted sound&quot; () is represented by the three small kana for (), (), (). These do not represent a mora by themselves and attach to other kana; all the rest of the graphemes represent a on their own.

Most dialects of Japanese are pitch accent languages, and these pitch accents are also based on morae.

There is a unique set of known as &quot;special mora&quot; () which cannot be pronounced by itself but still counts as one mora whenever present. These consist of &quot;nasal sound&quot; () represented by the kana for &quot;n&quot; (), the &quot;geminate consonant&quot; () represented by the small tsu (), the &quot;long sound&quot; () represented by the long vowel symbol () or a single vowel which extends the sound of the previous () and the &quot;diphthong&quot; () represented by the second vowel of two consecutive vowels ().

This set also has the peculiarity that – barring only a couple of extreme examples, namely コーン茶 and チェーン店 – the drop in pitch of a word (so-called &quot;downstep&quot;) cannot come after any of these &quot;special morae&quot;, a useful tidbit for language learners trying to learn word pitch accents.

===Luganda===
In Luganda, a short vowel constitutes one mora while a long vowel constitutes two morae. A simple consonant has no morae, and a doubled or prenasalised consonant has one. No syllable may contain more than three morae. The tone system in Luganda is based on morae. See Luganda tones and Luganda grammar.

===Old English===
In Old English, short diphthongs and monophthongs were monomoraic, long diphthongs and monophthongs were bimoraic, consonants ending a syllable were each one mora, and geminate consonants added a mora to the preceding syllable. If Modern English is analyzed in terms of morae at all, which is contentious, the rules would be similar, except that all diphthongs would be considered bimoraic. Probably in Old English, like in Modern English, syllables could not have more than four morae, with loss of sounds occurring if a syllable would have more than four otherwise. In the Old English period, all content words (as well as stressed monosyllables) had to be at least two morae long.

===Sanskrit===
In Sanskrit, the mora is expressed as the . For example, the short vowel &quot;a&quot; (pronounced like a schwa) is assigned a value of one , the long vowel is assigned a value of two s, and the compound vowel (diphthong) &quot;ai&quot; (which has either two simple short vowels, &quot;a&quot;+&quot;i&quot;, or one long and one short vowel, &quot;ā&quot;+&quot;i&quot;) is assigned a value of two s. In addition, there is (trimoraic) and (&#x27;long &#x27; = quadrimoraic).

Sanskrit prosody and metrics have a deep history of taking into account moraic weight, as it were, rather than straight syllables, divided into (, &#x27;light&#x27;) and / (/, &#x27;heavy&#x27;) feet based on how many morae can be isolated in each word. Thus, for example, the word (), meaning &#x27;agent&#x27; or &#x27;doer&#x27;, does not contain simply two syllabic units, but contains rather, in order, a / foot and a foot. The reason is that the conjoined consonants &quot;rt&quot; render the normally light &quot;ka&quot; syllable heavy.

<doc id="196567" wikidata="Q852466" url="?curid=196567" title="Coda (music)">
<text>In music, a coda (; ; plural ) is a passage that brings a piece (or a movement) to an end. It may be as simple as a few measures, or as complex as an entire section.

==In classical music==

The presence of a coda as a structural element in a movement is especially clear in works written in particular musical forms. Codas were commonly used in both sonata form and variation movements during the Classical era. In a sonata form movement, the recapitulation section will, in general, follow the exposition in its thematic content, while adhering to the home key. The recapitulation often ends with a passage that sounds like a termination, paralleling the music that ended the exposition; thus, any music coming after this termination will be perceived as extra material, i.e., as a coda. In works in variation form, the coda occurs following the last variation and will be very noticeable as the first music not based on the theme.

One of the ways that Beethoven extended and intensified Classical practice was to expand the coda sections, producing a final section sometimes of equal musical weight to the foregoing exposition, development, and recapitulation sections and completing the musical argument. For one famous example, see the finale of Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven).

===Musical purpose===
Charles Burkhart suggests that the reason codas are common, even necessary, is that, in the climax of the main body of a piece, a &quot;particularly effortful passage&quot;, often an expanded phrase, is often created by &quot;working an idea through to its structural conclusions&quot; and that, after all this momentum is created, a coda is required to &quot;look back&quot; on the main body, allow listeners to &quot;take it all in&quot;, and &quot;create a sense of balance.&quot;

===Codetta===
Codetta (Italian for &quot;little tail&quot;, the diminutive form) has a similar purpose to the coda, but on a smaller scale, concluding a section of a work instead of the work as a whole. A typical codetta concludes the exposition and recapitulation sections of a work in sonata form, following the second (modulated) theme, or the closing theme (if there is one). Thus, in the exposition, it usually appears in the secondary key, but, in the recapitulation, in the primary key. The codetta ordinarily closes with a perfect cadence in the appropriate key, confirming the tonality. If the exposition is repeated, the codetta is likewise repeated. Sometimes it has its ending slightly changed, depending on whether it leads back to the exposition or into the development sections.

==History==
Cauda, a Latin word meaning &quot;tail&quot;, &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;trail&quot; is the root of &quot;coda&quot; and is used in the study of conductus of the 12th and 13th centuries. The cauda was a long melisma on one of the last syllables of the text, repeated in each strophe. Conducti were traditionally divided into two groups, &quot;conductus cum cauda&quot; and &quot;conductus sine cauda&quot; (Latin: &quot;conductus with cauda&quot;, &quot;conductus without cauda&quot;), based on the presence of the melisma. Thus, the cauda provided a conclusionary role, similar to the modern coda.

==In popular music==
Many songs in rock and other genres of popular music have sections identifiable as codas. A coda in these genres is sometimes referred to as an &quot;outro&quot;, while in jazz, modern church music and barbershop arranging it is commonly called a &quot;tag&quot;. One of the most famous codas is found in the 1968 single &quot;Hey Jude&quot; by the Beatles. The coda lasted nearly four minutes, making the song&#x27;s full length at just over the seven-minute mark.

==In music notation==
In music notation, the coda symbol, which resembles a set of crosshairs, is used as a navigation marker, similar to the &quot;dal segno&quot; sign. It is used where the exit from a repeated section is within that section rather than at the end. The instruction &quot;To Coda&quot; indicates that, upon reaching that point during the final repetition, the performer is to jump immediately to the separate section headed with the coda symbol. The symbol can be used to provide a special ending for the final verse of a song.

The &quot;coda&quot; sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D10C MUSICAL SYMBOL CODA: 𝄌

<doc id="196570" wikidata="Q1079206" url="?curid=196570" title="Christian Coalition of America">
<text>The Christian Coalition of America (CCA), a 501(c)(4) organization, is the successor to the original Christian Coalition created in 1987 by religious broadcaster and former presidential candidate Marion Gordon &quot;Pat&quot; Robertson. This US Christian advocacy group includes members of various Christian denominations, including Baptists (50%), mainline Protestants (25%), Roman Catholics (16%), and Pentecostals (10% to 12%) among communicants of other churches.

== History ==

===Formation===
On April 30, 1987, the Christian Coalition was incorporated in Richmond, Virginia. The following year, after a well-funded but unsuccessful campaign for President, Pat Robertson, a religious broadcaster and political commentator, used the remainder of his campaign resources to jump-start the formation of the Christian Coalition&#x27;s voter-mobilization effort. &quot;Americans for Robertson&quot; accumulated a mailing list of several million conservative Christians interested in politics. This mailing provided the basis of the new organization.

The coalition had four original directors: Robertson, his son Gordon Robertson, Dick Weinhold, head of the Texas organization, and, Billy McCormack, pastor of the University Worship Center in Shreveport, Louisiana. McCormack had headed the Louisiana division of &quot;Americans for Robertson&quot; in 1988 and was also the vice president of the coalition.

After its founding, the Christian Coalition applied to become a tax-exempt charitable organization with the Internal Revenue Service. Forty-nine state chapters formed as independent corporations within their states, including the Christian Coalition of Texas. A handful, including the Christian Coalition of Texas, successfully obtained tax-exempt status as social-welfare organizations. After ten years, the Internal Revenue Service declined the Christian Coalition&#x27;s application for charitable status because it engaged in political activities. In response, the Christian Coalition of Texas was renamed the Christian Coalition of America, and the organization relocated in order to work nationwide.

===Voter guides===
In 1990, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia, began producing non-partisan voter guides which it distributed to conservative Christian churches. Complaints that the voter guides were partisan led to the denial by the IRS of the Christian Coalition, Inc.&#x27;s tax-exempt status in 1999. Later that same year, the coalition prevailed in its five-year defense of a lawsuit brought by the Federal Election Commission.

Ralph Reed, an Emory University Ph.D. candidate, whom Robertson had met when the younger man was working as a waiter at an inaugural dinner for George H. W. Bush in January 1989, took control of day-to-day operations of the coalition in 1989 as its founding executive director. He remained in the post until August 1997 when he left to enter partisan political consulting, founding his new firm Century Strategies, based near Atlanta, Georgia.

===Political involvement===
Robertson served as the organization&#x27;s president from its founding until June 1997, when President Reagan&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary Donald P. Hodel was named president of the CCA, and former U.S. Representative Randy Tate (R-WA) was named executive director. Upon announcement of Hodel becoming president of the CCA, Robertson expressed a desire to serve the grassroots activists that made up the coalition.

Grover Norquist, Washington insider, president of Americans for Tax Reform, and an old Reed ally, said of the appointments: &quot;What you&#x27;ve got is Reagan and Gingrich. Hodel is a Reagan Republican and Tate is a Gingrich Republican.&quot;

Late in 1997 the CCA was ranked by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as the 7th most powerful political organization in America.

After a disagreement with Robertson, Hodel left in January 1999 and Tate soon followed. Robertson took over the presidency. Later in 2001 he turned it and the chairmanship over to Roberta Combs, the group&#x27;s executive vice president and former state chairman of South Carolina, when he officially left the coalition.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, the coalition moved from Chesapeake, Virginia, to a large office on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Combs is the current president and CEO of the Christian Coalition of America. She is a founding state director and has been the only woman on the board of directors in the history of the Christian Coalition of America. Since moving to the capital, Combs installed members of her family as high-ranking officials in the group, including her daughter Michele Ammons and son-in-law Tracy Ammons. Michele and Tracy Ammons later divorced. Combs fired her former son-in-law Tracy Ammons after her daughter received a judgement against him for alimony and child support. Combs had filed an affidavit on her behalf on Coalition letterhead.

Combs canceled a direct-mail fund-raising campaign run by fund-raiser Bill Sidebottom of Interact Response Communications aimed at fighting child pornography after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The cancellation of the campaign in the middle of its run led to nearly a dozen lawsuits by creditors and the bankruptcy of its fund-raising company. Without a fund-raising company supporting it, the Christian Coalition went into sharp decline financially.

In March 2001, the Christian Coalition of America was sued by its African-American employees, who alleged racial discrimination. The District Court issued an injunction against the Christian Coalition. The case was settled and the African-American plaintiffs received a payment.

In November 2002, Combs downsized the staff and moved the organization&#x27;s offices from Washington, D.C., to a suburb of Charleston, South Carolina. The coalition reduced its lobbyists in Washington from a dozen to one. The Christian Coalition was later sued for $1,890 by Reese &amp; Sons Enterprises of Maryland, the moving company it used for transporting its goods to South Carolina, because of failure to pay the wrapping and packing fee. The coalition lost in court in Richmond, Virginia, and finally paid the movers.

Other reported debts have been $69,729 owed to its longtime law firm, Huff, Poole &amp; Mahoney PC of Virginia Beach, and Global Direct, a fundraising firm in Oklahoma, sued for $87,000 in expenses.
From the time Robertson left the group in 2001 until 2006, the coalition&#x27;s influence greatly declined. Revenue declined from a high of $26.5 million in 1996 to $1.3 million in 2004. The organization&#x27;s 2004 income tax return showed the Christian Coalition to be technically bankrupt, with debts exceeding assets by more than $2 million.

In 2005, the coalition finally concluded a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, ending its long-running battle with that agency regarding its tax exempt status. As a result, the IRS has recognized the coalition as a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization, the first time in the agency&#x27;s history that it has granted a letter of exemption to a group that stated in its application that it would distribute voter guides directly in churches. The consent decree enforces limitations on the terminology that may be used in the coalition&#x27;s voter guides.

In late 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Christian Coalition was unable to pay its office postage bill to Pitney Bowes. In addition, it had not paid new lawyers in Virginia Beach; the law firm sued the coalition.

In March 2006, the Christian Coalition of Iowa renamed itself the Iowa Christian Alliance. In splitting from the national group, the Iowa Christian Alliance cited &quot;the current problems facing the Christian Coalition of America&quot;. In August 2006, the Christian Coalition of Alabama split from the national group. It later renamed itself Christian Action Alabama.

In November 2006, the president-elect of the Christian Coalition of America resigned his post, citing a difference in philosophy over which issues the organization should embrace. Reverend Joel Hunter, currently the senior pastor of the Northland Church in Longwood, Florida, was to assume the presidency in January. However, Hunter stated the coalition&#x27;s leaders resisted his calls to expand their issue base, saying it would not expand the agenda beyond opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. Hunter also said he wanted to focus on rebuilding the coalition&#x27;s once powerful grassroots, an appeal he says board members rejected. &quot;After initial willingness to consider these changes, the board of the CCA decided, &#x27;that is fine, but that is not who we are&#x27;&quot;, Hunter said. Combs continues as the coalition&#x27;s president.

As of December 31, 2018, the Christian Coalition reported that it had $274,920 of cash on hand, and that it owed $39,367. During 2018, it received $766,799 of contributions, and it had spent $133,000 on management; $7,500 on advertisement and promotion; $162,000 on conferences, conventions, and meetings; $29,500 on affiliate payments; and $133,418 on other expenses.

<doc id="196573" wikidata="Q4639180" url="?curid=196573" title="4th Armored Division (United States)">
<text>The 4th Armored Division was an armored division of the United States Army that earned distinction while spearheading General Patton&#x27;s Third Army in the European theater of World War II.

The 4th Armored Division, unlike most other U.S. armored divisions during World War II, did not officially adopt a nickname for the division during the war. However, their unofficial nickname &quot;Name Enough&quot; came into use postwar; the division commander having said, &quot;Fourth Armored Division was name enough&quot;; &quot;They shall be known by their deeds alone.&quot; The 4th was named the &quot;Breakthrough&quot; division in 1954, but that name was eventually discontinued.

==History==
The 4th Armored Division was activated during World War II on 15 April 1941 with 3,800 men (10,000 by the end of May 1941) from various other units, at Pine Camp (Camp Drum, 1951; Fort Drum, 1974), New York under its first Commanding General, Brigadier General Henry W. Baird.

===World War II===
The division was organized as a full Armored Division in May and June 1942 under the command of Major General John Shirley Wood. It left Pine Camp for Camp Forrest for the Tennessee maneuvers in the Cumberland Mountains held in September and October. In mid-November, it was transferred to the Camp Ibis Desert Training Center (DTC) in the California-Arizona maneuver area and was the first Armored Division to occupy Camp Ibis near Needles, California in the Mojave Desert, which was close to the Arizona and Nevada borders. On 3 June, the 4th AD arrived at Camp Bowie, Texas, an armored training center located in central Texas near Brownwood, for more maneuvers until about December when it departed for Camp Myles Standish in Massachusetts for winter training. On 29 December, the 4th AD departed Boston to conduct training in England in preparation for the invasion of Normandy.

====France====

After training in England from January to July 1944, the 4th Armored Division landed at Utah Beach, on 11 July, over a month after the initial Normandy landings, and first entered combat on 17 July; on 28 July, battle action as part of the VIII Corps exploitation force for Operation Cobra, the 4th AD secured the Coutances area. The 4th AD then swung south to take Nantes, cutting off the Brittany Peninsula, 12 August 1944. Turning east, it drove swiftly across France north of the Loire, smashed across the Moselle 11–13 September, flanked Nancy and captured Lunéville, 16 September. The 4th AD fought several German panzergrenadier brigades in the Lorraine area including the SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 49 and SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 51 at this time, defeating a larger German force through superior tactics and training.

After maintaining a defensive line, Chambrey to Xanrey to Hénaménil, from 27 September to 11 October, the 4th AD rested briefly before returning to combat 9 November with an attack in the vicinity of Viviers. The 4th AD cleared Bois de Serres, 12 November, advanced through Dieuze and crossed the Saar River, 21–22 November, to establish and expand bridgehead and took Singling and Bining, then Baerendorf 24 November, before being relieved 8 December.

The 4th Armored Division received the following unit awards from France: Croix de Guerre with Palm (27–29 July 1944), Croix de Guerre with Palm (12–29 September 1944), and French Fourragere in the colors of the Croix de Guerre.

====Battle of the Bulge====
Two days after the Germans launched their Ardennes Offensive, the 4th AD entered the fight (18 December 1944), racing northwest into Belgium, covering 150 miles in 19 hours. The 4th AD, spearheading Patton&#x27;s Third Army, attacked the Germans at Bastogne and, on 26 December, Brigadier General Herbert L. Earnest&#x27;s Combat Command A led the column that relieved Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, with Company C, 37th Tank Battalion in the vanguard. to break through at Bastogne and relieve the besieged 101st Airborne Division. Six weeks later the 4th AD jumped off from Luxembourg City in an eastward plunge that carried it across the Moselle River at Trier, south, and east to Worms, and across the Rhine, 24–25 March 1945. Advancing all night, the 4th AD crossed the Main River the next day, south of Hanau, and continued to push on. Lauterbach fell 29 March, Creuzburg across the Werra on 1 April, Gotha on 4 April – where the 4th AD liberated Ohrdruf concentration camp, the first Nazi camp liberated by U.S. troops. By 12 April the 4th AD was across the Saale River. Pursuit of the enemy continued, and by 6 May the division had crossed into Czechoslovakia and established a bridgehead across the Otava River at Strakonice, with forwarding elements at Písek. The 4th AD was reassigned to the XII Corps on 30 April 1945. The 4th AD received the following Letter of Commendation:
To: Maj. Gen. Hugh J. Gaffey
&quot;The outstanding celerity of your movement and the unremitting, vicious and skillful manner in which you pushed the attack, terminating at the end of four days and nights of incessant battle in the relief of Bastogne, constitutes one of the finest chapters in the glorious history of the United States Army. You and the officers and men of your command are hereby commended for a superior performance.&quot;


The 4th AD&#x27;s second commander, Major General John Shirley Wood, (known as &quot;P&quot; Wood to his contemporaries, the &quot;P&quot; standing for &quot;Professor&quot;, and &quot;Tiger Jack&quot; to his men) who took over the division officially on 18 June 1942, trained the 4th Armored Division for two years before he personally led it into combat in France, on 28 July 1944, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. On 1 August, Gen. George Patton&#x27;s U.S. Third Army became operational and the 4th AD became the spearhead of the Third Army. The British military armor theorist and historian, Capt. Basil Henry Liddell Hart, once referred to General Wood as &quot;the Rommel of the American armored forces.&quot; Like Rommel, Wood commanded from the front, and preferred staying on the offensive, using speed and envelopment tactics to confuse the enemy. General Wood often utilized a light Piper Cub liaison aircraft flown by his personal pilot, Maj. Charles &quot;Bazooka Charlie&quot; Carpenter, to keep up with his rapidly moving division, sometimes personally carrying corps orders from headquarters directly to his advancing armored columns.

On 3 December 1944, General Wood was relieved as division commander. The division was then led by Major General Hugh Gaffey through the Battle of the Bulge until March 23, when Brigadier General William M. Hoge was awarded command. Major General Fay B. Prickett commanded during the occupation period. Major General Archibald R. Kennedy commanded the division after the war.

Among the most famous members of the 4th AD during World War II was Creighton Abrams, who commanded the 37th Tank Battalion. Abrams later rose to command all U.S. forces in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War and served as Army Chief of Staff in the 1970s. The M-1 tank is named after him. Abrams&#x27; friend, Harold Cohen, commanded the 10th Armored Infantry Battalion and fought in concert with Abrams&#x27; tanks.

===Post-war===

The division remained as occupation forces in Germany after redesignation as the First Constabulary Brigade. In 1949, it was redesignated back to 4th Armored Division and inactivated on 20 May 1949.

The 4th AD was reactivated on 15 June 1954 at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas with the name 4th Armored &quot;Breakthrough&quot; Division (&quot;Breakthrough&quot; was discontinued some years afterwards). In late 1957, the 4th AD was rotated to West Germany as part of Operation Gyroscope, replacing the 2nd Armored Division. Cooke Barracks in Göppingen served as the division headquarters. 

Combat Command &quot;A&quot; was located at Wiley Barracks, New Ulm. It comprised 2d Medium Tank Battalion (MTB), 66th Armor (Leipheim); 2d Armored Rifle Battalion (ARB), 41st Infantry (Neu Ulm); and 2d Armored Rifle Battalion, 51st Infantry. Combat Command &quot;B&quot; was at Ferris Barracks, Erlangen, comprising the 1st MTB, 35th Armor (Ferris Barracks); 2d MTB, 67th Armor (Fürth); 2d ARB, 50th Infantry (Ferris Barracks); and 2d Reconnaissance Squadron, 15th Cavalry. Combat Command &quot;C&quot; was at McKee Barracks, Crailsheim. It comprised 1st MTB, 37th Armor (McKee Barracks) and 1st ARB, 54th Infantry.

The 4th AD remained in Germany until final inactivation in May 1971, when it was reflagged as the 1st Armored Division.

<doc id="196576" wikidata="Q185063" url="?curid=196576" title="Warring States period">
<text>The Warring States period in Chinese history (221 BC) comprises the final centuries of the Zhou dynasty (256 BC), which were characterized by warfare, bureaucratic and military reform, and political consolidation. It followed the Spring and Autumn period and concluded with the wars of conquest that saw the state of Qin annex each of the other contender states by 221 BC and found the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynastic state in East Asian history.

While scholars have identified several different dates as marking the beginning of the Warring States period, Sima Qian&#x27;s choice of 475 BC is the most often cited. The era largely corresponds to the second half of the Eastern Zhou period, where the king of Zhou formally ruled as Chinese sovereign, but had lost political power and functioned in practice as a figurehead. This dynamic served as the backdrop for the machinations of the eponymous Warring States. The label &quot;Warring States period&quot; derives from the &quot;Record of the Warring States&quot;, a work of history compiled during the early Han dynasty (202 BC220 AD).

==Geography==

The political geography of the era was dominated by the Seven Warring States, namely:
*Qin located in the far west, with its core in the Wei River Valley and Guanzhong. This geographical position offered protection from the other states but limited its initial influence.
*The Three Jins located in the center on the Shanxi plateau were the three successor states of Jin. These were:
**Han south, along the Yellow River, controlling the approaches to Qin.
**Wei located in the middle, roughly today&#x27;s eastern Henan Province. 
**Zhao the northernmost of the three, roughly today&#x27;s southern Hebei Province as well as northern Shanxi Province.
*Qi east, centered on the Shandong Peninsula
*Chu south, with its core territory around the valleys of the Han River and, later, the Yangtze River.
*Yan northeast, centered on modern-day Beijing. Late in the period it pushed northeast and began to occupy the Liaodong Peninsula

Besides these seven major states other smaller states survived into the period. They include:
*Royal territory of the Zhou king was near Luoyi in the Han area on the Yellow River.
*Yue On the southeast coast near Shanghai was the State of Yue, which was highly active in the late Spring and Autumn era but was later annexed by Chu. 
*Zhongshan between the states of Zhao and Yan was the state of Zhongshan, which was eventually annexed by Zhao in 296 BC.
*Sichuan states: In the far southwest were the non-Zhou states of Ba (east) and Shu (west). These ancient kingdoms were conquered by Qin later in the period.
*Other minor states: There were many minor states which were satellites of the larger ones until they were absorbed. Many were in the Central Plains between the three Jins (west) and Qi (east) and Chu to the south. Some of the more important ones were Song, Lu, Zheng, Wey, Teng, Yue and Zou.

==Periodisation==

The eastward flight of the Zhou court in 771 BC marks the start of the Spring and Autumn period. No one single incident or starting point inaugurated the Warring States era. The political situation of the period represented a culmination of historical trends of conquest and annexation which also characterised the Spring and Autumn period. As a result, there is some controversy as to the beginning of the era. Proposed starting points include:

* 481 BCProposed by Song-era historian Lü Zuqian, since this year marks the end of the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;.
* 476–475 BCSima Qian, author of the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (), chose this date as the inaugural year of King Yuan of Zhou.
* 453 BC BCThe Partition of Jin saw the formation of Han, Zhao, and Wei, three of the seven warring states.
* 441 BCThe inaugural year of Zhou Kings starting with King Ai of Zhou.
* 403 BCThe year when the Zhou court officially recognised Han, Zhao and Wei as states. Sima Guang, author of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; (1084) advocates this date as symbolic of eroded Zhou authority.

The Eastern Zhou dynasty began its fall around 5th century BC. As their influence waned, they had to rely on armies in allied states rather than their own military force. Hundreds of smaller polities coalesced into seven major states which included: Chu, Han, Qin, Wei, Yan, Qi and Zhao. However, there eventually was a shift in alliances because each state&#x27;s ruler wanted independence. This caused hundreds of wars between 535 and 286 BC. The victorious state would have overall rule and control in China.

The system of feudal states created by the Western Zhou dynasty underwent enormous changes after 771 BC with the flight of the Zhou court to modern-day Luoyang and the diminution of its relevance and power. The Spring and Autumn period led to a few states gaining power at the expense of many others, the latter no longer able to depend on central authority for legitimacy or protection. During the Warring States period, many rulers claimed the Mandate of Heaven to justify their conquest of other states and spread their influence.

The struggle for hegemony eventually created a state system dominated by several large states, such as Jin, Chu, Qin, Yan, and Qi, while the smaller states of the Central Plain tended to be their satellites and tributaries. Other major states also existed, such as Wu and Yue in the southeast. The last decades of the Spring and Autumn era were marked by increased stability, as the result of peace negotiations between Jin and Chu which established their respective spheres of influence. This situation ended with the partition of Jin, whereby the state was divided between the houses of Han, Zhao and Wei, leading to the seven major warring states.

====Partition of Jin (453–403 BC)====
The rulers of Jin had steadily lost political powers since the middle of the 6th century BC to their nominally subordinate nobles and military commanders, a situation arising from the traditions of the Jin which forbade the enfeoffment of relatives of the ducal house. This allowed other clans to gain fiefs and military authority, and decades of internecine struggle led to the establishment of four major families, the Han, Zhao, Wei and Zhi.

The Battle of Jinyang saw the allied Han, Zhao and Wei destroy the Zhi family (453 BC) and their lands were distributed among them. With this, they became the de facto rulers of most of Jin&#x27;s territory, though this situation would not be officially recognised until half a century later. The Jin division created a political vacuum that enabled during the first 50 years expansion of Chu and Yue northward and Qi southward. Qin increased its control of the local tribes and began its expansion southwest to Sichuan.

===Early Warring States===
====The three Jins recognized (403–364 BC)====
In 403 BC, the court of King Weilie of Zhou officially recognized Zhao, Wei and Han as immediate vassals, thereby raising them to the same rank as the other warring states.

From before 405 until 383 BC the three Jins were united under the leadership of Wei and expanded in all directions. The most important figure was Marquess Wen of Wei (445–396 BC). In 408–406 BC he conquered the State of Zhongshan to the northeast on the other side of Zhao. At the same time he pushed west across the Yellow River to the Luo River taking the area of Xihe (literally &#x27;west of the [Yellow] river&#x27;).

The growing power of Wei caused Zhao to back away from the alliance. In 383 BC it moved its capital to Handan and attacked the small state of Wey. Wey appealed to Wei which attacked Zhao on the western side. Being in danger, Zhao called in Chu. As usual, Chu used this as a pretext to annex territory to its north, but the diversion allowed Zhao to occupy a part of Wei. This conflict marked the end of the power of the united Jins and the beginning a period of shifting alliances and wars on several fronts.

In 376 BC, the states of Han, Wei and Zhao deposed Duke Jing of Jin and divided the last remaining Jin territory between themselves, which marked the final end of the Jin state.

In 370 BC, Marquess Wu of Wei died without naming a successor, which led to a war of succession. After three years of civil war, Zhao from the north and Han from the south invaded Wei. On the verge of conquering Wei, the leaders of Zhao and Han fell into disagreement about what to do with Wei, and both armies abruptly retreated. As a result, King Hui of Wei (still a Marquess at the time) was able to ascend the throne of Wei.

Zhao extended from the Shanxi plateau across the plain to the borders of Qi. Wei reached east to Qi, Lu, and Song. To the south, the weaker state of Han held the east–west part of the Yellow River valley, surrounded the Zhou royal domain at Luoyang and held an area north of Luoyang called Shangdang.

====Qi resurgence under Tian (379–340 BC)====
Duke Kang of Qi died in 379 BC with no heir from the house of Jiang, which had ruled Qi since the state&#x27;s founding. The throne instead passed to the future King Wei, from the house of Tian. The Tian had been very influential at court towards the end of Jiang rule, and now openly assumed power.

The new ruler set about reclaiming territories that had been lost to other states. He launched a successful campaign against Zhao, Wey and Wei, once again extending Qi territory to the Great Wall. Sima Qian writes that the other states were so awestruck that nobody dared attack Qi for more than 20 years. The demonstrated military prowess also had a calming effect on Qi&#x27;s own population, which experienced great domestic tranquility during Wei&#x27;s reign.

By the end of King Wei&#x27;s reign, Qi had become the strongest of the states and proclaimed itself &quot;king&quot;; establishing independence from the Zhou dynasty (see below).

====Wars of Wei====
King Hui of Wei (370–319 BC) set about restoring the state. In 362–359 BC he exchanged territories with Han and Zhao in order to make the boundaries of the three states more rational.

In 364 BC, Wei was defeated by Qin at the Battle of Shimen and was only saved by the intervention of Zhao. Qin won another victory in 362 BC. In 361 BC the Wei capital was moved east to Daliang to be out of the reach of Qin.

In 354 BC, King Hui of Wei started a large-scale attack on Zhao. By 353 BC, Zhao was losing badly and its capital, Handan, was under siege. The state of Qi intervened. The famous Qi strategist, Sun Bin the great-great-great-grandson of Sun Tzu, the author of the &quot;Art of War&quot;, proposed to attack the Wei capital while the Wei army was tied up besieging Zhao. The strategy was a success; the Wei army hastily moved south to protect its capital, was caught on the road and decisively defeated at the Battle of Guiling. The battle is remembered in the second of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, &quot;besiege Wei, save Zhao&quot;—meaning to attack a vulnerable spot to relieve pressure at another point.

Domestically, King Hui patronized philosophy and the arts, and is perhaps best remembered for hosting the Confucian philosopher Mencius at his court; their conversations form the first two chapters of the book which bears Meng Zi&#x27;s name.

===Dukes become kings===
====Qi and Wei became kingdoms (344 BC)====
The title of king (&quot;wang&quot;, ) was held by figurehead rulers of the Zhou dynasty, while the rulers of most states held the title of duke (&quot;gong&quot;, ) or marquess (&quot;hou&quot;, ). A major exception was Chu, whose rulers were called kings since King Wu of Chu started using the title .

In 344 BC the rulers of Qi and Wei mutually recognized each other as kings: King Wei of Qi and King Hui of Wei, in effect declaring their independence from the Zhou court. This marked a major turning point: unlike those in the Spring and Autumn period, the new generation of rulers ascending the thrones in the Warring States period would not entertain even the pretence of being vassals of the Zhou dynasty, instead proclaiming themselves fully independent kingdoms.

====Shang Yang reforms Qin (356–338 BC)====

During the early Warring States period Qin generally avoided conflicts with the other states. This changed during the reign of Duke Xiao, when prime minister Shang Yang made centralizing and authoritarian reforms in accordance with his Legalist philosophy between the years 356 and 338 BC.

Shang introduced land reforms, privatized land, rewarded farmers who exceeded harvest quotas, enslaved farmers who failed to meet quotas, and used enslaved subjects as rewards for those who met government policies. As manpower was short in Qin relative to the other states at the time, Shang enacted policies to increase its manpower. As Qin peasants were recruited into the military, he encouraged active immigration of peasants from other states into Qin as a replacement workforce; this policy simultaneously increased the manpower of Qin and weakened the manpower of Qin&#x27;s rivals.

Shang made laws forcing citizens to marry at a young age and passed tax laws to encourage raising multiple children. He also enacted policies to free convicts who worked in opening wastelands for agriculture. Shang abolished primogeniture and created a double tax on households that had more than one son living in the household, to break up large clans into nuclear families. Shang also moved the capital to reduce the influence of nobles on the administration.

The rise of Qin was recognized by the royal court, and in 343 BC the king conferred the title of Count (伯 Bó) on Duke Xiao. As was customary, a conference was hosted which the feudal lords attended, and during which the Son of Heaven bestowed the title.

After the reforms Qin became much more aggressive. In 340 Qin took land from Wèi after it had been defeated by Qi. In 316 Qin conquered Shu and Ba in Sichuan to the southwest. Development of this area took a long time but slowly added greatly to Qin&#x27;s wealth and power.

====Qin defeats Wei (341–340 BC)====
In 341 BC, Wei attacked Han. Qi allowed Han to be nearly defeated and then intervened. The generals from the Battle of Guiling met again (Sun Bin and Tian Ji versus Pang Juan), using the same tactic, attacking Wei&#x27;s capital. Sun Bin feigned a retreat and then turned on the overconfident Wei troops and decisively defeated them at the Battle of Maling. After the battle all three of the Jin successor states appeared before King Xuan of Qi, pledging their loyalty.

In the following year Qin attacked the weakened Wei. Wei was devastatingly defeated and ceded a large part of its territory in return for truce. With Wei severely weakened, Qi and Qin became the dominant states in China.

Wei came to rely on Qi for protection, with King Hui of Wei meeting King Xuan of Qi on two occasions. After Hui&#x27;s death, his successor King Xiang also established a good relationship with his Qi counterpart, with both promising to recognize the other as &quot;king&quot;.

====Chu conquers Yue (334 BC)====


Early in the Warring States period, Chu was one of the strongest states in China. The state rose to a new level of power around 389 BC when King Dao of Chu () named the famous reformer Wu Qi as his chancellor.

Chu rose to its peak in 334 BC, when it conquered Yue to its east on the Pacific coast. The series of events leading up to this began when Yue prepared to attack Qi to its north. The King of Qi sent an emissary who persuaded the King of Yue to attack Chu instead. Yue initiated a large-scale attack at Chu but was defeated by Chu&#x27;s counter-attack. Chu then proceeded to conquer Yue.

====Qin, Han and Yan became kingdoms (325–323 BC)====
King Xian of Zhou had attempted to use what little royal prerogative he had left by appointing the dukes Xian (384–362 BC), Xiao (361–338 BC) and Hui (338–311 BC) of Qin as hegemons, thereby in theory making Qin the chief ally of the court.

However, in 325 the confidence of Duke Hui grew so great that he proclaimed himself &quot;king&quot; of Qin; adopting the same title as the king of Zhou and thereby effectively proclaiming independence from the Zhou dynasty. King Hui of Qin was guided by his prime minister Zhang Yi, a prominent representative of the School of Diplomacy.

He was followed in 323 BC by King Xuanhui of Han and King Yi of Yan, as well as King Cuo of the minor state Zhongshan. In 318 BC even the ruler of Song, a relatively minor state, declared himself king. Uniquely, while King Wuling of Zhao had joined the other kings in declaring himself king, he retracted this order in 318 BC, after Zhao suffered a great defeat at the hands of Qin.

====Partition of Zhou (314 BC)====
King Kao of Zhou had enfeoffed his younger brother as Duke Huan of Henan. Three generations later, this cadet branch of the royal house began calling themselves &quot;dukes of East Zhou&quot;.

Upon the ascension of King Nan in 314, East Zhou became an independent state. The king came to reside in what became known as West Zhou.

===Horizontal and vertical alliances (334–249 BC)===
Towards the end of the Warring States period, the state of Qin became disproportionately powerful compared with the other six states. As a result, the policies of the six states became overwhelmingly oriented towards dealing with the Qin threat, with two opposing schools of thought. One school advocated a &#x27;vertical&#x27; or north–south alliance called () in which the states would ally with each other to repel Qin. The other advocated a &#x27;horizontal&#x27; or east–west alliance called (), in which a state would ally with Qin to participate in its ascendancy.

There were some initial successes in , though mutual suspicions between allied states led to the breakdown of such alliances. Qin repeatedly exploited the horizontal alliance strategy to defeat the states one by one. During this period, many philosophers and tacticians travelled around the states, recommending that the rulers put their respective ideas into use. These &quot;lobbyists&quot;, such as Su Qin, who advocated vertical alliances, and Zhang Yi, who advocated horizontal alliances, were famous for their tact and intellect, and were collectively known as the School of Diplomacy, whose Chinese name ( &#x27;the school of the vertical and horizontal&#x27;) was derived from the two opposing ideas.

====Su Qin and the first vertical alliance (334–300 BC)====
Beginning in 334 BC the diplomat Su Qin spent years visiting the courts of Yan, Zhao, Han, Wei, Qi and Chu and persuaded them to form a united front against Qin. In 318 BC all states except Qi launched a joint attack on Qin, which was not successful.

King Hui of Qin died in 311 BC, followed by prime minister Zhang Yi one year later. The new monarch, King Wu, reigned only four years before dying without legitimate heirs. Some damaging turbulence ensued throughout 307 BC before a son of King Hui by a concubine (i.e. a younger half-brother of King Wu) could be established as King Zhao, who in stark contrast to his predecessor went on to rule for an unprecedented 53 years.

After the failure of the first vertical alliance, Su Qin eventually came to live in Qi, where he was favored by King Xuan and drew the envy of the ministers. An assassination attempt in 300 BC left Su mortally wounded but not dead. Sensing death approaching, he advised the newly crowned King Min have him publicly executed to draw out the assassins. King Min complied with Su&#x27;s request and killed him, putting an end to the first generation of Vertical alliance thinkers.

====The first horizontal alliance (300–287 BC)====

King Min of Qi came to be highly influenced by Lord Mengchang, a grandson of the former King Wei of Qi. Lord Mengchang made a westward alliance with the states of Wei and Han. In the far west, Qin, which had been weakened by a succession struggle in 307, yielded to the new coalition and appointed Lord Mengchang its chief minister. The alliance between Qin and Qi was sealed by a Qin princess marrying King Min. This &quot;horizontal&quot; or east–west alliance might have secured peace except that it excluded the State of Zhao.

Around 299 BC, the ruler of Zhao became the last of the seven major states to proclaim himself &quot;king&quot;.

In 298 BC, Zhao offered Qin an alliance and Lord Mengchang was driven out of Qin. The remaining three allies, Qi, Wei and Han, attacked Qin, driving up the Yellow River below Shanxi to the Hangu Pass. After 3 years of fighting they took the pass and forced Qin to return territory to Han and Wei. They next inflicted major defeats on Yan and Chu. During the 5-year administration of Lord Mengchang, Qi was the major power in China.

In 294, Lord Mengchang was implicated in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and fled to Wei. His alliance system collapsed.
Qi and Qin made a truce and pursued their own interests. Qi moved south against the state of Song whilst the Qin General Bai Qi pushed back eastward against a Han/Wei alliance, gaining victory at the Battle of Yique.

In 288, King Zhao of Qin and King Min of Qi took the title &quot;di&quot; ( &#x27;emperor&#x27;), of the west and east respectively. They swore a covenant and started planning an attack on Zhao.

====Su Dai and the second vertical alliance====
In 287 BC the strategist Su Dai, younger brother of Su Qin and possibly an agent of Yan, persuaded King Min that the Zhao war would only benefit Qin. King Min agreed and formed a &#x27;vertical&#x27; alliance with the other states against Qin. Qin backed off, abandoned the presumptuous title of &quot;Di&quot;, and restored territory to Wei and Zhao. In 286 Qi annexed the state of Song.

====The second horizontal alliance and fall of Qi====
In 285 BC, the success of Qi had frightened the other states. Under the leadership of Lord Mengchang, who was exiled in Wei, Qin, Zhao, Wei and Yan formed an alliance. Yan had normally been a relatively weak ally of Qi and Qi feared little from this quarter. Yan&#x27;s onslaught under general Yue Yi came as a devastating surprise. Simultaneously, the other allies attacked from the west. Chu declared itself an ally of Qi but contented itself with annexing some territory to its north. Qi&#x27;s armies were destroyed while the territory of Qi was reduced to the two cities of Ju and Jimo. King Min himself was later captured and executed by his own followers.

King Min was succeeded by King Xiang in 283 BC. His general Tian Dan was eventually able to restore much of Qi&#x27;s territory, but it never regained the influence it had under King Min.

====Qin and Zhao expansion====
In 278 BC, the Qin general Bai Qi attacked from Qin&#x27;s new territory in Sichuan to the west of Chu. The capital of Ying was captured and Chu&#x27;s western lands on the Han River were lost. The effect was to shift Chu significantly to the east.

After Chu was defeated in 278, the remaining great powers were Qin in the west and Zhao in the north-center. There was little room for diplomatic maneuver and matters were decided by wars. Zhao had been much strengthened by King Wuling of Zhao (325–299). In 307 he enlarged his cavalry by copying the northern nomads. In 306 he took more land in the northern Shanxi plateau. In 305 he defeated the north-eastern border state of Zhongshan. In 304 he pushed far to the north-west and occupied the east–west section of the Yellow River in the north of the Ordos Loop. King Huiwen of Zhao (298–266) chose able servants and expanded against the weakened Qi and Wei. In 296 his general Lian Po defeated two Qin armies.

In 269 BC Fan Sui became chief advisor to Qin. He advocated authoritarian reforms, irrevocable expansion and an alliance with distant states to attack nearby states (the twenty-third of the Thirty-Six Stratagems). His maxim &quot;attack not only the territory, but also the people&quot; enunciated a policy of mass slaughter that became increasingly frequent.

====Qin-Zhao wars (282–257 BC)====
In 265 King Zhaoxiang of Qin made the first move by attacking the weak state of Han which held the Yellow River gateway into Qin. He moved north-east across Wei territory to cut off the Han exclave of Shangdang north of Luoyang and south of Zhao. The Han king agreed to surrender Shangdang, but the local governor refused and presented it to King Xiaocheng of Zhao. Zhao sent out Lian Po who based his armies at Changping and Qin sent out general Wang He. Lian Po was too wise to risk a decisive battle with the Qin army and remained inside his fortifications. Qin could not break through and the armies were locked in stalemate for three years. The Zhao king decided that Lian Po was not aggressive enough and sent out Zhao Kuo who promised a decisive battle. At the same time Qin secretly replaced Wang He with the notoriously violent Bai Qi. When Zhao Kuo left his fortifications, Bai Qi used a Cannae maneuver, falling back in the center and surrounding the Zhao army from the sides. After being surrounded for 46 days, the starving Zhao troops surrendered in September 260 BC. It is said that Bai Qi had all the prisoners killed and that Zhao lost 400,000 men.

Qin was too exhausted to follow up its victory. Some time later it sent an army to besiege the Zhao capital but the army was destroyed when it was attacked from the rear. Zhao survived, but there was no longer a state that could resist Qin on its own. The other states could have survived if they remained united against Qin, but they did not.

In 257 BC, Qin army failed to besiege Handan and was defeated by the allied force of Zhao, Wei and Chu during the Battle of Handan.

====End of Zhou dynasty (256–249 BC)====
The forces of King Zhao of Qin defeated King Nan of Zhou and conquered West Zhou in 256 BC, claiming the Nine Cauldrons and thereby symbolically becoming The Son of Heaven.

King Zhao&#x27;s exceptionally long reign ended in 251 BC. His son King Xiaowen, already an old man, died just three days after his coronation and was succeeded by his son King Zhuangxiang of Qin. The new Qin king proceeded to conquer East Zhou, seven years after the fall of West Zhou. Thus the 800-year Zhou dynasty, nominally China&#x27;s longest-ruling regime, finally came to an end.

Sima Qian contradicts himself regarding the ultimate fate of the East Zhou court. Chapter 4 (The Annals of Zhou) concludes with the sentence &quot;thus the sacrifices of Zhou ended&quot;, but in the following chapter 5 (The Annals of Qin) we learn that &quot;Qin did not prohibit their sacrifices; the Lord of Zhou was allotted a patch of land in Yangren where he could continue his ancestral sacrifices&quot;.

===Qin unites China (247–221 BC)===


King Zhuangxiang of Qin ruled for only three years. He was succeeded by his son Zheng, who unlike the two elderly kings that preceded him was only 13 years old at his coronation. As an adult, Zheng became a brilliant commander who, in the span of just nine years, unified China.

====Conquest of Han====
In 230 BC, Qin conquered Han. Han, the weakest of the Seven Warring States, was adjacent to the much stronger Qin, and had suffered continuous assaults by Qin in earlier years of the Warring States period. This went on until Emperor Qin Shi Huang sent general Wang Jian to attack Zhao. King An of Han, frightened by the thought that Han would be the next target of the Qin state, immediately sent diplomats to surrender the entire kingdom without a fight, saving the Han populace from the terrible potential consequences of an unsuccessful resistance.

====Conquest of Wei====
In 225 BC, Qin conquered Wei. The Qin army led a direct invasion into Wei by besieging its capital Daliang but soon realized that the city walls were too tough to break into. They devised a new strategy in which they utilized the power of a local river that was linked to the Yellow River. The river was used to flood the city&#x27;s walls, causing massive devastation to the city. Upon realizing the situation, King Jia of Wei hurriedly came out of the capital and surrendered it to the Qin army in order to avoid further bloodshed of his people.

====Conquest of Chu====

In 223 BC, Qin conquered Chu. 
The first invasion was however an utter disaster when 200,000 Qin troops, led by the general, Li Xin, were defeated by 500,000 Chu troops in the unfamiliar territory of Huaiyang, modern-day northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Xiang Yan, the Chu commander, had lured Qin by allowing a few initial victories, but then counterattacked and burnt two large Qin camps.

In 222 BC, Wang Jian was recalled to lead a second military invasion with 600,000 men against the Chu state. High in morale after their victory in the previous year, the Chu forces were content to sit back and defend against what they expected to be a siege of Chu. However, Wang Jian decided to weaken Chu&#x27;s resolve and tricked the Chu army by appearing to be idle in his fortifications whilst secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, the Chu defenders decided to disband due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at that point, with full force, and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Chu lost the initiative and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it too was fully conquered with the destruction of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, Lord Changping, in 223 BC. At their peak, the combined armies of Chu and Qin are estimated to have ranged from hundreds of thousands to a million soldiers, more than those involved in the campaign of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years earlier.

====Conquest of Zhao and Yan====
In 222 BC, Qin conquered Zhao and Yan. 
After the conquest of Zhao, the Qin army turned its attention towards Yan. Realizing the danger and gravity of this situation, Crown Prince Dan of Yan had sent Jing Ke to assassinate King Zheng of Qin, but this failure only helped to fuel the rage and determination of the Qin king, and he increased the number of troops to conquer the Yan state.

====Conquest of Qi====
In 221 BC, Qin conquered Qi, the final unconquered state. It had not previously contributed or helped other states when Qin was conquering them. As soon as Qin&#x27;s intention to invade it became clear, Qi swiftly surrendered all its cities, completing the unification of China and ushering in the Qin dynasty. The last Qi king lived out his days in exile in Gong and was not given a posthumous name, therefore he is known to posterity by his personal name Jian.

====Aftermath====
The Qin king Ying Zheng declared himself as &quot;Qin Shi Huangdi&quot;, &quot;The first Sovereign Emperor of Qin&quot;.

In the rule of the Qin state, the union was based solely on military power. The feudal holdings were abolished, and noble families were forced to live in the capital city Xianyang, in order to be supervised. A national road (as well as greater use of canals) allowed for faster and easier deployment and supply of the army. The peasants were given a wider range of land rights, although they were subject to taxation, creating a large amount of revenue to the state.

==Military theory and practice==


===Increasing scale of warfare===

The chariot remained a major factor in Chinese warfare long after it went out of fashion in the Middle East. Near the beginning of the Warring States period there is a shift from chariots to massed infantry, possibly associated with the invention of the crossbow. This had two major effects. First it led the dukes to weaken their chariot-riding nobility so they could get direct access to the peasantry who could be drafted as infantry. This change was associated with the shift from aristocratic to bureaucratic government. Second, it led to a massive increase in the scale of warfare. When the Zhou overthrew the Shang at the Battle of Muye they used 45,000 troops and 300 chariots. For the Warring States period the following figures for the military strengths of various states are reported:
* Qin &lt;br&gt; 1,000,000 infantry, 1,000 chariots, 10,000 horses; 
* Chu &lt;br&gt; same numbers; 
* Wei &lt;br&gt; 200–360,000 infantry, 200,000 spearmen, 100,000 servants, 600 chariots, 5,000 cavalry; 
* Han &lt;br&gt; 300,000 total;
* Qi &lt;br&gt; several hundred thousand; 
For major battles, the following figures are reported:
* Battle of Maling &lt;br&gt; 100,000 killed;
* Battle of Yique &lt;br&gt; 240,000 killed;
* General Bai Qi is said to have been responsible for 890,000 enemy deaths over his career.
Many scholars think these numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid by the number of enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it seems clear that warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China&#x27;s traditional and current preference for a united throne.

===Military developments===

The Warring States period saw the introduction of many innovations to the art of warfare in China, such as the use of iron and of cavalry.

Warfare in the Warring States period evolved considerably from the Spring and Autumn period, as most armies made use of infantry and cavalry in battles, and the use of chariots became less widespread. The use of massed infantry made warfare bloodier and reduced the importance of the aristocracy, which in turn made the kings more despotic. From this period onward, as the various states competed with each other by mobilizing their armies to war, nobles in China belonged to the literate class, rather than to the warrior class as had previously been the case.

The various states fielded massive armies of infantry, cavalry, and chariots. Complex logistical systems maintained by efficient government bureaucracies were needed to supply, train, and control such large forces. The size of the armies ranged from tens of thousands to several hundred thousand men.
Iron weapons became more widespread and began to replace bronze. Most armour and weapons of this period were made from iron.
The first official native Chinese cavalry unit was formed in 307 BC during the military reforms of King Wuling of Zhao, who advocated &#x27;nomadic dress and horse archery&#x27;. But the war chariot still retained its prestige and importance, despite the tactical superiority of cavalry.

The crossbow was the preferred long-range weapon of this period, due to several reasons. The crossbow could be mass-produced easily, and mass training of crossbowmen was possible. These qualities made it a powerful weapon against the enemy.

Infantrymen deployed a variety of weapons, but the most popular was the dagger-axe. The dagger-axe came in various lengths, from 9 to 18 feet; the weapon consisted of a thrusting spear with a slashing blade appended to it. Dagger-axes were an extremely popular weapon in various kingdoms, especially for the Qin, who produced 18-foot-long pike-like weapons.

The Qiang battle spear was named as the king &#x27;wang&#x27; of all ancient weapons. It had the biggest impact on the battlefield and was quite difficult to master. The second important weapon of that era was the double-edged battle sword Jian. The fighting methods of using the Qiang spear and Jian sword were very different from what we see in movies or re-enactment shows today. Professional warriors of that era used the military concepts of &quot;Master&quot; Sun Tzu and created several successful &quot;Ge Dou&quot; martial schools.

===Military thought===

The Warring States was a great period for military strategy; of the Seven Military Classics of China, four were written during this period:

*&quot;The Art of War&quot; &lt;br&gt; It is attributed to Sun Tzu, a highly influential study of strategy and tactics.
*&quot;Wuzi&quot; &lt;br&gt; It is attributed to Wu Qi, a statesman and commander who served the states of Wei and then Chu.
*&quot;Wei Liaozi&quot; &lt;br&gt; of uncertain authorship.
*&quot;The Methods of the Sima&quot; &lt;br&gt; It is attributed to Sima Rangju, a commander serving the state of Qi.

==Culture and society==

The Warring States period was an era of warfare in ancient China, as well as bureaucratic and military reforms and consolidation; the major states, ruling over large territories, quickly sought to consolidate their powers, leading to the final erosion of the Zhou court&#x27;s prestige. As a sign of this shift, the rulers of all the major states (except for Chu, which had claimed kingly title much earlier) abandoned their former feudal titles for the title of 王, or King, claiming equality with the rulers of the Zhou.

At the same time, the constant conflict and need for innovative social and political models led to the development of many philosophical doctrines, later known as the Hundred Schools of Thought. The most notable schools of thought include Mohism (expounded by Mozi), Confucianism (represented by Mencius and Xunzi), Legalism (represented by Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Shen Dao and Han Fei) and Taoism (represented by Zhuangzi and Lao Tzu).

The many states that were competing between each other attempted to display their power not only militarily but in their courts and in state philosophy. Many differing rulers adopted the differing philosophies to their own advantage or that of their kingdom.

Mencius attempted to instate Confucianism as a state philosophy, proposing that through the governing of moral principles like benevolence and righteousness, the state would win popular support from one state and those neighboring, eliminating the need of a war altogether. Mencius had attempted to convince King Hui of Liang, although was unsuccessful since the king saw no advantage in the period of wars.

Mohism was developed by Mozi (468–376 BC) and it provided a unified moral and political philosophy based on impartiality and benevolence. Mohists had the belief that people change depending on environments around. The same was applied to rulers, which is why one must be cautious of foreign influences. Mozi was very much against warfare, although he was a great tactician in defense. He defended the small state of Song from many attempts of the Chu state.

Taoism was advocated by Laozi, and believed that human nature was good and can achieve perfection by returning to its original state. It believed that like a baby, humans are simple and innocent although with development of civilizations it lost its innocence only to be replaced by fraud and greed. Contrarily to other schools, it did not want to gain influence in the offices of states and Laozi even refused to be the minister of the state of Chu.

Legalism created by Shang Yang in 338 BC, rejected all notions of religion and practices, and believed a nation should be governed by strict law. Not only were severe punishments applied, but they would be grouped with the families and made mutually responsible for criminal act. It proposed radical reforms, and established a society based on solid ranks. Peasants were encouraged to practice agriculture as occupation, and military performance was rewarded. Laws were also applied to all ranks with no exception; even the king was not above punishment. The philosophy was adapted by the Qin state and it created it into an organized, centralized state with a bureaucracy chosen on the basis of merit.
This period is most famous for the establishment of complex bureaucracies and centralized governments, as well as a clear legal system. The developments in political and military organization were the basis of the power of the Qin state, which conquered the other states and unified them under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC.

===Nobles, bureaucrats and reformers===

The phenomenon of intensive warfare, based on mass formations of infantry rather than the traditional chariots, was one major trend which led to the creation of strong central bureaucracies in each of the major states. At the same time, the process of secondary feudalism which permeated the Spring and Autumn period, and led to such events as the partition of Jin and the usurpation of Qi by the Tian clan, was eventually reversed by the same process of bureaucratisation.

Under the demands of warfare, the states adopted bureaucratic reforms in the Warring States period. Wei adopted these in 445 BC, Zhao in 403 BC, Chu in 390 BC, Han in 355 BC, Qi in 357 BC and Qin in 350 BC. Power was centralised by curbing the landed aristocrats and sinecures and creating a new hierarchy based on meritorious service to the state, which were drawn from the lower rungs of society. Systematic auditing and reporting systems, and fixed salaries for officials were created.

The reforms of Shang Yang in Qin, and of Wu Qi in Chu, both centred on increased centralisation, the suppression of the nobility, and a vastly increased scope of government based on Legalist ideals, which were necessary to mobilise the large armies of the period.

=== Sophisticated arithmetic ===

A bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the Tsinghua collection dated to 305BC are the world&#x27;s earliest example of a two digit decimal multiplication table, indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period.

Rod numerals were used to represent both negative and positive integers, and rational numbers, a true positional number system, with a blank for zero dating back to the Warring States period.

The nine linked-rings puzzle, an advanced puzzle device which requires mathematical analysis to solve, was invented during the period.

==Literature==
An important literary achievement of the Warring States period is the Zuo Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, which summarizes the preceding Spring and Autumn period. The less famous work Guoyu is thought to be by the same author.

Many sayings of Spring and Autumn philosophers, which had previously been circulated orally, were put into writing in the Warring States. These include the Analects and The Art of War.

==Economic developments==

The Warring States period saw the proliferation of iron working in China, replacing bronze as the dominant type of metal used in warfare. Areas such as Shu (present-day Sichuan) and Yue (present-day Zhejiang) were also brought into the Chinese cultural sphere during this time. Trade also became important, and some merchants had considerable power in politics, the most prominent of which was Lü Buwei, who rose to become Chancellor of Qin and was a key supporter of the eventual Qin Shihuang.

At the same time, the increased resources of consolidated, bureaucratic states, coupled with the logistical needs of mass levies and large-scale warfare, led to the proliferation of economic projects such as large-scale waterworks. Major examples of such waterworks include the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which controlled the Min River in Sichuan and turned the former backwater region into a major Qin logistical base, and the Zhengguo Canal which irrigated large areas of land in the Guanzhong Plain, again increasing Qin&#x27;s agricultural output.

The Guanzi is considered one of the most foundational texts of the developing political economy in the Warring States period. It addresses principles of price regulation in the context of effectively dealing with commodities that are &quot;light&quot; (connoting a commodity which is unimportant, non-essential, or inexpensive) or &quot;heavy&quot; (a commodity which is important, essential, or expensive) and how whether a commodity is &quot;light&quot; or &quot;heavy&quot; is understood in relation to other commodities.

<text>Mozi, personal name Mo Di,
was a Chinese philosopher, logician, and founder of the Mohist school of thought, making him one of the most important figures of the Warring States period (221 BCE). Alongside Confucianism, Mohism became the most prominent, organized schools of the Hundred Schools of Thought throughout the period. The &quot;Mozi&quot; is an anthology of writings traditionally attributed to Mozi and to his followers.

Born in what is now Tengzhou, Shandong, Mozi and his followers argued strongly against both Confucianism and Taoism, with a philosophy emphasizing universal love, social order, the will of Heaven, sharing, and honoring the worthy. Mohism was actively developed and practiced across Warring States–era China, but fell out of favor following the establishment of the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE.

While tradition assumes the destruction of many Mohist texts in 213 BCE as part of Emperor Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s burning of books and burying of scholars, traces of Mohism can still be seen late in the early Han (from 202 BCE), in syncretic texts like the Huainanzi of . As Confucianism became the dominant school of thought during the Han dynasty (202 BCE220 CE), Mohism disappeared almost entirely by the middle of the Western Han period of 202 BCE to 9 CE. Mozi is referenced in the 6th-century CE &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;, which records that he was saddened when he saw the dyeing of pure white silk, which embodied his conception of austerity as simplicity and chastity.

==Life==

Most historians believe that Mozi was a member of the lower artisan class who managed to climb his way to an official post. Mozi was a native of the state of Lu (modern Tengzhou, Shandong), although for a time he served as a minister in the state of Song. Similar to Confucius, Mozi was known to have maintained a school for those who desired to become officials serving in the different ruling courts of the Warring States.

Mozi was a carpenter and was extremely skilled in creating devices (see Lu Ban). Though he did not hold a high official position, Mozi was sought out by various rulers as an expert on fortification. He was schooled in Confucianism in his early years, although he viewed Confucianism as being too fatalistic, with an overemphasis on elaborate celebrations and funerals, which Mozi considered to be detrimental to the livelihood and productivity of the common people. Mozi managed to attract a large following during his lifetime, rivaling that of Confucius. His followers—mostly technicians and craftspeople—were organized in a disciplined order that studied both Mozi&#x27;s philosophical and technical writings.

According to some accounts of the popular understanding of Mozi at the time, he had been hailed by many as the greatest hero to come from Henan. His passion was said to be for the good of the people, without concern for personal gain or even for his own life or death. His tireless contribution to society was praised by many, including Confucius&#x27;s disciple Mencius. Mencius wrote in &quot;Jinxin&quot; () that Mozi believed in love for all mankind, noting that, as long as something benefitted mankind, Mozi would pursue it even if it meant &quot;hurting his head or his feet&quot;. Zhang Tai Yan said that, in terms of moral virtue, even Confucius and Laozi could not compare to Mozi.

Mozi travelled from one crisis zone to another throughout the ravaged landscape of the Warring States, trying to dissuade rulers from their plans of conquest. According to the chapter &quot;Gongshu&quot; in the &quot;Mozi&quot;, he once walked for ten days to the state of Chu in order to forestall an attack on the State of Song. At the Chu court, Mozi engaged in nine simulated war games with Gongshu Ban, the chief military strategist of Chu, and overturned each one of his stratagems. When Gongshu Ban threatened him with death, Mozi informed the king that his disciples had already trained the soldiers of Song in his fortification methods, so it would be useless to kill him. The Chu king was forced to call off the war. On the way back, however, the soldiers of Song, not recognizing Mozi, would not allow him to enter their city, and he had to spend a night freezing in the rain. After this episode, he also prevented the state of Qi from attacking the State of Lu. He taught that the defense of a city did not depend only on fortification, weaponry, and food supply, but rather that it was also important to keep talented people close by and to put trust in them.

==Philosophy==
Mozi&#x27;s moral teachings emphasized introspection, self-reflection, and authenticity, rather than obedience to rituals. He observed that people often learned about the world through adversity. By reflecting on one&#x27;s own successes and failures, one attains true self-knowledge rather than mere conformity to ritual. Mozi exhorted people to lead a life of asceticism and self-restraint, renouncing both material and spiritual extravagance.

Like Confucius, Mozi idealized the Xia dynasty and the ancients of Chinese mythology, but he also criticized the Confucian belief that modern life should be patterned on the ways of the ancients. Mozi argued that what is thought of as &quot;ancient&quot; was actually innovative in its time, and thus should not be used to hinder present-day innovation. Though Mozi did not believe that history necessarily progresses, as did Han Fei Zi, he shared the latter&#x27;s critique of fate (, &quot;mìng&quot;). Mozi believed that people were capable of changing their circumstances and directing their own lives, which could be achieved by applying one&#x27;s senses to observing the world, as well as judging objects and events by their causes, functions, and historical bases. This was the &quot;three-prong method&quot; Mozi recommended for testing the truth or falsehood of statements. His students later expanded upon this theory to form the School of Names.

Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese ideal of strong attachments to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;impartial caring&quot; or &quot;universal love&quot; (, &quot;jiān ài&quot;). He argued directly against Confucians, who had philosophized that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, in contrast, argued that people in principle should care for all people equally, a notion that philosophers in other schools found absurd, as they interpreted this notion as implying no special amount of care or duty towards one&#x27;s parents and family.

Overlooked by those critics, however, was a passage in the chapter on &quot;Self-Cultivation&quot; which stated, &quot;When people near-by are not befriended, there is no use endeavoring to attract those at a distance.&quot; This point was also precisely articulated by a Mohist in a debate with Mencius (in the &quot;Mengzi&quot;), where the Mohist argued, in relation to carrying out universal love, that &quot;we begin with what is near.&quot; Also, in the first chapter in the &quot;Mozi&quot; on the topic of universal love, Mozi argued that the best way of being filial to one&#x27;s parents is to be filial to the parents of others. The foundational principle was therefore that benevolence, as well as malevolence, is requited, and that one would be treated by others as one treats others. Mozi quoted a popular passage from the &quot;Book of Odes&quot; to bring home this point: &quot;When one throws to me a peach, I return to him a plum.&quot; One&#x27;s parents will be treated by others as one treats the parents of others. Mozi also differentiated between &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;actuality&quot;, thereby placing a central importance on the will to love, even though in practice it might very well be impossible to bring benefit to everyone.

In addition, Mozi argued that benevolence comes to human beings &quot;as naturally as fire turns upward or water turns downward&quot;, provided that persons in positions of authority illustrate benevolence in their own lives. In differentiating between the ideas of &quot;universal&quot; (&quot;jian&quot;) and &quot;differential&quot; (&quot;bie&quot;), Mozi said that &quot;universal&quot; originated from righteousness while &quot;differential&quot; entailed human effort.

Mozi also held a belief in the power of ghosts and spirits, although he is often thought to have only worshipped them pragmatically. In fact, in his discussion on ghosts and spirits, he remarked that, even if they did not exist, communal gatherings for the sake of making sacrificial offering would play a role in strengthening social bonds. Furthermore, for Mozi the will of Heaven (, &quot;tiān&quot;) was that people should love one another, and that mutual love by all would bring benefit to all. Therefore, it was in everyone&#x27;s interest that they would love others &quot;as they love themselves&quot;. According to Mozi, Heaven should be respected because failing to do so would subject one to punishment. For Mozi, Heaven was not the &quot;amoral&quot;, mystical nature of the Daoists; rather, it was a benevolent, moral force that rewarded good and punished evil. Similar in some ways to the beliefs systems found in the Abrahamic religions, Mozi believed that all living things lived in a realm ruled by Heaven, and Heaven possessed a will which was independent from, and higher than, the will of people. Thus Mozi wrote that &quot;Universal love is the Way of Heaven&quot;, since &quot;Heaven nourishes and sustains all life without regard to status.&quot; Mozi&#x27;s ideal of government, which advocated a meritocracy based on talent rather than background, also followed his idea of Heaven.

Mozi opposed the Confucian idea of &quot;Destiny&quot;, promoting instead an idea of &quot;anti-fatalism&quot; (). Where the Confucian philosophy held that a person&#x27;s life, death, wealth, poverty, and social status were entirely dependent upon destiny and therefore could not be changed, Mozi argued that hard work and virtuous acts could change one&#x27;s position in life.

===Ethics===
Mohist ethics is considered a form of consequentialism, according to which the morality of an action, statement, teaching, policy, judgment, and so on, is determined by the consequences that it brings about. In particular, Mozi thought that actions should be measured by the way they contribute to the benefit of all members of society. With this criterion, Mozi denounced things as diverse as offensive warfare, expensive funerals, and even music and dance, which he saw as serving no useful purpose. According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BCE, is the &quot;world&#x27;s earliest form of consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare&quot;. Consequentialist theories vary over exactly which consequences are relevant, though they all share the same basic outcome-based structure. With Mozi&#x27;s overwhelming focus on &quot;benefit&quot; (, &quot;li&quot;) among other ends, and his explicit focus on making moral evaluations in light of them, Mozi&#x27;s ethics indeed shares this consequentalist structure. For interpreting Mozi, however, there is some debate over how to understand the consequences Mozi seems most concerned with, and therefore over which kind of consequentialism to ascribe to him.

Some believe the best descriptor to be state consequentialism. According to this reading, Mohist ethics makes moral evaluations based on how well the action, statement, etc., in question contributes to the stability of a state. Such state-related goods include social order, material wealth, and population growth. By centering his ethical theory around the promotion of such state-related ends, Mozi shows himself to be a state consequentialist. Unlike hedonistic utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, &quot;the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are ... order, material wealth, and increase in population&quot;. During Mozi&#x27;s era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. Mozi opposed wars because they wasted life and resources while interfering with the fair distribution of wealth, yet he recognized the need for strong urban defenses so he could maintain the harmonious society he desired. The &quot;material wealth&quot; of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing, and the &quot;order&quot; of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi&#x27;s stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability. Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison, in &quot;The Cambridge History of Ancient China&quot;, writes that the moral goods of Mohism &quot;are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth ... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically&quot;. In contrast to Jeremy Bentham, Mozi did not believe that individual happiness was important; the consequences of the state outweigh the consequences of individual actions.

Alternative readings locate the main focus of Mozi&#x27;s consequentialism in the welfare of the people themselves rather than that of the state as a whole. Such interpretations as Chris Fraser&#x27;s argue that it is a mistake to view Mozi&#x27;s focus on the collective well-being of a population as a focus on the well-being of the state itself rather than its constituents. In this way, Mozi tended to evaluate actions based on whether they provide benefit to the people, which he measured in terms of an enlarged population (states were sparsely populated in his day), a prosperous economy, and social order. Indeed these are collective goods rather than individual ones, which is a major difference between Mohist consequentialism and modern, Western versions. However, this reading emphasizes that collective goods are better considered as aggregated individual goods rather than as state goods.

This consequentialist structure supports Mohist ethics and politics, which survives in the form of 10 core doctrines:

# Promoting the Worthy
# Identifying Upward
# Universal Love (sometimes called &quot;Inclusive Care&quot;)
# Condemning Aggression
# Moderation in Use
# Moderation in Burials
# Heaven&#x27;s Intent
# Understanding Ghosts
# Condemning Music
# Condemning Fatalism

Each of these doctrines is justified on the grounds that it produces the best consequences for society, and that all people stand to benefit from adopting them. Promoting the worthy, for example, encourages people in positions of power to hire competent and worthy subordinates to fill posts, rather than hire friends and relatives instead. The reasoning here is that someone better qualified for the job will perform better and enable society as a whole to benefit. Identifying upward refers to the idea that people in subordinate positions in society must look to their superiors as models for their own conduct. Provided that the superiors are indeed morally competent and worthy of emulation, the rest of society will always have a reliable guide for their own actions, thereby giving rise to social benefits.

Universal love refers to the basic normative attitude the Mohists encourage us to adopt towards others. The idea is that people ought to consider all others as being part of their scope of moral concern. Indeed this is perhaps the most infamous of Mohist doctrines, and was criticized early on by philosophers such as Mengzi, who held that the doctrine was akin to renouncing one&#x27;s family. However, close readings of the texts by modern scholars have shown the demands of Mohist universal love to be much more mild and reasonable. Additionally, given the accretional nature of the texts, the audience of such texts may have changed depending upon the Mohists&#x27; social influence, and so the demands for universal love made on rulers, for example, is considerably higher than that made on the masses. At its most basic, however, the doctrine merely encourages a general attitude of care towards others. However, this does not require that we renounce all forms of special relationships we have with our families and friends. In fact, the Mohists introduce the problem that universal love is meant to solve by lamenting the fact that fathers and sons don&#x27;t care for each other, and so must instead adopt an attitude of universal love. Conversely, the Mohists hope, when people adopt an attitude of universal love, society as a whole will benefit.

Dovetailing with this idea is that of condemning aggression. The main targets of this doctrine are undoubtedly the rulers of the various warring states in China, who regularly embarked on expansionist military campaigns in order to increase their territory, power, and influence. However, such campaigns were enormously taxing on the population, disrupting regular farming cycles by conscripting able-bodied people for these military ends. Additionally, the practices is ethically wrong for the same reason that robbery and murder are wrong. In fact, according to Mozi, the two are actually one and the same; for what is an expansionist war of aggression other than robbery and murder on a grand scale? And yet, Mozi laments, those rulers who execute robbers and murderers engage in the very same practices. With respect to universal love, indeed part of the reason why rulers believe it is acceptable to invade and conquer other states while it is not acceptable for their own subjects to rob and steal from one another is that the people in neighboring states are not part of the rulers&#x27; scope of moral concern. If rulers were to instead include these people and refrain from wars of aggression, all states, those attacking and those defending, will benefit.

Moderation in use and moderation in burials are the main Mohist ideas about frugality. In one&#x27;s own projects, utility ought to be the only consideration. The Mohists took particular offense to the practice of extremely lavished funerals and demanding mourning rituals. Such funerals and rituals would potentially bankrupt an entire clan, at least temporarily, and disrupt its farming practices. For the dead in higher positions of authority, this disruption would affect an even greater number of people. Again, the point here is to promote benefit across society, and the Mohists believe that adopting frugal practices will do so.

Mozi&#x27;s ideas about ghosts and spirits follow from their religious beliefs in a morally consistent universe. Heaven, it is argued, is the ultimate moral standard, while ghosts and spirits serve as Heaven&#x27;s enforcers. Both doctrines, when adopted, promote societal benefit both by enabling people to rely upon an objective standard to guide their actions (namely, Heaven), and by acting as a sort of cosmic authority capable of enacting rewards and punishments.

Mozi&#x27;s condemnation of music rests on the same economic considerations as their general ideas of frugality. In ancient China, grand musical ceremonies established by rulers would place enormous financial and human strains on populations, and so Mozi condemned such ceremonies for this reason. Mozi did not object to music in principle—&quot;It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like the sound of the drum&quot; (&quot;Against Music&quot;)—but only because of the heavy tax burden such activities placed on commoners and also due to the fact that officials tended to indulge in them at the expense of their duties.

Finally, the Mohists rejected the idea of fatalism, or the idea that there is fate. The Mohists reject this idea on the grounds that it encourages lazy and irresponsible behavior. When people believe that there is fate, and that the consequences of their actions lie beyond their control, people will not be encouraged to improve themselves, nor will they be willing to take responsibility for disasters. As a result, society will suffer, and so the doctrine that there is fate ought to be rejected.

== Works and influence ==


&quot;Mozi&quot; is also the name of the philosophical anthology written and compiled by followers of Mozi. The text was formed by an accretional process that took place over a period of hundreds of years, beginning perhaps during or shortly after Mozi&#x27;s lifetime, and lasting until perhaps the early Han dynasty. During the Han dynasty, as Confucianism came to be the official school of political thought, Mohism gradually lost both its adherents and influence while simultaneously being partly incorporated into more mainstream political thought. The text was eventually neglected, and only 58 of the text&#x27;s original 71 books (&quot;pian&quot;) survive, some of which, notably the later Mohist &quot;Canons&quot;, contain significant textual corruptions and are fragmentary in nature. The anthology can be divided into 5 main groups, which are determined on the basis of both chronological and thematic features:

* Books 1-7 consist of short, miscellaneous essays containing summaries of Mohist doctrines, anecdotes about Mozi, and ideals about meritocratic government. Some appear to be relatively late texts, expressing mature Mohist political and ethical thought on some topics.
* Books 8-37 contain the Mohists&#x27; key essays on the ten &quot;core&quot; Mohist doctrines. Though they exhibit explicit thematic unity, textual evidence suggests that the Mohists revisited their core doctrines throughout their activity, responding to objections and addressing issues unresolved in earlier, often shorter and simpler expositions.
* Books 38-39 are a series of polemics against the Ru (Confucians). They are often grouped with books 8-37, though they do not expound a positive doctrine, and their purpose is entirely critical.
* Books 40-45 are often referred to as the &quot;dialectical books.&quot; These are often considered &quot;later Mohist&quot; writings, though actual chronological details about them are difficult to glean. They are written in an idiosyncratic style, and focus on a broad range of issues that go well beyond those of the Mohist core doctrines, including logic, epistemology, optics, geometry, and ethics.
* Books 46-51 are dialogues. They are probably later, and likely fictional, exhibiting Mozi in conversation with various interlocutors.
* Books 52-71 are chapters on military affairs, specifically focusing on preparing for defensive warfare.

The &quot;Mozi&quot; is a rich source of insight into early Chinese dynastic history, culture, and philosophy. The text frequently cites ancient classics, such as the &quot;Shang Shu&quot;, and at times departs from the received version, giving scholars insight into the textual development of such classics as well.

The texts portray Mozi as a mouthpiece for Mohist philosophy and not much else. This picture contrasts that of Confucius and Mencius found in the &quot;Lunyu&quot; (&quot;Analects&quot;) and &quot;Mengzi&quot; respectively, wherein the thinkers in question are portrayed as expressing emotions, chiding students, and even making mistakes. (Consider Mengzi&#x27;s disastrous advice to the King of Qi to invade the state of Yan.) To contrast, Mozi has little if any personality in the text, instead serving only as a mouthpiece for Mohist philosophy.

Mohism, like other schools of thought at the time, was suppressed under the Qin and died out completely under the Han, as its more radical adherents gradually dissolved and its most compelling ideas became absorbed by mainstream political thought. The influence of Mozi is still visible in many Han dynasty works written hundreds of years later. For example, the Confucian scholar Gongsun Hong describes the Confucian virtue of &quot;ren&quot; (&quot;benevolence&quot;) in Mohist terms. Additionally, Mohist epistemology and philosophy of language had a profound influence on the development of classical Chinese philosophy in general. In fact, Mohism was so prominent during the Warring States period that philosophical opponents, including Mencius and some authors of the Daoist anthology, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, lament the very prevalence and widespread influence of their ideas.

In modern times, Mohism has been given a fresh analysis. Sun Yat-Sen used &quot;universal love&quot; as one of the foundations for his idea of Chinese democracy. More recently, Chinese scholars under Communism have tried to rehabilitate Mozi as a &quot;philosopher of the people&quot;, highlighting his rational-empirical approach to the world as well as his &quot;proletarian&quot; background. The body in the Mozi is constructed by &quot;xing&quot; (, &#x27;body&#x27;), &quot;xin&quot; (, &#x27;heart&#x27;), &quot;qi&quot; (, &#x27;energy&#x27;) &#x27;which is in accord with the Pre-Qin thinkers&#x27; understanding to the body. While xing refers to the flesh-bloody part of human being, the concept of xin focuses on the aspect of cognition and is closely related to the concept of shan (, &#x27;goodness&#x27;), ai (, &#x27;love&#x27;), zhi (, &#x27;will&#x27;) and xing.

Some views claim that Mozi&#x27;s philosophy was at once more advanced and less so than that of Confucius. Indeed the Mohists were radical political reformers who sought primarily to benefit the masses and challenge the practices of the ruling orthodoxy, often targeting a perceived wasteful aristocracy whom they referred to as &quot;the gentlemen of the world.&quot; The Mohist idea of &quot;universal love&quot; embraced a broader idea of human community than that of the Confucians, arguing that the scope of individuals&#x27; moral concern should include all people. Opponents of this idea often claimed that &quot;universal love&quot; was akin to renouncing one&#x27;s family, and indeed more strict Mohists living in Mohist communities as the school flourished may have exhibited such behavior. However, there is some scholarly debate over just how radical the provisions of universal love actually are, and, as can be seen from the example of Gongsun Hong above, the less radical components of the doctrine were eventually absorbed by mainstream thought.

Mozi is also famous for his ideas about frugality, such as those concerning moderating expenses and eliminating wasteful ceremonies including music and funerals. A common misconception is that the Mohists eschewed all forms of art, but of course the Mohists&#x27; targets are more specifically elaborate, state-sponsored rituals that would place incredible financial burdens upon a mostly peasant population. This can be seen from Xunzi&#x27;s own arguments against Mozi in book 10 of the &quot;Xunzi&quot; &quot;Enriching the State,&quot; where Xunzi argues against Mozi that prominent displays of wealth on the part of the state is necessary to maintaining social order.

Some modern-day supporters for Mozi (as well as Communism) make the claim that Mohism and modern Communism share a lot in terms of ideals for community life. Others would claim that Mohism shares more with the central ideas of Christianity, especially in terms of the idea of &quot;universal love&quot; (in Greek, &quot;agape&quot;), the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, and the relation of humanity to the supernatural realm. However, Mohism is undoubtedly a product of Warring States China, a period of tremendous political violence and turmoil. The Mohists were political reformers, but they did not seek to challenge the monarchical model of government that prevailed during that time, and sought instead to reform from within by encouraging governments to hire competent people to carry out political tasks, care for their people inclusively, eliminate frivolous government spending, and halt all wars of aggression.

In many ways the influence of Mohism was a victim of its own successes, and it is fairly easy to understand its decline. The Mohists&#x27; ideas about the importance of meritocracy and universal love were gradually absorbed by mainstream Confucian thinking. Their opposition to offensive warfare became irrelevant once the various Warring States were unified under the Qin and later Han dynasty, and their religious superstitions were eventually replaced with less supernatural accounts. So their most promising ideas were metabolized by the tradition, while their more radical and anachronistic ones were gradually discarded, leading to their demise during the Han dynasty.

== Mohism and science ==
According to Joseph Needham, &quot;Mozi&quot; (collected writings of those in the tradition of Mozi, some of which might have been by Mozi himself) contains the following sentence: &#x27;The cessation of motion is due to the opposing force... If there is no opposing force... the motion will never stop. This is as true as that an ox is not a horse.&#x27; which, he claims, is a precursor to Newton&#x27;s first law of motion. &quot;Mozi&quot; also contains speculations in optics and mechanics that are similarly strikingly original, although their ideas were not taken up by later Chinese philosophers. The Mohist tradition is also highly unusual in Chinese thought in that it devoted time to developing principles of logic.

He is the first to describe the physical principle behind the camera, also known as the camera obscura.

<text>Saint Mocius (; died 288–295) was a Christian priest of Roman ancestry who lived in Amphipolis, Macedonia and became a Catholic and Orthodox saint.

==Life==
During a persecution against Christians under the emperor Diocletian (284-305), St Mocius exhorted the pagans who had assembled for the pagan festival of Dionysus (Bacchus), to abandon the customs which accompanied this celebration. He urged them to repent, be converted to Christianity, and be baptized. At the temple of Dionysus, he destroyed a statue of the god.

Mocius was brought to trial before the governor of Laodicea and subjected to torture. After this he was put into a red-hot oven, where he remained unharmed, but the flames coming out of the oven scorched the governor. Then he was given to wild beasts to be eaten, but they did not touch him. The lions lay down at his feet. The people, seeing such miracles, urged that the saint be set free. The governor ordered the saint to be sent to the city of Perinthus, and from there to Byzantium, where St Mocius was beheaded.

His feast day is May 11 in both the Catholic and Orthodox Church.

==Legacy==
The Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus (491-518) built an open air cistern, to supply water to the city of Constantinople (today&#x27;s Istanbul). It is the third of the Late Roman Period cisterns and the largest in the city, named after the saint who was venerated in a nearby church. In Turkish, it is called &quot;Altı Mermer Çukurbostanı&quot;. It has been converted into the Fatih Educational Park, but the ancient walls are still standing.

===Church of St Mokios===
A church dedicated to saint Mocius is said to have been built by Constantine I on top of a temple of Zeus. It was rebuilt by Pulcheria, Marcian or possibly Justinian I and restored again by Basil I in the 9th century. It was located between the Theodosian and Constantinian walls, perhaps to the west of the cistern named after the saint and close to the monastery of &quot;Theotokos ta Mikra Romaiou&quot;. The monastery also included a hospital and xenodochium and it is possible that the 11th century physician Ibn Butlan wrote his work &quot;The Physicians&#x27; Banquet&quot; in this monastery during his stay in Constantinople.

<text>Nikki Sixx (born Frank Carlton Serafino Feranna Jr.; December 11, 1958) is an American musician, best known as the co-founder, bassist, and primary songwriter of the heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, being the only member to remain throughout their entire history. Prior to forming Mötley Crüe, Sixx was a member of Sister before going on to form London with his Sister bandmate Lizzie Grey. In 2000, he formed side project group 58 with Dave Darling, Steve Gibb and Bucket Baker, issuing one album, &quot;Diet for a New America&quot;. Also in 2002, he formed the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns. Formed in 2006, initially to record an audio accompaniment to Sixx&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, his side band featured songwriter, producer, and vocalist James Michael and guitarist DJ Ashba.

Sixx has also worked with a number of artists and groups, co-writing and/or producing songs, such as Sex Pistols&#x27;s guitarist Steve Jones, Lita Ford, Alice Cooper, Meat Loaf, Marion Raven, Drowning Pool, Saliva and The Last Vegas, among others.

Sixx launched the clothing line &quot;Royal Underground&quot; in 2006 with Kelly Gray, formerly the co-president and house model of St. John. Initially the label concentrated on men&#x27;s clothing before expanding into women&#x27;s apparel. In 2010, Premiere Radio Networks launched nationally syndicated rock/alternative music radio programs &quot;Sixx Sense&quot; and &quot;The Side Show Countdown&quot; with both based in Dallas, Texas and hosted by Sixx and co-hosted by Jenn Marino.

==Early life==
Frank Carlton Serafino Feranna Jr. was born on December 11, 1958, in San Jose, California. He was also raised in San Jose. He is of Italian descent on his father&#x27;s side, from Prato, Tuscany. Sixx was partially raised by his single mother, Deana Richards, and by his grandparents after his father left the family. Feranna later moved in with his grandparents after his mother abandoned him. Feranna relocated several times while living with his grandparents. Feranna&#x27;s uncle, husband of Deana&#x27;s sister Sharon, is Don Zimmerman, producer and president of Capitol Records. Feranna had one full biological sister, Lisa, (born with Down syndrome; died circa 2000) and has one half-brother Rodney Anthony Feranna (b. 1966) and a half-sister Ceci.

Feranna grew up listening to Deep Purple, Harry Nilsson, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Queen, and Black Sabbath; he later discovered T. Rex, David Bowie, and Slade. While living in Jerome, Idaho, Feranna&#x27;s youth was troubled; he became a teenage vandal, broke into neighbors&#x27; homes, shoplifted, and was expelled from school for selling drugs. His grandparents sent him to live with his mother, who had moved to Seattle. Feranna lived there for a short time and learned how to play the bass guitar, having bought his first instrument with money gained from selling a guitar he had stolen.

==Career==
===Early career, Sister, London (1975–1979)===

At the age of 17, Feranna moved to Los Angeles and worked menial jobs such as working at a liquor store and selling vacuum cleaners over the phone while he auditioned for bands. He eventually joined the band Sister, led by Blackie Lawless, after answering an ad in &quot;The Recycler&quot; for a bass player. Soon after recording a demo, Feranna was fired from Sister along with bandmate Lizzie Grey.

Feranna and Grey formed the band London soon afterward, in 1978. During this time, Feranna legally changed his name to Nikki Sixx. After a number of lineup changes, London added former Mott the Hoople singer Nigel Benjamin to the group, and recorded a 16-track demo in Burbank. After the departure of Benjamin, along with the failure to find a replacement, Sixx departed London. The group would go on to feature Sixx&#x27;s former Sister bandmate Blackie Lawless (later of W.A.S.P.), Izzy Stradlin (then of Hollywood Rose, later of Guns N&#x27; Roses) and drummer Fred Coury (later of Cinderella). In 2000, a number of the London demos recorded with Sixx were included on &quot;London Daze&quot; by Spiders &amp; Snakes, led by former London guitarist Lizzie Grey.

===Mötley Crüe (1981–present)===

In 1981, Sixx founded Mötley Crüe alongside drummer Tommy Lee. They were later joined by guitarist Mick Mars through an ad in the local newspaper, and singer Vince Neil, with whom Lee had attended high school. The band self-recorded their debut album, &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot;, which was subsequently released in November 1981 on the band&#x27;s own Leathür Records label. After signing with Elektra Records, they re-released the same album. The band then went on to record and release &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, raising the band to national fame. They issued three more albums during the 1980s, &quot;Theatre of Pain&quot; in 1985, &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; in 1987, and &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; in 1989. The latter ended up being their most successful record, staying in the charts for 114 weeks after its release. The duo of Sixx and Lee are called the &quot;Terror Twins&quot;.

During his time with Mötley Crüe, Sixx became addicted to heroin. He is quoted in &quot;The Heroin Diaries&quot; as saying: &quot;Alcohol, acid, cocaine... they were just affairs. When I met heroin it was true love.&quot; He estimates he overdosed &quot;about half a dozen times&quot;. On December 23, 1987, Sixx overdosed on heroin and was reportedly declared clinically dead for two minutes before a paramedic revived him with two syringes full of adrenaline.
After releasing the compilation album &quot;Decade of Decadence&quot; in 1991, Neil left the group, and was replaced by John Corabi, who formerly served with The Scream. They released one self titled album with Corabi, in 1994, before firing him in 1996. Afterwards, they reunited with Neil, with whom they released &quot;Generation Swine&quot; in 1997.

Sixx had become controversial for an incident during a Mötley Crüe concert at Greensboro Coliseum Complex on October 30, 1997, in which he used racial epithets while goading the audience to physically attack a black security guard for repeatedly attacking a female fan. In May 2001, Sixx addressed the issue, and claimed he had apologized to the victim of the incident.

In 1999, Tommy Lee left the group to form Methods of Mayhem. He was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo, with whom they released the album &quot;New Tattoo&quot; in 2000. The group went on hiatus soon afterward before reuniting in 2004, during which Sixx declared himself sober. A 2001 autobiography entitled &quot;The Dirt&quot; packaged the band as &quot;the world&#x27;s most notorious rock band&quot;. The book made the top ten on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and spent ten weeks there.

In 2006, Mötley Crüe completed a reunion tour, featuring all four original members, and embarked on a co-headlining tour with Aerosmith, called The Route of All Evil. In April 2008, the band announced the first &quot;Crüe Fest&quot;, a summer tour, that featured Sixx&#x27;s side project , Buckcherry, Papa Roach and Trapt. On June 24, 2008, Mötley Crüe released their ninth studio album, &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;, with Sixx credited as either writer or co-writer on all tracks.

Sixx wrote most of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s material, including tracks such as &quot;Live Wire&quot;, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;, &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;, &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;, &quot;Wild Side&quot;, &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Holiday&quot; and &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;. In the 1990s, all four members began contributing to the material on the albums. 

===58 (2000)===

In 2000, Sixx formed the internet-based side project 58 with producer Dave Darling, guitarist Steve Gibb (formerly of Black Label Society and Crowbar) and drummer Bucket Baker. They released one single, titled &quot;Piece of Candy&quot;, and their debut album, &quot;Diet for a New America&quot;, also in 2000 through Sixx&#x27;s Americoma label and Beyond Records. The group did not tour, and was described by Sixx as &quot;strictly an artistic thing.&quot;

===Brides of Destruction (2002–2004)===

Brides of Destruction were formed by Sixx and Tracii Guns in Los Angeles 2002 initially with the name Cockstar after Mötley Crüe went on hiatus and Guns left L.A. Guns. Sixx also invited former Beautiful Creatures guitarist DJ Ashba to join the group however he declined to focus on his solo band, ASHBA. Ashba would eventually join Sixx in 

After a few lineup changes, that included Sixx&#x27;s former Mötley Crüe bandmate John Corabi, keyboardist Adam Hamilton and drummer Kris Kohls of Adema, the group was composed of Sixx, Guns, singer London LeGrand and drummer Scot Coogan formerly of Ednaswap and Annetenna.

They were advised by radio programmers that the name Cockstar would not be announced on air. They briefly adopted the moniker Motordog before settling on Brides of Destruction.

They entered the studio with producer Stevo Bruno to begin recording what would become &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;. The Brides played their first show opening for Mudvayne and Taproot on November 14, 2002, at the Ventura Theatre in California.

After signing a deal with Sanctuary Records, the group released &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; in 2004, with the album debuting at number 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling over 13,000 copies. A tour of the US, Europe, including an appearance at Download Festival in the United Kingdom, and Australia followed.

On October 25, 2004, it was announced that the group were to go on hiatus while Sixx reunited with Mötley Crüe for a reunion tour. The group continued without Sixx, however, with Guns adding former Amen bassist Scott Sorry to the group as Sixx&#x27;s replacement. The second Brides of Destruction album, titled &quot;Runaway Brides&quot;, released in 2005 featured three songs co-written by Sixx during the &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; sessions.

===Sixx:A.M. (2006–2017)===

Sixx formed his own group Sixx:A.M. in 2006, to record an audio accompaniment to his autobiography &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, with friends producer/songwriter James Michael and guitarist DJ Ashba (Guns N&#x27; Roses, formerly of Beautiful Creatures and BulletBoys). They recorded and released &quot;The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack&quot; in August 2007 through Eleven Seven. The single, &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;, received a high ratio of radio and video play peaking at number 2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.

The band made their live debut at the Crash Mansion on July 16, 2007. They performed five songs from the album, with former Beautiful Creatures drummer Glen Sobel filling in on the drums. On April 15, 2008, Sixx:A.M. announced they would be touring as part of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Crüe Fest&quot;. The tour began on July 1, 2008, in West Palm Beach, Florida. During Crüe Fest, Papa Roach drummer Tony Palermo served as a touring drummer for the band. A deluxe tour edition of &quot;The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack&quot; was released on November 25, 2008, which included a bonus live EP entitled &quot;Live Is Beautiful&quot;, which features recorded performances from the band&#x27;s summer tour.

In April 2009, both Sixx and Michael confirmed that the band was in the studio, recording new material. Sixx added that the new material was &quot;inspiring. it feels like we may have topped ourselves on this album coming up, and can&#x27;t wait for you to hear what it sounds like.&quot;

In 2010, the group continued recording the album with plans to release it by the late 2010/early 2011 with the group bringing in Paul R. Brown to shoot the video for the album&#x27;s first single. During an interview in July 2010, Sixx stated that the album was almost finished. &quot;This Is Gonna Hurt&quot;, the band&#x27;s second studio album, was released on May 3, 2011. A third studio album, &quot;Modern Vintage&quot;, was released in 2014. &quot;Prayers for the Damned&quot; and &quot;Prayers for the Blessed&quot; were released in 2016.

The band went on hiatus in 2017, with other members DJ Ashba and James Michael forming a new band, Pyromantic.

In 2021, the band released a greatest HITS album to coincide with Nikki&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;THE FIRST 21.&quot;

==Other work==
In 1989, Sixx was a featured guest artist on the album &quot;Fire and Gasoline&quot; by Steve Jones, formerly of the Sex Pistols. Sixx co-wrote and performed on the song, &quot;We&#x27;re No Saints&quot;. In 1991, Sixx played bass on &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot; on Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; album. Sixx co-wrote the track &quot;Die For You&quot;, along with Cooper and Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars. In 2002, Sixx played on Butch Walkers first solo album &quot;Left of Self Centered&quot;. In 2005, he collaborated with the Norwegian singer Marion Raven on two songs, &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot; and &quot;Surfing the Sun&quot;, for Raven&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Here I Am&quot;. A new version of &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot; appeared on Raven&#x27;s 2006 EP &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot; and on her 2007 U.S. debut album, &quot;Set Me Free&quot;. In 2006, he was one of the songwriters for Meat Loaf&#x27;s long-awaited album, &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;.

In September 2007, Sixx released a book titled &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, a collection of his journal entries from 1986 and 1987 (when his heroin addiction was at its most dangerous). Written with British journalist Ian Gittins, it presents the present-day viewpoints of his bandmates, friends, ex-lovers, caretakers, business associates and family as they respond to specific passages. The book debuted at #7 on &quot;The New York Times Best Seller list&quot;. Along with Big &amp; Rich (John Rich and Big Kenny Alphin), and James Otto, Sixx co-wrote &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Stop&quot; for Otto&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Sunset Man&quot; CD on Warner Bros/Raybaw Records.

In May 2021, it was announced that Sixx along with Rob Zombie, John 5, and Tommy Clufetos formed a supergroup called L.A. Rats. Their debut track, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot;, is from the soundtrack to the Liam Neeson film &quot;The Ice Road&quot;.

==Equipment==
===Signature bass guitars===
Sixx is most often seen playing Gibson Thunderbird bass guitars. Between 2000 and 2003, Gibson produced the Nikki Sixx Signature Blackbird. The Gibson Blackbird was for all intents and purposes a standard Thunderbird bass, but with a satin black finish, Iron Crosses on the fretboard instead of dots, an Iron Cross behind the classic Thunderbird logo, and Nikki Sixx&#x27;s &#x27;opti-grab&#x27; (a metal loop installed behind the bridge for hooking the little finger onto while playing). What also made this bass guitar interesting was the lack of volume or tone controls, being replaced by a single on/off switch. Although subtle, this helped give this Blackbird more tone and a higher output. This model was discontinued in 2003, but has recently been put back in production as the Epiphone Nikki Sixx Blackbird. Cosmetically the Epiphone Blackbird is identical to the Gibson original, but with a bolt-on single ply neck, solid mahogany body, different pickups and lower grade parts and manufacturing. The Epiphone model still kept the &#x27;opti-grab,&#x27; designed and made first by his bass technician Tim Luzzi, and single on/off switch of the Gibson original. In 2008, Gibson announced a &#x27;limited run&#x27; new Nikki Sixx signature bass. Like the original it features a neck through design made of mahogany and walnut, with maple &#x27;wings&#x27; to form the body. Unlike the original &#x27;Blackbird&#x27; bass, a clear &#x27;satin black cherry&#x27; finish is given to the instrument, with red &#x27;slash&#x27; X&#x27;s on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 12th frets. A mirror pickguard is also applied, with a red signature and two X&#x27;s (6 x&#x27;s on the whole bass guitar) is also a new addition. Unlike the Gibson Blackbird, the new signature featured volume and tone controls, the &#x27;opti-grab&#x27;, and an on/off switch.

==Personal life==

Sixx was engaged to Denise &quot;Vanity&quot; Matthews in 1987. In his autobiography, &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot;, Sixx described his toxic relationship with Matthews. &quot;Vanity came and went during different periods of my addiction. She was a wild black chick who had sung with Prince: she&#x27;d also been his lover for a while. At the time I thought of Vanity as a disposable human being, like a used needle. Once its purpose was fulfilled it was ready for the trash, only to be dug up if you were really desperate…We became drug buddies: sometimes, you could even just about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when Mötley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I&#x27;d been mostly snorting or injecting. But as soon as she showed me the real ins and outs of cooking up a good rock…it was love. Not her. The drug.&quot;

From May 1989 to November 1996, Sixx was married to his first wife, &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate Brandi Brandt; they have three children: Gunner Nicholas Sixx (born January 25, 1991), Storm Brieann Sixx (born April 14, 1994), and Decker Nilsson Sixx (born May 23, 1995).

One month after the divorce from Brandt, Sixx married his second wife, actress and Playmate of the Month for September 1995, Donna D&#x27;Errico. Sixx and D&#x27;Errico have one daughter, Frankie-Jean Mary Sixx (born January 2, 2001). D&#x27;Errico has a son, Rhyan (born 1993), from a previous relationship. They separated shortly after their daughter&#x27;s birth, and reconciled months later when Sixx completed rehab. They separated again on April 27, 2006, and divorced in June 2007, with D&#x27;Errico claiming irreconcilable differences.

Sixx dated tattoo artist Kat Von D from 2008 to 2010. A few months after their breakup, Sixx and Von D were spotted back together. Sixx was featured on an episode of Von D&#x27;s reality television show &quot;LA Ink&quot; in 2008, in which Von D gave him a tattoo of Mick Mars, lead guitarist of Mötley Crüe. On August 25, 2010, Sixx issued a statement that their relationship had dissolved. It was reported on October 19, 2010, that Sixx and Von D had got back together. On October 27, 2010 Kat Von D confirmed to &quot;USA Today&quot; that indeed she and West Coast Choppers owner Jesse James were still together, debunking original reports that she and Sixx had reconciled. 

On November 4, 2010, Sixx attended the &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; Launch Party in Santa Monica, California with Courtney Bingham. On November 26, 2012, Nikki revealed to the public that he proposed to Bingham while vacationing in St. Barts. They were married on March 15, 2014.

Bingham gave birth to their first child together, Ruby Sixx on July 27, 2019. Sixx announced the birth through social media.

Sixx practices Transcendental Meditation, as he considers it an important self-help technique.

During an interview with &quot;Wall of Sound,&quot; Sixx revealed he is working on a children&#x27;s book with his wife and a coffee table poetry/photography book.

==Radio shows==
Launched on February 8, 2010, &quot;Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx&quot; broadcasts Monday through Friday from 7 p.m. to midnight local time on rock/alternative music stations. Each night, host Nikki Sixx discusses music and lifestyle topics as he gives listeners a backstage look at the world and mind of a rock star. Sixx was joined by co-host Kerri Kasem, from its first episode until March 28, 2014. On April 2, it was announced that radio personality Jenn Marino would be joining the show in Kasem&#x27;s place. The show is based in Dallas, Texas in a studio in the Northpark Center.

Starting on May 7, 2012, KEGL in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas moved the show to mornings, making it the only station to carry the show in the mornings at 6 to 10 AM local time instead of the evening&#x27;s time slot. The show is customized for the Dallas/Fort Worth listeners for broadcast in the mornings on KEGL. Sixx said that bringing Sixx Sense to mornings &quot;has always been our goal. Who better to start your morning with than a rock star and a hot chick? It&#x27;s a dream come true to have a morning show on one of America&#x27;s best rock stations.&quot; however, one year later, Sixx Sense returned to evenings at KEGL. In addition, recent episodes of &quot;Sixx Sense&quot; air 24/7 on its own iHeartRadio streaming page.

&quot;The Side Show with Nikki Sixx&quot; is a two-hour original weekend program. Airing Saturday or Sunday between 6 a.m. and midnight local time, Nikki Sixx will air top-charting songs, showcase new and emerging artists, and welcome guests from the worlds of music and entertainment. In October 2017 Sixx announced he would step down from &quot;Sixx Sense&quot; on December 31, 2017.

==Running Wild in the Night==
With the formation of Sixx:A.M. and the release of &quot;The Heroin Diaries&quot;, Nikki Sixx teamed up with an already existing charity known as the Covenant House and created his own branch called Running Wild in the Night. In addition to partially funding the services the Covenant House provides on its own, Sixx&#x27;s division also provides a creative arts and music program. Sixx has negotiated with people in his industry to provide the program with musical instruments and software.

A Portion of the profits from Sixx:A.M.&#x27;s album &quot;The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack&quot; and his autobiography, &quot;The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star&quot; is donated to help the Covenant House. He continues to auction off personal items to fund Running Wild in the Night. As of April 2009, he had raised over $100,000.

<doc id="196591" wikidata="Q319980" url="?curid=196591" title="Gene Krupa">
<text>Eugene Bertram Krupa (January 15, 1909 – October 16, 1973) was an American jazz drummer, bandleader, and composer. Krupa is widely regarded as one of the most influential drummers in the history of popular music. His drum solo on Benny Goodman&#x27;s 1937 recording of &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; elevated the role of the drummer from that of an accompanist to that of an important solo voice in the band.

In collaboration with the Slingerland drum- and Zildjian cymbal-manufacturers, he became a major force in defining the standard band-drummer&#x27;s kit. &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine regards Krupa as &quot;the founding father of modern drumset playing&quot;.

Upon his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; labeled Krupa a &quot;revolutionary&quot; known for &quot;frenzied, flashy&quot; drumming, with his work having generated a significant musical legacy that started &quot;in jazz and has continued on through the rock era&quot;.

==Early life==
The youngest of Anna (née Oslowski) and Bartłomiej Krupa&#x27;s nine children, Gene Krupa was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Bartłomiej was an immigrant from Poland born in the village of Łęki Górne, southeastern Poland. Anna was born in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and was also of Polish descent. His parents were Roman Catholics who groomed him for the priesthood. He spent his grammar school days at parochial schools. He attended James H. Bowen High School on Chicago&#x27;s southeast side. After graduation, he attended Saint Joseph&#x27;s College for a year but decided the priesthood was not his vocation.

Krupa studied with Sanford A. Moeller, and began playing drums professionally in the mid-1920s with bands in Wisconsin. In 1927, he was hired by MCA to become a member of Thelma Terry and Her Playboys, the first notable American jazz band to be led by a female musician (except all-female bands). The Playboys were the house band at the Golden Pumpkin nightclub in Chicago and toured throughout the eastern and central United States.

==Career==

Krupa made his first recordings in 1927 with a band under the leadership of Red McKenzie and guitarist Eddie Condon. Along with other recordings by musicians from the Chicago jazz scene, such as Bix Beiderbecke, these recordings are examples of Chicago style jazz. Krupa&#x27;s influences during this time included Father Ildefonse Rapp and Roy Knapp (both teachers of his), and drummers Tubby Hall, Zutty Singleton and Baby Dodds. Press rolls (dragging one stick across the snare head while keeping the beat with the other stick) were a fairly common technique in the early stages of his development. There were many other drummers (Ray Bauduc, Chick Webb, George Wettling, Dave Tough) who influenced his approach to drumming and other instrumentalists and composers such as Frederick Delius who influenced his approach to music.

Krupa appeared on six recordings by the Thelma Terry band in 1928. In December 1934, he joined Benny Goodman&#x27;s band, where his drum work made him a national celebrity. His tom-tom interludes on the hit &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; were the first extended drum solos to be recorded commercially. But conflict with Goodman prompted him to leave the group and form his own orchestra shortly after the Carnegie Hall concert in January 1938. He appeared in the 1941 film &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, in which he and his band performed an extended version of the hit &quot;Drum Boogie&quot; (composed by Krupa and Roy Eldridge), sung by Martha Tilton and lip-synced by Barbara Stanwyck.

In 1943, Krupa was arrested on a falsified marijuana (cannabis) drug charge; this resulted in a short jail sentence, and the breakup of his orchestra. After Krupa broke up his orchestra he returned to Goodman&#x27;s band for a few months. When Goodman wanted him to go on a west coast tour, Krupa declined. He then joined Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s band for several months and then put together his next orchestra. He performed an uncredited drum riff in a montage sequence in the (1946) Oscar winning movie ‘’The Best Years of Our Lives’’.

As the 1940s ended, Count Basie closed his band and Woody Herman reduced his band to an octet. In 1951, Krupa cut down the size of his band to a ten-piece for a short while and from 1952 on he led trios, then quartets, often with Charlie Ventura then Eddie Shu on tenor sax, clarinet, and harmonica. He appeared regularly in the Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts. In the 1950s, Krupa returned to Hollywood to appear in the films &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; and &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot;. In 1959, the movie biography &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot; was released; Sal Mineo portrayed Krupa, and the film included cameos by Anita O&#x27;Day and Red Nichols. 

During the 1950s and 1960s, Krupa often played at the Metropole near Times Square in Manhattan and by 1956 his recordings were showcased on national radio networks by Ben Selvin within the RCA Thesaurus transcriptions library. He continued to perform in famous clubs in the 1960s, including the Showboat Lounge in northwest Washington, D.C. With peer Cozy Cole, Gene started a music school in 1954 that carried on into the 1960s. Some of the school&#x27;s students included Peter Criss of KISS and Jerry Nolan of The New York Dolls. Doug Clifford of Creedence Clearwater Revival cited Krupa as an inspiration. 

Krupa was still busy in the early 1970s until shortly before his death. That included several reunion concerts of the original Benny Goodman Quartette. On April 17, 1973, the Gene Krupa Quartet, composed of Eddie Shu (tenor and clarinet), John Bunch (piano), Nabil Totah (Bass) and Krupa (drums), recorded a live performance at the New School featuring the Louis Prima composition &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot;.

His compositions which he wrote or co-wrote included &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; in 1939, &quot;Drum Boogie&quot;, &quot;Boogie Blues&quot;, his theme song &quot;Apurksody&quot;, &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, &quot;Disc Jockey Jump&quot; with Gerry Mulligan, &quot;Wire Brush Stomp&quot;, &quot;Hippdeebip&quot;, &quot;Krupa&#x27;s Wail&quot;, &quot;Swing is Here&quot;, &quot;Quiet and Roll &#x27;Em&quot; with Sam Donahue, &quot;Bolero at the Savoy&quot;, &quot;Murdy Purdy&quot;, and &quot;How &#x27;Bout That Mess&quot;.

===Krupa-Rich drum battles===
Norman Granz hired Krupa and drummer Buddy Rich for his Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts. The two drummers performed at Carnegie Hall in September 1952 and it was issued by Verve as &quot;The Drum Battle&quot;. The two drummers faced off in a number of television broadcasts and other venues and often played similar duets with drummer Cozy Cole. Krupa and Rich recorded two studio albums together: &quot;Krupa and Rich&quot; (Verve, 1955) and &quot;Burnin&#x27; Beat&quot; (Verve, 1962).

==Personal life==
Krupa married Ethel Maguire twice: the first marriage lasted from 1934 to 1942, the second from 1946 to her death in 1955. He remarried in 1959 to Patty Bowler and they were divorced within ten years.

In the early 1970s, Krupa&#x27;s house in Yonkers, New York, was damaged by fire. He continued to live in the parts of the house that were habitable.

In 1973, Krupa died in Yonkers at the age 64 from heart failure, though he also had leukemia and emphysema. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Calumet City, Illinois.

==Endorsement==

In the 1930s, Krupa became the first endorser of Slingerland drums. At Krupa&#x27;s urging, Slingerland developed tom-toms with tuneable top and bottom heads, which immediately became important elements of virtually every drummer&#x27;s setup. Krupa developed and popularized many of the cymbal techniques that became standard. His collaboration with Avedis Zildjian developed the modern hi-hat cymbals and standardized the names and uses of the ride cymbal, crash cymbal and splash cymbal. He is also credited with helping to formulate the modern drum set, being one of the first jazz drummers to use a bass drum in a recording session 
(December 1927). One of his bass drums, a Slingerland 14×26, inscribed with Benny Goodman&#x27;s and Krupa&#x27;s initials, is preserved at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

==Awards and honors==
In 1978, Krupa became the first drummer inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame. The 1937 recording of Louis Prima&#x27;s &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)&quot; combined with Fats Waller&#x27;s &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; by Benny Goodman and His Orchestra featuring Krupa on drums was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1982.

Apollo 440&#x27;s 1996 hit single &quot;Krupa&quot; is a tribute to Gene Krupa.

==Legacy and posthumous information==
Roy Knapp affirmed: &quot;There is not a professional drummer, percussionist or other instrumentalist who does not in some way owe something and should be grateful to Gene Krupa for his imaginative and creative contributions in the modern drum techniques and styles in performance that we are using today&quot;. Buddy Rich, who cited Krupa as one of his biggest influences, stated: &quot;Gene Krupa was the beginning and the &#x27;end&#x27; of all drummers&quot; . He&#x27;s a great genius - a truly great genius of the drums. Gene discovered things that could be done with the drums that hadn&#x27;t been done before, ever. ... Before Gene, the drums were in the background, just a part of the band. To put it in plainer terms, the drums didn&#x27;t have much - meaning. Along comes Gene and the drums take on meaning and they&#x27;re out of the background. The drummer becomes somebody ... Gene gets credit for making people aware of the drummer - of what he&#x27;s doing and why he&#x27;s doing it and he deserves every bit of that credit&quot;. Jim Chapin defined him as &quot;a charismatic figure that made the public fully conscious of drummers&quot;.

Music critics such as Charles Waring have remarked that Krupa&#x27;s methods of performing, particularly his flamboyant charisma and use of solos, evolved into the approach taken by rock drummers such as John Bonham, Bill Ward and Keith Moon. Ian Paice and Carl Palmer claimed they started to play the drums at early age after listening to Krupa. Guitarist Dick Dale, who also played the percussions in the early days, was a Krupa fan and said his guitar sound and rhythm come from Krupa&#x27;s drumming.

<text>Óscar Arias Sánchez (; born 13 September 1940 in Heredia, Costa Rica) is a Costa Rican activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. He was President of Costa Rica from 1986 to 1990 and from 2006 to 2010.

Arias was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his proposal of a negotiated solution to the Central American crisis. He sought the support of the Contadora group for his plan, which involved the removal of all foreign powers from the region, an end to aid for antigovernment guerrillas in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and the implementation of democratic principles and a compromise peace for social reconstruction. Although his plan was not officially adopted, its key concepts were later reflected in the settlements in El Salvador (1990-1993) and Nicaragua (1989-1990).

He was also a recipient of the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism and a trustee of Economists for Peace and Security. In 2003, he was elected to the board of directors of the International Criminal Court&#x27;s Trust Fund for Victims.

==Early life==
Arias was born into an upper-class family in the province of Heredia. Arias concluded his secondary schooling at the Saint Francis College in the capital city of San José. He then went to the United States and enrolled in Boston University with the intention of studying medicine, but he soon returned to his home country and completed degrees in law and economics at the University of Costa Rica. In 1967, Arias traveled to the United Kingdom and enrolled in the London School of Economics. He received a doctoral degree in political science from the University of Essex in 1974.

==First presidency ==

Arias joined the National Liberation Party (PLN), Costa Rica&#x27;s main social democratic party. In 1986 he ran successfully for president on that party&#x27;s ticket. Arias&#x27;s presidency saw the transformation of Costa Rica&#x27;s economy from one based on the traditional cash crops (coffee and bananas) to one more focused on non-traditional agriculture (e.g., of exotic flowers and fruits) and tourism. Some within the PLN criticized his administration for abandoning the party&#x27;s social democratic teachings and promoting a neoliberal economic model. He is now often regarded as a neoliberal although he is a member of a nominally social democratic party.

Arias received the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize with the help of John Biehl, his peer in England, and Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto for his work towards the signing of the Esquipulas II Accords. This was a plan intended to promote democracy and peace on the Central American isthmus during a time of great turmoil: leftist guerrillas were fighting against the governments in El Salvador and Guatemala, which were backed by the United States under the auspices of the Cold War; the Contras, supported by the United States, were fighting an insurgency against the Sandinista in Nicaragua; Honduras, only recently wresting political power from its military, was caught in the middle as a base for U.S. military forces; and on Costa Rica&#x27;s other border, Panama faced the oppression of Manuel Noriega&#x27;s military dictatorship. With the support of Arias, the various armed conflicts ended within the decade (Guatemala&#x27;s civil war finally ended in 1996).

Arias then called for a higher level of integration in the Central America region and promoted the creation of the Central American Parliament (&quot;Parlamento Centroamericano&quot;). During his current administration, Arias has declared that Costa Rica will not enter the Central American Parliament. Arias also modified the country&#x27;s educational system. The most notable action in this respect was the reintroduction of standardized academic tests at the end of primary and secondary school.

==Second presidency==
The Costa Rican constitution had been amended in 1969 to include a clause forbidding former presidents to seek re-election. Arias challenged this at the Sala IV, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica, which initially rejected his application in September 2000. In 2003, a group of Arias supporters presented an unconstitutionality challenge against the 1969 constitutional amendment forbidding re-election, and this time the ruling in April 2003 struck down the prohibition against non-consecutive re-election. This decision was denounced as a &quot;state blow&quot; or &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by ex-president Luis Alberto Monge.

Arias announced in 2004 that he intended to run again for president in the February 2006 general elections. By then, he was the only living former president who was not either in jail, under indictment or facing an investigation. Though for years private polling companies and several news media published polls predicting Arias would win by a wide margin, the election was initially deemed too close to call. A month later, on 7 March, after a manual recount, the official results showed Arias beat center-left contender Ottón Solís by 18,169 votes (1.2% of valid votes cast), and finished just a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold required to capture the presidency in a single round. He took the oath of office at noon on 8 May 2006 at the National Stadium. In his speech on 15 September 2008, he admitted that he was tired because of the criticism of his opponents.

On 1 June 2007, he switched Costa Rica&#x27;s diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, making Costa Rica the 167th nation in the world to do so. Subsequently, under diplomatic and financial pressure from Beijing, he induced the Dalai Lama, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, to postpone indefinitely a proposed and much anticipated visit during Beijing&#x27;s suppression of controversial riots in Tibet.

At the 5th Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, on 18 April 2009, Arias gave a speech on the topic &quot;We&#x27;ve been doing something wrong&quot;. Directed at fellow Latin American leaders, he decried Latin America&#x27;s lack of development compared to other parts of the world, calling for pragmatism, and more resources directed at education rather than militaries.

===Mediator in 2009 Honduran Constitutional Crisis===
In 2009, the Supreme Court of Honduras issued an arrest warrant for Honduran President Manuel Zelaya because of violations of the constitution and laws. Two days later, the National Congress of Honduras (in which Zelaya&#x27;s own party held 62 out of 128 seats, more than any other party), also voted to dismiss Zelaya.
Zelaya fled to Costa Rica. The Honduran constitution mandated that the head of Congress, Roberto Micheletti, who was next in the presidential line of succession, becomes the provisional head of state since Vice President Elvin Ernesto Santos had resigned in December 2008 to run for president. Micheletti&#x27;s term ended 27 January 2010.

Arias began serving as mediator between Zelaya and Micheletti in the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. Representatives of the two Hondurans met with Arias on various occasions but so far have failed to reach any kind of agreement. As described above (with factual citations), Arias himself was initially prohibited by Costa Rica&#x27;s constitutional court from another term, due to constitutional term limits, but this was reversed using legal means, with the consent of the Costa Rican Sala IV court, unlike in Honduras. New elections in Honduras are planned for 29 November 2009. Micheletti&#x27;s government stated on 2 July 2009 that it is willing to hold this year&#x27;s presidential election early. Arias presented a seven-point agreement, which calls for the return of Zelaya as president – a condition deemed unacceptable to the interim government. Zelaya&#x27;s representatives accepted the Arias proposal &quot;in principle&quot; but Micheletti&#x27;s representatives balked at the key point of Zelaya returning to power in Honduras.

== Health ==
In August 2007, Arias was affected by tendinitis, and in April 2008 he canceled some activities because of muscular pain in his lumbar region. Subsequently, due to increasing difficulty in speaking over the course of several weeks, Arias went to the Philadelphia Ears, Nose and Throat Associates medical center in the United States on 20 May 2008, where it was determined that he had a nonmalignant cyst on his vocal cords. As a result, it was announced on 21 May that doctors advised him not to speak for one month, saying that if this did not help, surgery would be considered. On 11 August 2009 Arias was diagnosed with H1N1 Influenza, but he recovered.

==Controversy==
Some of Arias’s actions have generated controversy:
*In 2004, in response to a rival candidate (Antonio Álvarez) for his party&#x27;s nomination challenging him to a debate, Oscar Arias said: &quot;Eagles live in high places, and make a serious mistake if they go down to the mud to fight with snails.&quot;
*In 2010, during the closing weeks of his second term, he inaugurated various unachieved projects with ribbon-cutting and bronze plaque ceremonies:
**The new National Stadium, despite the fact that it was only about 75% finished.
**The &quot;new presidential offices&quot; despite the fact that these offices do not exist yet. In fact, the land is still for sale and the Legislative Assembly has allocated no funds yet in order to buy it, let alone build anything on the vacant lot.
**The new Juan Santamaría International Airport installation, despite the fact the project was only 82% completed.

Further controversies followed him even after his role as a president had come to an end. The route from Escazú to Caldera built by the Spanish company Autopistas del Sol has undergone heavy criticism over the years for its high tolls and dangerous roads (which had to undergo heavy maintenance to prevent further rock slides). Oscar Arias was also blamed for having invited a Canadian corporation to perform heavy mining which could potentially compromise the local biodiversity. Their permissions were revoked during the Chinchilla Miranda administration which gave the impression of Arias-Chinchilla enmity following his sudden criticism of then president Laura Chinchilla Miranda who was popularly regarded as a successor.

==Judicial accusations==

In 2017 Costa Rica&#x27;s General Attorney office indicted Arias for the Crucitas case, a case in which former Environment Minister Roberto Dobles and Arias as president signed a 2008 decree ceding the Canadian company Infinito Gold control over a protected area near the Nicaraguan border known as Crucitas for gold mining and declaring it &quot;national interest&quot;, something that the Prosecution argued was illegal as protected areas cannot be granted for exploitation of any kind. Dobles was previously found guilty of the charges, but Arias was not indicted alongside him by the previous General Attorney Jorge Chavarría (often accused of being close to Arias). The new General Attorney Emilia Navas reopened the case indicting Arias.

Also in 2019 psychiatrist and anti-Nuclear activist Alexandra Arce von Herold formally accused Arias of rape at the Public Ministry. Following her allegation three more women came to light accusing Arias of sexual harassment and misconduct. Arias denied the charges. In December 2020, all sexual harassment charges against Arias were dismissed.

=== Definitive acquittal and dismissal ===
After more than a year of investigations, and in the absence of evidence, the cases were dismissed by the prosecution. Due to the request of the two complainants, requiring, therefore, the revocation of the instance and subsequent dismissal. The definitive dismissal was ordered by Judge Natalia Rodríguez Solís, of the Pavas Criminal Court.

Regarding the &quot;Crucitas&quot; case, in October 2019 the former president was completely released from the case, according to a judicial resolution. 

== Recognitions and awards ==
Arias has received over fifty honorary degrees, including doctorates from Harvard University, Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Oberlin College, Wake Forest University, Ithaca College and Washington University in St. Louis.

Among the main awards received are:

* Premio de la Paz Martin Luther King Jr.
* Medalla de la Libertad de Filadelfia.
* Premio Jackson Ralston.
* Premio Principe de Asturias.
* Premio Humanitario Albert Schweitzer.
* Premio de las Américas.

Arias is descended from Ana Cardoso, an enslaved woman from Cartago.

<text>Edward Malcolm Korry (January 7, 1922 – January 29, 2003) was an American diplomat during the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.

Korry, a native of New York City, was U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia (1963-1967) and to Chile (1967–1971). During the Allende administration, the U.S. under Nixon implemented a tougher economic policy toward Chile, decreased economic aid, and prevented access to loans. The US support for the opposition culminated in the September 11th, 1973 coup that overthrew Allende, and resulted in the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.

Prior to his appointment to Ethiopia by John F. Kennedy, Korry was European editor for &quot;Look&quot; magazine and a United Press correspondent and European Editor in post-World War II Europe. In 1954, Korry became the Chief United Press Correspondent for Europe after working as in the same position for Eastern Europe and as United Press Manager for Germany and France. Korry graduated from Washington and Lee University. He joined the Foreign Service in 1939 after serving as a consultant to the Undersecretary of State and as a public member of one of the Foreign Service selection boards in 1962. In 1972 and 1973, he was president of the Association of American Publishers, and later, he was president of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. Korry was also a founding director of the Committee for East-West Relations and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Korry fought to preserve his reputation against widespread press reports, many of them by journalists who had been his peers and friends during his reportorial career, and who colluded or sourced their information from staff members of Senator Church’s Committee to the effect that he had played an instrumental role in a military coup to depose and kill Allende, despite Korry&#x27;s repeated public claims that he had known nothing of the CIA&#x27;s plans to foment this, nor had he played any role in it. In 1981, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in what &quot;Time&quot; magazine called a &quot;2,300-word correction,&quot; wrote that although the CIA had attempted to orchestrate a military takeover in Chile, &quot;none of this, it is now evident, was known to Ambassador Korry&quot;. This &quot;correction&quot; occurred while Korry was teaching a course on International Relations at Connecticut College in New London, CT.

Korry died from cancer on January 29, 2003 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

<doc id="196627" wikidata="Q5294731" url="?curid=196627" title="Donald M. Kendall">
<text>Donald Mcintosh Kendall (March 16, 1921 – September 19, 2020) was an American businessman and political adviser. He was CEO of Pepsi Cola (which merged with Herman Lay&#x27;s Frito Lay, Inc. to become PepsiCo in 1965), and CEO of PepsiCo from 1971 to 1986.

==Early life==
Donald Kendall was born in Clallam County, Washington, where his family owned a dairy farm, in 1921.

==Military service==
In 1942 Kendall joined the U.S. Navy. As a Navy Catalina PBY seaplane pilot he assisted in the Landings at Manila Bay, Mindoro, and Leyte Gulf. He was awarded 3 Air Medals and a Distinguished Flying Cross.

==Education==
Kendall attended Western Kentucky State College. He was the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate of Law Degree from Stetson University, DeLand, Florida; an Honorary Doctorate of Law Degree from Babson College, Wellesley, Massachusetts; and a Doctor of Law from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. Kendall also received Doctor of Humane Letters degrees from Mercy College, Dobbs Ferry, New York; Manhattanville College, Purchase, New York; the State University of New York (SUNY) Purchase; and Long Island University, Brookville, New York.

==Pepsi Cola, Inc.==
Kendall joined the Pepsi Cola Company in 1947, working at a bottling plant in New Rochelle, New York. After a later stint as a delivery driver, Kendall became a sales representative and rose through the sales ranks becoming a marketing vice president in 1956. He headed up Pepsi&#x27;s international operation in 1957 and became the CEO in 1963. In 1963, he made the decision to change the name of Pepsi&#x27;s diet soda from Patio Diet Cola to Diet Pepsi. In the early years of diet soft drinks, Pepsi became the first major soda manufacturer to give its diet product the same name as its flagship product. 

Kendall brought Pepsi to Russia and was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, in 2004. He oversaw the creation of the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens, a sculpture park that includes gardens, trails, parks, and a collection of art, primarily 20th century sculpture including works by Auguste Rodin, David Wynne, Alberto Giacometti, and Alexander Calder, at PepsiCo&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Purchase, New York.

== Board memberships ==
Kendall sat on numerous corporate boards including the Director of Enfrastructure, Inc., Buy.com, AmRest Holdings SE, National Alliance of Businessmen, and Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. He was also the main investor of American Giant, a clothing manufacturing company.

== Chile ==
In 1970, Kendall requested and participated in a high-level meeting of Chilean businessman and publisher 
Agustín Edwards Eastman of the Edwards family with high Nixon administration officials, after which President Nixon met with then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and CIA Director Richard Helms and, in the words of a 1976 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, said &quot;that Chile was to be saved from Salvador Allende and he didn&#x27;t care much how.&quot;

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;:...the October 1970 plot against Chile&#x27;s President-elect Salvador Allende ... was the direct result of a plea for action a month earlier by Donald Kendall, chairman of PepsiCo, in two telephone calls to the company&#x27;s former lawyer, President Richard Nixon. Kendall arranged for the owner of the company&#x27;s Chilean bottling operation to meet National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger on September 15. Hours later, Nixon called in his CIA chief, Richard Helms, and, according to Helms&#x27;s handwritten notes, ordered the CIA to prevent Allende&#x27;s inauguration.

== Joan Crawford ==
Kendall had a stormy professional relationship with actress Joan Crawford, who referred to Kendall as &quot;Fang&quot; until her death in 1977. Crawford gained a seat on the board of directors of Pepsi Cola Company after the death of her husband Alfred Steele, who was the chairman of the board of Pepsi, in 1959. She was active in promoting Pepsi-Cola, traveling both nationally and internationally for events such as plant openings and new product promotions. In 1973, when Crawford officially turned 65 (she was actually two years older born in 1906), she was forcibly retired from her position on the company&#x27;s board of directors. 

== Richard Nixon ==
Kendall was well acquainted with Richard Nixon and was photographed with Nixon as vice president, and with Nikita Khrushchev during Nixon&#x27;s Moscow trip known for the Kitchen Debate. During the Nixon administration Pepsi Cola was always a prominent beverage at White House functions. A conversation between Kendall and Nixon in the Oval Office appears in the second volume of the Watergate tapes. Kendall is heard offering advice to Nixon on how to handle his difficult situation. He later told an interviewer that he was &quot;disappointed&quot; at the way Nixon handled Watergate. &quot;How could you help but be?&quot;

== Death ==
Kendall died on September 19, 2020, at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 99 years.

== Recognition ==
*1989, George F. Kennan Award for outstanding contribution to improving U.S. Soviet relations
*1987, National Business Hall of Fame
*1986, the inaugural recipient of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund’s Equal Justice Award
*1979, Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Olivia de Havilland

<doc id="196636" wikidata="Q184665" url="?curid=196636" title="Ten thousand years">
<text>In various East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, the phrase &quot;Wànsuì&quot;, &quot;Banzai&quot;, &quot;Manse&quot;, and &quot;Vạn tuế&quot;, respectively, meaning &quot;myriad years&quot; is used to wish long life, and is typically translated as &quot;Long live&quot; in English. The phrase originated in ancient China as an expression used to wish long life to the emperor. Due to the historical political and cultural influence of Chinese culture on the East Asian cultural sphere, in the area, and in particular of the Classical Chinese language, cognates with similar meanings and usage patterns have appeared in many East Asian languages and Vietnamese. In some countries, this phrase is mundanely used when expressing feeling of triumph, typically shouted by crowds.

==China==

In Chinese, ten thousand or &quot;myriad&quot; is the largest numerical order of magnitude in common usage, and is used ubiquitously as a synonym for &quot;indefinitely large number&quot;. The term &quot;wansui&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;ten thousand years&quot;, is thus used to describe a very long life, or even immortality for a person.

Although the First Emperor of Qin also wished &quot;ten thousand generations&quot; &quot;(万世)&quot; for his imperial rule, the use of &quot;wansui&quot; was probably coined during Han dynasty. In 110 BC, Emperor Wu of Han was addressed by the phrase &quot;Wansui&quot; during a heaven ritual on Mount Song. According to legend, Mount Song itself called out the phrase to address the emperor. During the Tang dynasty, it came to be used exclusively to address the emperor as a prayer for his long life and reign. Then, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, its use was temporarily extended to include certain higher-ranking members of the imperial court, but this tradition was relatively short-lived: in later imperial history, using it to address someone other than the emperor was considered an act of sedition and was consequently highly dangerous. During certain reigns of weak emperors, powerful eunuchs such as Liu Jin and Wei Zhongxian circumvented this restriction by styling themselves with &quot;jiǔ qiān suì&quot; (, literally &quot;9,000 years&quot;) so as to display their high positions, which were close to or even exceeded the emperor&#x27;s, while still remaining reverent to the title of the emperor.

Traditionally, empresses consort and empresses dowager were addressed with &quot;thousand years&quot; () rather than &quot;ten thousand years&quot;, which was reserved for the emperor exclusively. However, Empress Dowager Cixi, the &quot;de facto&quot; supreme ruler of China from 1861 to 1908, was addressed with &quot;ten thousand years&quot;. Several photographs of her show a banner on her litter reading &quot;The Incumbent Holy Mother, the Empress Dowager of the Great Qing, [will live and reign for] ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand of ten thousand years&quot; (). The Emperor was addressed by the title &quot;Lord of Ten Thousand Years&quot; ().

===Usage===

Classically, the phrase &quot;wansui&quot; is repeated multiple times following a person&#x27;s name or title. For example, in ancient China, the Emperor would be addressed with (). The foregoing phrase is best known to modern Chinese through televised films, but is not historically accurate; in the Ming dynasty, the only occasion during which is used is the great court, which was held one to three times a year. Approaching the end of the ceremony, the attending officials will be asked to shout three times.

The significance of &quot;ten thousand&quot; in this context is that &quot;ten thousand&quot; in Chinese and many other East Asian languages represents the largest discrete unit in the counting system, in a manner analogous to &quot;thousand&quot; in English. Thus 100,000 in Chinese is expressed as 10 ten-thousands; similarly, whereas a million is &quot;a thousand thousands&quot; in Western languages, the Chinese word for it is &quot;bǎiwàn&quot; (), which literally means &quot;hundred ten-thousands&quot;. Because of this, Chinese people often use &quot;wàn&quot; in a manner analogous to &quot;thousand&quot; – whereas an English speaker might exclaim &quot;there are thousands of ants on the ground&quot;, the Chinese speaker would substitute it with &quot;ten thousand&quot; in the description. So in the context of &quot;wànsuì&quot;, a literally incorrect but culturally appropriate translation might be, &quot;may you live for thousands of years&quot;. The number simply denotes innumerability, in a manner etymologically similar to the Greek myriad (although the current usage of that word differs).

During the Qing, at the entrances of mosques in China, a tablet was placed upon which the characters for &quot;Huangdi, wansui, wansui, wanwansui&quot; (皇帝萬歲，萬歲，萬萬歲) were inscribed, which means, &quot;The Emperor, may he live forever&quot;. Westerners traveling in China noted the presence of these tablets at mosques in Yunnan and Ningbo.

===Modern use===
During the Battle of Sihang Warehouse in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese civilians voluntarily cheered &quot;Zhōnghuá Mínguó wànsuì!&quot; () after raising the Flag of the Republic of China on a flag-raising ceremony, to celebrate their victory over the Japanese.

In August 1945, after Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek announced the defeat of Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the people exclaimed &quot;Jiǎng... Zhōngguó... Wànsuì... Wànwànsuì!&quot; (蔣...中國...萬歲...萬萬歲!), which means, &quot;Chiang ... China ... live ten thousand years ... live ten thousand ten thousand years&quot;.
One of the most conspicuous uses of the phrase is at the Tiananmen gate in Beijing, where large placards are affixed to the gatehouse reading &quot;; ) and &quot;; ).

During the Cultural Revolution, the saying () was also common. After Mao&#x27;s death, the phrase has never been used for any individual. Apart from these special cases, the phrase is almost never used in political slogans today. In casual conversation, however, the phrase is used simply as an exclamation of joy. For example, CCTV commentator Huang Jianxiang shouted &quot;Yìdàlì wànsuì&quot; (; translated as &quot;Forza Italia!&quot; by some media) after Francesco Totti’s goal during Italy’s match against Australia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Taiwan-based singer Leehom Wang&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Change Me&quot; contains a song called &quot;&quot; ().

Within the Republic of China, shouting the phrase ; , translated as &quot;Long Live the Republic of China&quot;!) has been the final act ending presidential speeches on the National Day of the Republic of China, a tradition which was broken in 2016. It has been combined in recent years with another saying, (, translated as &quot;Long Live the Democratic Taiwan!&quot;) When this is said, everyone raises their right fists while standing.

In Cantonese, &quot;ten thousand years&quot; () can also be a slang term for treating others to foods and drinks.

The Chinese term was introduced to Japan as &quot;banzai&quot; (Kana: ; Kanji: ) as early as the 8th century, and was used to express respect for the Emperor in much the same manner as the Chinese term.

Even earlier, however, according to the &quot;Nihongi&quot;, during the reign of Empress Kōgyoku, A.D. 642, 8th Month, 1st Day:The Emperor made a progress to the river source of Minabuchi. Here, (s)he knelt down and prayed, worshipping towards the four quarters and looking up to the Heaven. Straightway there was thunder and a great rain, which eventually fell for 5 days, and plentifully bedewed the Empire. Hereupon the peasantry throughout the Empire cried with one voice: &quot;Banzai&quot; and said &quot;an Emperor of exceeding virtue&quot;.

&quot;Banzei&quot; was later revived as &quot;banzai&quot; (Kana: ばんざい) after the Meiji Restoration. &quot;Banzai&quot; as a formal ritual was established in the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution in 1889 when university students shouted &quot;banzai&quot; in front of the Emperor&#x27;s carriage.

Around the same time, &quot;banzai&quot; also came to be used in contexts unrelated to the Emperor. The supporters of the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement, for example, began to shout &quot;Jiyū banzai&quot; (Kanji: 自由万歳; Kana: じゆうばんざい, or, roughly, &quot;Long Live Freedom&quot;) in 1883.

During World War II, &quot;banzai&quot; or its full form served as a battle cry of sorts for Japanese soldiers. Ideally, &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots would shout &quot;banzai!&quot; as they rammed their planes into enemy ships; although Japanese popular culture has portrayed this romanticized scene, it is unknown if any pilot actually did so. Its confirmed use by ground troops, however, was heard in numerous battles during the Pacific Campaign, when Japanese infantry units attacked Allied positions. As a result, the term &quot;banzai charge&quot; (or alternatively &quot;banzai attack&quot;) gained common currency among English-speaking soldiers and remains the most widely understood context of the term in the West to this day.

===Modern use===
Traditionally, &quot;banzai&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;hurrah&quot;, literally translated as &quot;ten thousand years&quot;) was an expression of enthusiasm, and crowds shouting the word three times, arms stretched out above their heads, could be considered the traditional Japanese form of applause. More formally, the word is shouted three times during the dissolution of the House of Representatives, and also as an acclamation at the enthronement of the Japanese Emperor.

==Korea==

The same term is pronounced &quot;manse&quot; () in Korean. In Silla, it was used as a casual exclamation. It was a part of the era name of Taebong, one of the Later Three Kingdoms declared by the king Gung Ye in 911. During Joseon, Koreans used &quot;cheonse&quot; (, &quot;one thousand years&quot;) in deference to the Chinese emperor&#x27;s ten thousand years.

In the 20th century, various protests against Japanese occupation used the term in their names, including a pro-independence newspaper established in 1906, the March 1st Movement of 1919, and the June 10th Movement of 1926.

In North Korea, &quot;manse&quot; was used to wish long life for both Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, and for the political principles of their predecessor, Kim Il Sung. Today, the word is usually chanted whenever Kim Jong Un appeared in front of the public, accompanied by clapping. Akin to the &quot;banzai charge&quot; used by Japanese servicemen during the Pacific War, the Korean People&#x27;s Army used &quot;Widaehan Suryŏng Kim Ilsŏng Janggun Manse!&quot; (위대한 수령 김일성장군 만세; 偉大한 首領 金日成將軍 萬歲; &quot;Long live the Great Leader, General Kim Il-sung&quot;) as a charge mantra during the Korean War.

It is also used as a casual proclamation, commonly used as the English equivalent of &quot;Victory.&quot;

== Vietnam ==

In Vietnamese, &quot;vạn tuế&quot; is the phrase cognate to the Chinese &quot;wàn suì&quot; and is the Sino-Vietnamese reading of . However, this word is rarely used in the modern language, appearing instead only in Hán văn and pre-1945 related contexts (such as in &quot;vạn tuế, vạn tuế, vạn vạn tuế&quot;—compare to the Chinese usage, above). In other situations, &quot;muôn năm&quot; is used instead, and is frequently heard in communist slogans, such as &quot;Hồ Chủ tịch Muôn năm!&quot; (Long live President Hồ) and &quot;Đảng Cộng sản Việt Nam Quang vinh Muôn năm!&quot; (Long live the Glorious Communist Party of Vietnam).

&quot;Muôn&quot; is the Old Sino-Vietnamese reading of the chữ Hán 萬 (Sino-Vietnamese reading: &quot;vạn&quot;).

&quot;Tuổi&quot; is the Old Sino-Vietnamese reading of the chữ Hán 歲 (Sino-Vietnamese reading: &quot;tuế&quot;). It is derived from the pronunciation of this character in Middle Chinese.

&quot;Năm&quot; is a native Vietnamese word that inherited from the Proto-Mon-Khmer language (cognates with Khmer and Mon ).

There are many ways to write the words &quot;muôn tuổi&quot;, &quot;muôn năm&quot; in chữ Nôm, for example:
*muôn tuổi: 萬歲, 𨷈𢆫, 𨷈歲, 𲈦歲, 門𢆫, etc.
*muôn năm: 萬年, 𨷈𢆥 (), 㥃[⿰南林], 門南, etc.

<doc id="196637" wikidata="Q2003416" url="?curid=196637" title="Battle of Portland">
<text>The naval Battle of Portland, or Three Days&#x27; Battle, took place during 18–20 February 1653 (28 February – 2 March 1653 (Gregorian calendar)), during the First Anglo-Dutch War, when the fleet of the Commonwealth of England under General at Sea Robert Blake was attacked by a fleet of the Dutch Republic under Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp escorting merchant shipping through the English Channel.

The battle failed to settle supremacy of the English Channel, although both sides claimed victory, and ultimate control over the Channel would only be decided at the Battle of the Gabbard which allowed the English to blockade the Dutch coast until the Battle of Scheveningen, where Admiral Maarten Tromp was killed in a firefight.

==Background==
The First Anglo-Dutch War was caused by friction between the two naval powers of the century, competing for strategic supremacy over the world&#x27;s merchant routes. England and the United Provinces had always been &#x27;natural allies&#x27; against the Habsburgs, as deemed by the Council of State under the rule of Charles I. It has been argued that had Charles I stayed in power the war between the two nations would have never sprung, as he would never have obtained the necessary funding from parliament. However, the rise of the English Parliament under Oliver Cromwell saw the deterioration of diplomacy between the two as the Dutch stadtholder financially supported the Royalists. During the English Civil War, the Dutch had taken advantage of the internal strife within their neighbours, and greatly expanded their maritime presence throughout the world&#x27;s merchant harbours and routes, ultimately even challenging English control in its colonies, and the Dutch even boasted of driving all nations out of the sea. Nonetheless, Cromwell did not challenge the Dutch, still consolidating his power at home.
This changed when Parliamentary armies finally routed the Royalists at the Battle of Worcester, effectively ending the English Civil War. With Cromwell fully in power, the Parliament passed the Navigation Act 1651, requiring all goods destined to English ports to be transported by English ships, which impacted part of the Dutch ability to trade, since they were cut off from all of England&#x27;s colonies in the Americas and elsewhere. Later that year the Parliament gave an order which allowed privateers and warships to seize Dutch shipping. Parliament began to enforce its sovereignty over the &quot;British Seas&quot;, which granted the Royal Navy dominion from the North Sea to Cape Finisterre. The translation of Parliament&#x27;s words into action came when Sir George Ayscue folded Barbados into the Commonwealth and seized 27 Dutch merchantmen.

The Dutch response was divided; the moderate States of Holland pursued a policy of appeasement; but when the negotiations failed and the Navigation Acts were adopted the ferocious Orangist faction became more powerful, and the States General passed a resolution which would allow the Dutch war fleet, to be tripled in size, to protect Dutch interest over the areas in question. This fleet was put under the command of Admiral Maarten Tromp, who had defeated the sixth and final Spanish Armada at the Battle of the Downs, 31 October 1639. That same year, the Dutch signed a treaty with Denmark with the intent to hurt English trade routs. War finally broke out after a confrontation between admirals Robert Blake and Maarten Tromp, May 1652, at the Battle of Dover.

Minor skirmishes followed at the Battle of Plymouth, the Battle of Elba, and the Battle of Kentish Knock. The two fleets met for the first time in a major battle at the Battle of Dungeness, November 1652. The battle turned out to be a failure for the English, forcing them to rethink their naval strategy, led by Admiral Sir Henry Vane and an Admiralty Committee, including developing a tactic that would mark naval warfare for the following century. Taking a page out of the Dutch book the English reorganised each fleet into squadrons for greater tactical control. In fact, the tactic, renamed the line-of-battle tactic, would remain key to English/British naval strategy until the end of the Second World War. The two fleets would meet again off Portland.

==Battle==
During the first days of February 1653, Tromp escorted a convoy of merchant ships through the Channel and put them safely into the Atlantic Ocean. He set to return to his home port, but first anchored off La Rochelle to repair and resupply his ships and waited for expected merchantmen coming from the Atlantic. He attempted to set sail on 20 February with 152 merchantmen, but was held back for three days by high winds and rough seas. On 24 February Tromp finally set sail, entering the area off Portland four days later where he spotted Blake&#x27;s fleet attempting to cut them off. Immediately, Tromp set the signal for a general attack and began the offensive with the wind in his favour as he had the weather gauge.

Tromp&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Brederode&quot;, met Blake&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Triumph&quot;, immediately, sending a broadside at mere metres distance. Turning around, without having received a response from English gunners, he put a second broadside in &quot;Triumph&#x27;s&quot; other side, and finally then delivered a third after turning around again. Blake subsequently veered away and decided to fight at long range. Dutch Commodore De Ruyter was able to attack the English rear and engaged the largest English vessel in the fleet, &quot;Prosperity&quot;, ending in a boarding attempt which was repulsed by the crew of the English vessel the first time around. A second boarding attempt forced the &quot;Prosperity&quot; to surrender thereafter, however. An attempt to reclaim the ship surrounded De Ruyter, but after an intense fight the Dutch commodore was able to fight his way out. The battle continued for the day with heavy fire exchanged by both sides. Later on 28 February Blake sent a squadron of frigates to intercept and claim the Dutch merchantmen off the coast of La Rochelle. Tromp quickly responded by sending his own captains to intercept the English. Nonetheless, night brought a close to the day&#x27;s battle.

The following day the English were the first to begin the engagement, with the wind in their favour. The initiative of the English fleet was not gone from the previous day, but five attempts failed to break the Dutch line. The day also saw 12 Dutch merchantmen caught by Blake&#x27;s frigates after attempting to make a run for it, against Tromp&#x27;s explicit orders. After the second day most of the Dutch warships were out of powder and shot, and there was none to resupply with.

The third day ended just the same, with a failure to break the Dutch line. Several Dutch captains attempted to flee after completely running out of ammunition but Tromp ended their flight with a few shots across their ships. The battle ended for the day when Blake drew off, after forcing the Dutch to fight to the point where they only had around half an hour worth of shot left. Blake&#x27;s reasoning for the disengagement has been attributed to the fact that he received a wound to the thigh that day.

On the fourth day the English again attempted to resume action, but they found the sea empty of Dutch warships. Tromp had guided the remainder of his fleet along the coastline, escaping certain defeat the next day, leaving 12 warships and a number of merchantmen behind. Although both sides claimed victory after the battle, the fact remains that it was Tromp who left the field, not Blake, and in the end, it was Blake who was able to commandeer 20 to 40 Dutch merchantmen and at least eight Dutch warships back to his homeport.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Portland restored English control over the English Channel. While Dutch propaganda tried to paint the battle as a Dutch victory or a &quot;glorious defeat&quot; and the populace publicly rejoiced at the heroism shown, Admiral Tromp and the other flag officers knew better, all coming home in an extremely dark mood. They concluded that the adoption of line tactics by the English would make it impossible for the Dutch to compensate inferior firepower with better seamanship and they urged the States-General to finally start building real heavy warships instead of replacing losses by recruiting armed merchants. In an attempt to at least keep the North Sea open, an under-equipped Dutch fleet engaged the English again at the Battle of the Gabbard.

<doc id="196638" wikidata="Q216790" url="?curid=196638" title="Hanko, Finland">
<text>Hanko (; ) is a town in Finland, located in the southern coast of the country. Hanko is situated in the western part of the Uusimaa region. The population of Hanko is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

Hanko is located west of Helsinki and south-west of Ekenäs. 

The Port of Hanko is today the 4th largest port in Finland. The skyline of Hanko is dominated by the church and the water tower. Both of them received their current appearance after World War II, as their predecessors were either damaged or destroyed by the Soviet Armed Forces.

Hanko is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

==Geography==
The Hanko Peninsula, on which the city is located, is the southernmost tip of continental Finland. The soil is a sandy moraine, and vegetation consists mainly of pine and low shrubs, mostly &quot;Calluna&quot;. Hanko is known for its beautiful archipelago.

The town has a coastline of approximately , of which are sandy beaches. There are also over 90 small islands and islets within the city limits.

=== Climate ===
Hanko has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), which is significantly milder in terms of temperatures than the average of the same latitude. Compared to, for example, Helsinki, Hanko&#x27;s climate is more oceanic on average, which means milder in winter and cooler in summer. The moderating influence of Baltic Sea cyclones results in warm and moderately humid summers and long, moderately cold wet winters. The period with the most precipitation is in autumn and early winter. The driest months are April and May. Duration of sunshine varies greatly throughout the year, being high in summer due to both long days and relatively clear weather, and low in late autumn and early winter due to both short days and high number of cloudy days. Thunderstorms occur most in the summer months. 

==History==
The site was already known by sailors in the 15th century. Petroglyphs from that time are carved into the rock at the &quot;&quot; (, ) island.

Hanko has a long history of wars and battles. The Battle of Gangut between Swedish and Russian navies was fought in 1714 in the archipelago north of the peninsula. The battle was the first-ever victory of the Russian regular fleet.

The fortification works on the Hanko Peninsula had already been started by the end of the 18th century, when the Swedish constructed three separate forts on the outlying islands. The forts were taken over by Russia in 1809, and were later bombarded by the Royal Navy during the Crimean War and were eventually blown up during the hostilities by their own defenders.

The city was founded in 1874, soon after the Hanko-Hyvinkää railway was inaugurated in 1872. The Imperial Charter for the city was granted by Emperor Alexander II.

The Hanko area is suitable for quarrying granite, and in 1886 Ab Granit Oy (The Granite Company, Ltd.) began to do just that. Hanko granite was exported worldwide, and was used in construction of the Ateneum, the Helsinki Central Station, and other iconic Helsinki buildings, as well as buildings in St. Petersburg and elsewhere.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hanko was the port of choice for emigrants leaving Finland for a new life in North America. A memorial statue, showing birds in flight, commemorates this.

In the late 19th century, while Finland was still a Grand Duchy under Russia, Hanko was a popular spa resort for the Russian nobility. Some of the buildings from that period survive, notably the Hanko Casino (which is not a gambling establishment, but a former banquet hall of the spa). It is currently a restaurant. The Hotel Continental (1901) (now the Hotel Regatta) was designed by architect Lars Sonck in the notable Jugendstil style of the time; after falling into disrepair, the hotel was restored to its former glory in 2013.

Field Marshal C. G. Mannerheim owned a café, (, ), which is still popular among tourists and residents alike.

The Bengtskär lighthouse, situated southwest of Hanko, is the tallest () in the Nordic countries. It was built in 1906 and was the first lighthouse museum in Finland.

===Soviet naval base===


In the Moscow Peace Treaty that ended the Winter War on 13 March 1940, Hanko was leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base for a period of 30 years. During the Continuation War, Soviet troops were forced to evacuate Hanko in early December 1941. The Soviet Union renounced the lease formally in the Paris peace treaty of 1947. As a curiosity, it can be noted that the short Russo-Finnish front across the base of the peninsula on the Finnish side was held in part by volunteer troops from Sweden. A museum has been established at this location, among the trenches and other remnants of the war.

The role of the Hanko naval base was replaced by Porkkala in the armistice between Finland and the Soviet Union of 19 September 1944. Porkkala was returned to Finland in January 1956.

==Events==
The &quot;Hangon Regatta&quot; is a traditional fixture on the Finnish social scene, and is the town&#x27;s main summer event. Sailing enthusiasts attend to compete, but there are also others, mostly young people, with little or no interest in sailing, who attend only in order to party and drink. The latter constitute the so-called &quot;Regatta tail&quot;, which is not appreciated by most of the town&#x27;s residents.

Other traditional summer activities are the &quot;Tennis Week&quot;, the &quot;Sea Horse&quot; riding competitions, the &quot;Summer Theatre&quot; and Hanko Music Festival events.

Several sandy beaches and a multitude of leisure harbors attract tourists during the summer months. It is precisely because of these factors that Hanko has also been called the &quot;Riviera of Finland&quot;.

<text>E-government (known for electronic government) involves utilizing technology devices, such as computers and the Internet, for fastest means of delivering public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. E-government offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government and for government provision of services directly to citizens.

E- government involves digital interactions across various levels and stakeholders (C2G), between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories: This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government (city, state/province, national, and international), facilitating citizen involvement in governance using information and communication technology (ICT) (such as computers and websites) and business process re-engineering (BPR). Brabham and Guth (2017) interviewed the third party designers of e-government tools in North America about the ideals of user interaction that they build into their technologies, which include progressive values, ubiquitous participation, geolocation, and education of the public.

Other definitions stray from the idea that technology is an object and defines e-government simply as facilitators or instruments and focus on specific changes in Public Administration issues. The internal transformation of a government is the definition that established the specialist technologist Mauro D. Ríos. In his paper &quot;In Search of a Definition of Electronic Government&quot;, he says: &quot;Digital government is a new way of organization and management of public affairs, introducing positive transformational processes in management and the structure itself of the organization chart, adding value to the procedures and services provided, all through the introduction and continued appropriation of information and communication technologies as a facilitator of these transformations.&quot;
==Terminology==
E-government is also known as e-gov, electronic government, Internet governance, digital government, online government, connected government. As of 2014 the OECD still uses the term digital government, and distinguishes it from e-government in the recommendation produced there for the Network on E-Government of the Public Governance Committee. Several governments have started to use the term digital government to a wide range of services involving contemporary technology, such as big data, automation or predictive analytics.

&quot;E-gov strategies&quot; (or &quot;digital government&quot;) is defined as &quot;The employment of the Internet and the world-wide-web for delivering government information and services to the citizens.&quot; (United Nations, 2006; AOEMA, 2005). &quot;Electronic government&quot; (or &quot;e-government&quot;) essentially refers to &quot;utilization of Information Technology (IT), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT s), and other web-based telecommunication technologies to improve and/or enhance on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector&quot;. E-government promotes and improves broad stakeholders contribution to national and community development, as well as deepen the governance process.

In electronic government systems, government operations are supported by web-based services. It involves the use of information technology, specifically the Internet, to facilitate the communication between the government and its citizens.

===Transformational government===
Transformational government or also transformational e-government is the use of computer-based information and communications technologies (ICT) to change the way governments work. The term is commonly used to describe a government reform strategy which attempts to radically change the way people understand the government, especially those working within the government. For example, it is often associated with a &quot;whole-of-government&quot; viewpoint, which tries to foster cross-department collaboration and provide &quot;one-stop-shop&quot; convenience in the delivery of services to citizens.

The term &quot;transformational government&quot; is usually used aspirationally, as denoting the highest level of what e-government can achieve: 
# presence, where ICT, and usually websites, are used to provide information; 
# interaction, where government interacts with citizens, and departments interact with each other, online especially by email;
# transaction, where such things as paying taxes or licenses are carried out online;
# transformation, which involves a reinvention of government functions and how they operate. In relation to developing countries, it is often associated with hopes of reducing corruption, and in relation to developed countries, with attempts to increase the involvement of the private and voluntary sectors in government activity.

===Government 2.0===
Government 2.0 or Gov 2.0 refers to government policies that aim to harness collaborative technologies and interactive Internet tools to create an open-source computing platform in which government, citizens, and innovative companies can improve transparency and efficiency. Put simply, Gov 2.0 is about &quot;putting government in the hands of citizens&quot;. Gov 2.0 combines interactive Web 2.0 fundamentals with e-government and increases citizen participation by using open-source platforms, which allow development of innovative apps, websites, and widgets. The government&#x27;s role is to provide open data, web services, and platforms as an infrastructure.

===E-governance===

E-government should enable anyone visiting a city website to communicate and interact with city employees via the Internet with graphical user interfaces (GUI), instant-messaging (IM), learn about government issues through audio/video presentations, and in any way more sophisticated than a simple email letter to the address provided at the site&quot;

The essence of e-governance is &quot;The enhanced value for stakeholders through transformation&quot; and &quot;the use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees&quot;. The focus should be on:
* The use of information and communication technologies, and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve better government.
* The use of information and communication technologies in all facets of the operations of a government organization.
* The continuous optimization of service delivery, constituency participation, and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, the Internet and new media.
Whilst e-government has traditionally been understood as being centered around the operations of government, e-governance is understood to extend the scope by including citizen engagement and participation in governance. As such, following in line with the OECD definition of e-government, e-governance can be defined as the use of ICTs as a tool to achieve better governance.

===Non-internet e-government===
While e-government is often thought of as &quot;online government&quot; or &quot;Internet-based government,&quot; many non-Internet &quot;electronic government&quot; technologies can be used in this context. Some non-Internet forms include telephone, fax, PDA, SMS text messaging, MMS, wireless networks and services, Bluetooth, CCTV, tracking systems, RFID, biometric identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, identity cards, smart cards and other near field communication applications; polling station technology (where non-online e-voting is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., CSMW), email, online community facilities, newsgroups and electronic mailing lists, online chat, and instant messaging technologies.

==History==

One of the first references to the term &quot;electronic government&quot; happened alongside the term electronic democracy in 1992. During the last two decades, governments around the world have invested in ICT with the aim of increasing the quality and decreasing the cost of public services. But over that time, as even the least developed countries have moved to websites, e-services and e-government strategies, it has become increasingly clear that e-government has not delivered all the benefits that were hoped for it. One study found that 35% of e-government projects in developing countries resulted in total failures; and that 50% were partial failures.

In reaction to these poor outcomes, there has been a shift of perspective to &quot;transformational government&quot;, aiming beyond purely technical aspects of better enabling e-government processes towards addressing the cultural and organisational barriers which have hindered public service benefits realisation. Researchers have defined the rationale for transformational government as &quot;the exploitation of e-government such that benefits can be realized&quot;.

In 2010 the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) published a report which identified a wide range of common pitfalls which have hampered many governments in achieving significant impacts through their technology investments. However, OASIS also noted that:
:&quot;… an increasing number [of governments] are now getting to grips with the much broader and complex set of cultural and organizational changes which are needed for ICT to deliver significant benefits to the public sector. This new approach is generally referred to as Transformational Government.&quot;

OASIS cites the UK and Australia as two of the leaders in this area:
: &quot;Transformational Government…. encompasses a new &quot;virtual&quot; business layer within government which allows an integrated, government-wide, citizen-focused service to be presented to citizens across all channels, but at no extra cost and without having to restructure government to do so. Two good examples of this new approach are South Australia&#x27;s &quot;Ask Just Once&quot; portal and the UK Government&#x27;s DirectGov portal, and the approach is explained in detail in the CS Transform&#x27;s white paper entitled &quot;Citizen Service Transformation – a manifesto for change in the delivery of public services&quot;.

==UN e-Government Development Index==

The Division of a Public Administration and Development Management (DPAPM) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) conducts a bi-annual e-government survey which includes a section titled &quot;e-Government Development Index (EGDI)&quot;. It is a comparative ranking of 193 countries of the world according to three primary indicators: i) the OSI - Online Service Index that measures the online presence of the government in terms of service delivery; ii) the TII - Telecommunication Infrastructure Index iii) HCI -Human Capital Index. Constructing a model for the measurement of digitized services, the Survey assesses the 193 member states of the UN according to a quantitative composite index of e-government readiness based on website assessment; telecommunication infrastructure and human resource endowment. The e-Government Development Index can serve as a benchmarking tool for countries to identify their strengths and weaknesses and shape their policies along these findings in the area of e-government.

The e-Government Development Index (EGDI) is calculated with the following method: EGDI = 1/3 (OSI normalized + TII normalized + HCI normalized)

A diverse group of 100 researchers online volunteers from across the globe engaged with the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2016 UN E-Government Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.

The survey has been criticized not including an index of digital inclusion levels.

==Delivery models and activities of e-government==
The primary delivery models of e-government can be divided into:
* Government-to-citizen or government-to-consumer (G2C) approaches such as setting up websites where citizens can download forms, government information, etc.
** In this model, the G2C model applies the strategy of customer relationship management (CRM) with business concept.
** By managing their &quot;customer&quot; (citizen) relationship, the business (government) can provide the products and services required to fulfill the needs of the customer (citizen).
** In United States, the NPR (National Partnership for Reinventing Government) has been implemented from 1993.
* Government-to-business (G2B)
* Government-to-government (G2G)
* Government-to-employees (G2E)

Within each of these interaction domains, four kinds of activities take place:
* pushing information over the Internet, e.g.: regulatory services, general holidays, public hearing schedules, issue briefs, notifications, etc.
* two-way communications between the agency and the citizen, a business, or another government agency. In this model, users can engage in dialogue with agencies and post problems, comments, or requests to the agency.
* conducting transactions, e.g.: lodging tax returns, applying for services and grants.
* governance, e.g.: To enable the citizen transition from passive information access to active citizen participation by:
# Informing the citizen
# Representing the citizen
# Encouraging the citizen to vote
# Consulting the citizen
# Involving the citizen

Examples of online transactional services, employed in e-governments include:
* Applying for a birth certificate
* Applying for a building permit
* Applying for a business license
* Applying for a death certificate
* Applying for a driver&#x27;s license
* Applying for environmental permits
* Applying for government vacancies online
* Applying for land title registration
* Applying for a marriage certificate
* Applying for a personal identity card
* Applying for social protection programs
* Applying for a visa
* Declaring to police
* Paying fines
* Paying for utilities (water, gas electricity)
* Registering a business
* Registering a motor vehicle
* Looking up land registration info
* Looking up address and telephone number info in online telephone directory
* Submitting a change of address
* Submitting income taxes
* Submitting Value Added Tax

== Controversies ==

===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantages concerning e-government are that there exists a digital divide and digital inequalities that bar certain people from accessing the full benefits of digitization. When presented as the only option to access an essential service, those who do not have public access to computers and the internet, or do not have adequate knowledge on how to use them, suffer.

Other disadvantages include the reliability of information on the web and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including disintermediation of the government and its citizens, digital self-determination of citizens in a global internet network, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to cyber attacks, and disturbances to the &quot;status quo&quot; in these areas.

The political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.

====Cost====
Although &quot;a prodigious amount of money has been spent&quot; on the development and implementation of e-government, some say it has yielded only a mediocre result. The outcomes and effects of trial Internet-based government services are often difficult to gauge or users find them unsatisfactory.
According to Gartner, Worldwide IT spending is estimated to total $3.6 trillion in 2011 which is 5.1% increase from the year 2010 ($3.4 trillion).

==== Development ====
Because E-government is in the early stages of development in many countries and jurisdictions, it is hard to be applied to forms of government that have been institutionalized. Age-old bureaucratic practices being delivered in new mediums or using new technologies can lead to problems of miscommunication.

An example of such a practice was the automation of the Indiana welfare program that began in 2006. An audit commissioned by then Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels in 2005 found that several Family and Social Service Administration (FSSA) employees and welfare recipients were committing welfare fraud. The bureaucratic nature of Indiana&#x27;s welfare system allowed people to cheat the system and cost the state large amounts of money. Daniels characterized the system as &quot;irretrievably broken,&quot; stating that it was at a state where employees could not fix it on their own. He cited many issues that directly tie into the fact that the system had not been automated.

In hopes to reap the many benefits of e-government, Daniels signed into law a bill privatizing and automating the enrollment service for Indiana&#x27;s welfare programs. Daniels aimed to streamline benefits applications, privatize casework, and identify fraud. It was believed that moving away from face-to-face casework and toward electronic communication would fix the aforementioned problems and improve efficiency.

Indiana&#x27;s welfare enrollment facilities were replaced with online applications and call centers operated by IBM. These ran into issues almost immediately. The mainly face-to-face and personalized practice was modernized essentially overnight, blindsiding many people who relied on those features. The automated system worked upon a one size fits all approach that attributed errors to the recipient over anything else. Problems that were previously solvable through a single phone call with a recipient&#x27;s caseworker became increasingly complicated due to the private call center workers not being adequately trained.

Welfare recipients were denied their benefits due to lack of direct help, system errors out of their control, or simply an inability to use the technology meant to speed up the process. The transition overwhelmed not only recipients but also the employees. In October 2009, even Daniels admitted to the project being flawed and problematic, cancelling the contract with IBM. Indiana began rolling out a hybrid system starting in 2010, including caseworkers and some automation where appropriate.

====False sense of transparency and accountability====
Opponents of e-government argue that online governmental transparency is dubious because it is maintained by the governments themselves. Information can be added or removed from the public eye. To this day, very few organizations monitor and provide accountability for these modifications. Those that do so, like the United States&#x27; OMBWatch and Government Accountability Project, are often nonprofit volunteers. Even the governments themselves do not always keep track of the information they insert and delete.

====Hyper-surveillance====
Increased electronic contact and data exchange between government and its citizens goes both ways. Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than brick and mortar service offices (physical buildings) staffed by civil servants. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a totalitarian-like system could develop. When the government has easy access to countless information on its citizens, personal privacy is lost.

====Inaccessibility====

An e-government website that provides government services often does not offer the &quot;potential to reach many users including those who live in remote areas [without Internet access], are homebound, have low literacy levels, exist on poverty line incomes.&quot; Homeless people, people in poverty and elderly people may not have access.

==== Trust ====
Trust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions. This is much riskier and prone to fluctuation than a system of trust that is based on reputation because performance does not consider past actions.

With the automation of institutionalized government services, trust can go both ways: the trust that people have for the government, and the trust the government places in its people. In the case of Indiana&#x27;s automated welfare system, the less skilled call center workers defaulted their decisions to the automated system and favored solutions that best fit the system rather than the people. When too much trust is put in e-governance, errors and mistakes are not caught.

A crucial part of the Indiana welfare system was the relationship between caseworkers and their clients. It was the main way for Hoosiers to interact with this public institution and receive the help they want. However, Daniels and many others saw a potential invitation to fraud. There were indeed instances of welfare fraud occurring between caseworkers and clients, such as this case from Marion County, December 2009. But the motivation to automate was an attempt to catch people taking advantage of the system rather than trying to deliver the services to as many people as possible. Welfare recipients were being considered as criminals rather than people in need. Such treatment of the poor is similar to that of poorhouses from the 19th and 20th centuries. Both developed flawed systems with an intent to punish, creating more burdens than the initially marketed benefits.

===Advantages===

The ultimate goal of the e-government is to be able to offer an increased portfolio of public services to citizens in an efficient and cost-effective manner. E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.

Simple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paperwork for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.

E-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.

It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by obtaining easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to obtain it.

E-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings. Indiana became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. In addition to its simplicity, e-democracy services can reduce costs. Alabama Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources, Wal-Mart and NIC developed an online hunting and fishing license service utilizing an existing computer to automate the licensing process. More than 140,000 licenses were purchased at Wal-Mart stores during the first hunting season and the agency estimates it will save $200,000 annually from service.

The anticipated benefits of e-government include efficiency, improved services, better accessibility of public services, sustainable community development and more transparency and accountability.

====Democratization====

One goal of some e-government initiatives is greater citizen participation. Through the Internet&#x27;s Web 2.0 interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. Blogging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. Chat rooms can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.

A government could theoretically move more towards a true democracy with the proper application of e-government. Government transparency will give insight to the public on how decisions are made and hold elected officials or public servants accountable for their actions. The public could become a direct and prominent influence in government legislature to some degree.

====Environmental bonuses====

Proponents of e-government argue that online government services would lessen the need for hard copy paper forms. Due to recent pressures from environmentalist groups, the media, and the public, some governments and organizations have turned to the Internet to reduce paper use. The United States government utilizes the website Government Forms, by Agency | A | USAGov to provide &quot;internal government forms for federal employees&quot; and thus &quot;produce significant savings in paper. As well, if citizens can apply for government services or permits online, they may not need to drive into a government office, which could lead to less air pollution from gas and diesel-fuelled vehicles.

====Speed, efficiency, and convenience====
E-government allows citizens to interact with computers to achieve objectives at any time and any location and eliminates the necessity for physical travel to government agents sitting behind desks and windows. Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to brick and mortar government offices, which tend to be only open during Business hours (notable exceptions are police stations and hospitals, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).

Improved accounting and record-keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations. Individuals with disabilities or conditions that affect their mobility no longer have to be mobile to be active in government and can access public services in the comfort of their own homes (as long as they have a computer and Internet and any accessibility equipment they may need).

====Public approval====

Recent trials of e-government have been met with acceptance and eagerness from the public. Citizens participate in online discussions of political issues with increasing frequency, and young people, who traditionally display minimal interest in government affairs, are drawn to electronic voting procedures.

Although Internet-based governmental programs have been criticized for lack of reliable privacy policies, studies have shown that people value prosecution of offenders over personal confidentiality. Ninety percent of United States adults approve of Internet tracking systems of criminals, and 57% are willing to forgo some of their personal internet privacy if it leads to the prosecution of criminals or terrorists.

==Technology-specific e-government==
There are also some technology-specific sub-categories of e-government, such as m-government (mobile government), ubiquitous government), and g-government (GIS/GPS applications for e-government).

The previous concern about developments in E-government concerning technology are due to the limited use of online platforms for political reasons by citizens in local political participations.

The primary delivery models of e-government are classified depending on who benefits. In the development of the public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by the government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.

To develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.

=== Social Media Usage ===
Social networking services and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens&#x27; environment and the engagement is on the citizens&#x27; terms. Proponents of e-government perceive the government&#x27;s use of social networking as a medium to help the government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube widgets.

Government and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Government is also beginning to Twitter. In the state of Rhode Island, Treasurer Frank T. Caprio is offering daily tweets of the state&#x27;s cash flow. For a full list of state agencies with Twitter feeds, visit NIC. For more information, visit transparent-gov.com.

=== E-Signature ===
Several local governments in the United States have allowed online e-signatures for candidate nominating petitions and signature requirements for ballot initiatives. In 2012 Arizona launched a prototype system called E-qual, which allowed statewide candidates running for office to collect signatures online and share the link on other forms on social media. E-qual was expanded in 2016 to cover candidates in local elections within the state, but it was not used at the local level before the 2020 state election. The city of Boulder, Colorado has implemented a similar system in 2020 to collect signatures for city ballot questions.

===Africa===

====Egypt====
Since the election of the current president Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, he has invested large sums of money towards sustainable energy and digitalization of the government system. Some of the problems faced are privacy, security concerns, lack of citizens&#x27; awareness, and lack of technical unified standards. Egypt has a population of approx. 100 million with various backgrounds and living conditions and access to resources. Not only does the education level of citizens vary between cities and rural areas but also within Cairo. Compared to other Arab or Middle Eastern countries, Egypt is quite behind in terms of technological developments and utilization. Recently, the government issued a law that all businesses must have electronic receipts and that all pension payments or government-citizen expenditure must be done through electronic transfers. This shows their initiative to leave behind the cash driven economy to an electronic one.

====Kenya====
Following the transition from the longstanding Kenya African National Union government to the National Rainbow Coalition government in December 2002, in January 2004 a Directorate of e-government was established after an executive (cabinet) session. The newly created department had the duty to draw the plan of action for future ICT implementations.

Like many other African nations, Kenya has embraced the high mobile penetration rate within its population. Even people living in remote areas that did not have access to traditional telecommunications&#x27; networks can now communicate with ease. The fact of the same has, and continues to have, a great impact on the governments&#x27; strategies in reaching out to its citizens.
Given that about 70% of the population owns mobile phones, leading mobile network operators like Safaricom have taken a great step in offering services that meet citizens&#x27; demands. Such services include Kipokezi (which allows subscribers to do online chatting and also exchange electronic mails via standard mobile phones), and M-Pesa (which allows the subscribers to send and receive electronic cash). Such services have even appealed to the majority of Kenyans, as they support the branchless members of the society too, in undertaking normal and secure businesses via M-Pesa. The recent IMF report reveals that MPESA transactions in Kenya exceeded those carried out by the Western Union worldwide.

==== Armenia ====
Armenian e-government was established in 2004. E-government brings together all tools and databases created by Armenian state agencies and provides a user-friendly online environment for users. It includes more than twenty services and tools. Under this initiative, &quot;Interactive Budget&quot; and &quot;State Non-Commercial Organisations&#x27; Financing&quot; sections are available for the first time. There are also twenty other tools, including search engines, allowing to find the Government&#x27;s and the Prime Minister&#x27;s decisions, the agenda of the next cabinet sitting, information on the state purchases, the electronic tax reporting system, the online application system of the Intellectual Property Agency, the information search system of the Intellectual Property Agency, as well as the Electronic Signature and Electronic Visa (e-visa) sections. It is worth mentioning that the Electronic Signature is used in several other services when a user wants to submit an application or receive information. The Electronic Signature is universal system and is used both by the state officials and by citizens, legal entities.

#E-License: This system allows companies to submit an application for obtaining or terminating licenses regarding various activities (pharmaceuticals, banking, construction, transport etc.) It also provides other services in respect of already obtained license.
#System of reports on licensed activities: The Report Acceptance System for licensed persons enables to submit any report (annually, monthly or quarterly) on licensed activities.
#E-Payments: Electronic Payment System effectively processes online payments. This application is designed specifically for charging the state fees, local fees, the administrative penalties or services provided by state and local governmental bodies. Payments can be made by Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and local Arca or Mobidram systems.
#E-Cadastre: The system enables to submit an application to the property cadastre and receives information on landowners, the surface of a plot of land, legal status of any property. The state electronic payment system is integrated into this tool. Online applications for registration of rights and restrictions and related documents may be submitted by users who have a digital signature.
#E-Draft: In 2016 the Ministry of Justice of Armenia developed Legal Drafts&#x27; Database. It is designed particularly for publication any draft initiated by the government or member of Parliament. The database can be accessed through a website which provides the possibility of presenting the legal acts&#x27; drafts to the public, organizing online discussions, and as a consequence - the active participation of representatives of civil society in the law-making process. The website enables them to search legal drafts, follow their further progress, and become familiar with the presented suggestions. The registered users can present suggestions, become informed with the &quot;summary paper&quot; of the suggestions to the draft, the adopted suggestions or the reasoning concerning the not adopted ones.

====Azerbaijan====

The &quot;e-government&quot; framework was established in accordance with the &quot;National Strategy on Information-Communication Technologies in the Development of the Republic of Azerbaijan (2003–2012)&quot; and implemented in the framework of the &quot;E-Azerbaijan&quot; Program. The project is aimed to increase the convenience and efficiency of the activity of state agencies, simplify interactions between population, businesses, and government agencies, contribute to creating new citizen-official relations framework and ensure transparency and free flow of information.

The main components of the e-government infrastructure are integrated network infrastructure for state bodies, e-government portal, e-government gateway, State register of information resources and systems, e-signature, e-document circulation and e-government data center (under preparation).

State portal www.e-gov.az was established to facilitate citizens in benefiting from e-services provided by government agencies on a &quot;single window&quot; principle with the combination of services. Through e-government portal, citizens can use more than 140 e-services of 27 state agencies. Besides, a gateway between government agencies was established to ensure the mutual exchange of information, and most state agencies are connected to this infrastructure. The gateway allows users to efficiently use the existing government information systems and safe contact between them, issuing requests and rendering e-services, liberates citizens from providing same information or documents which are already available in information databases.

On 14 March 2018, it was launched E-government Development Center. It is a public legal entity that is subordinated to State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The service tries to utilize digital technologies, establish e-government to make state services operate more efficiently, ensure public services availability, and improve the living standards of the citizens of the country. It is government-to-citizen type of e-governance.

====Bangladesh====
The eGovernment web portal has been developed to provide more convenient access to various government services and information through one window. Services can now be delivered to people at their convenience, and more importantly, now have a lot more weight on transparency and accountability of public services.

====China====
According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (国务院国有资产监督管理委员会) of Fujian Province, digital Transformation was firstly proposed by IBM in 2012, which enhances the application of digital technology to reshape customer value propositions and emphasizes the customer interaction and collaboration. And Chinese government has added “Digital Economy” to its Government Work Report (政府工作报告) for four consecutive years from 2017, and proposed in the 14th Five-Year Plan to outline the “Use digital transformation to drive changes in production methods, lifestyles and governance methods as a whole”. Furthermore, Digital Transformation has been elevated to a national strategy from enterprise (organization) level.

Chinese government also has its official website for eGovernment is eGovernment.gov.cn, and maintained by Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party (中共中央党校) or National Academy of Governance (国家行政学院)(these two names are for one institute but with two different names).

====India====
The E-Governance initiatives and programs in India are undertaken by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY www.meity.gov.in).
The current umbrella program for e-governance of Government of India is known by the title &quot;DIGITAL INDIA&quot; (www.digitalindia.gov.in)

Indian government has launched many e-governance initiatives, including a portal for public grievance,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://pgportal.gov.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; MCA21 Mission Mode Project,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.mca.gov.in/MCA21/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; e-Filing of income tax,&lt;ref name=&quot;https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; e-gazette, Project Nemmadi, and their overall digital India policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://deity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/Digital%20India.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
E-government in Indonesia is developing, especially in central and regional/local government offices. E-government was officially introduced to public administration by Presidential Directive No 6/2001 on Telematics, which states that the government of Indonesia has to use telematics technology to support good governance. Furthermore, e-government should have been introduced for different purposes in government offices. As one of the ISO member countries, Indonesia gives more attention to facilitating the activities of standardization. Among of the facilities provided are building the National information system of standardization (SISTANAS) and Indonesia Standardization Information Network (INSTANET). As of 2017, ministries, institutions and local governments of Indonesia used to run separate e-government systems, which is now integrated into a centrally based system. In 2017, the government has also undertaken programs for digitization of SMEs and the informal sector. Many of the cities across Indonesia including Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and Makassar are implementing the concept of Smart City, consisting of e-government, e-health, e-education, e-logistics and e-procurement as priority areas.

====Iran====
In 2002, Iran published a detailed report named TAKFA (Barnameye Tose-e va Karborde Fanavaie Etela’at) in which it was predicted that most of the government bodies would try to virtualize their services as soon as possible. However, based on the reports by UN bodies, Iran has failed in recent years to meet the average standards of e-government. In 2008, the Supreme Council of Information released a report which criticized the government for its poor advancement in employing new communication technologies for administration purposes.

In 2016, Iran launched the National Information Network and improved the quality and speed of internet access. In 2017 Iran introduced phase one of e-government including E-Tax, E-Customs, E-Visa, E-Government Portal, and a mobile application to modernize Iran&#x27;s government services.

The Iranian government plans to introduce other phases of E-gov soon.

====Iraq====
The Iraqi E-government citizen program was established to &quot;eliminate bribery and favoritism and end the citizens&#x27; suffering in going back repeatedly to directories&quot;, the interface lets the citizen send requests and complaints, it can also be used for issuing identity cards, driving licenses and passports.

====Jordan====
Jordan established its e-government program in 2002. Many governmental services are provisioned online.

====Kazakhstan====
The e-government portal egov.kz was launched in 2012 as part of Kazakhstan&#x27;s effort to modernize how citizens access government services and information. It offers all possible services that can be provided by the state for citizens and businesses such as education, health care, social security, job placement and employment, tax issues, legal assistance. It is currently at the transformational stage of development. The main goal of egov.kz is to maximize efficiency. For instance, users can register birth of a child, while simultaneously resolving all related issues - applying for benefits and putting the child on the waiting list for kindergarten.
&lt;br&gt;
The egov.kz mobile app was recognized as best app in the GovTechioneers competition at the 2017 World Government Summit in Dubai. At the WSIS Prizes-2017 (World Summit on the Information Society contest), three projects from the Republic of Kazakhstan were announced champions: e-Government, Open Government, and Integrated Call Center 1414.

Projects of the e-government:
* &quot;E-licensing&quot; information system - Created to automate the processes of licensing and permits and to ensure an effective and transparent mechanism for information interaction between government agencies – licensors and the business community of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
* &quot;E-notary&quot; - Developed with the aim to improve the control over the activity of notary officers and optimize their work. The system involves registration of notary activities in electronic register and brings benefit to all the participants of juridical acts. &quot;E-notary&quot; system allows notary officers to check authenticity of the documents, get valid real estate data, maintain records of inheritance cases and goodwill. 
* Open Government - The Open Government consists of the following components: Open Data, Open RLA, Open Dialogue, Open Budgets, as well as Assessment of the Effectiveness of Government Agencies.
* eGov Mobile mobile application - Designed to provide public services and e-government services via smartphones. Citizens can log in using digital signature or a one-time password. 
* Chat-bots at Telegram, Facebook and Vkontakte – Chat-bots based on artificial intelligence were created to automate consultation of the most frequently requested public services of the e-Government portal.
* Smart Bridge – The project aimed at simplification of organizational procedures for integration, interaction of government bodies with business and the development of a competitive environment.
* Saqbol mobile app - Created to control the spread of coronavirus infection, as well as to timely localize infection sites using the Exposure Notification (notification system on the risk of contagion from Google and Apple). The app is designed to anonymously track contacts with other devices that have the same app installed, and store encrypted records of interaction with them.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, the e-government efforts are undertaken by the Malaysian government, under the umbrella of Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and e-government flagships, which was launched in mid-1996, by Dr Mahathir Mohamad (1981–2003), by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia (Jeong &amp; Nor Fadzlina, 2007).

Electronic government is an initiative aimed at reinventing how the government works. It seeks to improve how the government operates, as well as how it delivers services to the people (Ibrahim Ariff &amp; Goh Chen Chuan, 2000).

====Myanmar====
The Yangon City Development Committee (Burmese- ရန်ကုန်မြို့တော်စည်ပင်သာယာရေးကော်မတီ) (YCDC) is the administrative body of Yangon, and Yangon is the largest city and former capital of Myanmar (Burma). The Yangon City Development Committee consists of 20 departments. Its headquarters was on the Yangon City Hall. The committee&#x27;s chairman is also the city&#x27;s mayor.

In 2003, YCDC was organized to provide e-government for Yangon City. The main purposes of the city&#x27;s e-government program are to provide easy access between the government and the city&#x27;s citizens via the Internet, to reduce paper usage, to reduce the city budget, to build the city&#x27;s fiber ring, to provide timely public information, to store public data and to develop and expand G2G, G2C, G2B, and G2E programs.

In January 2013 responsibility for e-government was divided between the e-Government Administration Committee and the e-Government Processing Committee. The e-Government Administration Committee includes the Mayor of Yangon City as Chief, the General Secretary of Yangon City as Sub-Chief, and the other 20 head of department officers as chairmen. The e-Government Processing Committee includes the Head of Public Relation and Information Department as Chief and the other 20 deputy head of department officers as chairmen.

The official web-portal is www.ycdc.gov.mm.

Mandalay is the second-largest city and the last royal capital of Myanmar (Burma). In 2014, Mandalay Region Government developed www.mdyregion.gov.mm to know about regional government and their activities to people.

Mandalay Region Government organized the e-Government Steering Committee on 23 June 2016.
That committee chairman was U Sai Kyaw Zaw, Minister, Ministry of Ethnic Affairs.

On 21 July 2017 www.emandalay.gov.mm web portal was opened by Dr. Zaw Myint Maung, Prime Minister of Mandalay Region Government. That portal includes 2 e-services, 199 topics from 70 agencies.
The committee develops a Regional Data Center too. That Datacenter will be opened in 2018.

==== Nepal ====
The e-government planning and conceptual framework has been presented to Nepal in extensive support from the Government of Korea (KIPA). E-government Vision is &quot;The Value Networking Nepal&quot; through:
* Citizen-centered service
* Transparent service
* Networked government
* Knowledge-based society
Nepal&#x27;s E-government mission statement is &quot;Improve the quality of people&#x27;s lives without any discrimination, transcending regional and racial differences, and realize socio-economic development by building a transparent government and providing value-added quality services through ICT.&quot;

The e-government practice has been slow both in adoption and practice in Nepal. However, local government bodies now have dedicated team of ICT Volunteers working towards implementing e-government in the country through an extensive ICT for Local Bodies initiatives.

====Saudi Arabia====
In 2015, the Ministry of Interior of Saudi Arabia launched the e-service application known as &quot;Absher.&quot; The application allows the people of the Kingdom to access more than 279 different government services from their smartphones, without the need to queue or for the inefficiencies of bureaucracy.

Some e-services that can be completed by way of the application include:

# Passport Services
# Traffic Services
# Expatriate Affairs Services
# Civil Affairs Services
# Authorizations
# General Directorate of Prisons
# Public Prosecution
# Public Security
# MOI Services (Ministry of Interior)
# Ministry of Hajj
# General Services
# Information Services
Another application that has been launched is &quot;Tawakkalna&quot;. This application was created by the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) in order for the government to better counteract against COVID-19. Initially the application was created so as to issue permits to those who were required to commute to work during lockdown. Now, it is being used for travel; entering commercial buildings, hospitals, and schools within the Kingdom; setting vaccine appointments; and COVID-19 tracing.

====South Korea====
Announced in 2013 with &quot;an ambitious plan to allow wider public access to government data to improve the transparency of state affairs&quot;, this initiative includes: citizen-centered government innovation, core values of openness, sharing, communication, collaboration for all areas of governing, customized services to individual citizens, which will create jobs and support creative economy.

====Sri Lanka====
Sri Lanka have taken some initiative actions to provide the benefits of e-government to the citizens.

====Thailand====
To implement the principles of e-government, the Ministry of Information and Telecommunication Technologies of Thailand developed a plan for creating a modern e-services system during 2009–2014.

The next stage was the five-year project of the digital government, which began in 2016 and will be completed in 2021. This project assumes that within five years, more than 80% of Thai government agencies will use electronic documents for identification.

There is the Unified State Portal of e-Government of Thailand, developed by the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications Technology in 2008.

In 2018, Thailand ranks 73rd in the UN e-government ranking.

====United Arab Emirates====
In the United Arab Emirates, the Emirates eGovernment is designed for e-government operations.

====Pakistan====
In 2014, the Government of Pakistan created the National Information Technology Board under the Ministry of Information Technology &amp; Telecom to enable a digital eco-system for government services to the citizens of Pakistan. NITB was formed as a result of a merger between Pakistan Computer Bureau (PCB) and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD).

The key functions identified by the NITB are:

* Provide technical guidance for the introduction of e-Governance in the Federal Govt. 
* Suggest the efficient and cost-effective implementation of e-government programs in the Federal Ministries/Divisions. 
* To carry out a training needs assessment and design and implement the identified IT capacity building programs for the employees of Federal Ministries/Divisions.
* Review the status of e-government readiness regularly to ensure sustainable, accelerated digitization and relevant human resource development.
* Identify the areas where IT interventions can be helpful and to suggest measures for the automation of these areas through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR).
NITB rolled out an e-Office Suite across various ministries in the Government of Pakistan. While it clearly pursued efficiency gains and improved transparency, it also hoped to deliver &quot;efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan.&quot; The suite primarily included five modules or applications across all the ministries. Description of each module listed are: 
* Internal Communication Module
* HR Management Module
* Inventory &amp; Procurement Management Module
* Project Management Module
* Finance Budget Module
NITB released a high-level diagram that describes the process of transforming federal government agencies and ministries to e-office environments.

Criticism: NITB&#x27;s rollout of the e-Office suite across almost all federal agencies is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems to put together a lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlined in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating many MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end-user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.

===Europe===
====Germany====

E-government (from (en) electronic government, (de) e-government, rarely eGovernment) refers to the simplification, implementation and support of processes for information, communication and transaction within and between state, municipal and other official institutions and between these institutions and citizens or companies and organizations through the use of digital information and communication technologies (ICT).

The legal basis in Germany for federal authorities is the Electronic Government Act (EGovG). Some of the federal states have their own e-government laws.

==== Poland ====
The first discussions in Poland on e-government in Europe began with a report published in 1994 by the European Commission, entitled &quot;Europe and the Global Information Society Recommendations to the Council of Europe&quot; (named after one of the authors of the Bangemann Report). It showed the direction of the development of the global information society in Europe. Since then, the concept of e-government has become a permanent fixture in the issues raised in the EU as a component of eEurope.

In Poland, the year 2000 should be considered the beginning of e-government. It was then that the Scientific Research Committee prepared a document based on seven expert opinions, which was published under the collective title &quot;Global Information Society in the conditions of Poland&#x27;s Accession to the European Union&quot;. Today we know the material as an official document of the Scientific Research Committee and the Ministry of Communications entitled &quot;Goals and directions of development of the information society in Poland&quot;. In 2000, the Sejm also adopted a resolution on building the information society, and then in 2001, passed an act important for the development of e-government: introducing the Public Information Bulletin (BIP), the Act on access to public information, and the act on electronic signature, regulating the issue of e-signature. The next step in the development of e-management was the preparation of the ePoland document, containing an action plan for the development of the information society in Poland, which was modeled on the European eEurope development plan. This document was last updated in 2002. The next version of this strategy was called ePolska-2006. The adoption of this document resulted in the preparation by the Scientific Research Committee of the preliminary concept of the Gateway to Poland project (a central IT system, the task of which was to provide administrative services for citizens and business entities by electronic means) and the document The Strategy for Informatisation of the Republic of Poland-ePoland.

==== Russia ====
On the Federal Law &quot;On providing state and municipal services&quot; (2010), the strategy on development of Information Society in the Russian Federation, approved by the President (2008), the Federal target programme &quot;Electronic Russia&quot; (2002 – 2010 years), approved by the government (2002), the State Programme &quot;Information Society&quot; (2010), the Procedure on development and approval of administrative regulations execution of public functions (public services), approved by the government (2005), the concept of administrative reform in the Russian Federation in 2006 - 2010 respectively, approved by the government (2005), on other orders, resolutions and acts in the Russian Federation was created electronic government (or e-government).

The main target on creating e-government lies in the field of providing equal opportunities for all the Russians in spite of their living place and their incomes and make a more effective system of public administration. So e-government is created for reaching the useful system of public management accommodating the individual interests of every citizen by participation through ICTs in public policy-making.

Nowadays Russian e-government includes such systems as:

1. The United interagency Interacting system using for providing of state and municipal services, exchange of information and data between participants of interagency interacting, quick approval of state and municipal decisions, etc.

2. The United system for authentication and authorization providing evidence of the rights of all participants of e-government.

3. United portal of state and municipal services and functions which are the &quot;single window&quot; for all information and services assured by government and municipals.

The portal of public services is one of the key elements of the project to create an &quot;electronic government&quot; in the country. The portal provides a single point of access to all references on state and municipal services through the Internet and provides citizens and organizations the opportunity to receive these services electronically. Monthly visits by users of the public services portal range between 200,000 and 700,000. For example, citizens are now able to obtain or exchange a driver&#x27;s license through this portal.

4. Head system providing utilization of electronic signature.

Other systems located on cloud services, since cloud computing has been a useful tool for E-Government according to researchers.

Today Russian e-government elements are demanded in the spheres of e-governance, e-services (e-health, e-education, e-library, etc.), e-commerce, e-democracy (web-election, Russian public initiative). By the United Nations E-Government Survey 2012: E-Government for the People Russia became one of the 7 emerging leaders in e-government development, took ninth place in rating of e-government development in largest population countries, took 8th rank in Top e-participation leaders, after Norway, Sweden and Chile, Advancing 32 positions in the world rankings, the Russian Federation became the leader of e-government in Eastern Europe. Evolution of ICT in the Russian Federation provided the raising of Russia in e-government development index to the 27 places.

====Turkey====
E-Government in Turkey is the use of digital technology to improve service efficiency and effectiveness in Turkey.

As of December 2020, 700 government agencies offers 5,338 applications to 51,757,237 million users. The mobile application offers 2,850 services.

==== Ukraine ====
The main coordinating government body in matters of e-government is Ministry of Digital Transformation established in 2019. In 2020, it launched the Diia app and web portal which allows Ukrainians to use various kinds of documents (including ID-cards and passports) via their smartphones as well as to access various government services with the plans to make all governmental services available by 2023.

====United Kingdom====
&quot;Transformational Government: Enabled by Technology&quot;, 2005, stated that &quot;the future of public services has to use technology to give citizens choice, with personalised services designed around their needs not the needs of the provider&quot;.

A major report published by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee in July 2011 addressed procurement of Information Technology by the government and found there was an over-reliance &quot;on a small &#x27;oligopoly&#x27; of large suppliers&quot;. The report introduced its summary with the observation that 

However, an initiative introduced in 2011 which enables people to notify a number of central and local government departments about a birth or death at the same time, called &quot;Tell Us Once&quot;, has been welcomed as &quot;a fine example of innovation and best practice, a dynamic and inspiring model&quot;.

===North America===

====Canada====
The current Clerk of the Privy Council – the head of the federal public service has made workplace renewal a pillar of overall public service renewal. The key to workplace renewal is the adoption of collaborative networked tools. An example of such a tool is GCPEDIA – a wiki platform for federal public servants. Other tools include GCconnex, a social networking tool, and GCforums, a discussion board system.

Report of the Auditor General of Canada: Chapter 1 Information Technology: Government On-Line 2003: &quot;One of the key principles of Government On-Line is that programs and services will be transformed to reflect the needs and expectations of clients and citizens. From the government&#x27;s perspective, the overall objective of the GOL initiative is full service transformation – to fundamentally change the way the government operates and to deliver better services to Canadians.&quot;

====United States====
The election of Barack Obama as President of the United States became associated with the effective use of Internet technologies during his campaign and in the implementation of his new administration in 2009. On January 21, 2009, the President signed one of his first memorandums – the Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Transparency and Open Government. The memo called for an unprecedented level of openness in government, asking agencies to &quot;ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.&quot; The memo further &quot;directs the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies [and] to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in the memorandum.&quot;

President Obama&#x27;s memorandum centered around the idea of increasing transparency throughout various different federal departments and agencies. By enabling public websites like recovery.gov and data.gov to distribute more information to the American population, the administration believes that it will gain greater citizen participation.

In 2009 the U.S. federal government launched Data.gov to make more government data available to the public. With data from Data.Gov, the public can build apps, websites, and mashups. Although &quot;Gov 2.0&quot;, as a concept and as a term, had been in existence since the mid-2000s, it was the launch of Data.gov that made it &quot;go viral&quot;.

In August 2009 the City of San Francisco launched DataSF.org with more than a hundred datasets. Just weeks after the DataSF.org launch, new apps and websites were developed. Using data feeds available on DataSF.org, civic-minded developers built programs to display public transportation arrival and departure times, where to recycle hazardous materials, and crime patterns. Since the launch of DataSF.org there have been more than seventy apps created with San Francisco&#x27;s data.

In March 2009, former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom was at Twitter headquarters for a conversation about technology in government. During the town hall, Newsom received a tweet about a pothole. He turned to Twitter co-founders Biz Stone and Evan Williams and said let&#x27;s find a way for people to tweet their service requests directly to San Francisco&#x27;s 311 customer service center. Three months later, San Francisco launched the first Twitter 311 service, called @SF311, allowing residents to tweet, text, and send photos of potholes and other requests directly to the city. Working with Twitter and using the open-source platform, CoTweet turned @SF311 into reality. The software procurement process for something like this would normally have taken months, but in this case, it took less than three months. The @SF311 is saving the city money in call center costs. In 2011, The United States Government Accountability Office passed the Electronic Government Act in 2002 to promote better use of internet and information technology. Besides, to improve government services for citizens, internal government operations, and opportunities for citizen participation in government.

Presidential Innovation Fellows program where &quot;teams of government experts and private-sector doers take a user-centric approach to issues at the intersection of people, processes, products, and policy to achieve lasting impact&quot; launched in 2012. 18F a new digital government delivery service, was formed in early 2014 and United States Digital Service (USDS) was launched later in 2014.

===South America===

====Brazil====

The goal defined in the Digital Government Strategy is to reach the total digitization of services by the end of 2022.

&quot;The main objective of the digital government is to bring citizens closer to the State. Technologies allow us to see each Brazilian better, including those who feel excluded, to direct public policies in a much more agile and efficient way and to reach mainly those who need it most&quot;, emphasizes the Digital Government secretary of the Ministry of Economy, Luís Felipe Monteiro.

==International initiatives==
The early pioneering work by some governments is now being picked up by a range of global organizations which offer support to governments in moving to a transformational government approach. For example:
*The World Bank has set up an eTransform Initiative (ETI) with support from global IT partners such as Gemalto, IBM, L-1 Identity Solutions, Microsoft and Pfizer. &quot;The eTransform Initiative is about tapping information technology, expertise and experiences&quot;, said Mohsen Khalil, Director of the World Bank Group&#x27;s Global Information and Communication Technologies Department. &quot;Government transformation is about change management facilitated by technology. This initiative will facilitate the exchange of lessons and experiences among various governments and industry players, to maximize impact and lower risks of ICT-enabled government transformation.&quot;
*A number of private sector organizations working in this area have published white papers which pull together global best practices on government transformation.
*OASIS launched (September 2010) a new Technical Committee tasked with producing a new global best practice standard for a transformational government Framework. The Framework is expressed as a number of &quot;Pattern Languages&quot;, each providing a detailed set of guidance notes and conformance clauses on how to deliver the required changes in practice.

<doc id="196652" wikidata="Q7051686" url="?curid=196652" title="Norma Khouri">
<text>Norma Khouri is the pen name of author Norma Bagain Toliopoulos (born Norma Bagain in Jordan in 1970). She is the author of the book titled &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; (known under its original title in Australia, Britain, and Commonwealth nations and as &quot;Honor Lost&quot; in the United States). The book was published by Random House in 2003.

The book, which became a bestseller, purported to describe the honor killing of her best friend in Jordan. After criticism from Jordanian writers and groups in regards to numerous errors, the book was exposed as a literary hoax in 2004.

==Early life==
Khouri was born in Jordan in 1970, and moved to Chicago in the United States with her parents in 1973. She attended a Catholic school in South Chicago.

In 1993, she married John Toliopoulos, the father of her two children, Zoe and Christopher. In about 2001, Khouri, Toliopoulos and their children moved to Australia, from where she published a non-fiction account of the supposed honour killing of her best friend in Jordan. After the revelation of her literary hoax made headline news, she moved back to the United States. She is the subject of the 2007 film &quot;Forbidden Lie$&quot;.

==&quot;Forbidden Love&quot; hoax==
On July 24, 2004, Malcolm Knox, literary editor of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, revealed that Khouri was not living in Jordan during 1993-1995 (the timeframe of &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;), but was living in Chicago with her husband, John Toliopoulos, and her two children. She had not lived in Jordan since her early childhood, except for a three-week stay during which she apparently researched the background for her book. Knox further revealed accusations that Khouri had left the United States while being investigated for defrauding an elderly neighbor.

Things were further complicated for Random House Australia, because Khouri was sponsored under the category of nomination for distinguished talent in 2002. On July 28, 2004, the Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced that Khouri was cleared of violating visa conditions, but Khouri had already left the country of her own accord.

Khouri said she would co-operate with all requests to provide documentation and was said to be preparing to publish her next book &quot;A Matter of Honour&quot; in November 2004, again by Random House. It appears that this book was not released, as on August 18, 2004, Khouri admitted publicly that she took &quot;literary licence&quot; with the book, claiming that she did not receive any payment or royalties for writing it.

<doc id="196660" wikidata="Q982175" url="?curid=196660" title="Dennis Prager">
<text>Dennis Mark Prager (; born August 2, 1948) is an American conservative radio talk show host and writer. He is the host of the nationally syndicated radio talk show &quot;The Dennis Prager Show&quot;. In 2009, he co-founded PragerU, which primarily creates five-minute videos from an American conservative perspective, among other content.

His initial political work starting in 1969 concerned Refuseniks, the Soviet Jews who were unable to emigrate. He gradually began offering more and broader commentary on politics.

== Early life and education ==
Dennis Prager was born in Brooklyn to Hilda (; 1919–2009) and Max Prager (1918–2014), the latter the son of Polish Jewish immigrants. Prager and his brother, Kenneth Prager, were raised in a Modern Orthodox Jewish home. He attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush in Brooklyn, New York, where he befriended Joseph Telushkin.

Prager attended Brooklyn College, where he double-majored in anthropology and history, and received a B.A. in 1970. He became a fellow at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and attended there from 1970 to 1972, while he also took courses at the University of Leeds. After he left graduate school, Prager left Modern Orthodoxy but maintained many traditional Jewish practices; he remains religious. Prager holds an honorary Doctor of Laws from Pepperdine University.

== Career ==
=== Beginnings ===

In 1969, while he was studying in England, he was recruited by a Jewish group to travel to the Soviet Union to interview Jews about their life there. When he returned the next year, he was in demand as a speaker on repression of Soviet Jews; he earned enough from lectures to travel, and visited around sixty countries. He became the national spokesman for the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.

The start of Prager&#x27;s career overlapped with a growing tendency among American Jews, who had been staunchly liberal, to move toward the center and some to the right, driven in part by the influx of Jews from the Soviet Union. In 1975, Prager and Telushkin published an introduction to Judaism intended for nonobservant Jews: &quot;The Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism&quot;, which became a bestseller. Among the questions addressed in the text were: how does Judaism differ from Christianity, and can one doubt the existence of God and still be a good Jew, and how do you account for unethical but religious Jews?

Prager ran the Brandeis-Bardin Institute from 1976 to 1983; Telushkin worked with him there. It was Prager&#x27;s first salaried job. He soon earned a reputation as a moral critic attacking secularism and narcissism, both of which he said were destroying society; some people called him a Jewish Billy Graham.

===1980s===
In 1982, KABC (AM) in Los Angeles hired Prager to host its Sunday night religious talk show &quot;Religion on the Line&quot;, which got top ratings and eventually led to a weekday talk show. He and Telushkin published another book in 1983, &quot;Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitism&quot;.

According to a review in &quot;Commentary&quot;, the book depicts antisemitism as a &quot;sinister form of flattery&quot;; the authors wrote that hatred of Jews arises from resentment over Jews&#x27; acceptance of the doctrine that they are God&#x27;s chosen people, charged with bringing a moral message to the world. The book describes Jews as both a nation (stateless for a long time) and followers of a religion and says that this identity is essential to Judaism; the book says that calls for Jews to culturally assimilate as well as opposition to Zionism are both forms of antisemitism. The book describes secular Jews as people who have lost their way, and who generally fall into the error of applying Judaism&#x27;s mission to reform the world in ways that tend to be leftist, totalitarian, and destructive.

He also wrote a syndicated column for newspapers across the country. In 1985, Prager launched his own quarterly journal, &quot;Ultimate Issues&quot;, which was renamed to &quot;The Prager Perspective&quot; in 1996.

In 1986, he divorced and underwent a year of therapy, which the &quot;Encyclopedia of Judaism&quot; says contributed to his 1999 book &quot;Happiness is a Serious Problem&quot;. In 1990, he wrote an essay called &quot;Judaism, Homosexuality and Civilization&quot; that argued against normalizing homosexuality in the Jewish community and placed sexual sins on a continuum from premarital sex, celibacy, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, and incest; he argued that confining sex to heterosexual marriage desexualized religion, which was a great achievement of ancient Jewish tradition that was worth fighting to retain.

===1990s===
By 1992, he was remarried. By that time he was, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Jewish Journal&quot;, a &quot;fixture on local radio&quot; and &quot;a Jewish St. George battling the forces of secularity on behalf of simple &#x27;goodness&#x27;&quot;, and generally socially conservative, with some exceptions; he supported a woman&#x27;s legal access to abortion (although he said it was usually immoral), and supported and justified sex between non-married consenting men and women. In 1992, he became involved with the Stephen S. Wise Temple and gave talks there, and got a weekday night talk show on KABC.

In 1994, Prager also did an hour each weekday, via satellite on WABC, KABC&#x27;s sister station in New York, before doing his KABC show locally.

During the 1994–1995 television season, Multimedia Entertainment syndicated a television show featuring Prager. Prager said he was &quot;ambivalent about television as a medium for deep, intelligent programming&quot; but that the show was &quot;an incredible opportunity to reach a mass audience with my belief system&quot;. In 1995, he moved the studio audience on-stage with him where they could interact with him more directly.

==Political commentary==
Prager supported Jimmy Carter in the 1976 US presidential election. In 1994, the Anti-Defamation League published a report on antisemitism in the Christian right movement; Prager, who aligned with the social and political conservatism of the Christian right, attacked the ADL and its report. In 1995, he urged conservative Jews to be open to working with conservative Christians, like the Christian Coalition. In 1995, he named Jacob Petuchowski, Eliezer Berkovits, Harold Kushner, C.S. Lewis, Richard John Neuhaus, Michael Novak, and George Gilder as the people who had influenced his theology the most.

In 1995, Prager criticized the Illinois Supreme Court decision in the Baby Richard case that removed a child from his adoptive parents. With KABC he held a &quot;Rally for Baby Richard&quot;, where he got support from actors Priscilla Presley, Tom Selleck, and John McCook.

In 1996, Prager testified in Congress in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. Prager testified that &quot;the acceptance of homosexuality as the equal of heterosexual marital love signifies the decline of Western civilization.&quot; Prager worked with Bob Dole&#x27;s campaign in the 1996 presidential election; when polls prior to the election showed that the Dole campaign did not have much Jewish support, Prager said this was because &quot;American Jews are ignorant regarding the anti Israel aspects of the current Democrat Party.&quot;

Since 1999, he has hosted a nationally syndicated talk show on the socially and politically conservative Christian radio station KRLA in Los Angeles. KRLA is part of the Salem Media Group that carries other conservative hosts, including James Dobson, Randall Terry, Janet Parshall, Sebastian Gorka and Larry Elder; it is a key voice of the Christian right that seeks to change American politics as well as the way that individual people live.

In 2006, Prager criticized Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, for announcing that he would use the Quran for the reenactment of his swearing in ceremony. Prager wrote: &quot;Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don&#x27;t serve in Congress.&quot; In response, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch called for Prager to end his service on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Council.

In 2009, Prager joined other Salem Radio Network hosts to oppose the Affordable Care Act. In 2014, while same-sex marriage in the United States was in the process of being nationally legalized, he wrote that if that were to happen, then &quot;there is no plausible argument for denying polygamous relationships, or brothers and sisters, or parents and adult children, the right to marry.&quot; In 2014, he also said that the &quot;heterosexual AIDS&quot; crisis was something &quot;entirely manufactured by the Left&quot;.

Prager endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, but said that Trump was his &quot;17th choice out of 17 candidates&quot;. He clarified that he &quot;was not a Trump supporter, when there was a choice&quot; but added, &quot;There is no choice now.&quot; Prager had previously said that Trump was &quot;unfit to be a presidential candidate, let alone president&quot;. Conor Friedersdorf of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; criticized Prager for endorsing Trump.

In 2017, Prager was invited to be a guest conductor for the volunteer orchestra of Santa Monica, California, as part of a fundraising concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Some of the orchestra members protested the invitation, which they considered promoting bigotry. The orchestra leader, Guido Lamell, had invited Prager because he admired him, as Prager often discussed and promoted classical music on his shows and had guest-conducted a few times in the past, and because he thought Prager&#x27;s presence might help raise more money. Lamell called Prager &quot;a great man, leader and friend&quot;.

In February 2020, he told a caller: &quot;Of course you should never call anybody the n-word, that&#x27;s despicable,&quot; but complained about the word itself being considered unacceptable. In April 2020, Prager called the COVID-19 lockdowns &quot;the greatest mistake in the history of humanity.&quot; He was subsequently criticized in the media for trivializing the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a 2020 video called &quot;&#x27;Follow the Science&#x27; Is a LIE&quot;, Prager touted Sweden&#x27;s response to COVID-19 and asserted, &quot;Sweden is the proof that lockdowns are useless&quot;. A fact check in December 2020 found Prager&#x27;s claim false, as Sweden had higher rates of COVID infection and mortality than other Scandinavian countries. Since then Prager continues to criticize the lockdowns as unwarranted and destructive to society after findings from a commission set up by Sweden&#x27;s parliament concluded that the government should have shut venues and taken other tougher measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic, though its no-lockdown strategy was broadly beneficial (dated February 25, 2022).

In a November 2021 Newsmax interview, Prager argued that &quot;irrational fears&quot; about people not vaccinated against COVID-19 had wrongly made them &quot;the pariahs of America as I have not seen in my lifetime&quot;, more than gay men and intravenous drug users during the AIDS crisis, who he inaccurately said had not been ostracized. &quot;The Independent&quot; called his comments &quot;alarming revisionism&quot;. In the interview, Prager also called concerns about climate change &quot;idiotic&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot;.

== PragerU ==

In 2009, Prager and his producer Allen Estrin started a website called PragerU, which creates five-minute videos on various topics from a conservative perspective. &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; described PragerU as &quot;one of the biggest, most influential and yet least understood forces in online media.&quot; it spent around 40% of its annual $10 million budget on marketing; each video is produced according to a consistent style. Videos cover topics such as &quot;racism, sexism, income inequality, gun ownership, Islam, immigration, Israel, police brutality&quot; and speech on college campuses. &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; wrote that &quot;the biggest reason PragerU has escaped national attention is that it mostly doesn&#x27;t do Trump,&quot; or engage with the political news cycle. Some of its videos had viewer access restricted by YouTube in 2017.

== Personal life ==
Prager speaks English, French, Russian and Hebrew. His brother, Kenneth Prager, is a physician and professor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center who advocates for vaccines and against hydroxychloroquine. His nephew, Joshua Prager, is a former writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He also has a son, David Prager.

In November 2024, Prager suffered a serious back injury as the result of a fall.

== Bibliography ==
In 2018, Prager published a commentary on the Book of Exodus; this was followed by another commentary on the Book of Genesis in 2019. Both were published by the Salem Media Group.

<text>Lawrence Hargrave, MRAeS, (29 January 18506 July 1915) was an Australian engineer, explorer, astronomer, inventor and aeronautical pioneer. He was perhaps best known for inventing the box kite, which was quickly adopted by other aircraft designers and subsequently formed the aerodynamic basis of early biplanes.

== Biography ==

Lawrence Hargrave was born in Greenwich, England, the second son of John Fletcher Hargrave (later Attorney-General of NSW), and was educated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland, where there is now a DT building named in his honour. He immigrated to Australia at fifteen years of age with his family, arriving in Sydney on 5 November 1865 on the &quot;La Hogue&quot;. He accepted a place on the &quot;Ellesmere&quot; and circumnavigated Australia. Although he had shown ability in mathematics at his English school he failed the matriculation examination and in 1867 took an engineering apprenticeship with the Australasian Steam Navigation Company in Sydney. He later found the experience of great use in constructing his models and his theories.

In 1872, as an engineer, Hargrave sailed on the &quot;Maria&quot; on a voyage to New Guinea but the ship was wrecked. In 1875, he again sailed as an engineer on William John Macleay&#x27;s expedition to the Gulf of Papua. From October 1875 to January 1876 he was exploring the hinterland of Port Moresby under Octavius Stone, and in April 1876 went on another expedition under Luigi D&#x27;Albertis for over 400 miles up the Fly River on the SS &quot;Ellengowan&quot;. In 1877 he was inspecting the newly developing pearling industry for Parbury Lamb and Co. He returned to Sydney, joined the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1877, and in 1878 became an assistant astronomical observer at Sydney Observatory. He held this position for about five years, retired in 1883 with a moderate competency, and gave the rest of his life to research work.

Hargrave was a Freemason.

== Aeronautics ==
Hargrave had been interested in experiments of all kinds from an early age, particularly those with aircraft. When his father died in 1885, and Hargrave came into his inheritance, he resigned from the observatory to concentrate on full-time research and for a time gave particular attention to the flight of birds. He chose to live and experiment with his flying machines in Stanwell Park, a place which offers excellent wind and hang conditions and nowadays is the most famous hang gliding and paragliding venue in Australia.

In his career, Hargrave invented many devices, but never applied for a patent on any of them. He needed the money but he was a passionate believer in scientific communication as a key to furthering progress. As he wrote in 1893:
Workers must root out the idea [that] by keeping the results of their labours to themselves[,] a fortune will be assured to them. Patent fees are much wasted money. The flying machine of the future will not be born fully fledged and capable of a flight for 1000 miles or so. Like everything else it must be evolved gradually. The first difficulty is to get a thing that will fly at all. When this is made, a full description should be published as an aid to others. Excellence of design and workmanship will always defy competition.
Among many, three of Hargrave&#x27;s inventions were particularly significant:
* study of curved aerofoils, particularly designs with a thicker leading edge;
* the box kite (1893), which greatly improved the lift to drag ratio of early gliders;
* work on the rotary engine, which powered many early flying machines up until about 1920.

He made endless experiments and numerous models, and communicated his conclusions in a series of papers to the Royal Society of New South Wales. Two papers which will be found in the 1885 volume of its &quot;Journal and Proceedings&quot; show that he was early on the road to success. Other important papers will be found in the 1893 and 1895 volumes which reported on his experiments with flying-machine motors and cellular kites.
Of great significance to those pioneers working toward powered flight, Hargrave successfully lifted himself off the ground under a train of four of his box kites at Stanwell Park Beach on 12 November 1894. Aided by James Swain, the caretaker at his property, the kite line was moored via a spring balance to two sandbags (see image). Hargrave carried an anemometer and clinometer aloft to measure wind speed and the angle of the kite line. He rose 16 feet in a wind speed of 21 mph. This experiment was widely reported and established the box kite as a stable aerial platform. Hargrave claimed that &quot;The particular steps gained are the demonstration that an extremely simple apparatus can be made, carried about, and flown by one man; and that a safe means of making an ascent with a flying machine, of trying the same without any risk of accident, and descending, is now at the service of any experimenter who wishes to use it.&quot; This was seen by Abbott Lawrence Rotch of the meteorological observatory at Harvard University who constructed a kite from the particulars in &quot;Engineering&quot;. A modification was adopted by the weather bureau of the United States and the use of box-kites for meteorological observations became widespread. The principle was applied to gliders, and in October 1906 Alberto Santos-Dumont used the box-kite principle in his aeroplane to make his first flight. Until 1909 the box-kite aeroplane was the usual type in Europe.

Hargrave had not confined himself to the problem of constructing a heavier-than-air machine that would fly, for he had given much time to the means of propulsion. In 1889 he invented a rotary engine which appears to have attracted so little notice that its principle had to be discovered over again by the Seguin brothers in 1908. This form of engine was much used in early aviation until it was superseded by later inventions. His development of the rotary engine was frustrated by the weight of materials and quality of machining available at the time, and he was unable to get sufficient power from his engines to build an independent flying machine.

Hargrave&#x27;s work inspired Alexander Graham Bell to begin his own experiments with a series of tetrahedral kite designs. However, Hargrave&#x27;s work, like that of many other pioneers, was not sufficiently appreciated during his lifetime. His models were offered to the premier of New South Wales as a gift to the state, and it is generally incorrectly stated that the offer was not accepted. It is not clear what really happened, but there appears to have been delays in accepting the models, and in the meantime about 100 of them were given to some visiting German professors who handed them to the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Hargrave also conducted experiments with a hydroplane, the application of the gyroscopic principle to a &quot;one-wheeled car&quot;, and with &#x27;wave propelled vessels&#x27;.

Hargrave&#x27;s only son Geoffrey was killed at the Battle of Gallipoli in May 1915 during World War I. Hargrave was operated on for appendicitis but suffered peritonitis afterwards and died in July 1915. He was interred in Waverley Cemetery on the cliffs overlooking the open ocean.

Hargrave was an excellent experimenter and his models were well crafted. He had the optimism that is essential for an inventor, and the perseverance that will not allow itself to be damped by failures. Modest, unassuming and unselfish, he always refused to patent his inventions, and was only anxious that he might succeed in adding to the sum of human knowledge. Many men smiled at his efforts and few had faith that anything would come of them. An honourable exception was Professor Richard Threlfall who, in his presidential address to the Royal Society of New South Wales in May 1895, spoke of his &quot;strong conviction of the importance of the work which Mr Hargrave has done towards solving the problem of artificial flight&quot;. Threlfall called Hargrave the &quot;inventor of human flight&quot;, and the debt supposed to be owed by the Wright brothers to Hargrave. The step he made in man&#x27;s conquest of the air was an important one with far-reaching consequences, and he should be remembered as an important experimenter and inventor, who &quot;probably did as much to bring about the accomplishment of dynamic flight as any other single individual&quot;.

<doc id="196667" wikidata="Q154993" url="?curid=196667" title="Christian VI of Denmark">
<text>Christian VI (30 November 1699 – 6 August 1746) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1730 to 1746. The eldest surviving son of Frederick IV and Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, he is considered one of Denmark-Norway&#x27;s more anonymous kings, but he was a skilled politician, best known for his authoritarian regime. He was the first king of the Oldenburg dynasty to refrain from entering in any war. During his reign both compulsory confirmation (1736) and a public, nationwide school system (1739) were introduced. His chosen motto was &quot;Deo et populo&quot; (for God and the people).

==Early years==

Christian was born in the early hours of the morning on 30 November 1699 at Copenhagen Castle as the second but eldest surviving son of King Frederick IV of Denmark by his first consort, Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. A former heir to the throne, also named Christian, had died in infancy in 1698, and as his grandfather King Christian V had died just three months, before he was born, he was thus crown prince from birth. The newborn prince was baptized later the same day by the royal confessor Peder Jespersen, and was named after his late grandfather, King Christian V.

From 1706, Christian came to understand Danish but used German for everyday speaking and writing. He received a better education than both his father and grandfather.

As Crown Prince, he was allowed by his father to find a royal wife by himself. During a trip through Europe accompanied by Chancellor Ulrik Adolf Holstein, the Crown Prince decided on Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, one of the ladies-in-waiting at the court of the Saxon-Polish queen Christiane Eberhardine in the Castle Pretzsch. Sophia Magdalene came from a minor margraviate (not greater than Lolland-Falster) of the Hohenzollern dynasty where able consciousness was inversely proportional to the funds; half of the land was mortgaged, and her father died young. She had 13 siblings and was considered an unequal match for the Danish prince, but the king gave his permission. In Christian&#x27;s letters, he describes his feelings for the princess&#x27;s intense religiosity, which reminded him of his own. They were married on 7 August 1721, while Christian was crown prince. The wedding was held at Pretzsch in Saxony.

==Reign==

At the death of Frederick IV on 12 October 1730, the couple became King and Queen of Denmark-Norway. They were crowned on 6 June 1731 in the Chapel of Frederiksborg Palace.

The king was shy and introverted by nature, and stayed away from the public. Christian&#x27;s indignation at his father&#x27;s bigamy and general promiscuity – the reason for the great sorrow of his late mother – led him to one of his first government actions: reversing his father&#x27;s will and depriving widow Queen Anna Sophie, (Frederick IV&#x27;s third wife if all &quot;marriages&quot; are counted, second wife if bigamous marriages excluded), of a large part of the wealth she had inherited before exiling her to the Clausholm estate, her childhood home.

For the first ten years of his government he consulted often with his cousin, Count Christian Ernst of Stolberg-Wernigerode. The count took part in almost everything, from the dismissal of cooks in the Queen&#x27;s kitchen to determining alliance policy. He encouraged the king as long as possible to maintain the English alliance, which led to the marriage between Louise, the daughter of George II of Great Britain with the king&#x27;s elder son Frederick.

In 1733, the royal couple travelled to Norway. A poem/speech by Peter Höyer was performed in his honor when he visited the city of Trondheim on 18 July.

Christian&#x27;s central domestic act was the introduction of the so-called adscription of 1733 (in Danish, &quot;stavnsbånd&quot;), a law that forced peasants to remain in their home regions, and by which the peasantry was subjected to both the local nobility and the army. Though the idea behind this law was probably to secure a constant number of peasant soldiers, it later was widely regarded as the ultimate subjugation of the Danish peasantry, and damaged Christian VI&#x27;s reputation. The act would later be abolished in 1788.
The Pietist views of King Christian influenced much of his ecclesiastical polity although both nobility and many common people secretly resisted the king&#x27;s influence. This did not mean that it was without effect. It had an influence on much of the poetry of the age including that of hymn writer Hans Adolph Brorson (1694–1764). Another lasting result of the king&#x27;s efforts was the introduction of mandatory confirmation in 1736. This required some level of literacy, thereby promoting the need for a common school system, which was created by decree in 1739.

There were numerous building activities connected to Christian VI, and he was probably the greatest Danish builder of the 18th century; his queen also made a notable effort. Among their works are Christiansborg Palace (built 1732–1742, burned in 1794, rebuilt); Hirschholm Palace, a summer country retreat in North Zealand in current day Hørsholm municipality (built 1737–1739, demolished 1812); and the Eremitage (built 1734–1736, still standing). For Crown Prince Frederik (V) was built the Prince&#x27;s palace in Kalveboderne (built 1743–1744, still standing as the National Museum). The construction of these expensive buildings was financed by Øresundstolden, with the purpose of representing the power and wealth of the Danish realm, but they also became an economic burden on the subjects.

Christian&#x27;s foreign policy was a peaceful one and Denmark-Norway kept strictly neutral. In both trade and commerce, it was an age of advancement; some new companies and banks were founded. His plans to make their only daughter, Princess Louise, Queen of Sweden never came to fruition. During the election of the heir to the Swedish throne, both the prince of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld and the prince of Mecklenburg were considered as candidates to be heir to the childless King Frederick I of Sweden. In 1743, Adolf Frederik of Holstein-Gottorp was elected Swedish heir.
===Treaty of San Ildefonso===
The Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1742, signed between Spain and Denmark-Norway, was a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation by setting out the conditions that would govern commercial relations between the two countries. José del Campillo y Cossio on behalf of Philip V of Spain and Frederik Ludvig, Baron Dehn, by Christian VI, adjusted the agreement at the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso on 18 July 1742. The treaty was never made effective: Spanish authorities considered that the exemption clause on half of the taxes for the import of Danish fish conflicted with other treaties with third countries, in which they were guaranteed preference in trade with Spain. In 1753 the agreement would be nullified.

===Death===

From his youth, Christian VI was sickly and chronically ill. On 6 August 1746 – the day before his silver marriage anniversary – the king died on Hirschholm Palace. Christian VI was interred in Roskilde Cathedral. The neoclassical memorial designed and produced by sculptor Johannes Wiedewelt was commissioned by the king&#x27;s widow who upon his death.

The marble monument was completed in 1768, but not installed at Roskilde Cathedral until 1777. The monument includes a sarcophagus and two female figures, &quot;Sorgen&quot; (&quot;Sorrow&quot;) and &quot;Berømmelsen&quot; (&quot;Fame&quot;). This was the first neoclassical sarcophagus in Denmark and is considered to mark the start of neoclassicism in that country.

===Legacy===
To posterity, Christian VI is known foremost as a religious ruler. He was deeply devoted to Pietism, and during his entire reign he tried to impart its teachings to his subjects. The religious pressure he imposed, along with his lack of personal charm, made him one of the most unpopular of Denmark-Norway&#x27;s absolutist kings; but he was the first who never went to war nor was involved in war.

The cities of Kristiansund in Norway and Christiansted on Saint Croix are named for him.

<text>Frederick IV (Danish: &quot;Frederik&quot;; 11 October 1671 – 12 October 1730) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1699 until his death. Frederick was the son of Christian V of Denmark-Norway and his wife Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel.

==Early life==
Frederick was born on 11 October 1671 at Copenhagen Castle as the eldest son of King Christian V and his spouse Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel. His grandfather King Frederick III had died a year and a half before he was born, and as the eldest son of the ruling King he was thus Crown Prince from birth. The newborn prince was baptised the same evening with the name Frederick by the royal confessor Hans Leth. The royal baptismal font, which has been used for the baptism of the royal children in Denmark ever since, was used for the first time at his christening.

At the age of 18, he was given a seat on the Council of State as the heir apparent to the throne.

As Crown Prince, Frederick broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg, as the hill in Valby was then known, the future site of Frederiksberg Palace. The one-storey building, probably designed by Ernst Brandenburger, was completed in 1703.

Frederick was allowed to choose his future wife from a number of Protestant royal daughters in northern Germany. In 1695, he visited the court of Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow in Güstrow. But his visit there was cut short by a message telling of his brother Prince Christian&#x27;s serious illness (he had, in fact, already died in Ulm). Frederick later returned to Güstrow, where he was forced to choose the eldest of the unmarried princesses. On 5 December 1695 at Copenhagen Castle, he married Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, herself a great-great-granddaughter of Frederick II of Denmark. 

At the death of Christian V on 25 August 1699, the couple became King and Queen of Denmark-Norway. They were crowned on 15 April 1700 in the chapel of Frederiksborg Palace.
==Reign==
===Domestic rule===
Frederick&#x27;s most important domestic reform was the abolition in 1702 of the so-called &quot;vornedskab&quot;, a kind of serfdom which had applied to the peasants of Zealand since the Late Middle Ages. His efforts were largely in vain because of the introduction in 1733 of adscription (&quot;stavnsbånd&quot;), a law that forced peasants to remain in their home regions, by which the peasantry were subjected to both the local nobility and the army.

After the Great Northern War, trade and culture flowered. The first Danish theatre, Lille Grønnegade Theatre, was created and the great dramatist Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) began his career. He established the College of Missions which funded the missionary Hans Egede (1686–1758) in taking forward the colonisation of Greenland. Politically this period was marked by the King&#x27;s connection to the Reventlows, the Holsteiner relatives of his second queen, and by his growing suspicion of the old nobility.

During Frederick&#x27;s rule Copenhagen was struck by two disasters: the plague of 1711, and the great fire of October 1728, which destroyed most of the medieval capital. The King had been persuaded by astronomer Ole Rømer (1644–1710) to introduce the Gregorian calendar in Denmark-Norway in 1700, but the astronomer&#x27;s observations and calculations were among the treasures lost to the fire.

Frederik IV, having twice visited Italy, had two pleasure palaces built in the Italian baroque style: Frederiksberg Palace was extended during his reign, when it was converted into a three-storey H-shaped building, completed in 1709 by Johan Conrad Ernst, giving the palace a true Italian baroque appearance and Fredensborg Palace, both considered monuments to the conclusion of the Great Northern War.
=== Venetian journey ===
Frederick IV holds a memorable place in the social history of the city of Venice due to a remarkable visit he made during the winter of 1708–09. The King stayed in the city with an entourage of at least 80 people, formally incognito under the title &quot;Count of Oldenburg.&quot; This disguise was not meant to conceal his identity, but rather to avoid the cumbersome and costly etiquette required for a royal visit.

During his nine-week stay, Frederick IV became a familiar figure in Venice. He was a frequent guest at operas and comedies, indulging in the city&#x27;s vibrant cultural scene. The King was also a generous buyer of Venetian glass, which was highly prized at the time. His visit to the state arsenal of Venice was marked by a prestigious gift from the republic: two large bronze cannons and a bronze mortar.

One of the highlights of his stay was a grand regatta on the Grand Canal held in his honour, which was immortalized in a painting by Luca Carlevarijs. In the painting, Frederick IV is depicted in a gondola with eight rowers, accompanied by a cavalier, enjoying the spectacle. This event is celebrated as a key moment in the King&#x27;s visit.

The winter of 1708–09 was unusually cold, so much so that the lagoon surrounding Venice froze over. Venetians were able to walk from the city to the mainland, and it became a popular joke that the King of Denmark had brought the cold weather with him.

Frederick IV&#x27;s time in Italy was not confined to Venice. He also made a visit to the dowager grand-princess Violante Beatrice at the grand-ducal court of the Medici family in Florence, further cementing his ties with the European nobility.

Upon his return journey, Frederick IV conducted political negotiations with Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, as well as with Frederick I of Prussia, regarding the impending war against Sweden. His visit to Venice thus not only contributed to his cultural experience but also had significant political implications.
Much of the King&#x27;s life was spent in strife with kinsmen. Two of his first cousins, Charles XII of Sweden and Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (the three men were the grandsons of Frederick III of Denmark), had waged war upon his father jointly. Initially defeated by the Swedes and forced to recognise the independence of Holstein-Gottorp, Frederick finally drove the next duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Duke Charles Frederick (who was Frederick IV&#x27;s first cousin once removed) out of Schleswig in 1713, and avoided the revenge contemplated by Charles Frederick&#x27;s mother-in-law, Catherine I of Russia.

=== Personal life ===
Frederick was deemed a man of responsibility and industry — often regarded as the most intelligent of Denmark-Norway&#x27;s absolute monarchs. He seems to have mastered the art of remaining independent of his ministers. Lacking all interest in academic knowledge, he was nevertheless a patron of culture, especially art and architecture. His main weaknesses were probably pleasure-seeking and womanising, which sometimes distracted him. He was the penultimate Danish king to make a morganatic marriage (the last was Frederick VII with Louise Rasmussen aka &quot;Countess Danner&quot;).

Without divorcing Queen Louise, in 1703 he married Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg (d.1704). After the death of Elisabeth, he entered into a romance with her lady-in-waiting Charlotte Helene von Schindel, though he later lost interest in her. In 1711, Frederick fell in love with 19-year-old Countess Anne Sophie Reventlow, daughter of the then Grand-Chancellor Conrad von Reventlow. He carried her off from her home, Clausholm Castle near Randers, after her mother refused to let her daughter be a royal mistress. Frederick had seen Anne Sophie at a masquerade ball at Koldinghus, where the royal family resided during the plague that devastated Copenhagen. A secret marriage was held at Skanderborg on 26 June 1712. At that time he accorded her the title &quot;Duchess of Schleswig&quot; (derived from one of his own subsidiary titles). Three weeks after Queen Louise&#x27;s death in Copenhagen on 4 April 1721, he legalised his relationship with Anna Sophie by a new marriage, this time declaring her queen consort (the first wife of a hereditary Danish king to bear that title who was not of royal blood by birth). It was undoubtedly a relief to regularise a relationship they both saw as sinful. Of the nine children born to him of these three wives, only two of them survived to adulthood: the future Christian VI and Princess Charlotte-Amalia, both from the first marriage. All the other children died in infancy.

The Reventlows took advantage of their kinship to the King. Anna&#x27;s sister, the salonist Countess Christine Sophie Holstein of Holsteinborg, was nicknamed &quot;Madame Chancellor&quot; because of her influence. Within a year of making Anna Queen, Frederick also recognized as dynastic the issue of the morganatic marriages of two of her kinsmen, Duke Philip Ernest of Schleswig-Holstein-Glucksburg (1673–1729) and Duke Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Plön-Norburg (1674–1706), to non-royal nobles. The other Schleswig-Holstein dukes of the House of Oldenburg perceived their interests to be injured, and Frederick found himself embroiled in complicated lawsuits and petitions to the Holy Roman Emperor. Also offended by the Countess&#x27;s elevation were Frederick&#x27;s younger unmarried siblings, Princess Sophia Hedwig (1677–1735) and Prince Charles (1680–1729), who withdrew from Copenhagen to their own rival court at the handsomely re-modelled Vemmetofte Cloister (later a haven for dowerless damsels of the nobility).

===Later life===
During the King&#x27;s last years he had dropsy (oedema), and was also affected by the consequences of an accident in an explosion in a cannon foundry in Copenhagen. He also had private sorrows that inclined him toward Pietism, a form of faith that would rise to prevalence during the reign of his son. During his last years, Frederick IV asked for the loyalty of his son in order to protect Queen Anna Sophie. Despite the growing weakness, he set in 1730 on a muster travel; he reached Gottorp but had to return, and died in Odense, on the day after his 59th birthday. He was buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the site of the mausoleum of Danish royalty.

<doc id="196670" wikidata="Q156187" url="?curid=196670" title="Frederick V of Denmark">
<text>Frederick V (Danish and Norwegian: &quot;Frederik V&quot;; 31 March 1723 – 14 January 1766) was King of Denmark and Norway and Duke of Schleswig-Holstein from 6 August 1746 until his death in 1766. A member of the House of Oldenburg, he was the son of Christian VI of Denmark and Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.

Although the personal influence of Frederick was limited, his reign was marked by the progress of commerce and trade, and art and science prospered under his reign. Unlike his parents who were deeply devoted to Pietism, Frederick grew into a hedonist. As regent, he took part in the conduct of government by attending council meetings, but he was afflicted by alcoholism and most of his rule was dominated by able ministers who were influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. His ministers marked his reign by the progress of commerce and the emerging industry. They also avoided involving Denmark-Norway in the European wars of his time. Although Frederick V wasn&#x27;t personally interested in cultural affairs, his first wife was, and the public entertainment and freedom of expression that had been banned during his father&#x27;s reign was again permitted.

== Early years ==
=== Birth and family ===

Prince Frederick was born between 10 and 11 in the evening on 31 March 1723. He was the grandson of King Frederick IV of Denmark and Norway and the only son of Crown Prince Christian and Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Frederick was the last Danish prince to be born in the then antiquated and overextended Copenhagen Castle, which dated from the late 14th century, and had assumed a monstrous appearance and started to crumble under its own weight after several extensions. Demolition of the castle began in 1731 to make way for a more adequate royal residence, the vast Baroque style Christiansborg Palace, from where Frederick would eventually reign. The young prince was baptized the following day in the Crown Princess&#x27;s Bedchamber by the royal confessor Christen Lemvig, and was named after his grandfather, King Frederick IV. 

As the Crown Prince&#x27;s only son, Frederick was destined to rule from birth. A younger sister died in infancy in 1724, and his only surviving sister, Princess Louise, was born in 1726. On 12 October 1730, King Frederick IV died and Frederick&#x27;s father ascended the throne as King Christian VI. Frederick himself became Crown Prince at the age of seven.

=== Upbringing and education ===

Christian VI and Queen Sophie Magdalene were deeply devoted to Pietism, a movement within Lutheranism that combines its emphasis on biblical doctrine with an emphasis on individual piety and living a vigorous Christian life. As a consequence, Frederick was given a strictly religious upbringing. At the age of 7, he received his own royal household with the German nobleman Georg Wilhelm von Söhlenthal as his hofmeister. Söhlenthal was an ardent supporter of the Moravian Brethren, and his home was the center of the pietistic circles in Copenhagen. He shared a deep religious piety with the king, and for a time he was Christian VI&#x27;s adviser on ecclesiastical matters. However, Söhlenthal did not succeed in influencing the spiritual development of the Crown Prince, as he was an overly gentle and weak character, and in 1738 he was dismissed from his position as hofmeister.

Frederick&#x27;s education became rather deficient. In 1730 the king entrusted the significant and well-educated privy councillor Iver Rosenkrantz supervision of Crown Prince Frederik&#x27;s upbringing, but this had no influence on the actual teaching. Rosenkrantz was a supporter of the traditional Lutheran orthodoxy, while Christian VI more and more became a proponent of Pietism and lost confidence in Rosenkrantz. The Crown Prince&#x27;s education was therefore completely carried out in the German Pietist spirit that prevailed at court. Like his ancestors at the then primarily German-speaking court in Copenhagen, he only had a poor command of the Danish language, and knew German better than Danish all his life. None the less, his mother ironically referred to him as &quot;Der Dänische Prinz&quot; (literally &quot;The Danish Prince&quot; in German) because he occasionally spoke Danish. Apart from a certain interest in coin collecting, he only had modest cultural or intellectual interests.

Prince Frederick proved himself from an early age to have a completely different nature from his strict and somewhat gloomy parents. He was gentle and kind in nature, cheerful and accessible to everyone, and wanted to see his subjects happy. Unlike his secluded parents, who were rarely seen outside their palaces, he enjoyed spending time in public with people from all walks of life. Despite his upbringing in a strictly pietistic home, he was not himself gripped by pietism. Although certainly not unfamiliar with religious sentiments, Frederick grew into a hedonist who enjoyed the pleasures of life such as deer stalking, wine and women.

This hedonism, however, evolved to debauchery, and Frederick became well known for a libertine lifestyle marked by sexual licentiousness and alcoholism. With a group of other rakes, he would tour the city&#x27;s taverns and brothels, to an extent that his father at one point considered having him declared legally decapacitated. The King&#x27;s more prudent advisers, however, spoke against it, as it would legally be a violation of the &quot;King&#x27;s Law&quot; (; ), the absolutist constitution of Denmark and Norway from 1665. Furthermore, it would also compromise the monarchy to an unprecedented degree to admit that the future king was unfit to rule.
Of the outmost importance for the future of the Crown Prince and his realm, was the 1730 appointment as his chamber page of Adam Gottlob Moltke, a nineteen year old nobleman from Mecklenburg who was eleven years older than Frederick. Moltke had been a page to his father, and the King and Queen counted on Moltke to teach the Crown Prince to control himself. In 1743 Moltke was promoted to Hofmeister. In fact, Moltke did nothing to control Frederick&#x27;s sexual appetite nor his alcohol consumption, but in return a lifelong relationship of trust was established between the two men, which was to become crucial after Frederick&#x27;s ascension to throne.

In 1740, the Crown Prince was confirmed, and from then on as heir to the throne was given a seat in the Council of State. During the Swedish succession crisis in 1743 following the death of Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden in 1741, when it was clear that no legitimate heir was to be expected, Crown Prince Frederick in 1743 had great prospects of being elected heir to the throne in Sweden. The peasantry unilaterally elected Crown Prince Frederick, and in Dalecarlia the peasants even instigated a rebellion, the Dalecarlian rebellion or &quot;stora daldansen&quot; () to enforce his election. However, as a result of the Treaty of Åbo in 1743, which ended the Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743, Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp was appointed heir to the throne in place of Crown Prince Frederick, after pressure from the Russian empress Elizabeth Petrovna.

=== First marriage ===

Crown Prince Frederick&#x27;s propensity for debauchery accelerated his marriage negotiations in the hope that marriage would suppress the frequent drinking and debauched behaviour of the Crown Prince. In 1743, a dynastic marriage was negotiated between him and Princess Louise of Great Britain, the youngest daughter of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach. The marriage was proposed by Great Britain from political reasons. At the time of the marriage, both France and Great Britain wished to make an alliance with Denmark-Norway, and being protestant Great Britain had the advantage of being able to make a marriage alliance. The Danish government was in favor of the proposal, while Frederick&#x27;s father, King Christian VI, was initially reluctant. But he was convinced, as he hoped the marriage would lead to British support for his son&#x27;s claim to the throne of Sweden. As for the Crown Prince, after having been presented with a portrait of the princess and finding her exterior appealing, and having been told of her amiability, he declared himself willing to marry Louise, all the more so as he too could see that the political circumstances made the marriage desirable.
Thus, the marriage negotiations began during the year of 1743, and were successfully concluded within a few months on 14 September. They were married in a proxy wedding ceremony on 10 November 1743 in Hanover, with the Princess&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Cumberland, acting as the representative of the groom. A week later, the entourages of Louise and Frederick met in the border city of Altona in the then Danish Duchy of Holstein, where Frederick met his wife for the first time. Louise and Frederick then travelled together to Copenhagen, where Louise held her official entry into the Danish capital to great cheers from the population on 11 December 1743. Already the same day a second wedding ceremony with the groom present was held in the chapel of the newly completed Christiansborg Palace.
Louise quickly became popular both at the royal court and among the general population, due to her natural and straightforward behavior, and her popularity also contributed to that of her husband. Although the marriage was arranged, the couple got along quite well, and at least during the first years, their relationship was apparently amicable. The couple had five children, of whom the eldest son, the heir to the throne Crown Prince Christian, did not survive infancy. However, Louise only partially succeeded in taming her husband&#x27;s licentious behavior, and not even in the first period of the marriage did he manage to stay away from the orgies to which he had become accustomed, and continued his debauched lifestyle. Although Frederick came to feel high regard for his wife and always treated her with kindness, he reportedly was not in love with her. He continued to enjoy random liaisons with others, and during the years 1746–51, the king had a favorite mistress named Madam Hansen with whom he also had five children. However, Frederick felt comfortable with Louise, and she pretended not to notice his adultery. 
After the wedding, the newlyweds initially took up residence at Charlottenborg Palace, a Baroque style residence of the Danish royal family located at Copenhagen&#x27;s largest square, Kongens Nytorv. They lived there until, in 1745, they could move into the completed Prince&#x27;s Mansion, a city mansion located just across the Frederiksholm&#x27;s Canal from Christiansborg Palace, which was remodeled for them by the Danish architect and royal building master Nicolai Eigtved in the new Rococo style. Their home quickly became the setting for a lively and entertaining court which differed greatly from the rigid and heavy etiquette that prevailed at his parents&#x27; court at Christiansborg Palace.

=== Freemasonry ===
The Norwegian Masonic historian Karl Ludvig Tørrisen Bugge claimed Frederick V as crown prince was included in the Copenhagen Masonic Lodge St. Martin. This was probably June 1744, and inspired by the Prussian king Frederick the Great who was also included in a masonic lodge in his youth. They both had fathers who were violently opposed to the Masons, but unlike the Prussian king, Frederick V never published his membership of the lodge.

==Reign==
===Accession===

On 6 August 1746—the day before his parents&#x27; silver marriage festivities—his father died at the age of 46 at Hirschholm Palace, the royal family&#x27;s summer retreat north of Copenhagen. At the death of his father, Frederick immediately ascended the thrones of Denmark and Norway as their fifth absolute monarch at the age of just 23. The new king and queen then moved the short distance from the Prince&#x27;s Mansion across the Frederiksholm&#x27;s Canal into the large Christiansborg Palace. On 4 September the following year, they were anointed in Frederiksborg Palace&#x27;s Chapel, the traditional place of coronation of Denmark-Norway&#x27;s monarchs during the days of the absolute monarchy, on the island of Sealand north of Copenhagen.
Frederick V&#x27;s accession to the throne brought about a great change in life at the Danish court, which now became far more festive and acquired a more easy-going tone than under his strictly religious parents. What Frederick and Louise on a small scale had begun at Charlottenborg and the Prince&#x27;s Mansion, they now continued at a large scale at Christiansborg. As secluded as his parents had kept themselves from the people, just as strongly Frederick V seemed to want to meet the people, and it has been told how he and the queen enjoyed socializing with the citizens of Copenhagen and visiting the peasants in their farms. Almost as a sign of the new times, the heavy iron chains that had previously surrounded Christiansborg to keep the people at distance disappeared, court life regained its luster, and the palace&#x27;s halls and salons once again became the setting for balls and social gatherings. Also commoners were now invited to court events, including the Dano-Norwegian writer Ludvig Holberg, who has described vividly how comfortable he feels at the court of Frederick V.

===Rule===

The personal influence of Frederick was limited, making him one of absolute rulers who least made for the state&#x27;s strength. When he became king, his alcoholism had developed in such a way that he was hardly able to lead a government alone and was completely dependant on his advisers. Just after his accession he appointed A. G. Moltke, whom he had as a favourite, as his Lord Chamberlain — an office that had previously been a mere court post. Now it became an outstanding position that gave Moltke opportunity as the king&#x27;s confidential friend to be around him from morning till night, with the king talking to him about whatever was on his mind, which enabled Moltke to make his influence felt in all areas where he pleased. One of his main tasks was to take care that his dissolute Majesty didn&#x27;t damage the Royal household&#x27;s reputation with his constant orgies. Frederick&#x27;s main interest was primarily the arts of war that rivalled the anti-military attitudes that characterized his counsellors; he enjoyed hunting and stayed often at the Jægersborg Dyrehave estates.

Although the king, as regent, took part in the conduct of government by attending council meetings, he was afflicted by alcoholism and most of his rule was dominated by very able ministers such as A. G. Moltke J. H. E. Bernstorff and H. C. Schimmelmann. These men marked his reign by the progress of commerce and the emerging industry of gunpowder plant and cannon foundry in Frederiksværk, built by Johan Frederik Classen. They also avoided involving Denmark-Norway in the European wars of his time. The country remained neutral even for the duration of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), despite its proximity to combatants Russia and Sweden, an act which undoubtedly shaped the perception of the period as a happy time.

In the same period the Royal Frederiks Hospital and the Royal Orphanage (Det kgl. Opfostringshus) was created, a school intended for poor boys that still exists today, opened in Christianshavn on 1 October 1753. On 29 June 1753 Frederick V created Denmark&#x27;s first lottery, called the Royal Copenhagen Lottery—a lottery that exists to this day as &quot;Klasselotteriet&quot;.

Art and science prospered under his reign, and although he wasn&#x27;t personally interested in cultural affairs, the public entertainment, performing arts, and freedom of expression that had been banned under the pietistic hypocrisy (characterized during his father&#x27;s reign) was again permitted. This change was influenced by his first wife, who encouraged performances by actors and musicians. In 1748, the Royal Danish Theatre (&quot;Det Kongelige Teater&quot;) opened in Nicolai Eigtved&#x27;s new Komediehus (Playhouse) on Kongens Nytorv. And in 1754, the Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi&quot;) in Copenhagen was also founded under his name and officially inaugurated on 31 March 1754, his 31st birthday. Frederick purchased what would become known as the Danish West Indies from the Danish West India Company in 1754. As an active Freemason, he set up on 24 June 1749 the first Masonic lodge in Norway.

=== Second marriage ===

Queen Louise died suddenly on 19 December 1751 at Christiansborg Palace, predeceasing her husband by fourteen years and causing great impact on the royal family and the court&#x27;s life, where she was adored. She was buried with great pomp at Roskilde Cathedral. At the time of her death, she was pregnant with her sixth child, who also died.

The government thought it best for the king to remarry as soon as possible, in an attempt to stabilize his behavior. The king himself was initially unwilling to remarry a foreign princess, unless it was with an English princess, none of whom were available at the time. Reportedly, the king had a wish to marry Moltke&#x27;s own daughter, maid-of-honor Catharine Sophie Wilhelmine von Moltke, a match Adam Gottlob did not wish and prevented by quickly having her married to Count Hannibal Wedell of Wedellsborg. Moltke then drew the king&#x27;s attention to Duchess Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, daughter of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and sister-in-law to Frederick the Great of Prussia. After having made some additional investigations and met with satisfying answers, the king expressed himself willing to marry her, and the wedding took place at the chapel of Frederiksborg Castle on 8 July 1752. The marriage was frowned upon by the people who saw it as too early for the King to remarry. Neither did the formal princess appeal to his own taste, and with the court she was never popular—with no other identifiable cause than her sense of rigid etiquette, practised in German princely courts, that may have seemed less friendly than the English Louise. During his second marriage, the king had a relationship with Charlotte Amalie Winge.

Their only child, Hereditary Prince Frederick, was born in 1753. He was, in his turn, father of King Christian VIII of Denmark and grandfather of Louise of Hesse, the future queen of Denmark. Juliane Marie died in 1796, having been regent for her son Prince Frederick.

== Death and burial ==

Over the years, the king&#x27;s heavy drinking and indulgent lifestyle had taken their toll on his health, especially since his constitution was not too robust to begin with. The king became increasingly melancholic, and neglected himself and the affairs of state. In the last years, his drinking increased even more, and he was rarely sober. Twice he broke his leg in drunken accidents, with subsequent long convalescences which greatly weakened him. According to Dorothea Biehl&#x27;s statements the king was often seen in a condition &quot;where his arm was not strong enough to bring his hat on his head again without Moltke&#x27;s help.&quot; In the end he was completely broken down as a result of drinking and debauchery. On at Christiansborg Palace, the king died of edema at the age of forty-two, after a twenty-year reign. He had been a pleasant change compared to the pious Christian VI&#x27;s autocracy, and when Frederick died there were many who mourned. His last words were reportedly: &quot;It is a great consolation to me in my last hour that I have never wilfully offended anyone, and that there is not a drop of blood on my hands.&quot;

After lying in state with great pomp at the chapel at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, he was interred next to Queen Louise in Roskilde Cathedral on the island of Zealand, the traditional burial site for Danish monarchs since the 15th century. His monument in Roskilde cathedral was completed in 1769, and designed by the Danish sculptor Johannes Wiedewelt. It includes a large sarcophagus resting on footpieces and decorated by numerous sculptures, behind which is a column topped of an urn, a medallion with the king&#x27;s portrait, and on each side of the sarcophagus, sitting approx. 9&#x27; high above the floor, are two crowned, grieving female figures representing Denmark and Norway. The memorial chapel in which it is placed was created as a collaboration between Wiedewelt and the Danish architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff.

=== Monuments ===

On 1 August 1771, five years after the king&#x27;s death, an equestrian statue of Frederick V dressed in the garb of a Roman emperor by the French sculptor Jacques François Joseph Saly was unveiled in Amalienborg Square in Copenhagen.

=== Places named after Frederick V ===

* The city of Paamiut in Greenland was formerly known as Frederikshaab 
* The former naval base Fredriksvern in Norway

===Succession crisis===
Within one hundred years of his time, Denmark faced the crisis of his male issue (the main branch of the Royal House) becoming extinct. This created a succession crisis beginning from his grandson&#x27;s reign that affected both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein. Finally, his great-grandson through the female line, Christian IX of Denmark, who was married to his great-granddaughter Louise of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), became the designated heir.

===2021 bust controversy===
In February 2021, Frederick V came suddenly to the focus of a historical-political controversy when a group of radical artists removed a bust of the King and sunk it in Copenhagen Harbor, in protest of Denmark&#x27;s role in the Atlantic slave trade during his reign.

== Cultural depictions ==
===Literature===

Frederick V appears in the early part of &quot;The Visit of the Royal Physician&quot; (), a 1999 historical novel by Per Olov Enquist, which mainly deals with his son Christian VII. As depicted in the book, Frederick&#x27;s contemptuous and overbearing attitude to his son had a significant part in causing the mental instability which characterized Christian&#x27;s life and reign.

<doc id="196677" wikidata="Q747460" url="?curid=196677" title="Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud">
<text>Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud (; 31 May 1753 – 31 October 1793) was a French lawyer and statesman, a figure of the French Revolution. A deputy to the Assembly from Bordeaux, Vergniaud was an eloquent orator. He was a supporter of Jacques Pierre Brissot and the Girondist faction.

==Early life and education==
Vergniaud was born in the city of Limoges in the province of Limousin, to the elder Pierre Vergniaud and his wife Catherine Baubiat. The Vergniauds had both come from well-to-do merchant families with a long history in the province, and the family enjoyed a comfortable prosperity. At the time of Vergniaud&#x27;s birth, his father was a contractor and purveyor for the king, supplying food for the royal garrison in the city.

The younger Vergniaud was first tutored at home by a Jesuit scholar, Abbé Roby, a master of ancient languages: it is likely that Vergniaud&#x27;s lifelong love of the classics was inspired by him. The boy was sent to the Jesuit college at Limoges where he excelled. The future French statesman Turgot was at that time the intendant of the province, and knew the elder Vergniaud well. On one occasion, young Pierre recited some of his own poetry in the presence of Turgot, who was greatly impressed by his talent. Through Turgot&#x27;s patronage, Vergniaud was admitted to the Collège du Plessis in Paris. Little is known of Vergniaud&#x27;s personal life during his time at Du Plessis, but his education there was clearly a major formative experience: his deep, personal absorption of classical history and philosophy is evident throughout his later life.

After his studies were complete, Vergniaud went unsure of his direction in life. He drifted lazily through several years, dabbling in fiction and theater, and losing his short career as a clerk in the provincial revenue office. Much to his father&#x27;s dismay, his chief preoccupation became frequenting salons and engaging in conversation, but in these pursuits Vergniaud excelled magnificently: important new friendships and associations grew richly for him in the salons. He was particularly favored by the Countess de Maleyssie, who let the frequently destitute Vergniaud live freely in her estate, and Charles Dupaty, President of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Bordeaux, who urged him to study law.

==Attorney-at-law==
Vergniaud&#x27;s sister Marie had married a wealthy porcelain maker from Limoges named A.M. Alluaud, and it was this brother-in-law who gave fortifying encouragement and critical financial support to the aspiring law student. With his help, and the powerful guidance of Dupaty, Vergniaud was accepted by the bar and went straight into practice in April 1782. He did not take long to make his mark in the field. His first few cases were successful enough, but before the end of his first year in practice he was handed the case of Marie Bérigaud, a local woman accused of promiscuity and a consequent infanticide. This sordid and sensational affair held the city in thrall and Vergniaud was given the difficult assignment of proving her innocence. At the trial&#x27;s end, the young woman was absolved of all charges, and her false accuser was imprisoned instead. With this shockingly complete victory, Vergniaud was widely recognized as a rising star.

===Durieux Affair===
Years of successful advocacy followed, and Vergniaud&#x27;s eloquence was frequently met with loud bursts of applause in the courtroom. In 1790 he took on the defense of Pierre Durieux, a National Guardsman of Brive who had been imprisoned and sentenced to death for having incited a riot. The Durieux affair arose from the boisterous celebrations of revolutionary peasants in the small village near Brive called Allassac. Incensed members of the local aristocracy had attempted to quell the indecorum by firing shots in the air; met with rocks and stones, they turned their guns on the crowd and killed several peasants. When Durieux&#x27;s unit arrived to restore order, the soldier found himself repelled by his duty, and according to the charges he urged the rioters to fight back. Durieux was not alone: many Guardsmen were arrested and two were swiftly condemned to death. While Durieux languished in jail awaiting his turn, the news spread and sparked the furious interest of revolutionaries all around the nation. Vergniaud had already been greatly moved by revolutionary rhetoric, and was an enthusiastic supporter of the reforms which had caused the initial celebrations at Allassac. As Durieux&#x27;s lawyer, Vergniaud entered his first truly political case.

The trial began in February 1791 before a packed courtroom. Vergniaud&#x27;s case was built on the fact that his client had not actually committed any offense: could he be hanged, Vergniaud asked, just for something he said in a moment of righteous anger? He reminded the court of similarly imprudent remarks that had recently been made in the National Assembly itself: &quot;One of its members... speaking of those to whom the people owe their liberty [said], &#x27;One must fall upon these people saber in hand.&#x27; Have you asked for a scaffold to be raised for him?&quot; With rising drama, he repeated the question four times to the hushed courtroom. In a long and incandescent speech, he widened his defense of Durieux to include the whole of the peasant crowd: &quot;They trod in indignation the soil which they so long had watered with their sweat and tears. Their eyes turned with the somber disquiet of resentment to the superb château where they had so often gone to lower themselves by shameful homage, and from which, more than once, the caprices of pride... had spread like devastating torrents.&quot; Vergniaud&#x27;s oration put the entire Revolution on trial, and, like Durieux, it was exonerated completely. Revolutionaries printed copies of his defense and circulated them throughout France. Vergniaud had delivered one of the great speeches of his life, and now the provincial lawyer would be coaxed from all quarters to join the revolution at the national level.

==In the Legislative Assembly==
In 1789 Vergniaud had been elected a member of the general council of the &quot;département&quot; of the Gironde. After the Durieux affair, he was chosen to be a representative to the Legislative Assembly and he proceeded to Paris in August 1791. The Assembly met on 1 October, and for a time Vergniaud refrained from speaking publicly. Soon after his first speech on October 25, however, he was elected president of the Assembly, for the usual brief term. Between the outbreak of the Revolution and his election to the Legislative Assembly, Vergniaud&#x27;s political views had undergone a decided change. At first he had supported the idea of a constitutional monarchy, but the flight of King Louis XVI made him distrust the sovereign, and he began to favour a republic.

The sentiments and passions that his eloquence aroused were made use of by a more extreme party. Even his first Assembly speech, on the &quot;émigrés&quot;, proposing for a treble annual contribution be levied on their property, resulted in a measure passed by the Assembly, but vetoed by the king, mandating the death sentence and confiscation of their goods. Step by step, he was led on to tolerate violence and crime, the excesses of which he realised only by the September Massacres, which ultimately overwhelmed the party of Girondists that he led.

On 19 March 1792, when the perpetrators of the massacre of Avignon had been introduced to the Assembly by Collot d&#x27;Herbois, Vergniaud spoke indulgently of their crimes and lent the authority of his voice to their amnesty.

He worked at the theme of the &quot;émigrés&quot;, as it developed into that of the counter-revolution, and in his occasional appearances in the tribune as well as in the project of an address to the French people, which he presented to the Assembly on 27 December 1791, he stirred the heart of France, especially by his call to arms on 18 January, shaped the policy, which culminated in the declaration of war against the king of Bohemia and Hungary on 20 April.

The policy in foreign affairs, which he pursued through the winter and spring of 1791–92, he combined with arousing the suspicions of the people against the monarchy, which he identified with the counter-revolution, and of forcing a change of ministry. On 10 March, Vergniaud delivered a powerful oration in which he denounced the intrigues of the court and uttered his famous apostrophe to the Tuileries: &quot;In ancient times fear and terror have often issued from that famous palace; let them re-enter it to-day in the name of the law!&quot;

The speech overthrew Claude Antoine Valdec de Lessart, whose accusation was decreed, and Jean Marie Roland, the nominee of the Girondists, entered the ministry. By June the opposition of Vergniaud (whose voice still commanded the country) to the king rose to fever pitch. On 29 May Vergniaud went so far as to support the disbanding of the king&#x27;s guard, yet he appears to have been unaware of the extent of the feelings of animosity which he had aroused in the people, probably because he was wholly unconnected with the practices of the party of the Mountain as the instigators of the violence. The party used Vergniaud, whose lofty and serene ideas they travestied in action. Then came the riot of 20 June and the invasion of the Tuileries.

He was powerless to quell the riot. Continuing for yet a little longer his course of almost frenzied opposition to the throne, on 3 July he boldly denounced the king as a hypocrite, a despot and a base traitor to the constitution. His speeches were perhaps the greatest single factor in the development of the events of the time.

On 10 August, the Tuileries was stormed, and the royal family took refuge in the Assembly. Vergniaud presided, replying to the request of the king for protection in dignified and respectful language. An extraordinary commission was appointed: Vergniaud wrote and read its recommendations for National Convention to be formed, the king be provisionally suspended from office, a governor appointed for his son, and the royal family be consigned to the Palais Luxembourg. Hardly had the great orator attained the object of his aim, the overthrow of Louis as a sovereign, when he became conscious of the forces by which he was surrounded. He denounced the massacres of September, their inception, their horror and the future to which they pointed, in language so vivid and powerful that it raised for a time the spirits of the Girondists, but on the other hand, it aroused the fatal opposition of the Parisian leaders.

The question of whether Louis XVI should be judged and, if so, by whom was the subject of protracted debate. The Girondist leader at last, on 31 December 1792, broke silence, delivering one of his greatest speeches. He pronounced in favour of an appeal to the people. The great effort failed, and four days afterwards, Vergniaud and his whole party were further damaged by the discovery of a note signed by him along with Gaudet and Armand Gensonné and presented to the king two or three weeks before 10 August. It was greedily seized on by the enemies of the Girondists as evidence of treason.

On 16 January 1793 a vote was taken in the Convention upon the punishment of the king. Vergniaud voted early and for death. The action of the great Girondist was followed by a similar verdict from nearly the whole party which he led. On the 17th, Vergniaud presided at the Convention, and it fell to him, labouring under the most painful excitement, to announce the fatal result of the voting. Then, for many weeks he remained silent. He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project.

==Proscription of the Girondists==
When the institution of a revolutionary tribunal was proposed, Vergniaud opposed the project, denouncing the tribunal as a more awful inquisition than that of Spain, and avowing that his party would all die rather than consent to it. Their death by stratagem had already been planned, and on 10 March they had to go into hiding. On the 13th Vergniaud boldly exposed the conspiracy in the Convention. The antagonism caused by such an attitude had reached a significant point when on 10 April Robespierre himself laid his accusation before the Convention. He fastened on Vergniaud&#x27;s letter to the king and his support of the appeal to the people as proof that he was a moderate in its then despised sense. Vergniaud made a brilliant extemporaneous reply, and the attack for the moment failed. But now, night after night, Vergniaud and his colleagues found themselves obliged to change their abode, to avoid assassination, a price being even put upon their heads. Still with unfaltering courage they continued their resistance to the dominant faction, till things came to a head on 2 June 1793. The Convention was surrounded with an armed mob, who clamoured for the &quot;twenty-two.&quot; In the midst of this it was forced to continue its deliberations. The decree of accusation was voted, and the Girondists were proscribed. Vergniaud is noted for his last gesture of defiance in standing up among the subdued deputies and offering them a glass of blood to slake their thirst, a metaphor for their betrayal of the Girondins.

Vergniaud took refuge for a day, then returned to his own home. He was kept under surveillance there for nearly a month, and in the early days of July was imprisoned in La Force Prison. He carried poison with him, but never used it. His tender affection for his relatives abundantly appears from his correspondence, along with his profound attachment to the great ideas of the Revolution and his noble love of country. On one of the walls of the Carmelite convent to which for a short time the prisoners were removed Vergniaud wrote in letters of blood: &quot;Potius mori quam foedari&quot;—Death before dishonor. Early in October the Convention brought forward its indictment of the twenty-two Girondists. They were sent for trial to the Revolutionary tribunal, before which they appeared on 27 October. The procedure has been referred to as a travesty of justice. Vergniaud&#x27;s moving oratory and persuasive lawyering upset the court&#x27;s plans for a quick trial, but the predetermined verdicts were handed down anyway. Early on the morning of 31 October 1793 the Girondists were conveyed to the scaffold, singing on the way the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; and keeping up the strain till one by one they were guillotined. Vergniaud was executed last and buried in the Madeleine Cemetery.

<text>Armand Gensonné (, 10 August 175831 October 1793) was a French politician.

The son of a military surgeon, he was born in Bordeaux, Gascony, and studied Law before the outbreak of the French Revolution, becoming lawyer of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Bordeaux. In 1790 he became &quot;procureur&quot; of the Bordeaux Commune, and in July 1791 was elected by the newly created &quot;département&quot; of the Gironde a member of the court of appeal.
In the same year he was elected deputy for the &quot;département&quot; to the Legislative Assembly. As &quot;rapporteur&quot; of the diplomatic committee, in which he supported the policy of Jacques Pierre Brissot, he proposed two of the most revolutionary measures passed by the Assembly: the decree of accusation against the King Louis XVI&#x27;s brothers (the Comte de Provence and the Comte d&#x27;Artois) on 1 January 1792, and the declaration of war against the Habsburg ruler Francis II (20 April 1792).

He denounced of the intrigues of the court and of the &quot;Comité autrichien&quot; (&quot;Austrian committee&quot;, the purported royalist group supporting the Austrians with whom the country was at war), but the violence of the extreme republicans, culminating in the riots of 10 August, alarmed him.

Elected to the National Convention, where he was regarded as one of the most brilliant of the group of orators from the Gironde (although he always read his speeches), Gensonné denounced, on 24 October, the actions of the Paris Commune following the September Massacres. At the king&#x27;s trial in late December, he supported an appeal to the people, but voted for the death sentence. He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project.

As a member of the Committee of General Defence, and as president of the convention (7 March–21 March 1793), he shared in the harsh attacks of the Girondists on The Mountain. On 2 June, after François Hanriot&#x27;s anti-Girondist intervention, he was among the first of those inscribed on the prosecution list. Gensonné was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 24 October 1793, sentenced to death and guillotined.

<doc id="196680" wikidata="Q711992" url="?curid=196680" title="Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk">
<text>Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, (22 March 136622 September 1399) was an English peer. His family was a venerable one, and by the time Thomas reached adulthood, they were extremely influential in national politics. He claimed a direct bloodline from King Edward I. His father died when Thomas and his elder brother were young. John soon died, and Thomas inherited the Earldom of Nottingham. He had probably been friends with the king, Richard II, since he was young, and as a result, he was a royal favourite, a role he greatly profited from. He accompanied Richard on his travels around the kingdom and was elected to the Order of the Garter. Richard&#x27;s lavish dispersal of his patronage made him unpopular with parliament and other members of the English nobility, and Mowbray fell out badly with the king&#x27;s uncle, John of Gaunt.

Mowbray journeyed into Scotland with the king when he invaded in 1385, although it is possible that their friendship was waning at this point. Richard had a new favourite, Robert de Vere; Mowbray, meanwhile, became increasingly close to Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. Mowbray married Elizabeth who was the daughter of Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. The king already distrusted Arundel and Mowbray&#x27;s new circle included the equally estranged Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester. Together they plotted against the king&#x27;s chancellor, the Earl of Suffolk, appealling him in parliament. Suffolk was impeached, and a council was appointed to oversee the king. Mowbray gradually became disillusioned with his comrades, perhaps because of the brutal revenges they took and by 1389, he was back in the king&#x27;s favour. Mowbray entered into jousts, led embassies and joined Richard on his 1395 invasion of Ireland, negotiating successfully with the Irish Kings. By now, the king felt sufficiently restored to power to attack his enemies, which seems to have culminated in Mowbray&#x27;s killing of Gloucester in Calais in 1397 on Richard&#x27;s orders. Probably in a , Mowbray was made Duke of Norfolk soon after.

In the meantime, Mowbray had fallen out with John of Gaunt&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Bolingbroke, and they arranged a trial by combat. No sooner had this begun than the king cancelled it in person. He exiled them both: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for ten years. Mowbray took a vow of pilgrimage, intending to travel to Jerusalem. He reached Venice, but in September 1399, he died before leaving it. By his wife Elizabeth, he left two sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Thomas, inherited his father&#x27;s earldom of Norfolk, rebelled against the king in 1405 and was beheaded for treason. Mowbray&#x27;s second son, also John, inherited the dukedom and served the crown faithfully.

== Background and youth ==
The Mowbrays were an old baronial family, having been first ennobled in 1295. By the 14th century, advantageous marriages, service to the crown and its rewards gave them great political standing. Thomas Mowbray was the son of John, Lord Mowbray and his wife Elizabeth Segrave, the daughter and heiress of John, Lord Segrave by his wife Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk. Margaret in turn was daughter and heiress of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, the fifth son of King Edward I.

Thomas Mowbray was born in 1366; the precise date is unknown. He was probably named after the cult of St Thomas Becket, which his mother followed. Thomas&#x27;s elder brother John was their father&#x27;s heir. Lord Mowbray died in 1368. Four years later, the brothers became the ward of their great-aunt, Blanche of Lancaster. John—a &quot;special friend&quot; to the king, suggest Enoch Powell and Keith Wallis— was created Earl of Nottingham on the coronation of King Richard II in 1377 but died in early 1383. Almost immediately—within a few days—the earldom was re-granted to Thomas, and even though he was still legally a minor, he was allowed seisin of his patrimony.

As a second son, little was recorded of Mowbray&#x27;s youth, although his background and status ensured him a position at court. The King and Mowbray had probably been childhood friends and he was a royal favourite from around 1382. That year he was granted hunting rights in certain royal forests and was knighted. It was around this time that John of Gaunt&#x27;s son Henry Bolingbroke began falling out of favour with the King. Mowbray supplanted him in the king&#x27;s favour. In 1383, he married ten-year-old Lady Elizabeth Lestrange, heiress of John, Lord Blakemere, although she died not long after the wedding.

==Political background==
Richard II was only ten when he succeeded his grandfather&#x27;s, Edward III&#x27;s, throne in 1377. Although the appearance was maintained that he personally reigned, a continual council was organised to manage government business for him. This government, originally popular, faced increasing criticism following the suppression of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381. King Richard was reproved for his patronage of a few select royal favourites, to an extent that has been described as &quot;lavish to the point of foolishness&quot; by a biographer, historian Anthony Tuck. Parliament also believed that the King should rule as economically as possible, and they observed with displeasure the King&#x27;s distribution of extravagant wealth to a limited circle. The greatest recipient was Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk. Abroad, the Hundred Years&#x27; War was going poorly for England. Several expeditions had left for France in the early years of the reign to defend English French territory, but they were almost all military and political failures.

==Career to 1390==
Mowbray remained high in royal favour following the death of his wife, and he was elected to the Order of the Garter in October 1383, despite his military inexperience. The King granted him grace and favour rooms at the royal palaces of Eltham and Kings Langley. As an important courtier, Mowbray accompanied Richard on his tour of East Anglia in 1383. His closeness to the King drew the opprobrium of his uncle, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster—the most powerful man in the Kingdom after the King. Gaunt accused Mowbray, along with Robert, Earl of Oxford and William, Earl of Salisbury of plotting against Richard. Gaunt had fallen out of favour with his nephew and had withdrawn from the council. In retaliation for his accusations, says the chronicler Thomas Walsingham, Mowbray, de Vere and Montacute plotted to kill the duke in February 1385. The King held jousts between 13 and 14 February and Gaunt&#x27;s murder was to be committed on the 14th; it is possible that Richard did not disapprove, such had relations between him and his uncle broken down over military policy. Gaunt told Richard that he viewed the King&#x27;s advisors as &quot;unsavoury&quot;; Mowbray and his colleagues lodged a series of further accusations against the duke. Gaunt received a warning of the attack at the joust and fled on the night of 14 February.


On 30 June 1385—as the royal army was about to leave for Scotland—Mowbray received his great-grandfather&#x27;s office of Marshal of England. He led a force of 99 men-at-arms and 150 archers, serving with Gaunt in the vanguard. Mowbray helped draw up the King&#x27;s ordinances for the campaign at Durham, although by now, suggests Given-Wilson, Mowbray&#x27;s relations with Richard were cooling.

Less than a year after his first wife&#x27;s death, Mowbray married Elizabeth Fitzalan. Elizabeth was a daughter of Richard, Earl of Arundel, and, although the King attended their wedding and the week-long festivities accompanying it, it is unlikely that the marriage was popular with Richard. His second marriage must have been a turning point. Richard doubtless saw Arundel as a negative influence on Mowbray and feared the strengthening of the earl&#x27;s position against him. Mowbray and Elizabeth had also wed without his permission, so the King distrained Mowbray&#x27;s estates until he had received the value of the license. Tuck argues that &quot;nor was the king&#x27;s concern unfounded&quot;; Mowbray had been increasingly isolated at court by the King&#x27;s latest favourites, such as Oxford, and had moved into the circle of those who opposed the new royal intimates, perhaps seeing them as the best way to dispose of his rival. This circle also included not only Richard&#x27;s father-in-law but his uncle, Thomas, Duke of Gloucester. In a sign that Mowbray was not completely out of favour, Elizabeth received her robes as a Lady of the Garter in 1386.

Both men had played an important role in parliament&#x27;s attack on Richard&#x27;s chancellor, Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk at the Wonderful Parliament of 1386. The Wonderful Parliament had taken place against a backdrop of genuine fear of a French invasion—Walsingham described how Londoners, in his view, like &quot;timid mice they scurried hither and thither—and Arundel had been appointed Admiral of England. In March the following year he, in turn, appointed Mowbray his deputy, and they took a fleet out of Margate and encountered a French-Flemish fleet almost immediately. The result was its crushing defeat. Between 50 and 100 French-Flemish ships were captured or destroyed. The King was unimpressed. When Arundel and Mowbray returned to court, Richard claimed they had only defeated merchants, and Oxford turned his back on the earls. It was, however, an extremely popular victory with the people.

=== Appellant ===

For most of the 1380s, Mowbray received what he doubtless considered his due from the King in lands, offices and grants. But by 1387, he became increasingly estranged from Richard&#x27;s court. The main reason for this was probably jealousy of de Vere. While he was wealthy enough not to rely on royal favour, as de Vere did, he expected the honour and dignity that his birth and status demanded. This he saw increasingly syphoned off to his rival. Although the Wonderful Parliament had set up a commission to effectively restrain the King, it turned out to be ineffective. Richard emasculated the commission by leaving London immediately, ignoring its deliberations, and holding his own councils in the provinces. He also took legal advice from his judges who, unsurprisingly, found in his favour that those responsible for parliament&#x27;s treatment of the King should be deemed traitors. In response, Mowbray joined Bolingbroke, Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick in appealing several of the King&#x27;s friends, including Oxford, of treason, and raised an army at Hornsey, north of London. The Appellants&#x27; army engaged Oxford&#x27;s at the Battle of Radcot Bridge, inflicting a crushing defeat on the royalists in December. Mowbray did not take part, as he was guarding the road back to the West Midlands at Moreton in Marsh, although he may have sent a portion of his retinue to the Appellant army.

Mowbray appears responsible for dissuading Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick from marching to London and deposing the King. Indeed, he and Bolingbroke may have been a moderating influence on the others. Conversely, due to his position as Earl Marshal—one of the two heads of the Court of Chivalry—his presence with the Appellants enabled them to frame their offensive juridically rather than as a traditional noble rebellion. Mowbray was amongst the Appellants that attended Richard in the Tower of London—with arms linked— on 30 December 1387 and accused the King of treachery towards them. They also demanded Richard order the arrest of the appellees; Walsingham reports that he only agreed to do so on being threatened, once again, with deposition. The King attempted to divide Mowbray from his colleagues, asking him to stay behind when the others were ready to leave. With the King now under their control, Mowbray and the Appellants called parliament for early 1388. This session became known as the Merciless Parliament on account of the vengeance it laid on the King&#x27;s closest supporters, with Mowbray overseeing the executions with &quot;the aid and authority of the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of London&quot;. Mowbray was to take the condemned to the Tower and &quot;&#x27;from there drag him through the city of London as far as the gallows at Tyburn, and there hang him by the neck&quot;.

===&quot;Rapprochment&quot; with the King===

For his part, there are signs that Mowbray was becoming dissatisfied with his comrades through the course of the parliament, which Tuck suggests was because Mowbray was &quot;never as committed to the destruction of the court faction as Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick&quot;. Given-Wilson suggests that the inclusion of Mowbray by the Appellants broadened their base among the nobility (from his having had less acrimonious relations with the King), but also weakened them as a body by diluting their grievances. As indicated by Mowbray&#x27;s dispute with Warwick over the Gower lordship, they were already &quot;shot through with personal and political differences&quot; as it was. Tuck suggests that, while Mowbray seems able to have stomached the convictions of the others, &quot;the real rift occurred over the question of Sir Simon Burley&#x27;s fate&quot;. Gloucester and Warwick accused him of exercising undue influence over Richard; Burley, the under-chamberlain, had been tutor to the King, who wanted to save him. Mowbray and Bolingbroke agreed, but to no avail, and in May 1388 Burley was hanged at Tyburn.

Mowbray was loyal to the King and court. Early indications of Mowbray&#x27;s return to favour came in early 1389 when he had his estates restored to him and was pardoned for having married without the King&#x27;s licence. In March, he was appointed warden of the East March and castellan of Berwick Castle, receiving wages of £6,000 in peacetime and twice that in time of war. His appointment was not a success; he alienated the traditional lord of the north, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who retired to court. Mowbray held no lands in the north and had few contacts among the gentry, upon whom he needed to rely to raise his army. Mowbray&#x27;s tenure in the East March was effectively disabled from the start; Mowbray&#x27;s ineffectiveness to highlighted in June that year, when a Scottish incursion ravaged the north of England and, facing little opposition, went as far south as Tynemouth. Mowbray, the &quot;Westminster Chronicle&quot; reports, refused the Scottish offer of a pitched battle and retreated to Berwick Castle.

The King regained sole control of government around in May 1389, and Mowbray attended a royal council meeting in Clarendon Palace that September, demonstrating the gulf that existed by then between him and his ex-comrades. At another meeting the following month, the King attempted to increase Mowbray&#x27;s remuneration in March. The council, headed by William of Wykeham as chancellor, refused—&quot;in the name and by the will of all the other lords of the council&quot;—and Richard was forced to acquiesce, albeit , or &quot;with an angry expression&quot;. Henry Percy had been recompensed for the loss of the wardenship with the captaincy of Calais; in 1391, he and Mowbray exchanged offices, returning Percy to the March and sending Mowbray to France.

===Martial service===
As a result of Mowbray&#x27;s return to the court party, his undertaking of royal service for the King increased. He jousted before Richard&#x27;s chamberlain at St Inglevert, near Boulogne, in April 1390, where he proved himself a champion against the French, who the well-regarded knight led, Jean de Boucicaut. Mowbray led a group of up to 60 English knights and esquires. The following month another joust was held at Smithfield, outside London. Mowbray&#x27;s presence in the King&#x27;s party was a part of Richard&#x27;s policy of reconciling the appellants to his personal rule and, by extension, furthering his own power. Here, before the King, Mowbray defeated John Dunbar, Earl of Moray—who later died, says one chronicler, of his wounds—after six jousts with an unrebated lance. Froissart wrote how, at Smithfield &quot;everyone exerted himself to the utmost to excel: many were unhorsed and more lost their helmets&quot;.

Mowbray joined the King on his campaign to Ireland in 1394. Richard&#x27;s strategy was to plant his nobility across the country in direct confrontation with Gaelic kings to force them into submission. Mowbray occupied Carlow, of which he was granted the lordship. Mowbray led several raids against the King of Leinster, Art Macmurrough, and a royal letter to the council reported how he &quot;had several fine encounters with the Irish&quot;. Mowbray burned nine villages, killing many, and captured around 8,000 head of cattle. On one occasion, he nearly captured MacMurrough &quot;and his wife in their beds&quot;. MacMurrough&#x27;s escape left Mowbray &quot;sorely vexed&quot;, and in revenge he had the house razed, as well as 14 surrounding villages. He then marched through the Blackstairs Mountains &quot;which was all bog...no Englishman has commonly entered before&quot;. A number of enemies were captured. Their leader was executed, and his head sent to Richard.

Mowbray eventually secured MacMurrough&#x27;s indenture of submission to Richard. During these negotiations, Mowbray possessed full powers, and persuaded Macmurrough to evacuate Leinster for the English. His sub-chieftains followed. In the event neither macMurrough nor his armies left Leinster, and Mowbray was in no position to force them. His attempts to install English lordship in the province came to nothing; he returned to England in May 1395.

==Royal service to 1398==
On his return, Mowbray almost immediately became involved, with his comrades-in-arms from the Irish campaign Lord Scrope and the Earl of Rutland, in the negotiations over Richard&#x27;s proposed marriage to Isabella, daughter of the French King, Charles VI. Mowbray made many trips to France, finally concluding negotiations in March 1396. The betrothal was made official in September, and Mowbray escorted the French King to Calais. Richard also deputised Mowbray to conduct secret negotiations with Philip, Duke of Burgundy and John, Duke of Berry. Given-Wilson suggests that the King &quot;had considerable faith in Mowbray&#x27;s diplomatic ability&quot; since in May the next year, Mowbray represented England at the Imperial Diet in Frankfurt. This had been called to end the latest Papal Schism by forcing the resignation of the two partisan popes. Richard&#x27;s faith in Mowbray is reflected in the numerous grants the earl received in this period. Tuck suggests that Mowbray could afford to spend an estimated 40% of his total income just on wages to retainers, suggesting his affinity was substantial enough to match that of most earls.

In 1397, at Warwick&#x27;s expense, Mowbray received the lordship of Gower, which their two families had been quarrelling for possession of for most of the preceding century. Saul suggests that Mowbray relied on his friendship with the King to retrieve the grant, which had been in Beauchamp&#x27;s hands since 1354. This was &quot;doubly disastrous&quot; for Warwick, comments Saul; not only was it the richest lordship he possessed—thus having a major impact on his income—but he was ordered to repay Mowbray the profits he had earned since 1361, amounting to around £5333 per annum. The atmosphere at court was tense. Richard may have felt threatened, suspecting that the Appellants would launch another attack; this may have persuaded him to get in first. In early July, the King settled all family accounts with the Appellants. He invited Arundel, Gloucester and Warwick to a feast—of Herodian infamy, reported Walsingham—at which they would be arrested. Only Warwick attended. Arundel and Gloucester were apprehended later. They were tried individually and convicted of treason in September. Warwick forfeit his titles and estates and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Arundel was beheaded; Mowbray, as Earl marshal, oversaw the sentence of his erstwhile comrade. Gloucester was exiled to Calais. It was probably Mowbray&#x27;s attempts to save Simon Burley&#x27;s life years before that saved Mowbray&#x27;s in 1397.

===Murder of Gloucester and elevation===
 Gloucester had been covertly arrested on the night of 10–11 July 1397, and &quot;bundled out of England to Calais&quot;. It was popularly speculated that the King personally ordered Gloucester&#x27;s assassination, and it was later alleged—in the 1399 parliament—that Mowbray was likely instrumental, in his role of Captain of Calais. Rumours of Gloucester&#x27;s death had been circulating since August, and Given-Wilson speculates that this may be a sign that Richard had ordered Mowbray to kill the duke then, but that the latter hesitated several weeks. Richard ordered William Rickhill, Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, to Calais, &quot;in the company of our dearest kinsman Thomas, earl marshal and earl of Nottingham... and there that you do and perform each and everything which is enjoined on you by the aforesaid earl on our behalf&quot;. In the event they travelled separately. Rickhill left England on 7 September and was to receive Mowbray&#x27;s instructions when they arrived. The writs he had, notes McVitty, &quot;were deliberately left undated or were post-dated to fit a falsified timeline&quot;. When they met, Mowbray&#x27;s instructions were that Rickhill was to have a &quot;colloqium... clearly and openly certified under his seal&quot;. Gloucester made his confession, in the presence of witnesses, on 8 September. The following day, when Rickhill requested another meeting with the Duke, Mowbray refused him. A few days later, parliament requested Mowbray to bring Gloucester back to England to have him stand trial before it. Mowbray returned the writ of summons with the bald reply that he was unable to do so because the duke was dead: &quot;I held this duke in my custody in the lord king&#x27;s prison in the town of Calais, and there, in that same prison, he died&quot;. The historian Amanda McVitty suggests that &quot;historians generally agree that by this point, Richard must have known that Gloucester was already dead&quot;.

On 29 September 1397, Mowbray received a royal pardon for his role as an Appellant. This was part of Richard&#x27;s re-establishment of his aristocracy known as the &quot;Duketti&quot;: &quot;dukelings&quot; or &quot;little dukes&quot;. Given-Wilson has suggested that Mowbray&#x27;s new title &quot;cheapened the great titles at the crown&#x27;s disposal&quot;, while Rowena Archer has argued that, although he may not have been related to the King by blood, &quot;he had lineage and wealth to merit so high an honour&quot;. He also suggests that this does not necessarily indicate the true relationship between the two men. As an (albeit ex) appellant, Richard must have found it difficult to forget Mowbray&#x27;s earlier treason, irrespective of his subsequent loyalty. For Mowbray&#x27;s part, he was too experienced a political operator at the court not to realise this. To celebrate their return to the King&#x27;s grace, Bolingbroke and Mowbray held a ceremonial requiem mass and feast, last which the King and Queen attended. Ostensibly this was to commemorate the return from the Holy Land of Mowbray&#x27;s father&#x27;s bones for reinterment; John Mowbray had built up a posthumous reputation as and something of a cult surrounded him. John Mowbray&#x27;s bones were reliquaried at a Carmelite church, a display that was clearly intended to reflect personally on Mowbray also, increasing his political stature just as he had been elevated to the highest title in the land.

===Quarrel with Bolingbroke===
By late 1397, Richard was planning another expedition to Ireland, while in another repercussion from the Revenge Parliament, around the same time Mowbray quarrelled with Bolingbroke, now Duke of Hereford. Not only did this seriously disrupt the King&#x27;s plans, but says Saul, it was also the event that &quot;brought the royal house of cards come tumbling down&quot;. The historian Caroline Barron argues that &quot;a certain amount of inter-aristocratic rivalry could work to the king&#x27;s advantage, but it was a dangerous game to play&quot;, and this one was to be fatal to Richard. The causes behind their dispute are no longer obvious, but Saul suggests that although a &quot;tangled story&quot;, Given-Wilson&#x27;s explanation is probably as accurate as can now be discerned. He suggests that the issue was less with the personalities involved and more with broader disagreements regarding royal policy, which the King could not contain. The narrative of events only survives through Bolinbroke&#x27;s later retelling. They had both been pardoned in December 1397 in the final session of the previous parliament.

According to Bolingbroke, he met Mowbray on the London–Brentford road while on their way to the Shrewsbury parliament, Mowbray telling him that the king was planning on having them both arrested and that the royal pardons they had received were valueless; Richard intended to &quot;annul that record&quot;. Bolingbroke said he protested that the King would not commit such a breach of faith, to which Mowbray supposedly reminded him that Warwick, Arundel and Gloucester had also had pardons. The King, in turn, was backing their enemies at court, especially Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, the Duke of Surrey and the Earls of Wiltshire, Salisbury and Gloucester. Mowbray apparently urged Bolingbroke to turn against Surrey, Wiltshire and Gloucester, arguing that &quot;even if they are unable to achieve their purpose at present, they will be intent on destroying us in our homes ten years hence&quot;. Mowbray, claimed Bolingbroke, told him that the King thought revenge a dish best served cold and could not be trusted to keep his word. In Given-Wilson&#x27;s words, &quot;It was, [Mowbray] remarked, in the time-honoured manner of politicians sensing the knife at their back, a funny old world ().&quot; Mowbray was probably more concerned for his safety than Bolingbroke, as the latter had the support of John of Gaunt behind him, and Mowbray did not.

The King heard of their encounter and made Bolingbroke repeat Mowbray&#x27;s &quot;many dishonest and slanderous words&quot; at the Shrewsbury sitting of parliament. On 3 January 1398, Bolingbroke presented the King with a deed—&quot;to the best of his memory&quot;—of accusation. Mowbray was furious and denied everything. Parliament could not establish the rights or wrongs of the affair, and Richard set up a committee to resolve it. Believing that Bolingbroke was doing his father&#x27;s bidding, Mowbray laid an ambush for Gaunt in early 1398, although the Duke escaped to Shrewsbury. Mowbray now panicked, says Given-Wilson, and fled. Thus, only Bolingbroke&#x27;s narrative of events survives, as Mowbray did not hang around long enough to provide his own. The King reacted immediately. Mowbray forfeited his office of Earl Marshal, and an order went out for his arrest. Mowbray appeared before Richard at Oswestry in January 1398, having either surrendered or been arrested. Pending a full council hearing in April, he and Bolingbroke were imprisoned in Windsor Castle. Bolingbroke was promptly bailed by his father; Mowbray remained in prison. However, the lack of either supporting or disputing evidence for either party&#x27;s claims made it a &quot;he said, he said&quot; situation, and as a result, Richard decided that it could only be settled with trial by combat, since both men refused to be reconciled. The day was set for 16 September 1398 in Coventry, with the delay being intended to allow cooler heads to prevail if possible. They did not, and the tourney took place as agreed. Both men were experienced and skilled jousters, and according to Adam of Usk,

At this point, the King intervened and stopped the combat. Usk avers this was because he saw that Mowbray was on the verge of losing, whereas the official chronicle says Richard was averse to two of his subjects injuring themselves or worse in the name of his justice. Another contemporary chronicler, the author of the suggests that the fighting had hardly begun when the King stopped it. The scholar Amanda McVitty suggests that he saw the chance to rid himself of two ex-Appellants while appearing to be acting with chivalric magnanimity. Allington-Smith suggests that, perhaps, &quot;it was not in his interest that either of them should win&quot;. Anne Curry has argued that, in his office of Earl Marshal, Mowbray would usually have organised such a duel himself. Historians, she proposes, have not made enough of the fact that this was not enough for Bolingbroke to restrain his attack.

==Exile and death==
Instead of fighting, the two men were exiled: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for 10 years. Usk suggests that Mowbray would at some point be welcomed back, when &quot;being minded he might restore him&quot;. Given-Wilson suggests that even at this stage, Richard had foreseen the possibility of confiscating the two men&#x27;s estates. The longer sentence on Mowbray was supposedly because, while the charge of treason had not been proven, he had failed to renounce the appellants severely enough, had misgoverned Calais to the endangerment of the country and had plotted against John of Gaunt. Mowbray was given a choice by Richard. He could go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Germany, Bohemia or Hungary. This allowed Mowbray to save his honour. Anywhere else was prohibited upon pain of death. He was banned from communicating with Bolingbroke during the latter&#x27;s exile. This sentence could not be appealed, nor could they request to return early, although he would receive £1000 per annum from his estates while abroad. His office of Earl Marshal was granted to Westmorland, while his heir was placed in the household of Richard&#x27;s Queen as a page. Mowbray also set up a council to advise the young Thomas in his father&#x27;s absence, which included some of his own experienced councillors such as Sir John St. John.

Mowbray sailed from Lowestoft to Dordrecht on 19 September 1398; over a thousand well-wishers saw him off from the quay. It was 2PM, and Mowbray was accompanied by around 30 people, including servants and retainers. A historian of the town has commented that, &quot;If the authorities had chosen Lowestoft as the embarkation point in preference to Yarmouth because it was smaller and less well known, their hopes of keeping the event low-key seem not to have worked&quot;. Observers included eighty members of the Suffolk gentry, and they testified that, with a strong wind behind him—&quot;&quot; was recorded—he could easily make six league before sunset.

Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, did not die until March 1399. Mowbray would not, though, inherit the great Brotherton estates. Even though he had been granted letters of protection after the Coventry judgement allowing him to sue for the right to enter any new inheritance, these were cancelled the same day Richard announced he would confiscate Bolingbroke&#x27;s Lancastrian inheritance. This has been described by the scholar Douglas Biggs as an act of either &quot;malice or great folly&quot;.

In Venice, he arranged to purchase a ship from the Signoria, during which negotiations he is recorded in the senate records as &quot;Magnificent Lord the Duke of Gilforth&quot;, or Guildford. The antiquarian Mary Margaret Newett commented that &quot;it is not clear why he took this title or how long he bore it&quot;, although there are a number of Venetian documents extant from a few years later that refer to him again as Duke of Norfolk.

Mowbray died of the plague in Venice on 22 September 1399. He was buried in St Mark&#x27;s Cathedral with an unusual funerary slab. The imagery includes the royal arms of England (per his office of Earl Marshal), the lion crest of his family, the White Hart of Richard II and the White Swan of Henry IV—although the latter, comments the historian David Marcombe had &quot;its head curiously concealed beneath Mowbray&#x27;s helm&quot;. Had he died closer to home, he probably would have been buried in the family mausoleum at Axholme.

==Legacy and aftermath==
Chris Given-Wilson has argued that Mowbray&#x27;s feud with Bolingbroke led directly to the latter&#x27;s usurpation of Richard&#x27;s throne. Bolingbroke returned to England in early July 1399. He claimed that he had only returned to claim his Lancastrian inheritance, but with Richard in Ireland and facing no resistance as he marched south, and claimed the throne on 30 September. Shortly afterwards, on 6 October 1399, the creation of Mowbray as Duke of Norfolk was annulled by Parliament, although his heir retained his other titles. Mowbray&#x27;s executors were granted £1000 for the fulfilment of his will, payment of debts and burial in Venice. In 1532 Mowbray&#x27;s descendant, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk requested the return of Mowbray&#x27;s bones from Venice, intending them to be reinterred with his ducal descendants.

==Personality and assessment==
Mowbray founded the Axholme Charterhouse in 1395 or 1396; he had been petitioning the papacy since at least 1389 for authority. He bequeathed Axholme &quot;a tun or two pipes Gascon wine&quot; a year, along with other smaller donations to other houses. Also in 1396 he founded a Carthusian monastery at Epworth.

Contemporary chroniclers are near-universal in their condemnation of Mowbray, although those that have survived were all writing after Bolingbroke seized the throne. The historian Nigel Saul has described Mowbray as being &quot;driven by ambition and lust for power&quot; and fickle in character. Barron suggests he was &quot;an erratic and insecure man&quot;, while Given-Wilson says that &quot;impetuous and mercurial Mowbray may have been&quot;, but he was not without principles.

==Marriages and issue==
Mowbray married first, after 20 February 1383, Elizabeth le Strange (c. 6 December 137323 August 1383), &quot;suo jure&quot; Lady Strange of Blackmere, daughter and heiress of John le Strange, 5th Baron Strange of Blackmere and Lady Isabel de Beauchamp, daughter of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick. Lady Elizabeth was 9 years old at the time of her marriage and died within around 6 months of being married; as such the couple had no issue. Mowbray&#x27;s second wife was Lady Elizabeth FitzAlan (c. 13728 July 1425), widow of Sir William Montagu, and daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel and Lady Elizabeth de Bohun, daughter of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, by whom he had two sons and three daughters.

Mowbray&#x27;s eldest son and his namesake, inherited the earldom of Nottingham but rebelled against Henry IV in 1405 and was beheaded at 19. The younger Thomas had married Constance, daughter of John Holland, Duke of Exeter around 1400.
Mowbray&#x27;s second son, John, thus inherited his father&#x27;s earldoms. John married Katherine Neville, daughter of the northern magnate Ralph, Earl of Westmorland in 1412, and for loyal service under Henry V, John was restored to the dukedom of Norfolk in 1425.

Mowbray&#x27;s oldest daughter Elizabeth married Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk by 1403. Michael was described by a contemporary chronicler as being &quot;as strong, as active and as daring as any member of the court&quot; of Henry V, and, dying at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, was one of the few notable English deaths. Margaret, the second daughter, married twice, first to Sir Robert Howard, by whom she was the mother of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. She was married by 1420; Robert Howard may have been a retainer of the 2nd Duke of Norfolk and certainly fought with him in France. Her second marriage was to Sir John Grey of Ruthin, Denbighshire, an old friend of the Mowbrays. She died in 1459. The youngest daughter Isabel also married twice. Her first husband was Sir Henry Ferrers, son of William, Baron Ferrers of Groby; Henry died in 1425. She married secondly James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley.

==Estates==
The patrimony that Mowbray inherited was substantial, predominantly based around East Anglia, and focused on the family&#x27;s holdings in Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. These included the important manors of Melton Mowbray and their of Axholme. His mother&#x27;s Segrave inheritance augmented these estates, bringing him manors in Huntingdonshire, Norfolk, Sussex, Warwickshire and Wiltshire. His second wife—whose father, the Earl of Arundel, was one of the wealthiest men in the country—brought him further estates in Norfolk, as well as more in Buckinghamshire and Essex. His landed income was in the region of £1,475 per annum. Given-Wilson calls this &quot;a sizeable patrimony, but not one which would have put Mowbray in the first rank of English earls&quot;. However, this figure does not include the various gifts of valuables or grants of office and land he received from the King. Further, on the death of his grandmother, Countess Margaret, he would have expected to gain another major power base in East Anglia, particularly centred on Framlingham Castle. There was also a swathe of land across Yorkshire, stretching through Hovingham, Thirsk and Nidderdale. Combined with her estates on the Welsh Marches, around Chepstow, and other English counties, these have been adjudged to be worth approximately another £3000 annually. Saul has estimated his annual income at around £2,000 per annum.

==Cultural representations==
===Tudor===
As Thomas Mowbray, his quarrel with Bolingbroke and subsequent banishment are depicted in the opening scene of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;. Mowbray is charged not only with Gloucester&#x27;s murder but also with embezzling money intended to pay for the Calais garrison. The King promises that &quot;frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear / The accuser and the accused freely speak&quot;, although Mowbray professes himself unable to speak as freely as he wished due to the King&#x27;s blood links with Bolingbroke. Mowbray&#x27;s fears are unfounded: Richard describes Bolingbroke&#x27;s charges as based on &quot;ancient malice&quot;, and Mowbray is goaded into making his challenge for trial by combat, presumably so the King cannot find in his favour. Mowbray, understanding he is a pawn in the King&#x27;s plans, prophetically replies to Richard&#x27;s &quot;Lions make leopards tame&quot; with the retort, &quot;Yea, but not change his spots&quot;. Bolingbroke&#x27;s accusations, argues Dr. Imke Lichterfeld, &quot;are grave indeed&quot;, and range from the embezzlement of 8,000 nobles, to the death of Gloucester and treason: three crimes each worse than the last.

His death in exile is announced later in the play by the Bishop of Carlisle. Mowbray is also mentioned in &quot;Henry IV, Part II&quot;, as having once employed the now-dissolute Falstaff as a page. The implication in that scene, set around 1405, is that Mowbray represents an extinct generation of great warriors, particularly as he is the last Englishman to have died on a crusade in the Shakespearean canon. When Shakespeare was writing, deposition was a politically sensitive subject, as, like Richard, Elizabeth I was also childless and increasingly paranoid of dynastic threats from her nobility. Shakespeare uses the exiling of Mowbray and Bolingbroke to represent the exiling of Catholic recusants during her later reign; and, suggests scholar Alfred Thomas, &quot;would thus have resonated with those Elizabethans who had been forced to repudiate their native English tongue as they assumed a life of exile in Catholic Europe&quot;. Further forcing comparison with Elizabeth, Mowbray outright rejects his sovereign&#x27;s &quot;women&#x27;s war&quot; of words.

Mowbray appears in William Baldwin&#x27;s and George Ferrers&#x27;s &quot;A Mirror for Magistrates&quot;, from the mid-16th century. He is described as &quot;the chief worker in the duke [of Gloucester]&#x27;s destruction&quot;, this is because Baldwin and Ferrers follow Robert Fabyan&#x27;s view that by revealing Gloucester&#x27;s plot against the King, Mowbray thereby sealed the Duke&#x27;s fate, rather than because he was in Calais himself. They also suggest that Mowbray was perhaps the least committed of the Appellants in 1386. Mowbray is also the subject of a ballad by the late Tudor poet Thomas Deloney, &quot;A Song of the Banishment of Two Dukes, Hereford and Norfolke&quot;. Deloney is faithful to the chronicles he follows, vilifying Mowbray—who is called &quot;most untrue&quot; to the King—and emphasising Bolingbroke&#x27;s wisdom and righteousness and his God-given claim to the throne. Mowbray is blamed for the King&#x27;s troubles:

===Modern===
Mowbray has been a major role in most adaptions of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, and only a few can be mentioned here. As Duke of Norfolk, he was portrayed by Noel Johnson in the BBC&#x27;s fifteen-part serial adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays, &quot;An Age of Kings&quot; in 1960. Ian McKellen, in an early role, took the play on a provincial tour with the Prospect Theatre Company, with Stephen Greif as Mowbray, in 1960; he is last seen visiting Gloucester, with guards, carrying a mattress, reflecting the contemporary rumour of his suffocation. 1973 saw John Barton&#x27;s Stratford-upon-Avon production, with Denis Holmes to Richard Pasco&#x27;s King, in which Mowbray and Bolingbroke fought each other on massive hobby horses. Barton&#x27;s production transferred to the Aldwych Theatre the following year. Five years later, David Giles production saw Richard Owens as Mowbray in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot;, the entire canon transmitted over a period of seven years. Derek Jacobi led, and Gilles focussed on the ambiguity of the King&#x27;s relationship with Mowbray, who had been his friend and loyal servant but could not yet trust again.

One of the first plays put on by the newly formed English Shakespeare Company, Mowbray was played by Michael Cronin between 1987 and 1988 to Michael Pennington&#x27;s Richard. Indeed, it had been the RSC&#x27;s failure to cast Pennington as Richard the previous year—taken by Jeremy Irons with Richard Moore as the Duke—that led to the formation of the breakaway group. Moore played Mowbray as an artisan-type, rather than a military man, with bright green clothes and a clumsy gait. David Lyon played to David Threlfall&#x27;s Bolingbroke in Deborah Warner&#x27;s 1995 production at the National Theatre&#x27;s Cottesloe. This production was notable for the casting of Fiona Shaw as King Richard. Lyon reprised his role when Warner adapted her production for television two years later. Critic Michael Hattaway noted that, by then, &quot;the uninformed resentment at the take-over of one of Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest roles by a woman had been quelled by the excellence and intelligence of Shaw&#x27;s performance&quot;.

In 2000, Steven Pimlott directed David Troughton as Bolingbroke to Samuel West&#x27;s Richard, with Paul Greenwood playing what critic Rhoda Koenig described as a &quot;quietly intense, harshly whispering&quot; Mowbray. Norfolk. He was played by James Purefoy in the BBC2 series &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, a 2012 television film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Henriad, while the following year David Tennant took the leading role in Gregory Doran&#x27;s RSC production, against Antony Byrne&#x27;s Mowbray.

While Mowbray&#x27;s purported murder of Gloucester takes place before Shakespeare&#x27;s narrative begins, Mowbray does not appear in the play named after his victim, &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot;.

<text>Matamoros, officially known as Heroica Matamoros, is a city in the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, and the municipal seat of the homonymous municipality. It is on the southern bank of the Rio Grande, directly across the border from Brownsville, Texas, United States.
Matamoros is the second largest city in the state of Tamaulipas.
As of 2016, Matamoros had a population of 520,367.
In addition, the Matamoros–Brownsville Metropolitan Area has a population of 1,387,985, making it the 4th largest metropolitan area on the Mexico–US border. Matamoros is the 39th largest city in Mexico and anchors the second largest metropolitan area in Tamaulipas.

The economy of the city is significantly based on its international trade with the United States through the USMCA agreement, and it is home to one of the most promising industrial sectors in Mexico, mainly due to the presence of maquiladoras. In Matamoros, the automotive industry hosts the assembly and accessories plants for brands such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. Prior to the growth of the maquiladoras in the 2000s, Matamoros&#x27; economy had historically been principally based on agriculture, since northern Mexico&#x27;s biggest irrigation zones are in the municipality. PEMEX announced a multibillion-peso offshore drilling project for the port of Matamoros, one of the future prospects for Mexico&#x27;s oil industry.

Matamoros is a major historical site, the site of several battles and events of the Mexican War of Independence, the Mexican Revolution, the Texas Revolution, the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, and the French Intervention that allowed the city to earn its title of &quot;Undefeated, Loyal, and Heroic&quot;. The Mexican National Anthem was played for the first time in public at an opera house, the Teatro de la Reforma (sometimes known as &quot;The Opera Theater&quot;) in Matamoros.

Matamoros has a semiarid climate, with mild winters and hot, humid summers. Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas, are home to the Charro Days and Sombrero Festival, two-nation fiestas that commemorate the heritage of the U.S. and Mexico which are celebrated every February.

==History==
===Foundation===
In 1519, the same year that Hernán Cortés arrived at the port of Veracruz, a captain named Alonso Álvarez de Pineda carried out a brief expedition to the region of northern Tamaulipas, where he named the town known today as Rio Bravo (Rio Grande) as Rio de las Palmas (Palms River). Nevertheless, the actual founding of Matamoros began in 1686, when Captain Alonso de León explored the area and concluded that the Rio Grande was an excellent route for navigation, and that the area of Matamoros was an ideal spot for cattle raising.

In the year 1749, thirteen enterprising families, twelve from Camargo and one from Reynosa, decided to invest and begin a new, influential cattle industry in the area. Former landowners were skeptical that this new investment would be successful, since the frequent overflow of the Rio Grande caused severe floods, and because ranches were occasionally attacked by Indians. Nonetheless, these thirteen families effectively carried out their business plan and created 113 cattle-raising sites. In the year 1774, they officially named the area San Juan de los Esteros Hermosos, known today as Matamoros.

In 1793, to colonize the province of Nuevo Santander, two Franciscan missionaries named Francisco Pueyes and Manuel Júlio Silva established a parish in the main plaza of Matamoros. They proposed a new name for the community: Villa del Refugio, in honor of the parish and patron saint, Our Lady of the Refuge of the Estuaries.

===Mexican independence===
In 1826, the governor Lucas Fernandez dispatched a decree to change the name of the city to Matamoros, in honor of Mariano Matamoros, a hero of the Mexican War of Independence, who participated along with José María Morelos. During the Texas Revolution (1836), Matamoros was the fortress for many Mexican soldiers against rebel attacks.

In 1851, the city of Matamoros was again heroic for defending against attacks by troops under José María Jesús Carbajal, many of whom were recruited from within Texas, who sought to establish a federal republic against the centralist government of Mexico City. The federal troops of Francisco Avalos were able to repel their enemy, and the state congress granted Matamoros the title of &quot;Heroic&quot;, countersigned by the Mexican Congress, hence the city&#x27;s official name of Heroica Matamoros.

The future of the city radically changed after Matamoros declared itself an international free trade zone in 1858. This transformation brought upon urbanization, industrialization, and the expansion of the Bagdad Port, which experienced an economic boom for being the only entrance port for mercenaries for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The Port of Matamoros, also known as the Port of Bagdad, was during the American Civil War one of the leading commercial ports of the world.

===Texas Revolution===

The city of Matamoros was a strategic and fortified city during the Texas Revolution. The Matamoros Expedition was launched to attack Matamoros and defeat the forces of Antonio López de Santa Anna. It proved controversial and divisive. The roots of the controversy lay in the division within the provisional government between Governor Henry Smith and the General Council over whether to remain loyal to the Constitution of 1824 and support the liberals of Mexico in the Federalist cause against Santa Anna or to declare independence from Mexico and seek to become an independent territory. The division, on the other hand, was mirrored within the provisional government and among the commanders in the field, who compounded the situation and contributed to the near destruction of the Texian army.

===American Civil War===
At the beginning of the American Civil War, the city of Matamoros was simply a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande from Brownsville. It had, for several years, been considered a port, but it had relatively few ships arriving. Previous to the war, accounts mention that not over six ships entered the port each year. Nevertheless, in about four years, Matamoros, due to its proximity to Texas, was to assume a new status as a port, and multiply its population. A Union general in 1865 described the importance of the port in Matamoros:

The cotton trade brought together in Bagdad, Tamaulipas, and Matamoros over 20,000 speculators from the Union and the Confederacy, England, France, and Germany. Bagdad had grown from a small, seashore outpost to a &quot;full-pledge town&quot;. The English-speaking population in the area by 1864 was so great that Matamoros even had a newspaper printed in English—it was called the &quot;Matamoros Morning Call&quot;. In addition, the port exported cotton to England and France, where millions of people needed it for their daily livelihood, and it was possible to receive fifty cents per pound in gold for cotton, when it cost about three cents in the Confederacy, &quot;and much more money was received for it laid down in New York and European ports&quot;. Other sources mention that the port of Matamoros traded with London, Havana, Belize, and New Orleans. The Matamoros and New York City trade agreement, however, continued throughout the war and until 1864, and it was considered &quot;heavy and profitable&quot;.

By 1865, Matamoros was described as a prosperous town of 30,000 people, and Lew Wallace informed General Ulysses S. Grant that neither Baltimore or New Orleans could compare itself to the growing commercial activity of Matamoros. Nevertheless, after the collapse of the Confederacy, &quot;gloom, despondency, and despair&quot; became evident in Matamoros—markets shut down, business almost ceased to exist, and ships were rarely seen. &quot;For Sale&quot; signs began to sprout up everywhere, and Matamoros returned to its role of a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande.

The conclusion of the American Civil War brought a severe crisis to the now abandoned Port of Bagdad, a crisis that until this day the port has never recovered from. In addition, a tremendous hurricane in 1889 destroyed the desolated port. This same hurricane was one of the many hurricanes during the period of devastating hurricanes of 1870 to 1889, which reduced the population of Matamoros to nearly half its size, mounting with it another upsetting economic downturn.

===French intervention===

During the French intervention, the port of Baghdad was the scene of the Battle of Baghdad, where the Mexican army defeated the French army and its conservative allies.

===Mexican Revolution===

During the course of the Mexican Revolution, the generals Francisco Mújica and Lucio Blanco executed the first agrarian reform for land in the country (1913). Consequently, in the years to come, Matamoros enjoyed another golden era during The Cotton Age, from 1948 to 1962. This epoch placed Matamoros as the largest cotton producer and exporter in the country.

===Modern era===

Since the 1970s, and especially during the 1990s, after the initiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, foreign investment has multiplied in Matamoros, resulting in an enormous population growth, prominently from other Mexican states, like San Luis Potosí and Veracruz.

Many major crimes have occurred in Matamoros, including the 1989 murder of an American tourist, a 1999 standoff and a 2011 mass kidnapping. In 2023, four American tourists were kidnapped. Two of them as well as a Mexican bystander were killed; the other two were rescued by Mexican authorities.

==Demographics==
The population of the Matamoros locality, measuring 115.3 km2, was 510,739 in 2020 Census, while the entire municipality had 541,979 people covering 4,633 km2. 
==Economy==
===Industrial sector===
The economy of Matamoros depends primarily on its proximity to the United States, due to the importance of the strong presence of foreign investment in the area. Maquiladoras are a direct representation of American presence in the state of Tamaulipas; the trade of goods through the international bridges and the flow of people on both sides of the border play a huge role in the economic posture of Matamoros.

Matamoros is home to more than 122 maquiladoras dedicated in its majority to export to the United States. This industry produces technological goods like cables, electrical appliances, electrical components, vehicle parts and accessories, textiles, chemical products, machinery, and computer products. The city operates about 35% of the Tamaulipas&#x27; maquiladora industry, placing second, just behind Reynosa. In December 2004, the maquiladora industry employed more than 52,777 workers in Matamoros, an increase of 576 jobs compared to 2003 representing a 60% increase in employment.

===Commercial sector===
This economic activity is the second most important in the city of Matamoros, generating approximately 13.5% of the total employment in the municipality. The rapid growth of the population in Matamoros, along with an increase in incomes, have amplified the demand of satisfiers in the area. In the whole state of Tamaulipas, Matamoros places first in terms of jobs and businesses generated by foreign investment in the area, comprising a total of 238 companies, 36% of the state&#x27;s whole business sector.

===Agricultural sector===
The rural area of Matamoros encompasses 97 communities, with more than 36,096 inhabitants in these small agrarian sectors. Traditionally, the city was eminently agricultural, cultivating sorghum, corn, beans, vegetables, and sunflower by millions each year. The terrain in Matamoros categorized in two factions: gley soil, land that is only used for grazing by livestock, and arable land, used solely for growing crops.

The municipality of Matamoros is within the Rio Grande river basin, and by means of irrigation, the agricultural sector flourishes in production. The two main water suppliers are the Rio Grande and the Arroyo del Tigre, which have dams that irrigate the region.

===Livestock production===
The bovine is the most predominant livestock in the municipality of Matamoros, and the commercialization of its meat is the principal income of ranchers in the region. In fact, livestock production goes as the following: bovine (62%), pigs (16%), and sheep (9%).

In the northern part of Tamaulipas, near the municipality of Matamoros, the breeding of calves is characterized and well known for having European blood. However, this is only seen among specialized, high quality meat industries that breed Charolais cattle, Simmental cattle, and the Zebus.

===Fishing industry===
Matamoros has more than of coastline on the Gulf of Mexico, and a total of of the Laguna Madre.

Fortress of Casamata, converted into Museum Casamata in 1970, was a bastion that now guards a fine collection of prehispanic figurines and artifacts dating from central historic moments: the Spanish colonist era, the Mexican War of Independence, and the contentious Mexican Revolution. Unique and curious items are also exhibited, such as an iron casket where the remains of fearless General Canales once rested (fought against both American and French invasions) and the dark tunnels lounged beneath the construction, inevitable reference for local horror stories. The existence of a multipurpose hall and newspaper library also provide extra interest to the museum. The museum was founded by Don Eliseo Paredes Manzano, the city&#x27;s first &quot;cronista&quot; and recognized historian.

On 28 January 1829, the plaza was named after the heroic and historical figure Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who fought in the Mexican War of Independence. Moreover, the Cathedral of Nuestra Señora Villa del Refugio, constructed in 1831, was one of the first mayor constructions and is one of the present symbols of the city. Its neoclassical architecture, along with its rich, historical background, attracts visitors yearlong. The Casino Matamorense, constructed in 1950, is traditionally considered the center of social gatherings for the principal families of Matamoros.

And finally, the &#x27;Teatro Reforma,&#x27; once considered the &#x27;House of the Opera of the 19th Century&#x27;, was constructed in 1861. For decades, the theater was home to important balls held by the richest families of Matamoros and the high-ranking military officers of the state. In addition, &#x27;Teatro Reforma&#x27; is well known for being the first place in history where the Mexican National Anthem was played.

<text>Jean-Marie Roland de la Platière (; 18 February 1734 – 10 November 1793) was a French inspector of manufactures in Lyon and became a leader of the Girondist faction in the French Revolution, largely influenced in this direction by his wife, Marie-Jeanne &quot;Manon&quot; Roland de la Platière. He served as a minister of the interior in King Louis XVI&#x27;s government in 1792.

== Early life ==
Roland de la Platière was born and baptized on 18 February 1734 in Thizy, Rhône. He was a studious child, who received a thorough education. At the age of 18 years, Roland was offered the choice of becoming either a businessman or a priest. But he declined both offers and took up studying manufacturing, leading him to the city of Lyons. Two years later, a cousin and inspector of manufactures offered Roland a position in Rouen. He gladly accepted the job. Roland then was transferred to Languedoc, where he became an enthusiastic economist but soon became ill from overwork. He was then offered the less stressful job of lead inspector of Picardy which was the third most important manufacturing province in France in 1781.

Later that year he married Marie-Jeanne Phlipon, better known simply as Madame Roland, the daughter of a Parisian engraver. Madame Roland was just as involved in Jean-Marie&#x27;s work as he was, editing much of his writing and supporting his political goals. For the first four years of their marriage, Roland continued to live in Picardy and work as a factory inspector. His knowledge of commercial affairs enabled him to contribute articles to the &quot;Encyclopédie Méthodique&quot;, a three volume encyclopedia of manufacturing and industry, in which, as in all his literary work, he was assisted by his wife.

== The Revolution ==
During the first year of the Revolution, the Rolands moved to Lyon, where their influence grew and their political ambitions became clear. From the beginning of the Revolution, they affiliated with the liberal cause. The articles they contributed to the &quot;Courrier de Lyon&quot; came to the attention of the Parisian press; although Roland signed them, it was Madame Roland who wrote them. The city then sent Roland to Paris to inform the Constituent Assembly of the critical state of the silk industry and to ask for relief of Lyon&#x27;s debt. As a result, a correspondence began between Roland, Jacques Pierre Brissot and other supporters of the Revolution, whom he had met in Paris. The Rolands arrived in Paris during February 1791, and remained there until September. They frequented the Society of the Friends of the Constitution, entertaining deputies who later became leading Girondists, and taking an active part in the political landscape. Meanwhile, Madame Roland opened her first salon, helping her husband&#x27;s name become better known in the capital.

In September 1791, Roland&#x27;s mission was complete and he returned to Lyon. By then, however, inspectorships of manufacture had been abolished, so the Roland family decided to move and make their new home in Paris. Roland became a member of the Jacobin Club, and their influence continued to grow. Madame Roland&#x27;s salon becoming the rendezvous of Brissot, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve, Maximilien Robespierre, and other leaders of the popular movement – especially François Nicolas Leonard Buzot.

When the Girondins assumed power, Roland found himself appointed minister of the interior on 23 March 1792, displaying both his administrative ability and what the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (Eleventh Edition, 1911) characterized as &quot;a bourgeois brusqueness&quot;. His wife&#x27;s influence on his declarations of policy was particularly strong in this period: as Roland was &quot;ex officio&quot; excluded from the Legislative Assembly, these declarations were in writing, and so most prone to exhibit Madame Roland&#x27;s personal beliefs.

King Louis XVI used his veto power to prevent decrees against &quot;émigrés&quot; and the non-juring clergy. Madame Roland therefore wrote a letter addressing the royal refusal to sanction the decrees and the role of the king in the state, which her husband addressed and sent to the king. When it remained unanswered, Roland read it aloud in full council and in the king&#x27;s presence. Judged inconsistent with a minister&#x27;s position and disrespectful in tone, the incident led to Roland&#x27;s dismissal. However, he then read the letter to the Assembly, which ordered it printed and circulated. It became a manifesto of dissatisfaction, and the Assembly&#x27;s subsequent demand that Roland and other dismissed ministers be reinstated eventually led to the king&#x27;s dethronement.

After the insurrection of 10 August, Roland was reinstated as Interior Minister, but was dismayed by what he saw as the lack of progress made by the Revolution. As a provincial, he opposed the &quot;Montagnards&quot; who aimed at supremacy not only in Paris but in the government as well. His hostility to the Paris Commune prompted him to propose transferring the government to Blois; and his attacks on Robespierre and his associates made him very unpopular. After failing to seal the armoire de fer (iron chest) found in the Tuileries Palace, containing documents that indicated Louis XVI&#x27;s relations with corrupt politicians, he was accused of destroying some of the evidence within. Finally, during the trial of the king, he and the Girondists demanded that the sentence should be decided by a poll of the French people rather than the National Convention. Two days after the king&#x27;s execution, he resigned his office.

== Death ==
Not long after he resigned as minister, the Girondins came under attack and Roland was denounced as well. Roland fled Paris and went into hiding; in his absence, he was sentenced to death. Madame Roland remained in Paris, where she was arrested in June 1793 and executed on 8 November. When Roland learned belatedly of his wife&#x27;s imminent death, he wandered away from his refuge in Rouen and wrote a few words expressing his horror at the Reign of Terror: &quot;From the moment when I learned that they had murdered my wife, I would no longer remain in a world stained with enemies.&quot; He attached the paper to his chest, sat up against a tree, and ran a cane-sword through his heart on the evening of 10 November 1793.

<text>Osiel Cárdenas Guillén (born 18 May 1967) is a Mexican drug lord and the former leader of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. Originally a mechanic in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, he entered the cartel by killing Juan García Abrego&#x27;s friend and competitor Salvador Gómez, after the former&#x27;s arrest in 1996. As confrontations with rival groups heated up, Osiel Cárdenas sought and recruited over 30 deserters from the &quot;Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales&quot; to form the cartel&#x27;s armed wing. Los Zetas served as the hired private mercenary army of the Gulf Cartel.

After a shootout with the Mexican military in 2003, Cárdenas was arrested and imprisoned. In 2007 he was extradited to the U.S. and in 2010 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for money laundering, drug trafficking, and for having threatened two U.S. federal agents in 1999. His brother, Mario Cárdenas Guillén, worked for the Gulf Cartel, as did another brother, Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, who was killed by Mexican Marines on 5 November 2010. He was imprisoned at USP Terre Haute and was released on 30 August 2024. His inmate number was 62604–079. In December 2024, he was returned to Mexico and arrested. He is incarcerated in the maximum-security Altiplano prison outside Mexico City.

==Arrest of García Abrego==
Following Juan García Abrego&#x27;s 1996 arrest by Mexican authorities and subsequent extradition to the United States, his brother Humberto García Abrego tried to take over the leadership of the Gulf Cartel but ultimately failed, having neither the leadership skills nor the support of the Colombian drug-provisioners. In addition, he was widely known and under surveillance; his surname alone guaranteed this. He was to be replaced by Óscar Malherbe de León and Raúl Valladares del Ángel, until their arrest a short time later. This led several cartel lieutenants to fight for the leadership. Malherbe tried to bribe officials with $2 million to obtain his release, but it was denied. Hugo Baldomero Medina Garza, known as &quot;El Señor de los Tráilers&quot;, is considered one of the most important members of the Gulf Cartel. He was one of the top cartel officials for more than 40 years, trafficking about of cocaine to the United States each month. His luck ended in November 2000 when he was captured in Tampico, Tamaulipas and imprisoned in La Palma. After Medina Garza&#x27;s arrest, his cousin Adalberto Garza Dragustinovis was investigated for allegedly forming part of the Gulf Cartel and for laundering money; this case is still open. The next in line was Sergio Gómez alias &quot;El Checo&quot;, however, his leadership was short-lived when he was assassinated in April 1996 in Valle Hermoso. After this, Cárdenas took control of the cartel in July 1999 after assassinating Salvador Gómez Herrera alias &quot;El Chava&quot;, co-leader of the Gulf Cartel and his close friend, earning his nickname &quot;Mata Amigos&quot; (Friend Killer).

==Cárdenas era and Los Zetas==
In 1997, the Gulf Cartel began to recruit military personnel that Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo, an army general of that time, had assigned as representatives from the Attorney General of Mexico&#x27;s offices in certain states across Mexico. After his imprisonment a short time later, Jorge Madrazo Cuéllar created the National Public Security System (SNSP), to fight the drug cartels along the U.S-Mexico border. After Osiel Cárdenas took full control of the Gulf Cartel in 1999, he found himself in a no-holds-barred fight to keep his notorious organization and leadership untouched, and sought out members of the Mexican Army Special Forces to become the military armed-wing of the Gulf Cartel. His goal was to protect himself from rival drug cartels and from the Mexican military, in order to perform vital functions as the leader of the most powerful drug cartel in Mexico. Among his first contacts was Arturo Guzmán Decena, an Army lieutenant who was reportedly asked by Cárdenas to look for the &quot;best men possible&quot;. Consequently, Guzmán Decenas deserted from the Armed Forces and brought more than 30 army deserters with him to form part of Cárdenas’ new criminal paramilitary wing. They were enticed with salaries much higher than those paid by the Mexican Army. Among the original defectors were Jaime González Durán, Jesús Enrique Rejón Aguilar, and Heriberto Lazcano, who was killed in 2012 while he was the supreme leader of Los Zetas. The creation of Los Zetas ushered in a new era of drug trafficking in Mexico. Between 2001 and 2008, the organization of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas was collectively known as La Compañía (The company).

One of the first missions of Los Zetas was to eradicate Los Chachos, a group of drug traffickers under the orders of the Milenio Cartel, who disputed the drug corridors of Tamaulipas with the Gulf Cartel in 2003. This gang was controlled by Dionisio Román García Sánchez alias &quot;El Chacho&quot;, who had decided to betray the Gulf Cartel and switch his alliance to the Tijuana Cartel; however, he was eventually killed by Los Zetas. Once Cárdenas consolidated his position and supremacy, he expanded the responsibilities of Los Zetas, and as years passed, they became much more important to the Gulf Cartel. They began to organize kidnappings, impose taxes, collect debts, operate protection racket, control the extortion business, secure cocaine supply and trafficking routes known as &quot;plazas&quot; (zones) and execute its foes, often with grotesque savagery. In response to the rising power of the Gulf Cartel, the rival Sinaloa Cartel established a heavily armed, well-trained enforcer group known as Los Negros. The group operated similarly to Los Zetas, but with less complexity and success. There is a circle of experts who believe that the start of the Mexican Drug War did not begin in 2006 when Felipe Calderón sent troops to Michoacán to stop the increasing violence, but in 2004 in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, when the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas fought off the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Negros.

The death of Arturo Guzmán Decena (2002), and the capture of Rogelio González Pizaña (2004), the second-in-line, marked the opportunity for Heriberto Lazcano to take charge of Los Zetas. Upon the arrest of the Gulf Cartel boss Cárdenas in 2003, and his extradition in 2007, the actions of Los Zetas changed—they began to become synonymous with the Gulf Cartel, and their influence grew within the organization. Los Zetas began to grow independently from the Gulf Cartel, and eventually a rupture occurred between them in early 2010.

==Cárdenas&#x27; standoff with U.S. agents==

On 9 November 1999, two U.S. agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were threatened at gunpoint by Cárdenas and approximately fifteen of his henchmen in Matamoros. The two agents traveled to Matamoros with an informant to gather intelligence on the operations of the Gulf Cartel. Cárdenas demanded that the agents and the informant get out of their vehicle, but they refused to obey his orders. The incident escalated as Cárdenas threatened to kill them if they did not comply and his gunmen prepared to shoot them. The agents tried to reason with Cárdenas that killing U.S. federal agents would result in a massive manhunt by the U.S. government. Cárdenas eventually let the men go and threatened to kill them if they ever returned to his territory.

The standoff triggered a massive law enforcement effort to crack down on the leadership structure of the Gulf Cartel. Both the Mexican and U.S. governments increased their efforts to apprehend Cárdenas. Prior to the standoff, he was regarded as a minor player in the international drug trade, but this incident grew his reputation and made him one of the most-wanted criminals. The FBI and the DEA filed numerous charges against him and issued a US$2 million bounty for his arrest.

==Kingpin Act sanction==
On 1 June 2001, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Cárdenas under the Kingpin Act, for his involvement in drug trafficking along with eleven other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from conducting any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.

==Cárdenas&#x27; arrest and extradition==

Osiel Cárdenas Guillén was captured in the city of Matamoros, on 14 March 2003 in a shootout between the Mexican military and Gulf Cartel gunmen. He was one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives; they were offering $2 million for his capture. According to government archives, this six-month military operation was planned and carried out in secret; the only people informed were President Vicente Fox, Mexico&#x27;s Secretary of Defense Gerardo Clemente Vega, and Mexico&#x27;s Attorney General, Rafael Macedo de la Concha. It is believed that he was located based on information provided by Alejandro Lucio Morales Betancourt (Z-2), Osiel Cardenas personal pilot and former Special Forces Intelligence officer who acted as Guzmán Decenas second in command who possibly turned against Osiel Cardenas after his capture in 2001. After his capture, Osiel Cárdenas was sent to the federal, high-security prison La Palma. However, it was believed that Cárdenas still controlled the Gulf Cartel from prison. He was extradited in 2007 to the United States, where he was sentenced to 25 years in a prison in Houston for money laundering, drug trafficking, homicide and death threats to U.S. federal agents. Reports from the PGR and &quot;El Universal&quot; state that while in prison, Osiel Cárdenas and Benjamín Arellano Félix, from the Tijuana Cartel, formed an alliance. Moreover, through handwritten notes, Osiel Cárdenas gave orders on the movement of drugs in Mexico and into the United States, approved executions, and signed forms to allow the purchase of police forces. And while his brother Antonio Cárdenas Guillén led the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas still gave vital orders while in La Palma sending messages through his lawyers and guards.

The arrest and extradition of Osiel Cárdenas, however, caused several top lieutenants from both the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas to fight over important drug corridors to the United States, especially in the cities of Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and Tampico—all situated in Tamaulipas state. They also fought for coastal cities Acapulco and Cancún; the state capital of Monterrey, and the states of Veracruz and San Luis Potosí. Using violence and intimidation, Heriberto Lazcano took control of both Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel after Cárdenas’ extradition. Lieutenants who were once loyal to Cárdenas began following Lazcano&#x27;s orders. He tried to reorganize the cartel by appointing several lieutenants to control specific territories. Morales Treviño was appointed to oversee Nuevo León; Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez in Matamoros; Héctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa, nicknamed &quot;El Karis&quot;, took control of Nuevo Laredo; Gregorio Sauceda Gamboa, known as &quot;El Goyo&quot;, along with his brother Arturo, took control of the Reynosa plaza; Arturo Basurto Peña, alias &quot;El Grande&quot;, and Iván Velásquez Caballero alias &quot;El Talibán&quot; took control of Quintana Roo and Guerrero; and Alberto Sánchez Hinojosa, alias &quot;Comandante Castillo&quot;, took over Tabasco. However, continual disagreement was leading the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas into an inevitable rupture.

===United States v. Cárdenas Guillén===
In 2007, Osiel Cárdenas was extradited to the United States and charged with conspiracy to traffic large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, violating the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute (also known as The Kingpin Statute), and for threatening two U.S. federal officers. The standoff the two agents had with the drug lord in 1999 in the city of Matamoros led to the U.S. indicting Cárdenas and pressuring the Mexican government to capture him. In 2010 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being charged with 22 federal charges; the courtroom was locked and the public prevented from witnessing the proceedings. The proceedings took place in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in the border city of Brownsville. Cárdenas was isolated from interacting with other prisoners at ADX Florence. He was transferred to USP Florence High, then to USP Lewisburg, and finally to USP Terre Haute.

Nearly $30 million of the former drug lord&#x27;s assets were distributed among several Texas law enforcement agencies. In exchange for a 25-year sentence, he agreed to collaborate with U.S. agents in intelligence information. The U.S. federal court awarded two helicopters owned by Osiel Cárdenas to the Business Development Bank of Canada and GE Canada Equipment Financing respectively; and both of them were bought using &quot;drug proceeds&quot;.

On 30 August 2024, US officials announced that Cárdenas had been released from prison and was now in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In December 2024, Cárdenas was returned to Mexico and was immediately arrested and incarcerated at the maximum-security Altiplano prison outside Mexico City to face criminal charges in his home country.

==In popular culture==
A character loosely based on Osiel Cárdenas Guillen, named &quot;Raciel&quot;, was a major supporting character in the second season of the 2017 TV series &quot;El Chapo&quot;.

<text>Joseph Michel Antoine Servan (November 3, 1737 – 1807) was a French publicist and lawyer.

He was born at Romans (Dauphiné). After studying law he was appointed &quot;avocat-general&quot; at the &quot;parlement&quot; of Grenoble at the age of twenty-seven. In his &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;administration de la Justice Criminelle&quot; (1767) he made an eloquent protest against legal abuses and the severity of the criminal code. In 1767 he gained great repute for his defense of a Protestant woman who, as a result of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, had been abandoned by her Catholic husband.

In 1772, however, on the &quot;parlement&quot; refusing to accede to his request that a present made by a &quot;grand seigneur&quot; to a singer should be annulled on the ground of immorality, he resigned, and went into retirement. He excused himself on the score of ill health from sitting in the States General of 1789, to which he had been elected deputy, and refused to take his seat in the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot; under the Empire.

Among his writings may be mentioned &quot;Reflexions sur les Confessions de J.-J. Rousseau&quot; (1783) and &quot;Essai sur La formation des assemblées nationales, provinciales, et municipales&quot; (1789). His &quot;Œuvres choisies&quot; and &quot;Œuvres inédites&quot; have been published by De Portets. His brother Joseph Servan de Gerbey (1741-1808) was war minister in the Girondist ministry of 1792.

See &quot;&quot;Lettres inédites de Servan&quot;,&quot; in &quot;Souvenirs et mémoires&quot; (vol. iv., Paris, 1900).

Michel Foucault&#x27;s quotation of Servan who he mentioned as belonging to an influential group called the &quot;Idéologues&quot; in his seminal work on prisons, &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; provides an illuminating insight into the mind of Servan:
