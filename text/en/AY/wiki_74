<text>The &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy is a major class of newsgroups in Usenet, containing all newsgroups whose name begins with &quot;alt.&quot;, organized hierarchically. The &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy is not confined to newsgroups of any specific subject or type, although in practice more formally organized groups tend not to occur in &quot;alt.*&quot;. The &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy was created by John Gilmore and Brian Reid.

Unlike most of the other hierarchies, there is no centralized control of the hierarchy and anyone who is technically capable of creating a newsgroup can do so. In practice, however, most newsgroups follow an informal procedure involving a public discussion in &quot;alt.config&quot; before being created. This procedure is designed to help the potential creator better understand what factors contribute to a newsgroup&#x27;s success.

It is up to each individual news administrator whether to add a new newsgroup, and some will not do so if the group has not been discussed in &quot;alt.config&quot;. As a result, groups that do not follow this procedure are usually not well-propagated. News group removal in theory occurs in much the same way as newsgroup creation, however as a matter of practice most news administrators do not remove newsgroups.

==Origin==
The birth of the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy is tied to a drastic transformation of the Usenet, the Great Renaming of 1987. The &quot;backbone carriers&quot;, or the backbone cabal as they have been referred to by some users of the Usenet, were vital hubs in the distribution chain of most of the newsgroup postings. Their effort to change the way newsgroups are organized led to objections from some vocal Usenet users.

In particular, the creation of the &quot;talk.*&quot; hierarchy for discussions of controversial or sensitive issues by the renaming did not go well. The &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy was suggested as an alternative to &quot;talk.*&quot; by Brian Reid. It would be a network without the backbones, thereby free from backbones&#x27; influences on creating or not creating a new newsgroup. The first newsgroup on the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy was his &quot;alt.gourmand&quot;.

The prefix &quot;alt&quot; refers to the fact that it is a &quot;hierarchy that is &#x27;alternative&#x27; to the &#x27;mainstream&#x27; (comp, misc, news, rec, soc, sci and talk) hierarchies&quot;. The &quot;So You Want to Create an Alt Newsgroup&quot; FAQ repeats a common joke that the name &quot;alt&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Anarchists, Lunatics, and Terrorists&quot;.

Alt has since become home for a wide variety of things that did not fit elsewhere. In particular, there are many &quot;alt.fan&quot; newsgroups, mostly devoted to discussions of the work and life of famous people: writers, musicians, actors and athletes have &quot;alt.fan&quot; groups. This sub-hierarchy has also been used for self-promotion by otherwise unknown people. During the notorious trial of Karla Homolka, &quot;alt.fan.karla-homolka&quot; was created to get around the Canadian news blackout on the case.

Two major sections of the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy, the &quot;alt.sex.*&quot; and &quot;alt.binaries.*&quot; hierarchies, have been found to fit better in the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy than the Big-eight. Because of the inevitably lurid and sometimes offensive subjects that it would cover, newsgroup administrators objected to the inclusion of one or more newsgroups covering sexual topics in the Big Seven (including the existing &quot;rec.arts.erotica&quot;), fearing that they may prevent the major news hierarchies from being widely distributed. News administrators are free to add any or all of the &quot;alt.sex.*&quot; newsgroups without having to worry about conflicting with the Big Seven. Likewise, any and all of the &quot;alt.binaries.*&quot; newsgroups can be accepted or rejected by administrators if they choose. Binaries are often of extremely large size, which is why administrators may choose to exclude them.

Several extensions of the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy have become quite successful on their own. A number of newsgroups have taken advantage of the freedom of the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy to create a number of newsgroups that specialize on certain topics, as opposed to the broader &quot;generic&quot; discussions of the Big Seven hierarchy. For instance, the &quot;rec.*&quot; hierarchy may be home to the movie discussion newsgroups &quot;rec.arts.movies.current-films&quot;, &quot;rec.arts.movies.past-films&quot;, and &quot;rec.arts.movies.reviews&quot;; but the &quot;alt.movies.*&quot; hierarchy contains more focused discussion groups including &quot;alt.movies.silent&quot;, &quot;alt.movies.hitchcock&quot;, &quot;alt.movies.kubrick&quot;, and &quot;alt.movies.visual-effects&quot;.

The language of preference in the &quot;original&quot; Usenet hierarchies, including &quot;alt.*&quot;, is English, which implies that the preferred character set encoding for these newsgroups is ASCII. Other language hierarchies have later been created in parallel to the existing English ones, for example &quot;de.*&quot; for German, &quot;fr.*&quot; for French, etc. Some access providers also created their own versions, prefixing the newsgroups names with their own name in a similar way. Messages posted in these &quot;private&quot; groups are generally not passed to other providers or the internet in general.

==Censorship==
In June 2008, it was announced that Sprint and Verizon would be cutting off access to the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy to their subscribers, citing child pornography as the only reason. New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo claimed his office found child porn in 88 of the 100,000 groups that exist on &quot;alt.*&quot;. Verizon has not blocked &quot;alt.*&quot; from users, but has simply stopped maintaining the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy on their own servers. Verizon subscribers can still access the &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy through a third-party Usenet service.

In the same time frame, AT&amp;T&#x27;s United States–based consumer dial internet service provider decommissioned their NNTP servers entirely, citing a combination of the above concerns and a putative decline in traffic volume which had accelerated beyond a statistical point of no return.

<doc id="195425" wikidata="Q3290836" url="?curid=195425" title="ILLIAC I">
<text>The ILLIAC I (Illinois Automatic Computer), a pioneering computer in the ILLIAC series of computers built in 1952 by the University of Illinois, was the first computer built and owned entirely by a United States educational institution.

==Computer==
The project was the brainchild of Ralph Meagher and Abraham H. Taub, who both were associated with Princeton&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Study before coming to the University of Illinois. The ILLIAC I became operational on September 1, 1952. It was the second of two identical computers, the first of which was ORDVAC, also built at the University of Illinois. These two machines were the first pair of machines to run the same instruction set.

ILLIAC I was based on the IAS machine Von Neumann architecture as described by mathematician John von Neumann in his influential &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;. Unlike most computers of its era, the ILLIAC I and ORDVAC computers were twin copies of the same design, with software compatibility. The computer had 2,800 vacuum tubes, measured 10 ft (3 m) by 2 ft (0.6 m) by 8½ ft (2.6 m) (L×B×H), and weighed . ILLIAC I was very powerful for its time; in 1956, it had more computing power than all of Bell Telephone Laboratories.

Because the lifetime of the tubes within ILLIAC was about a year, the machine was shut down every day for &quot;preventive maintenance&quot; when older vacuum tubes would be replaced in order to increase reliability. Visiting scholars from Japan assisted in the design of the ILLIAC series of computers, and later developed the MUSASINO-1 computer in Japan. ILLIAC I was retired in 1962, when the ILLIAC II became operational.

==Innovations==
* 1955 – Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson used ILLIAC I to compose the &quot;Illiac Suite&quot; which was one of the first pieces of music to be written with the aid of a computer.
* 1957 – Mathematician Donald B. Gillies, physicist James E. Snyder, and astronomers George C. McVittie, S. P. Wyatt, Ivan R. King and George W. Swenson of the University of Illinois used the ILLIAC I computer to calculate the orbit of the Sputnik 1 satellite within two days of its launch.
* 1960 – The first version of the PLATO computer-based education system was implemented on the ILLIAC I by a team led by Donald Bitzer. It serviced a single user. In early 1961, version 2 of PLATO serviced two simultaneous users.

<doc id="195432" wikidata="Q1063385" url="?curid=195432" title="Music from Big Pink">
<text>Music from Big Pink is the debut studio album by the Canadian-American rock band the Band. Released on July 1, 1968, by Capitol Records, it employs a distinctive blend of country, rock, folk, classical, R&amp;B, blues, and soul. The album&#x27;s title refers to a house in West Saugerties, New York called &quot;Big Pink&quot;, which was shared by bassist/singer Rick Danko, pianist/singer Richard Manuel and organist Garth Hudson and in which the album&#x27;s music was partly composed. The album itself was recorded in studios in New York and Los Angeles in 1968, and followed the band&#x27;s stint backing of Bob Dylan on his 1966 tour (as the Hawks) and time spent together in upstate New York recording material that was officially released in 1975 as &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, also with Dylan. The cover artwork is a painting by Dylan.

In 2000, the album was rereleased with additional outtakes from the recording sessions, and in 2018, a &quot;50th Anniversary Super Deluxe&quot; edition was released with a new stereo mix by Bob Clearmountain.

==Background and Big Pink house==
The Band&#x27;s members included Danko, Manuel, Hudson, guitarist Robbie Robertson and drummer/singer Levon Helm. They began to create their distinctive sound during 1967 when they improvised and recorded with Bob Dylan a huge number of cover songs and original Dylan material in the basement of a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, located at 56 Parnassus Lane (formerly 2188 Stoll Road). The house was built by Ottmar Gramms, who bought the land in 1952. The house was newly built when Rick Danko found it as a rental. Danko moved in along with Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel in February 1967. The house became known locally as &quot;Big Pink&quot; for its pink siding. The house was subsequently sold by Gramms in 1977, and since 1998, it has been a private residence.

Widely bootlegged at the time, initially as &quot;Great White Wonder&quot; in July 1969, some of the recordings Dylan and the Band made were officially released in 1975 on &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, and then in their totality in 2014 on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete&quot;. By the end of 1967, the Band felt it was time to step out of Dylan&#x27;s shadow and make their own statement.

==Recording==
The Band&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman (who was also Dylan&#x27;s manager) approached Capitol Records to secure a record deal for a group still informally described as &quot;Dylan&#x27;s backing band&quot;. Alan Livingston at Capitol signed the Band, initially under the name the Crackers. Armed with news of a recording deal for the group, they lured Levon Helm back from the oil rigs where he had been working to Woodstock where he took up his crucial position in the Band, singing and playing drums. Helm&#x27;s return coincided with a ferment of activity in Big Pink as the embryonic Band not only recorded with Dylan but also began to write their own songs.

After meeting with producer John Simon, the Band started to record their debut album in Manhattan at A&amp;R Studios, at 799 7th Avenue in the early months of 1968. The Band recorded &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;, &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, &quot;We Can Talk&quot;, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s On Fire&quot; and &quot;The Weight&quot; in two sessions. Robertson has said that when Simon asked them how they wanted it to sound, they replied, &quot;Just like it did in the basement.&quot;

Capitol, pleased with the initial recording session, suggested that the group move to Los Angeles to finish recording their first album at Capitol Studios. They also cut some material at Gold Star Studios on Santa Monica Boulevard. The songs on &quot;Big Pink&quot; recorded in L.A. were &quot;In A Station&quot;, &quot;To Kingdom Come&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Suzie&quot;, &quot;Long Black Veil&quot; and &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;.

==Artwork==
Dylan offered to sing on the album, but ultimately realized it was important for the Band to make their own statement. Instead, Dylan signified his presence by contributing a cover painting. Barney Hoskyns has written that it is significant the painting depicts six musicians. The cover of &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; was intended to establish the group as having a different outlook from the psychedelic culture of 1968. Photographer Elliott Landy flew to Toronto to photograph the assembled Danko, Manuel, Robertson, and Hudson families on the Danko chicken farm. A photo was inserted of Diamond and Nell Helm, who lived in Arkansas. The photo appeared on the cover with the caption &quot;Next of Kin&quot;. The overall design of the sleeve is by Milton Glaser (who also did the poster that was packed with the 1967 &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;).

==Reception==
The initial reception to the album was positive. It received praise for the organic quality of the instrumentation, which had been recorded live without overdubbing. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Al Kooper&#x27;s rave review of &quot;Big Pink&quot; ended with the words, &quot;This album was recorded in approximately two weeks. There are people who will work their lives away in vain and not touch it.&quot; This helped to draw public attention to it (&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; even referred to them as &quot;the band from Big Pink&quot; instead of just &quot;the Band&quot;). The fact that Bob Dylan wrote one and co-wrote two of the songs on the album also attracted attention. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, crediting the music&#x27;s original evocation of &quot;country-soul feeling without imitating it&quot; and the &quot;human roughness around the edges&quot;, yet stating that he &quot;always admired that album&quot; but &quot;from a distance&quot;.

In 1968, &quot;The Weight&quot; peaked at No. 63 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 singles chart in the US. The song was a bigger hit elsewhere, peaking at No. 35 in Canada, and No. 21 in the UK. The album peaked at No. 18 in Canada and reached No. 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Pop Albums chart in 1968, and then recharted as a No. 8 hit on the Top Internet Albums chart in 2000. &quot;The Weight&quot; gained widespread popularity from the Band&#x27;s performance of it at Woodstock on August 17, 1969, and due partially to its inclusion in the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, though it was omitted from the soundtrack because of licensing issues. A cover version by the band Smith was included on the soundtrack album instead.

The laid-back feel of the album attracted the attention of other major artists. For example, Eric Clapton cites the album&#x27;s roots rock style as what convinced him to quit Cream, and engage Delaney and Bonnie and friends as &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot; on his debut solo album. George Harrison was also impressed by the album&#x27;s musicianship and sense of camaraderie, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd called it the second &quot;most influential record in the history of rock and roll&quot;, after the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, and said that it &quot;affected Pink Floyd deeply, deeply, deeply&quot;. According to Terry Burrows, the album spawned the Americana genre, while music academic Chris Smith said its songs laid the groundwork for roots rock music. The music writer Ian MacDonald called it &quot;...the most influential record of its time – probably the most influential in rock history&quot;, citing its influence on the Beatles, Elton John, Traffic, Fairport Convention, the Byrds, the Grateful Dead, Little Feat, and 1970s country rock in general.

&quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; was voted No. 452 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003, it was ranked 34th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, a ranking it maintained on the magazine&#x27;s 2012 revised list, before dropping to number 100 in a 2020 revised list. On Metacritic, the expanded 50th anniversary edition of the album has an aggregate score of 99 out of 100, based on seven reviews, a rating that the website defines as indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

== Re-releases ==

The original LP record issue included a gatefold cover in 1968, duplicated 40 years later in 2008 as a remastered 180 gm LP. On compact disc, it was remastered as a gold CD in 1989, as a DVD-audio in 2001 and as a remastered numbered edition SACD in 2009. On August 29, 2000, it was reissued by EMI Records as a standard compact disc with nine bonus tracks. In 2012, Mobile Fidelity released a remastered, numbered, limited edition, Half-speed Mastering from the original master tapes, 180g LP pressed at RTI.

In 2018, a 50th Anniversary Edition was released with an entirely new stereo mix and 5.1 mix by Bob Clearmountain, mastered by Bob Ludwig. It also included some of the additional tracks from the 2000 re-release, and a new vocal-only mix of &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;.

<text>The Cyclone is a vacuum-tube computer, built by Iowa State College (later University) at Ames, Iowa. The computer was commissioned in July 1959. It was based on the IAS architecture developed by John von Neumann. The Cyclone was based on ILLIAC, the University of Illinois Automatic Computer. The Cyclone used 40-bit words, used two 20-bit instructions per word, and each instruction had an eight-bit op-code and a 12-bit operand or address field. In general IAS-based computers were not code compatible with each other, although originally math routines which ran on the ILLIAC would also run on the Cyclone.

The Cyclone was completed just as the transistor was replacing the vacuum tube as an active computing element. The Cyclone had about 2,500 vacuum tubes, 1,521 of which were type 5844. (The IBM 1401 computer, announced the same year, was fully transistorized. About 15,000 IBM 1401 machines were produced.)

The supervisor of the Cyclone computer construction was Dr. R. M. Stewart, a professor of physics at ISC (now ISU). The paper-tape input was upgraded with an optical character reader using a high-speed stepper motor, again by a person from the Physics Department. Robert Asbury Sharpe organized and taught courses for interested faculty and wrote an assembler as well as an ALGOL compiler for the Cyclone.

The Cyclone solved 40 equations with 40 unknowns in less than four minutes. This was the same type of problem that the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was designed to solve twenty years earlier at the same college.

The Cyclone computer was 10 feet tall, 12 feet long, 3 feet wide, and contained over 2,700 vacuum tubes. It used 19 kW of electric power and weighed about . &quot;Good time&quot; was about 40 hours per week.

The original Cyclone had:
# Input and output via five-hole paper tape. 
# A model 28 Teleprinter, 10 characters per second, was also available for output.
# Memory was originally 1,024 40-bit words of Williams tube electrostatic memory.

The Cyclone had a major rebuild about 1961:
# Five-hole paper tape was replaced by an eight-hole tape reader/punch.
# The console printer was upgraded to an eight-hole Friden Flexowriter.
# 1024-word Williams memory was replaced by four banks of magnetic-core memory, 4096 words in each bank.

Both versions had features and limitations:
* All IAS derivatives used an asynchronous CPU, with no clock. Each unit generated an &quot;answer-back&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m ready&quot; signal, which permitted the output to be used or the next step taken. Most computers designed since then are &quot;synchronous&quot;, meaning after a certain number of clock cycles the unit is finished with the pending operation, for example an addition.
* There were no index registers. To access sequential data in a loop, programs used address modification in the instructions instead of incrementing or decrementing an index.
* The Cyclone had a loudspeaker system connected to the sign bit of the accumulator. Operators or monitors could listen for an infinite loop or particular program. When the computer was finished, the memory exerciser program was started, which had a distinctive sound - signaling others that the machine was available. Speakers were placed in offices and work areas for convenience.

The only input device was the paper tape reader and the only outputs were the console printer and paper tape punch. As the paper tape punch was much faster than the printer, most output was punched, and then listed on an off-line printer.
The Iowa State Cyclone is distinct from the Atanasoff–Berry Computer of the late 1930s - neither John Vincent Atanasoff nor Clifford Berry worked on this machine.

<text>Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Glendale, California, in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden&#x27;s lead singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell with Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Their unique sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock and 1990s alternative rock, with musical influences that included 1960s funk, soul and R&amp;B. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, with emphasis on Cornell&#x27;s wide vocal range and Morello&#x27;s unconventional guitar solos.

In their six years together, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. They disbanded in February 2007 after Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was leaving the band. Later that year, Cornell and Morello (under his moniker The Nightwatchman) released solo albums, and Morello, Commerford, and Wilk reunited with Zack de la Rocha for the Rage Against the Machine Reunion Tour.

Audioslave reunited to perform at Prophets of Rage&#x27;s Anti-Inaugural Ball, which took place on January 20, 2017. Cornell&#x27;s death later that year precluded any chance of further reunions.

==History==

===Formation (2000–2001)===
On October 18, 2000, Rage Against the Machine broke up after the vocalist, Zack de la Rocha, announced he was leaving, citing a breakdown in the band&#x27;s &quot;decision-making process&quot;. The remaining members—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello and Brad Wilk— announced plans to search for a new vocalist. 

Several vocalists jammed with them, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but the band did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Layne Staley of Alice in Chains was long rumored to have auditioned, but Morello denied this on Twitter in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, which had broken up in 1997. Rubin also persuaded Morello, Wilk and Commerford to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that, with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band, as the Yardbirds had evolved into Led Zeppelin. Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him &quot;the angel at the crossroads&quot; because &quot;if it wasn&#x27;t for him, I wouldn&#x27;t be here today&quot;.

The chemistry with Cornell was immediately apparent. Morello said: &quot;He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It didn&#x27;t just sound good. It didn&#x27;t sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can&#x27;t deny it.&quot; The group wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

===&quot;Audioslave&quot; (2002–2003)===

On March 19, 2002, the group, still unnamed, was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell&#x27;s manager confirmed that he had left the band, with no explanation given.

Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, the Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band&#x27;s albums.

Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the names Civilian or the Civilian Project. According to Morello, the songs were unfinished and, in some cases, &quot;weren&#x27;t even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind&quot;. He described them as &quot;inferior sketches of works-in-progress, sent to Seattle for Chris to work on. Someone at that studio helped themselves to a copy and, after eight months, it made its way to an Italian website. Then it went global and everyone thought they had the record, which was so frustrating.&quot;

The band announced their name after coming to an agreement with a Liverpool based band with the same name and launched their website in early September. The first single, &quot;Cochise&quot;, was posted online in late September, and was on the radio in early October. Critics praised Cornell&#x27;s vocal style, a departure from the rapping of de la Rocha, and found that &quot;the former members of RATM have gone and done a Paul Weller, retreating from the ground they broke back [to] the sounds that inspired them&quot;. Director Mark Romanek shot a music video for &quot;Cochise&quot;, which shows the band playing atop a tower under construction in the midst of a giant fireworks display providing all the lighting. The firework explosions during filming prompted fears of a terrorist attack among residents living near Los Angeles&#x27; Sepulveda Dam, the shooting location.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Audioslave&quot;, was released on November 19, 2002, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 7 after selling 162,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold within a month of release, and by 2006 achieved triple platinum status. It remains the most successful Audioslave album, having sold more than three million copies in the United States alone. It received mixed reviews; some critics felt it was uninspired, and predictable. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised Cornell&#x27;s voice, but criticized virtually every other aspect, deeming the lyrics &quot;complete gibberish&quot; and Rubin&#x27;s production &quot;a synthesized rock-like product that emits no heat&quot;. Other critics praised the style as reminiscent of 1970s rock, and compared it to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, saying they added much-needed sound and style to contemporary mainstream rock.

Audioslave made their live debut on November 25, 2002, performing a brief concert on the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway in New York City for the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. It was the first time any band had appeared on Letterman&#x27;s marquee. That year&#x27;s KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas was Audioslave&#x27;s first paying concert, in which the band played on the first night, December 7, after giving a secret club show the night before. Toward the end of the band&#x27;s six-song set, Cornell told the audience, &quot;These guys saved my life this year,&quot; and the show ended with his bandmates hugging him. Afterwards, asked to expand on his comments, he would say only that he had dragged the trio &quot;through a trail of shit&quot; in the past months. Cornell later confirmed that he had checked into drug rehabilitation. In a San Diego CityBEAT article, Cornell explained that he went through &quot;a horrible personal crisis&quot; during the making of the first record, staying in rehab for two months and separating from his wife. He credited Morello, Commerford and Wilk with helping him rebound. He dismissed rumors about problems with OxyContin or heroin, but when asked, offered only, &quot;Various things. I&#x27;m not picky. Mainly for drinking.&quot;

&quot;Like a Stone&quot;, the second single from &quot;Audioslave,&quot; was released in early 2003. It was the highest-charting single from the album, reaching number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts. It was certified gold, making it Audioslave&#x27;s most successful single. The music video for &quot;Like a Stone&quot; was written and directed by Meiert Avis. It was shot in the Los Angeles house where Jimi Hendrix wrote &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. The video uses negative space to invoke the memory of musicians past. The music video for the third single, &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot;, was banned by MTV, reportedly because it shows the band in a high-speed car chase running police cars and motorcycles off the road. The band&#x27;s first DVD, &quot;Audioslave&quot;, was released on July 29, 2003.

Audioslave toured extensively worldwide in 2003, gaining positive reviews for their performances, including at the revived Lollapalooza. Their performance on the Lollapalooza tour won the &quot;Metal Edge&quot; 2003 Readers&#x27; Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Lollapalooza Band&quot;.

===&quot;Out of Exile&quot; (2004–2005)===

In 2004, at the 46th Grammy Awards, &quot;Like a Stone&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot; and &quot;Audioslave&quot; for &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;. They spent the rest of 2004 on break from touring and working on the second album. This gave Morello time to concentrate on his solo project, the Nightwatchman, and also to take an active part in political activities. Cornell had time to focus on his personal life; after his divorce from his first wife was finalized, he married Vicky Karayiannis, a Paris-based publicist he met during Audioslave&#x27;s first European tour.

Work on a new album had started in 2003 during the Lollapalooza tour, and continued at the end of the year when band members entered the studio. Aside from writing new material, the band also had some leftover songs from the &quot;Audioslave&quot; sessions; according to Morello, they had &quot;almost another album&#x27;s worth of stuff [already done].&quot; &quot;Be Yourself&quot;, the first single from the still-untitled album, was panned by some critics, who felt it was &quot;limp, and the lyrics are bland and directionless&quot;. Nevertheless, it reached number one on the Mainstream and Modern Rock charts.

In April 2005, the band launched a club tour, which lasted until late May. Although on previous tours Audioslave occasionally played cover songs, they deliberately avoided playing their former bands&#x27; songs to avoid using those songs as a &quot;crutch&quot; to &quot;help sell and break Audioslave&quot; as their aim was to establish the band as an &quot;independent entity&quot;. After achieving that goal, they thought it was &quot;time to own those histories,&quot; and began performing a selection of the two bands&#x27; most popular songs (such as &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot;) on the tour.

The second single, &quot;Your Time Has Come&quot; was released through a unique promotion, lasting one week, which involved radio listeners around the world. Radio stations were asked to post a link on their websites to a special timed-out download of the song. Once one million people clicked on the link, the song was unlocked and became downloadable by all one million.

On May 6, 2005, Audioslave played a free show in Havana, Cuba, in front of an estimated 50,000 people at the La Tribuna Antiimperialista José Martí (José Martí Anti-Imperialist Stand) venue, which was purpose-built in 2000 for mass protests against the U.S. government. Audioslave became the first American rock group to perform an open-air concert in the socialist republic of Cuba. The band traveled to Havana—bringing along their camera crew—on May 4 to spend two days visiting historic sites and interacting with Cuban musicians and youngsters. Morello and the rest of the band insisted that the trip was not to make a political statement, but to take part in a musical cultural exchange. Cornell commented: &quot;Hopefully, this concert will help to open the musical borders between our two countries.&quot; The trip was organized with the joint authorization of the United States Department of the Treasury and the Instituto Cubano de la Musica (Cuban Institute of Music), as travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba is restricted, but the authorization arrived so late that the band had to cancel and postpone several confirmed dates of their U.S. tour. The 26-song-set concert—which included several Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine songs—was the longest the band had ever played.

&quot;Out of Exile&quot; was released internationally on May 23, 2005, then a day later in the U.S. It debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart, the only Audioslave album to reach this position. The following week, however, it dropped to number three, with a 62-percent sales decrease—consequently reaching platinum. Cornell admitted to writing some of his most personal songs on the album, influenced by the positive changes in his life since 2002. He described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs.

The album was received more favorably than Audioslave&#x27;s debut; critics noted Cornell&#x27;s stronger vocals, likely the result of quitting smoking and drinking, and pointed out that &quot;Out of Exile&quot; is &quot;the sound of a band coming into its own.&quot; AllMusic, which gave &quot;Audioslave&quot; a lukewarm review, praised the album as &quot;lean, hard, strong, and memorable.&quot; The lyrics, however, were still a common complaint. MusicOMH.com wrote that Cornell&#x27;s lyrics &quot;continue to border on the ridiculous&quot;; the album&#x27;s softer, slower approach was frequently criticized as well.

Following the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on a European tour, performed at the Live 8 benefit concert in Berlin on July 2, 2005, and played their first North American headlining arena tour from late September to November 2005. The music video for &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Remind Me&quot;, the third single from &quot;Out of Exile,&quot; was posted online in September 2005. Audioslave&#x27;s second DVD, &quot;Live in Cuba&quot;, featuring the concert in Havana, was released on October 11, 2005. It was certified platinum in less than two months.

===&quot;Revelations&quot; and breakup (2006–2007)===
In December 2005, Audioslave received its third Grammy nomination at the 48th Grammy Awards in the Best Hard Rock Performance category for &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Remind Me&quot;. Audioslave began recording their next album; Cornell had already expressed his desire to make &quot;an album every year or year-and-a-half&quot; even before &quot;Out of Exile&quot; was released. In early July 2005, after the conclusion of the European tour, the band returned to the studio to write new songs; Morello said their aim was to &quot;blur the lines between rehearsing, recording and touring.&quot; The actual recording began in January 2006, with plans to release the album, &quot;Revelations&quot;, in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News - Audioslave Turn To Rage/Soundgarden Producer For Third LP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the band chose &quot;Out of Exile&quot;&#x27;s mixer, Brendan O&#x27;Brien, as producer.
Audioslave had 20 songs written and recorded, 16 of those in only three weeks. The album&#x27;s release date, however, was postponed to early September, and the band cancelled their previously announced European tour, to have a new album to support, when they embarked on touring. The first single off the album, &quot;Original Fire&quot;, was made available online on Audioslave&#x27;s official website for free streaming in early July.

News about Cornell&#x27;s departure emerged in July 2006, when insiders stated that after the third album was released, he would depart the band and restart his solo career. Cornell immediately denied the rumors, stating &quot;We hear rumors that Audioslave is breaking up all the time. ... I always just ignore [them].&quot; In the same interview, he also discussed his intentions to record a new solo album, the second in seven years, before the end of August.
A special marketing campaign preceded the new album&#x27;s release in August, when the art concept was featured on Google Earth as a fictional utopian island, Audioslave Nation, created in the South Pacific. Several songs from the upcoming album appeared on movie and video game soundtracks; &quot;Wide Awake&quot; and &quot;Shape of Things to Come&quot; were featured in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, while &quot;Revelations&quot; was on the soundtrack of &quot;Madden NFL 07&quot;. &quot;Revelations&quot; was released on September 5, 2006. The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 2 and sold 142,000 copies during its first week of release. It became the band&#x27;s least commercially successful album; dropping even faster than &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, its sales were down 65 percent the following week, achieving gold certification a month later. The album showed funk, soul and R&amp;B influences that were non-existent for the band before; Morello referred to the new sound as &quot;Led Zeppelin meets Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&quot;. Additionally, several songs took a more overtly political stance than previous Audioslave releases.

The album received a similar critical response to &quot;Out of Exile&quot; with the majority of reviewers praising the band&#x27;s integrity on the record. The new funk and soul influences were also welcomed favorably; Allmusic called the album Audioslave&#x27;s &quot;most colorful, diverse, and consistent record yet.&quot; Many others, however, saw it as &quot;just another rock record&quot;, and musically not much different from the previous album.

Cornell decided to delay the Revelations tour until 2007, because he wanted to &quot;let the album come out &quot; and also concentrate on his second solo album. The rest of the band went along; Morello also revealed his plans to release his debut solo album in early 2007. The second, and final single from the album, &quot;Revelations&quot; was released in October 2006 with an accompanying music video a month later.

On January 22, 2007, Rage Against the Machine was announced to reunite for one show only, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, on April 29. Less than a month later, on February 15, Cornell officially announced his departure from Audioslave, issuing this statement:
Due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences, I am permanently leaving the band Audioslave. I wish the other three members nothing but the best in all of their future endeavors. He stated that, as far as he was concerned, Audioslave had disbanded, and that a greatest hits collection would be issued in the future, because of label commitments.

===Post-breakup (2008–2016)===
Morello and Cornell initially disagreed over the particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: &quot;Tom and I did have communications about the fact that I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it.&quot; He also added that this process of &quot;doing Audioslave business&quot; led him to go solo. Contrary to some reports, Cornell has stated that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, &quot;Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren&#x27;t particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren&#x27;t as conjoined anymore.&quot;

In 2011, Cornell revealed further information about the band&#x27;s breakup; &quot;Personally a lot of it was me trying to land on my feet again. I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded...I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn&#x27;t need to become what it became. You learn with experience.&quot;

In 2012, Morello said that unreleased material that was not on the three albums could be released in the future at an unspecified point. Cornell and Morello shared the stage together for the first time in seven years, among many musicians, at the 2013 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concert. Cornell also joined Morello on stage on September 26, 2014, guesting on his solo Seattle show. They played together several Nightwatchman songs, Cornell&#x27;s usual acoustic covers, and for the first time in eight years, some Audioslave songs.

In August 2015, Cornell openly said in interview with &quot;Total Guitar&quot; that he was quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: &quot;I think it would be great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again.&quot; Soon after, Morello said that he was interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: &quot;I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He&#x27;s one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And to be able to play the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again.&quot;

===Reunion and death of Chris Cornell (2017)===
On January 17, 2017, it was announced that Audioslave would reunite for their first show in 12 years at Prophets of Rage&#x27;s Anti-Inaugural Ball, protesting President Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration. The event took place on January 20, 2017.

Asked in February 2017 if there would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, &quot;It&#x27;s always a possibility. I mean, we&#x27;ve been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about actually picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody&#x27;s so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that&#x27;s taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it&#x27;s really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it&#x27;s comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody&#x27;s up for it.&quot;

However, on May 18, 2017, three months after making that statement, Cornell was found deceased in his Detroit hotel room, ending the possibility of any future Audioslave reunions with their original lead vocalist.

==Name==

The original idea for the band&#x27;s name was &quot;Civilian&quot;, but it was dropped when members found out that it was already taken. Morello later discredited the story, contradicting Commerford and Cornell, and commented that &quot;Civilian&quot; was merely a rumor circulating at the time. He stated: &quot;The band has only ever had one name, and that is Audioslave.&quot; Morello described the origin of the &quot;Audioslave&quot; name to LAUNCHcast as follows:
That was Chris&#x27; suggestion that sort of came to him in a vision. We&#x27;re all on the two-way pagers, and Chris one night said, &quot;I got it. It&#x27;s Audioslave.&quot; We were all, like, &quot;All right, fantastic.&quot; ... To paraphrase Elvis Costello, talking about band names is like dancing about architecture—there&#x27;s just no point in it because the band name becomes the music and the people.

After the name was announced, it emerged that it was already being used by an unsigned band from Liverpool. The two bands worked out a settlement, with the American Audioslave paying $30,000 in a deal that allowed each band to use the name. To avoid confusion, the Liverpool band would rename themselves &quot;The Most Terrifying Thing&quot;.

The name was mocked by critics due to its uninspired nature, and was regarded as one of the worst in contemporary rock music, or even of all time. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it the &quot;most asinine bandname of the year,&quot; and Chuck Klosterman of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine chided it as &quot;one of the dumbest band names in recent rock history.&quot;

==Musical style and influences==
Audioslave&#x27;s musical style has generally been regarded as hard rock, alternative metal, post-grunge, and alternative rock. By combining 1970s style hard rock riffing with alternative rock, Audioslave created a distinctive sound. This mix was driven by Cornell&#x27;s wide vocal range, Morello&#x27;s innovative guitar solos and the robust rhythm section of Wilk and Commerford. Morello, although stating he &quot;never felt musically limited&quot; in Rage Against the Machine, did say that he had &quot;a lot more scope to explore with Audioslave&quot; and a &quot;wider musical territory&quot;. This meant that the instrumentalists had the opportunity to write slow and melodic songs, something they had not done before.

As opposed to de la Rocha&#x27;s lyrics, Cornell&#x27;s were mostly apolitical; Morello referred to them as &quot;haunted, existential poetry&quot;. They were characterised by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism, love, hedonism, spirituality and Christianity. Audioslave&#x27;s first two albums drew influences from 1970s hard rock and heavy metal such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and from the members&#x27; previous bands (the grunge sound of Soundgarden and the funk metal sound of Rage Against the Machine). For &quot;Revelations&quot;, which was influenced by 1960s and 1970s funk, soul and R&amp;B music, Morello used vintage guitars and amplifiers and Cornell adopted his &quot;seventies funk and R&amp;B-flavor vocals&quot;. He also cited Sly &amp; the Family Stone, James Brown and Funkadelic as influences on the funk overtones on the album.

Just as Rage Against the Machine did, Audioslave also included the statement &quot;All sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals&quot; in their albums&#x27; booklets as Morello&#x27;s guitar work often caused listeners to believe that the band used samples, synthesiser effects or different turntable techniques to produce certain sounds.

==Songwriting and recording process==
All of Audioslave&#x27;s lyrics were written by Cornell, while all four members—as a band—were credited with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as &quot;more collaborative&quot; and &quot;satisfying&quot; than Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s, which was &quot;a battle creatively&quot;. Cornell also felt the same way; he saw Soundgarden&#x27;s songwriting method inferior to Audioslave&#x27;s. Rick Rubin, producer of the band&#x27;s first two albums, was also lauded as &quot;a great collaborative partner&quot; and was likened to &quot;the fifth Beatle&quot; by Tom Morello. The time spent on songwriting by the band was always short. They wrote 21 songs in 19 days for the first album and exceeded that rate for the second album by having a song or sometimes two written every day. This method was adopted for the third album as well.

Cornell&#x27;s battle with drug addiction and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process of the debut album. He said he was &quot;never able to write effectively&quot; while drinking, and attended rehab after recording &quot;Audioslave&quot;. Although Morello stated that &quot;Revelations&quot; was &quot;the first record [Cornell] didn&#x27;t smoke, drink or take drugs through the recording,&quot; he later clarified his statement by saying: &quot;Chris was stone sober during the making of our &quot;Out of Exile&quot; album. Chris was also sober during the making of &quot;Revelations&quot; and prior to recording he gave up smoking as well.&quot;

==Politics==

In contrast to Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave&#x27;s music was mostly apolitical. Cornell stated he did not want to become the new singer of Rage Against the Machine or any political band, but he would play benefits the other band members wanted to play. Despite his reluctance to write political lyrics, he himself never discounted the possibility; he already touched upon political issues in &quot;Audioslave&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Set It Off&quot;—a song inspired by 1999&#x27;s WTO riots (the &quot;Battle of Seattle&quot;)—then later wrote an anti-war song, &quot;Sound of a Gun&quot;, and what Morello called &quot;the most political song Audioslave&#x27;s ever written,&quot; &quot;Wide Awake&quot; for &quot;Revelations.&quot; &quot;Wide Awake&quot; was an attack on the Bush administration&#x27;s perceived failures over the consequences of Hurricane Katrina.

The band was openly anti-Bush and against the Iraq War from the beginning; on March 17, 2003, only hours after President Bush announced plans to invade Iraq, the band performed live in Hollywood with messages reading &quot;How many Iraqis per gallon?&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Texas, a Village is Missing an Idiot,&quot; scrolled across the stage. The music video for &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Remind Me&quot; was also critical of the Iraq war. Wilk called Bush &quot;a fucking scam&quot; in an interview, criticizing the Bush administration&#x27;s rationale for war in Iraq.

During the time of the second album&#x27;s release, several politically charged Rage Against the Machine songs resurfaced in Audioslave&#x27;s live set. Although the members committed to not making political statements during their Cuba tour, Commerford stated in an interview that the concert made Audioslave more politically active than Rage Against the Machine ever was. While in Cuba, Cornell said that he takes &quot;every aspect of human life&quot; into consideration, when it comes to writing lyrics, and that he would write about the experience in a song, or more songs. This culminated in the political influences on &quot;Revelations&quot;, although he did not write about Cuba specifically. He asserted that he felt Audioslave can be a band like U2, which is &quot;not overtly political, but Bono gets a lot done.&quot; That year, the band played at two more concerts organized to raise political awareness: Live 8, which aimed to end global poverty, and the Hurricane Katrina benefit concert, ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief.

Audioslave was prominently involved in the Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization formed by Tom Morello and System of a Down&#x27;s Serj Tankian to &quot;bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice.&quot; Axis of Justice tents were set up at almost every Audioslave show, and with the exception of Commerford all band members appeared on the &quot;Concert Series Volume 1&quot; CD/DVD charity album released in 2004.

<doc id="195439" wikidata="Q1067721" url="?curid=195439" title="Odelay">
<text>Odelay is the fifth studio album by American musician Beck, released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records. The album featured several successful singles, including &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, &quot;Devils Haircut&quot;, and &quot;The New Pollution&quot;, and peaked at number sixteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of July 2008, the album had sold 2.3 million copies in the United States, making &quot;Odelay&quot; Beck&#x27;s most successful album to date. Since its release, the album has appeared in numerous publications&#x27; lists of the greatest of the 1990s and of all time.

==Recording==

The sessions for what would become &quot;Odelay&quot; originally began as a subdued, acoustic affair. In 1994, Beck started to record tracks for his follow-up to &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; with Bong Load producers Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf. Only the tracks &quot;Ramshackle&quot;, &quot;Feather in Your Cap&quot;, and &quot;Brother&quot; from these sessions have been released, all of which are acoustic, sparse, and melancholic. He would eventually abandon work with Rothrock and Schnapf, opting to work with the Dust Brothers instead. The Dust Brothers&#x27; production style was hip-hop-focused yet more layered; their résumé included notable work with Beastie Boys, Tone Lōc and Young MC.

==Title and artwork==
The title is a phonetic English rendering of the Mexican slang interjection &quot;órale&quot;, which translates roughly to &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;ok&quot;. The phrase &quot;odelay&quot; is repeated in the lyrics during the outro of the song &quot;Lord Only Knows&quot;. According to Stephen Malkmus, the title is a pun on &quot;Oh Delay&quot;, since the album took very long to record. The album&#x27;s cover is a photo of a Komondor, a rare Hungarian breed of dog with a heavy, corded coat, jumping over a hurdle. The original photo was shot by canine photographer Joan Ludwig (1914–2004) for the July 1977 issue of the American Kennel Club&#x27;s &quot;Gazette&quot;.

==Tour==
The promotional tour for the album began in May–June 1996, appearing in several record stores and radio stations in the U.S. Throughout the rest of the year followed numerous U.S. tours and European festival dates. 

As the tour continued into 1997, Beck began playing larger venues in America. The tour unofficially ended on September 5th, 1997, with a taped band performance at &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot; in New York, after over 150 shows from July &#x27;96 until September &#x27;97. 

It was on the &quot;Odelay&quot; tour that Beck earned a wide reputation as an energetic and impeccable performer, and his profile rose after multiple appearances on MTV, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, the 1997 Grammys, &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; and more.

==Deluxe edition==
On January 29, 2008, &quot;Odelay – Deluxe Edition&quot; was released. The two-disc set contains the original album, plus 19 B-sides, remixes and previously unreleased songs. The liner notes feature complete lyrics and artwork, as well as an essay from Thurston Moore and the transcript of 15 high school students interviewed by Dave Eggers.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Odelay&quot; received almost unanimous critical acclaim. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards in 1997, it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and won for Best Alternative Music Album, as well as Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;. &quot;Odelay&quot; was named Album of the Year in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, and &quot;NME&quot;″s annual critics poll.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine observed that, like &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;, &quot;Odelay&quot; incorporated elements from various genres, including &quot;folk and country, grungy garage rock, stiff-boned electro, louche exotica, old-school rap and noise rock.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield noted punk rock, bossa nova, Latin soul and mainstream R&amp;B as additional influences.

==Legacy==
In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;Odelay&quot; the 51st greatest album of all time. It was voted as one of the top 10 pop albums of the 1990s by the music writers of The Associated Press. It was ranked No. 16 in &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. The music website &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at No. 19 on their top 100 albums of the 1990s in 2003 and No. 93 in their updated Top 150 list in 2022. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album No. 306 in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2009, and later ranked it No. 424 in the 2023 edition, as well as No. 9 on its 2019 list of the 100 best albums of the &#x27;90s. Voters in Channel 4&#x27;s 2005 &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot; poll placed it at No. 73. 

In 2000, &quot;Odelay&quot; was ranked No. 54 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; in 2010.

<text>María Concepción Alonso Bustillo (born June 29, 1957), better known as María Conchita Alonso, is a Cuban-American actress, singer, and beauty pageant titleholder who represented Venezuela at Miss World 1975 and placed in the top seven. She is most known to international audiences for playing Amber Mendez in the 1987 action thriller &quot;The Running Man&quot;. 

She has participated in film and television productions, and was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award as Best Leading Actress in 1996 for her role in &quot;Caught&quot;. As a singer, she has received several gold and platinum records, and has been nominated for three Grammy Awards.

Alonso was the first Latin American actress not born in the United States to star in a musical on Broadway, with &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; at the Broadhurst Theatre (1995).

==Early life==
María Conchita Alonso was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba, on June 29, 1955, to Ricardo Alonso and Conchita Bustillo. Her family moved to Venezuela when she was five years old in 1962 after the Cuban Revolution. She was crowned Miss Teenager World in 1971. She was runner up for Miss Venezuela in 1975, and became a top seven runner-up in the Miss World pageant later that year, which was won by Puerto Rico&#x27;s Wilnelia Merced.

== Career ==

Alonso&#x27;s first gold album and number one song on the charts was &quot;Love Maniac&quot;, released in 1979 under the name Ámbar. After that followed her second number-one &quot;The Witch&quot; and soon after &quot;Dangerous Rhythm&quot;. For what is considered her best known song, she was asked by Giorgio Moroder to write the lyrics in Spanish and sing &quot;Vamos a Bailar&quot; which he had written for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Scarface&quot;. The song instantly became a classic among Spanish speakers, despite failing to garner major attention outside of Cuba where it was recorded. Her two albums with Ámbar and her solo debut were recorded in English. Her second album, &quot;María Conchita&quot;, in 1984, made her an international singing star in the Spanish-speaking market, and garnered her first of three Grammy Award nominations (1985, 1988, 1994).

Alonso sang the United States national anthem at the FIFA UNICEF charity match on July 27, 1986, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, in front of a crowd of 57,539. The game was between the “Rest of the World” and “The Americas” which featured Diego Maradona only one month after his successful 1986 World Cup win.

Alonso made her Hollywood film debut in &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; (1984) with Robin Williams, and also starred in &quot;Touch and Go&quot; (1986), &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot; (1987), &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), &quot;Colors&quot; (1988), &quot;Vampire&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1989), &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (1993).

In 1995, she became the first Latin-born actresses to star in a Broadway show, playing Aurora in &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;. She later acted in the romantic comedies &quot;Chasing Papi&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Last Guy on Earth&quot; (2006).

Alonso was cast to play Lucía, the mother of Gabrielle Solis, on the ABC series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. The episode aired on February 19, 2006. She was in the Latin version, &quot;Amas de Casa Desesperadas&quot;, for Univision Network. She was a guest star in the live-action film of the comic book &quot;El Muerto&quot; and appeared in the film &quot;Material Girls&quot; (2006).

Alonso hosted VH1&#x27;s &quot;¡Viva Hollywood!&quot; on April 13, 2008, with Carlos Ponce. She portrayed Sam in the werewolf horror film &quot;Wolf Moon&quot;, directed by Dana Mennie.

Alonso appeared in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;The Lords of Salem,&quot; released in 2013. Her latest film, a fantasy short titled &quot;The Secret of Joy&quot;, features her alongside fellow Venezuelan actor Carlos Antonio León, Spanish actress Laura Bayonas, and Brazilian actress Ana Carolina Da Fonseca in a story that aims to bring awareness about pediatric cancer.

== Political views ==
Alonso has often spoken in support of LGBT rights and in appreciation of her LGBT fans, stating, &quot;I was very much supported by the community when I first came out with my music&quot;. In a 2004 article, she compared herself to Cher in terms of her connection to LGBT culture.

Alonso was an outspoken critic of Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, whom she described as a &quot;dictator&quot;-like &quot;Hitler&quot; and whose voters and supporters she described as &quot;terrorists.&quot; She appeared on Sean Hannity&#x27;s &quot;Hannity&#x27;s America&quot; on May 6, 2007, &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; on June 1, 2007 and Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; on August 13, 2007, and March 11, 2009.

Alonso issued an &quot;Open Letter to Sean Penn&quot; (the two had played lovers in the 1988 movie &quot;Colors&quot;) online on March 29, 2010, regarding his support of Hugo Chávez. She used a point-by-point refrain of &quot;WHY&quot; in her letter questioning various issues occurring in Venezuela. In December 2011, she got into a heated exchange with Penn at a Los Angeles airport during which Penn called her a pig and she responded by calling Penn a communist.

In 2008, Alonso endorsed the US presidential campaign of Republican nominee John McCain, writing:

In an August 2012 Spreecast interview, Alonso stated her opposition to Obama&#x27;s re-election, saying that if reelected, he would take steps to make the United States become more like Venezuela under the Chávez government.

In January 2014, Alonso resigned from a San Francisco production of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; after appearing in an advertisement for Republican candidate for Governor Tim Donnelly.

In mid-2016, Alonso stated that she supported neither Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump nor Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election. Despite this, however, she would go on to support Trump and then endorse him in the 2020 presidential election.

<doc id="195442" wikidata="Q1785781" url="?curid=195442" title="MANIAC I">
<text>The MANIAC I (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer Model I) was an early computer built under the direction of Nicholas Metropolis at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. It was based on the von Neumann architecture of the IAS, developed by John von Neumann. As with almost all computers of its era, it was a one-of-a-kind machine that could not exchange programs with other computers (even the several other machines based on the IAS). Metropolis chose the name MANIAC in the hope of stopping the rash of silly acronyms for machine names, although von Neumann may have suggested the name to him.

The MANIAC weighed about .

The first task assigned to the Los Alamos MANIAC was to perform more precise and extensive calculations of the thermonuclear process. In 1953, the MANIAC obtained the first equation of state calculated by modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space.

In 1956, MANIAC I became the first computer to defeat a human being in a chess-like game. The chess variant, called Los Alamos chess, was developed for a 6×6 chessboard (no bishops) due to the limited amount of memory and computing power of the machine.

The MANIAC ran successfully in March 1952 and was shut down on July 15, 1958. However, it was
transferred to the University of New Mexico in bad condition, and was restored to full operation by Dale Sparks, PhD. It was featured in at least two UNM Maniac programming dissertations from 1963. It remained in operation until it was retired in 1965. It was succeeded by MANIAC II in 1957.

A third version MANIAC III was built at the Institute for Computer Research at the University of Chicago in 1964.

==Notable MANIAC programmers==
* Mary Tsingou – developed algorithm used in the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem
* Klara Dan von Neumann – wrote the first programs for MANIAC I
* Dana Scott – programmed the MANIAC to enumerate all solutions to a pentomino puzzle by backtracking in 1958.
* Marjorie Devaney – one of the first MANIAC I programmers.
* Arianna W. Rosenbluth – wrote the first full implementation of the widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
* Paul Stein and Mark Wells – implemented Los Alamos chess.

<doc id="195445" wikidata="Q68456" url="?curid=195445" title="French language in the United States">
<text>The French language is spoken as a minority language in the United States. Roughly 1.18 million Americans over the age of five reported speaking the language at home in the federal 2020 American Community Survey, making French the seventh most spoken language in the country behind English, Spanish (of which it is the second Romance language to be spoken after the latter), Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Arabic. 
Several varieties of French evolved in what is now the United States:
*Acadian French, spoken in Northern Maine by descendants of colonists in Acadia
*Louisiana French, spoken in Louisiana by descendants of colonists in French Louisiana
*New England French, spoken in New England by descendants of 19th and 20th-century Canadian migrants
*Missouri French, spoken in Missouri by descendants of French settlers in the Illinois Country
*Muskrat French, spoken in Michigan by descendants of habitants, voyageurs and coureurs des bois in the Pays d&#x27;en Haut
*Métis French, spoken in North Dakota by Métis people

More recently, French has also been carried to various parts of the nation via immigration from Francophone countries and regions. Today, French is the second most spoken language (after English) in the states of Maine and Vermont. French is the third most spoken language (after English and Spanish) in the states of Louisiana, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

As a second language, French is the second most widely taught foreign language (after Spanish) in American schools, colleges and universities. While the overwhelming majority of Americans of French ancestry grew up speaking only English, some enroll their children in French heritage language classes.

==Dialects and varieties==
There are three major groups of French dialects that emerged in what is now the United States: Louisiana French, Missouri French, and New England French (essentially a variant of Canadian French).

Louisiana French is traditionally divided into three dialects, Colonial French, Louisiana Creole French, and Cajun French. Colonial French is traditionally said to have been the form of French spoken in the early days of settlement in the lower Mississippi River valley, and was once the language of the educated land-owning classes. Cajun French, derived from Acadian French, is said to have been introduced with the arrival of Acadian exiles in the 18th century. The Acadians, the francophone inhabitants of Acadia (modern Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and northern Maine), were expelled from their homeland between 1755 and 1763 by the British. Many Acadians settled in lower Louisiana, where they became known as Cajuns (a corruption of &quot;Acadians&quot;). Their dialect was regarded as the typical language of white lower classes, while Louisiana Creole French developed as the language of the black community. Today, most linguists regard Colonial French to have largely merged with Cajun, while Louisiana Creole remains a distinct variety.

Missouri French was spoken by the descendants of 17th-century French settlers in the Illinois Country, especially in the area of Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and in Washington County. In the 1930s there were said to be about 600 French-speaking families in the Old Mines region between De Soto and Potosi. By the late 20th century the dialect was nearly extinct, with only a few elderly speakers able to use it. Similarly, Muskrat French is spoken in southeastern Michigan by descendants of &quot;habitants&quot;, &quot;voyageurs&quot; and &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; who settled in the Pays d&#x27;en Haut.

New England French, essentially a local variety of Canadian French, is spoken in parts of the New England states. This area has a legacy of significant immigration from Canada, especially during the 19th and the early 20th centuries. Some Americans of French heritage who have lost the language are currently attempting to revive it. Acadian French is also spoken by Acadians in Maine in the Saint John Valley.

Métis French is spoken by some Métis people in North Dakota.

Ernest F. Haden identifies the French of Frenchville, Pennsylvania as a distinct dialect of North American French. &quot;While the French enclave of Frenchville, Pennsylvania first received attention in the late 1960s, the variety of French spoken has not been the subject of systematic linguistic study. Haden reports that the geographical origin of its settlers is central France, as was also the case of New Orleans, but with settlement being more recent (1830–1840). He also reports that in the 1960s French seemed to be on the verge of extinction in the state community.&quot;

Brayon French is spoken in the Beauce of Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick; and Madawaska, Maine mostly in Aroostook County, Maine. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is morphosyntactically identical to Quebec French. It is believed to have resulted from a localized levelling of contact dialects between Québécois and Acadian settlers. Some of the Brayons view themselves as neither Acadian nor Québécois, affirming that they are a distinctive culture with a history and heritage linked to farming and forestry in the Madawaska area.

Canadian French spoken by French Canadian immigrants is also spoken by Canadian Americans and French Canadian Americans in the United States across Little Canadas and in many cities of New England. French Canadians living in Canada express their cultural identity using a number of terms. The &quot;Ethnic Diversity Survey&quot; of the 2006 Canadian census found that French-speaking Canadians identified their ethnicity most often as French, French Canadians, Québécois, and Acadian. The latter three were grouped together by Jantzen (2006) as &quot;French New World&quot; ancestries because they originate in Canada.
All these ancestries are represented among French Canadian Americans. Franco-Newfoundlanders speaking Newfoundland French, Franco-Ontarians, Franco-Manitobans, Fransaskois, Franco-Albertans, Franco-Columbians, Franco-Ténois, Franco-Yukonnais, Franco-Nunavois are part of the French Canadian American population and speak their own form of French.

Various dialects of French spoken in France are also spoken in the United States by recent immigrants from France, by people of French ancestry and descendants of immigrants from France.

== Native speaker populations ==
===French ancestry===
A total of 10,804,304 people claimed French ancestry in the 2010 census although other sources have recorded as many as 13 million people claiming this ancestry. Most French-speaking Americans are of this heritage, but there are also significant populations not of French descent who speak it as well, including those from Belgium, Switzerland, Haiti and numerous Francophone African countries.

===Newer Francophone immigrants===
In Florida, the city of Miami is home to a large Francophone community, consisting of French expatriates, Haitians (who may also speak Haitian Creole, a separate language which is derived partially from French), and French Canadians; there is also a growing community of Francophone Africans in and around Orlando and Tampa. A small but sustaining French community that originated in San Francisco during the Gold Rush and was supplemented by French wine-making immigrants to the Bay Area is centered culturally around that city&#x27;s French Quarter.

In Maine, there is a recent increase of French speakers due to immigration from Francophone countries in Africa.

===Francophone tourists and retirees===
Many retired individuals from Quebec have moved to Florida, or at least spend the winter there. Also, the many Canadians who travel to the Southeastern states in the winter and spring include a number of Francophones, mostly from Quebec but also from New Brunswick and Ontario. Quebecers and Acadians also tend to visit Louisiana, as Quebec and New Brunswick share a number of cultural ties with Louisiana.

===Seasonal migrations===
Florida, California, New York, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Hawaii, and a few other popular resort regions (most notably Old Orchard Beach, Maine, Kennebunk and Kennebunkport, Maine and Cape May, New Jersey) are visited in large numbers by Québécois, during winter and summer vacations.

==Language study==
French has traditionally been the foreign language of choice for English-speakers across the globe. However, after 1968, French has ranked as the second-most-studied foreign language in the United States, behind Spanish. Some 1.2 million students from the elementary grades through high school were enrolled in French language courses in 2007–2008, or 14% of all students enrolled in foreign languages.

Many American universities offer French-language courses, and degree programs in the language are common. In the fall of 2021, 135,088 American university students were enrolled in French courses, or 11.4% of all foreign-language students and the second-highest total of any language (behind Spanish, with 584,453 students, or 49.4%).

French teaching is more important in private schools, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data because of the optional status of languages. Indeed, the study of a foreign language is not required in all states for American students. Some states, however, including New York, Virginia and Georgia, require a minimum of two years of study of a foreign language.

<text>Over 50 million Americans claim German ancestry, which made them the largest single claimed ancestry group in the United States until 2020.

===German-language Methodist Church===

From the middle of the 19th century, English was used as a second language in the churches, but there were regions in which German was the main church language into the 20th century. In 1937 both churches fused and joined the United Methodist Church in 1968.

===German-language press===
The first German newspaper in the U.S. was (&quot;the High German-Pennsylvanian story-writer, or collection of important news from the realms of nature and the church&quot;), later known as

. It was a German-language paper, &quot;&quot; that on July 5, 1776, was the first paper to report the American Declaration of Independence, and it did so in German translation. English readers would have to wait a day later to read the English text in &quot;The Pennsylvania Evening Post&quot;.

In the 19th century, the German press increased in importance and the number of dailies exploded. In 1909 a report stated &quot;every American city or town with a large German population possesses one or more German newspapers. In New York City there are twelve or more... the best... being... the &quot;New Yorker Staats-Zeitung&quot;. The Illinois Staats-Zeitung has nearly as large a circulation, and the Milwaukee &quot;Germania&quot; claims the largest circulation of all. The &quot;Milwaukee Herold&quot; comes not far behind. Philadelphia has its , Baltimore its &quot;Correspondent&quot;, Cincinnati its , St. Louis... its... , where Joseph Pulitzer started his career, and .&quot; It also reported that compared to 17,194 English papers in the U.S. in 1900, there were 613 German ones. The next largest language group, the Scandinavian, had only 115.

With the repression of the German language during World War I, the German press in America was reduced dramatically.

===German language in public education===
Throughout much of the 19th century, there were fierce debates in many large American metropolitan areas with German immigrant communities, such as Chicago and St. Louis to determine whether public schools should offer German-language education. The issue was of considerable local interest, as German-speaking families overwhelmingly sent their children to parochial schools at which instruction was conducted in German. In some German immigrant neighborhoods in Chicago, public school attendance was so low that the press reported the institutions as being practically empty. The decision of the Chicago Public Schools to make English the sole language of instruction in the city&#x27;s schools sparked outrage from the city&#x27;s German community. Hermann Raster, the Republican editor-in-chief of the &quot;Illinois Staats-Zeitung,&quot; and the Socialist politician Adolph Douai strongly opposed the new rule, and both became known as vocal critics of enforcing English-only education in the United States.

===Persecution during World War I===

When the U.S. joined in World War I, an anti-German hysteria quickly spread in American society. German-Americans, especially immigrants, were blamed for military acts of the German Empire, and even speaking German was seen as unpatriotic. Many German-American families anglicized their names (e.g. from to &quot;Smith&quot;, to &quot;Taylor&quot;, to &quot;Miller&quot;), and German nearly disappeared in public in many cities. In the countryside, the presence became quieter but persevered particularly in regions of many Germans. Many states otherwise forbade the use of German in public and the teaching of German in schools.

During the early 20th century, as influential White Anglo-Saxon Protestants in the United States sought to regain the upper hand of power and social influence, which had been heavily threatened by the waves of immigration, used politics and through the funded formation of the Ku Klux Klan, would help to give rise to anti-immigrant and distrust aimed at German-Americans among other groups of people. Through advertising and government-funded marketing, German-Americans also known as the &quot;Dutchman,&quot; and the German language quickly went from being viewed as distinguished and the language of the educated to being distrusted, and as such, anyone fluent in the language regardless of age associated with or who practiced traditions viewed as foreign of any type was subject to several public harassments, distrust, and on a few occasions, death.

One such death of note was that of Robert Prager, a German seeking naturalization in St. Louis, Missouri, who was accused on the night of April 14, 1914, of being a German spy by a mob of 300 &quot;men and boys&quot; after he had allegedly shared words at a socialist meeting earlier that evening. The jail into which he had taken refuge from the crowds was quickly overrun and being stripped of his clothes, he was led down Main Street with a rope tied around his neck and was forced to walk the route. With shattered glass bottles being thrown down in his walking path, he was forced to sing patriotic songs. He was forced during this walk to kiss an American flag which had been wrapped around him. He was walked to a hanging tree at the edge of town where he was lynched. In an article from &quot;The St. Louis Global-Democrat,&quot; it was reported that there had been multiple incidences of mobs tarring and feathering individuals.

Other acts of discrimination based on ethnic background included the banning of performing of music from German composers at symphony concerts including the attempt to rename certain foods. Sauerkraut for example would become Liberty Cabbage. &quot;Hamburger&quot; would be for a short while &quot;Liberty Steaks.&quot;Language use had also been the primary focus of legislation at state and local levels. Some of these regulations included the publication of charters banning speaking German within city limits. A total ban on the teaching of German in both public and private education could be found in at minimum 14 states, including some states that would extend this to ban the teaching of all languages except for English, although the majority would ban non-English languages typically only banned German. A total ban on teaching German in both public and private schools was imposed for a time in at least 14 states, including California, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Nebraska. California&#x27;s ban lasted into the mid-1920s. The Supreme Court case in &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot; ruled in 1923 that these laws were unconstitutional. In October 1918, a bill intended to restrict federal funds towards states that enforced English-only education was created. On April 9, 1919, Nebraska enacted a statute called &quot;An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska,&quot; commonly known as the Siman Act. It provided that &quot;No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language.&quot; It forbade foreign instruction to children who had not completed the eighth grade. In Montana, speaking German was banned in public for two years during World War I. Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislature passed a German-language ban, but it was vetoed by the governor. Churches during this period such as the Lutheran Church became internally divided over services and religious instruction in German and English.
Closely related to the forced decline of German is the near default of the American war loans to the Triple Entente resulting in the introduction of the first to the fourth Liberty Bonds by the Federal Reserve. After March 1918, the Federal Reserve Bank started to use dozens of mobile &quot;war exhibits&quot; stationed on trains that drove through the US to sell &quot;liberty bonds.&quot; Newspapers of the time have stories of harassment of &quot;slackers,&quot; who were forced to buy bonds and burn German books during the exhibition. 
* &quot;Special Trains to Show War Exhibits.F. P. Clayton, of the publicity department of the Federal Reserve Bank, has received a wire from J. W.Hoopes, executive manager of the campaign, who Is now in Washington, saying that he has secured for use in the 11th federal District two special trains which will carry actual war exhibits from the battlefields of Europe. It Is hoped that the trains will be accompanied by officers who have seen actual service. These trains will stop at places, the names of which will be announced later and speeches will be made from the cars.&quot;
* &quot;During the visit of a war exhibit train yesterday at Mountain Grove a huge bonfire was made by the pupils of the high schools there into which was thrown every German textbook used In the school During the burning the fire whistles blew and the church bells rang ...&quot;

==Dialects and geographic distribution==
It should be mentioned at this time that the dialects presented below are only partials to the whole dialectal picture of the stratum of German dialects spoken in the US.

===Alsatian===

Alsatian, (), is a Low Alemannic German dialect spoken by Old Order Amish and some Old Order Mennonites in Allen County, Indiana, and their daughter settlements. These Amish immigrated to the US in the mid-1800s. There are fewer speakers of Alsatian in Indiana than of Bernese German, even though there are several thousand speakers. There are also speakers of Bernese German and Pennsylvania German living in the community. Most speakers of Alsatian also speak or at least understand Pennsylvania German. Speakers of Alsatian in Indiana are thus exposed to five languages or dialects: Alsatian, Bernese German, Pennsylvania German, Standard German and English.

===Amana===

Amana German, West Central German, a Hessian dialect in particular, is still spoken by several hundred people in seven villages in the Amana Colonies in Iowa, which were founded by Inspirationalists of German origin. Amana German is derived from Hessian dialects which fused into a so-called &quot;Ausgleichsdialekt&quot; that adopted many English words and some English idioms.

===Bernese===

Bernese German, (Standard German: &quot;Berndeutsch&quot;, ) is a subdialect of High Alemannic German which is spoken by Old Order Amish in Adams County, Indiana, and their daughter settlements. There are several thousand speakers of the dialect in the US.

A link to an interview on YouTube featuring Berndeutsch from Indiana can be found in the citation below.

===Hutterite===

Hutterite communities in the United States and Canada speak Hutterite German, an Austro-Bavarian dialect. Hutterite is spoken in the U.S. states of Washington, Montana, North and South Dakota, and Minnesota; and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

===Indiana===
There is also a significant population of Amish and Old Order Mennonites located in rural areas of Elkhart County and LaGrange County, Indiana, who speak Pennsylvania Dutch. A much smaller community of Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking Amish is found in Parke County, in western Indiana. Many English words have become mixed with this dialect and it is quite different from Standard German (), but quite similar to the dialect of the Palatinate region.

Usually, Pennsylvania Dutch (often just &quot;Dutch&quot; or ) is spoken at home, but English is used when interacting with the general population. The Amish and Old Order Mennonites of northern Indiana often differentiate between themselves and the general population by referring to them, respectively, as the &quot;Amish&quot; and the &quot;English.&quot; Pennsylvania &quot;Dutch&quot; is sometimes used in worship services, though this is more common among the Amish than the Mennonites. More mainstream (city) Mennonites may have a working knowledge of the language, but it is not frequently used in conversation or in worship services.

===Pennsylvania===

Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites and other Pennsylvania Germans speak a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania German, widely called &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot;, where &quot;Dutch&quot; is used in its archaic sense, thus not limited to Dutch but including all variants of German. It is a remnant of what was once a much larger German-speaking area in eastern Pennsylvania. Most of the &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; originate from the Palatinate area of Germany and their language is based on the dialect of that region. While the language is stable among the Old Orders and the number of speakers growing due to the high birth rate among the Old Orders, it is quickly declining among the non-plain Pennsylvania Germans (also called Fancy Dutch).

===Plautdietsch===

Plautdietsch, a Low German dialect, is spoken and most often associated with &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites who immigrated mostly to Kansas in the mid-1870s. These Mennonites also found in Canada tended to slowly assimilate into the mainstream society over several generations, but Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonite immigrants—mainly from Mexico, where there is lesser to no assimilation—brought Plautdietsch back to Kansas. Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonite migrants from Mexico formed a new settlement in Seminole, Texas, in 1977. In 2016 there were about 6,000 Plautdietsch speakers around Seminole.

===Texas===

A dialect called Texas German based in the Texas Hill Country still exists but has been dying out since the end of World War II. Following the introduction of English-only schooling during both World Wars, Texas German speakers drifted towards English and few passed the language to their descendants.

===Wisconsin===

The various German dialects that were brought to Wisconsin did not develop into a leveled dialect form, like, e.g., in southeastern Pennsylvania, where Pennsylvania German as a leveled dialect emerged, but remained distinct.

In the link provided, an archive of Wisconsin German field recordings can be found on the Datenbank für Gesprochenes Deutsch hosted by the Leibniz Institut für Deutsche Sprache. Other field recordings can be found at the Max Kade Institute as well.

==German as the official U.S. language myth==
An urban legend, sometimes called the Muhlenberg legend after Frederick Muhlenberg, states that English only narrowly defeated German as the U.S. official language. In reality, the proposal involved a requirement that government documents be translated into German. The United States has no statutory official language; English has been used on a &quot;de facto&quot; basis, owing to its status as the country&#x27;s predominant language.

In Pennsylvania, which had a large German-American population, German was long permitted as a language of instruction in public schools. State documents were available in German until 1950. As a result of widespread anti-German sentiment during World War I, German fluency decreased from one generation of Pennsylvanians to the next, and today only a small fraction of its residents of German descent are fluent in the German language.

Texas had a large German population from the mid-1840s onward due to the Adelsverein. After Texas was granted statehood in 1845, it required that all laws be officially translated into German. This remained in force until 1917, when the United States entered the First World War.

==German-American tradition in literature==
As cultural ties between Germany and the United States have been historically strong, a number of important German and U.S. authors have been popular in both countries. In modern German literature, this topic has been addressed frequently by the Boston-born author of German and English lyrical poetry Paul-Henri Campbell.

==Use in education==
According to a government-financed survey, German was taught in 24% of American schools in 1997, and only 14% in 2008.

German is third in popularity after Spanish and French in terms of the number of colleges and universities offering instruction in the language.

===Structure of German Language Acquisition by state===

== American German ==

=== Standard American German ===
What here is referred to as Standard American German is a mix of historical words, English loan words, and new words which together are found in the German language used by non-Amish nor Mennonite descendants. The study of the German language in the United States was suppressed during World War I, but has since regained coverage by major universities, most notedly at the University of Kansas from scholars such as William Keel, the Max-Kade Institute of German-American Studies of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and George J. Metcalf from the University of Chicago. While towns may have differing grammatical structures and sometimes pronunciations as influenced by the first immigrant families, their regions, and consequent contact with English, there is no set in stone official grammatical syntax of the American German variety of German and so when taught, that of standard German from Germany is used. Despite the lack of such stabilized syntax, communication is still possible. One speaker might recognize however, that another may be from another community, town, or area.

=== Selected phrases ===


== General American German nouns==
These nouns have been found in all regions of the United States and are not exclusive to any particular region. Some English loanwords are found via cultural diffusion with English speaking populations and often were introduced given the lack of certain objects (ie. &quot;der&quot; &quot;Truck)&quot; in pre-20th century German. Dialect leveling is also found throughout regions where German is still found. Though previous studies have tried to pinpoint certain words to specific locations such as &quot;Stinkkatze&quot; with Texas German dialects, further research has since found these words in use extending beyond their originally perceived regions. For example the following varieites of &quot;Stinkkatze / Stinkkatz&#x27; / Stinkkotz / Stinkchaatz&quot; &quot;(Swiss-German speaking communities)&quot; have been found in many midwestern states spanning to Texas. 


=== General American German verbs ===

Throughout the history of the German language in the United States, through the coexistence with English, there are many loanwords which have been absorbed into the American variety of German. There are also many usages which have been preserved in American German varieties including usages from the numerous dialects of the German regions. This preservation is a common phenomenon that occurs when a language leaves its original region: While the language in the original country moves forward, words and meanings in the new region freeze and often do not change along with the mother country. 
=== North Dakota German samples ===
The story of the generally studied North Dakota German originates in southern central Germany. The ancestors of these Germans, also known as Volga Germans, had relocated to Russia in 1763 under invitation by Catherine the Great and organized over one hundred colonies which lined the Volga River near present-day Saratov. By 1884, many of these German-Russians began their journey to present-day North Dakota, and primarily chose to settle in the south-central part of the state. Settlements, as per ethnic tradition in Russia, were often based on &quot;common religious affiliation.&quot;
German-Russian Protestants traditionally are the hegemonic group within McIntosh County and the eastern half of Logan County.
German-Russian Catholics traditionally are the hegemonic group within southern Emmons County and branch into western Logan County.
The dialects of these immigrants, alongside cultural differences among the sub-ethnic groups of the &quot;Volga Germans&quot; are today often marked by small differences in meaning, word usage, and sometimes pronunciation which reflects the original regions of Germany from where many of the individuals of this ethnic group have their origins. The dialects of southern Germany often are tied together with shared meanings, sounds, and grammars, though remain distinct in syntax and grammatical pattern and often individual word definitions. Therefore, when studying transcriptions, some varieties of North Dakota German may be understood by Pennsylvania Amish German speakers due to similarities, yet understanding is achievable from general dialect speakers or those familiar with southern German dialects. Though each respective member can establish communication with his own ethnic group&#x27;s dialect or his town&#x27;s dialect, neither dialect is the same.

Sample 2

=== Missouri German samples ===
Over the years, Missouri became a state full of German enclaves. 
In 1837 along the Missouri River, School Teacher George Bayer, a German of Philadelphia, traveled to Missouri and purchased 11,000 acres of land. When the first 17 settlers arrived on the newly purchased land, what would become Hermann, Missouri, the land terrain was unexpectedly unsuitable for a town. According to local legend and what could serve as a study for anthropological researchers into the ethnic characteristics of the Low Germans and other German ethnicities, the survival of this town is credited to German ethnic characteristic of perseverance and hard work.
While Hermann German is a recognized form of German, other German settlements and German American farms where German was and is spoken can still be found to this day. This form of Saxon from the dialect of the region of Hannover, Germany can still be heard in pockets surrounding St. Louis, Missouri and in other reaches of the state.
Sample 2 (Conversational Saxon)St. Genevieve, Missouri has also been the site of massive historic immigrant in-moving. The main groups of historic mention are the French-Americans of the area and migrants from Baden-Württemberg. The migrations of the latter occurred primarily in the later decades of the 19th century. In recent years, the preserved alemannic dialect in the town of New Offenburg was recorded in the documentary film “New Offenburg.”
Sample 3 (Conversational New Offenburg Alemannic German)&quot;In de Morga, well all de do um mi... mi... mi Pecanbaum, [a Eichhos&#x27;] ist gsucht gang hette und het a Pecan gessa. Des woar boutta halb Stunde zuruck - a roder Eichhos&#x27;.&quot;

*Informant 2: &quot;Er het a groasse Booch&quot;

<text>Fight for Your Mind is the second album by Ben Harper. Released on August 1, 1995, it was his last solo album before adding the Innocent Criminals to his line-up. Reviews were generally very positive, praising Harper&#x27;s fusion of multiple genres, from folk (&quot;Another Lonely Day&quot;), folk rock (&quot;Gold to Me&quot;), and politically charged reggae (&quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot;).

After Harper&#x27;s well-received debut, &quot;Welcome to the Cruel World&quot;, he expanded on his fanbase by touring relentlessly with jam bands like Dave Matthews Band. On this, his second album, Harper added a more refined sense of his own intense spirituality, such as on the gospel-influenced album closers, &quot;Power of the Gospel&quot;, &quot;God Fearing Man&quot; and &quot;One Road to Freedom&quot;.

==Artwork==
The album cover features Harper&#x27;s face on fire, as the artwork features the use of military roundels from African nations (plus Jamaica) to represent each track on the album. The track corresponding to each roundel is:
*Angola – &quot;Oppression&quot; 
*Cameroon – &quot;Ground on Down&quot;
*Central African Republic – &quot;Another Lonely Day&quot;
*Chad – &quot;Please Me Like You Want To&quot;
*Uganda – &quot;Gold to Me&quot;
*Jamaica – &quot;Burn One Down&quot;
*Egypt – &quot;Excuse Me Mr&quot;
*Niger – &quot;People Lead&quot;
*Ghana/Guinea – &quot;Fight for Your Mind&quot;
*Kenya – &quot;Give a Man a Home&quot;
*Nigeria – &quot;By My Side&quot;
*Somalia – &quot;Power of the Gospel&quot;
*Ivory Coast – &quot;God Fearing Man&quot;
*Ethiopia – &quot;One Road to Freedom&quot;

Harper has continued to use roundel-inspired artwork on his other albums.

<text>WEIZAC (&quot;Weizmann Automatic Computer&quot;) was the first computer in Israel, and one of the first large-scale, stored-program, electronic computers in the world.

It was built at the Weizmann Institute during 1954–1955, based on the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) architecture developed by John von Neumann and was operational until the end of 1963. WEIZAC was widely used by Israeli scientists and researchers and helped with the advancement of science and technology in the young nation.

As with all computers of its era, it was a one of a kind machine that could not exchange programs with other computers (even other IAS machines).

==The beginning==

The WEIZAC project was initiated by Prof. Chaim L. Pekeris, who worked at the IAS at the time von Neumann&#x27;s IAS machine was being designed. Chaim Weizmann, Israel&#x27;s future first president, asked Pekeris to establish the Department of Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute, and Pekeris wanted to have a similar computer available there. Pekeris wanted it as means to solve Laplace’s tidal equations for the Earth&#x27;s oceans, and also for the benefit of the entire scientific community of Israel, including the Defense Ministry.

In July 1947, an advisory committee for the Applied Mathematics Department discussed the plan to build the computer. Among the committee&#x27;s members were Albert Einstein, who did not find the idea reasonable, and John von Neumann, who supported it. In one conversation, von Neumann was asked: &quot;What will that tiny country do with an electric computer?&quot; He responded: &quot;Don’t worry about that problem. If nobody else uses the computer, Pekeris will use it full time!&quot;

In the end, a decision was made to proceed with the plan. Chaim Weizmann assigned US$50,000 for the project (), which was 20% of the Weizmann Institute total budget.

In 1952, Gerald Estrin, a research engineer from the von Neumann project, was chosen to lead the project. He came to Israel along with his wife, Thelma, who was an electrical engineer and also involved in the project. They brought with them schematics, but no parts. Estrin later commented: &quot;As I look back now, if we had systematically laid out a detailed plan of execution we would probably have aborted the project.&quot; After arriving, Estrin&#x27;s impression was that besides Pekeris, other Israeli scientists thought it is ridiculous to build a computer in Israel.

To recruit skilled staff for the project, a newspaper advertisement was posted. Most of the applicants had no records of prior education because those were lost in the Holocaust or during immigration, but in Israel&#x27;s budding technical community everyone knew or knew about everybody else. The WEIZAC project also provided an opportunity for mathematicians and engineers to move to Israel without sacrificing their professional careers.

==Specifications==
WEIZAC was an asynchronous computer operating on 40-bit words. Instructions consisted of twenty bits: an eight-bit instruction code and twelve bits for addressing. Punched paper tape was used for I/O, and later, in 1958, magnetic tape. The memory was initially a magnetic drum containing 1,024 words which was later replaced with a much faster 4,096 word magnetic-core memory module.

In 1961, the memory was further expanded with two additional 4,096 word modules.

==Usage==
In late 1955, WEIZAC performed its first calculation. Subsequently, it was used to study problems like worldwide changes in tide, earthquakes, atomic spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, random walk methods, numerical analysis, and other problems. The computer found out that there was an amphidromic point in the South Atlantic at which the tide does not change. It also numerically calculated the eigenvalues of a two-electron atom quantum system based on programming by Yigal Accad who put Pekeris&#x27; development of the relevant equations into machine code. These results were later experimentally verified by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, confirming the correctness of Schrödinger&#x27;s Equations.

WEIZAC was kept constantly busy, and users (especially from other institutions) became increasingly frustrated with not being able to get computing time, and demanded more computers to become available. WEIZAC&#x27;s success led to the recognition of the demand for computers and digital technology in Israel, and ultimately, provided the foundation for Israel&#x27;s computer and technology industries.

==After WEIZAC==
Until 1961, WEIZAC was the only computer in the State of Israel. It operated until 29 December 1963 and was replaced by a commercially-built computer, a CDC 1604A. At the same time the institute&#x27;s staff began constructing the locally designed GOLEM – based on the ILLIAC II architecture, but with several improvements which resulted in significantly-reduced volume and power consumption.

==Recognition==
On 5 December 2006, WEIZAC was recognized by the IEEE as a milestone in the history of electrical engineering and computing, and the team who built it was awarded the &quot;WEIZAC Medal&quot;.

<text>Antonio Verrio (c. 1636 – 15 June 1707) was an Italian Baroque painter. He was responsible for introducing Baroque mural painting into England and served the Crown over a thirty-year period.

== Career ==

Verrio, born in Lecce, Kingdom of Naples, started his career in Lecce and was a pupil of Giovanni Andrea Coppola (1597–1659). Several works by Verrio still exist in the Apulian city, including &quot;S. Francesco Saverio appare al Beato Marcello Mastrilli&quot; – his first known signed work.

Around 1665, Verrio moved to the region of Toulouse where he was commissioned to decorate the Château de Bonrepos, the property of Pierre-Paul Riquet, promoter of the Canal du Midi. He then settled in Toulouse itself where he worked for the Carmes Déchaussées and the Capucins. Today two of his paintings, &quot;Le Mariage de la Vierge&quot; et &quot;Saint-Félix de Cantalice&quot;, are in the collection of the Musée des Augustins there. Around 1670, Verrio moved to Paris where he developed an aristocratic clientele and decorated three private houses including the hotel Brûlart – the only one that still exists today (in private hands).

In March 1672, Verrio crossed the Channel on the recommendation of Ralph Montagu, who had been English Ambassador Extraordinary in Paris since 1669. Thanks to Montagu, Verrio made his English debut working for aristocrats such as the 1st Earl of Arlington (Euston Hall and Arlington House, now destroyed) and the 1st Duke of Lauderdale (Ham House, now a property of The National Trust), and rapidly acquired the royal patronage of Charles II.

By 1675, Verrio had painted the exquisite allegorical portrait of the king known as &quot;The Sea Triumph of Charles II&quot;, and was &#x27;denizened&#x27; on 5 May of that year. Soon afterwards he was engaged to decorate the North Range of Windsor Castle, where he collaborated with the architect Hugh May and the sculptor Grinling Gibbons. This was the most important commission of his entire career: twenty ceilings, three staircases, the King&#x27;s Chapel and St George&#x27;s Hall for which he was paid the colossal sum of £10195 8s 4d. On its completion, in 1684, Verrio was appointed Chief First Painter. Only three ceilings have survived the redecoration of the castle commissioned by George IV during the 1820s.

On the succession of James II, Verrio continued his royal service and decorated Whitehall Palace (burnt in 1698) and Henry VIII&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor (destroyed). In March 1685, he was also appointed &quot;Keeper of the Great Garden in St James&#x27;s Park&quot;. At the Glorious Revolution, Verrio received no royal protection from William III and had to leave the court.

Verrio, who had worked for the nobility while he was employed by Charles and James, returned to his aristocratic clientele. He spent the next decade at Burghley House, the property of the 5th Earl of Exeter, and Chatsworth House, the property of the 4th Earl of Devonshire. Both are very fine examples of English Baroque decoration, and Burghley contains Verrio&#x27;s masterpiece, the Heaven Room. By 1699, William finally overrode the Test Act and invited Verrio back to court. After having worked at Windsor again, Verrio undertook the decoration of Hampton Court Palace for William. At his death, in 1702, Verrio continued his royal service and painted for Queen Anne his last royal commission in the Queen&#x27;s Drawing Room. In 1705, Verrio was granted by the queen an annual pension of £200 and allowed to keep his lodgings at Hampton Court. Before his death, on 15 June 1707, Verrio painted a series of portraits including his self-portrait, now in the National Portrait Gallery.

Verrio influenced younger artists such as Louis Laguerre and James Thornhill, and his Hampton Court Palace frescoes (now under the care of Historic Royal Palaces) constitute a priceless legacy.

== Verrio&#x27;s work ==
Verrio&#x27;s surviving decorative work in England and Wales can be seen at Burghley House, Chatsworth House, Reigate Priory, Royal Hospital Chelsea, Christ&#x27;s Hospital, Ham House, Hampton Court Palace, Moor Park, Powis Castle, Snape Castle (although in very bad condition) and Windsor Castle. Some of his paintings, sketches and drawings belong to various collections including the British Museum, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, National Portrait Gallery, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery, Royal Collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum. In France, his work can be seen in Toulouse at the musée des Augustins and at Saint Exupère&#x27;s church and in Paris, where he painted some of the vaults of the Hôtel Brûlart. In Italy, his paintings can be found in various churches and in the provincial museum of Lecce, his native city.

<doc id="195454" wikidata="Q15104428" url="?curid=195454" title="Amiskwia">
<text>Amiskwia is a genus of soft-bodied marine animals known from fossils of the Middle Cambrian Lagerstätten both in the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada and the Maotianshan shales of Yunnan Province, China. It is interpreted as a member of the clade Gnathifera &quot;sensu lato&quot; or as a basal cucullophoran.

== Etymology ==
The scientific name &quot;Amiskwia sagittiformis&quot; derives from the Cree &quot;amiskwi&quot;, &quot;beavertail&quot;, a name of various objects in Yoho National Park, and from the Latin &quot;sagitta&quot; (&quot;arrow&quot;) and &quot;formis&quot; (&quot;shape&quot;), in reference to the general appearance of the animal. &quot;Sinica&quot;, of &quot;A. sinica&quot;, refers to that species&#x27; origin from China.

== Description ==

Known specimens of &quot;Amiskwia&quot; vary in length from and in width from . The body was somewhat flattened. The head had a pair of tentacles that emerged from the midline of the head. The tentacles had a relatively thick base and tapered to a point. Along the sides of the trunk were a pair of lateral fins, which were around one third of the total body length. The trunk terminated with a flat, rounded caudal fin. The gut was straight, and ran from the mouth to the anus, which was located on the underside of the body near the caudal fin. Within the mouth is a pair of semi-circular structures, described as &quot;jaws&quot; each bearing 8-10 conical spikes, which increased in size away from the midline of the structure. Two other structures, dubbed the &quot;dorsal plate&quot; and &quot;ventral plate&quot;, are also present in the mouth.

== Phylogeny ==

The following dendrogram shows the evolutionary relationships of &quot;Amiskwia&quot; as in Park et al. 2024.


== Ecology ==
&quot;Amiskwia&quot; was likely a freely swimming (nektonic) organism that was either a predator or a scavenger.

== History of research ==
&quot;Amiskwia&quot; was originally categorized by paleontologist Charles Walcott. Walcott thought he saw three buccal spines in the fossils, and therefore categorized &quot;Amiskwia&quot; as a chaetognath worm (arrow worm). However, &quot;Amiskwia&quot; appears to lack the characteristic grasping spines and teeth of other Burgess fossil arrow worms. Later scientists suggested an affinity with the nemerteans (ribbon worms), but the evidence for this was somewhat inadequate. Conway Morris, on re-examining of the Burgess Shale fauna in the 1970s, described it as being the single known species in an otherwise unknown phylum, given that it has two tentacles near its mouth, rather than the characteristic single tentacle of true nemerteans. (Nemerteans do not have a single tentacle. However, a pair of antero-lateral tentacles is present in two of the many genera of pelagic nemerteans. Nemerteans do have a single eversible—normally internal—proboscis, which when everted could resemble an anterior median tentacle if fossilized. Whether retracted or everted, the proboscis is the only structure in pelagic nemerteans likely to fossilize, as it is the only structure with substantial connective tissue and muscle. The body wall has almost no muscle or connective tissue and is exceedingly unlikely to fossilize; hence, a pelagic nemertean fossil would be only the proboscis). Butterfield implies from the appearance of the fossils that the organisms may have lacked a cuticle: while this is also true of the nemerteans, these organisms lack a coelom and are thus unlikely to fossilise. He goes on to argue that the absence of cuticle is characteristic of the chaetognaths; whilst teeth would be expected, a similar fossil, &quot;Wiwaxia&quot;, shows such structures in only 10% of the expected instances, and anomalocaridids are often found detached from their mouthparts, so the absence may be taphonomic rather than genuine. The absence of spines could simply mean that the fossils represent young organisms — or that later chaetognath evolution involved paedomorphosis.

Two studies published in 2019 redescribed &quot;Amiskwia.&quot; Vinther and Parry (2019) argued that &quot;Amiskwia&quot; was a stem-group chaetognath, while Caron and Cheung (2019) suggested that the organism was a total group gnathiferan, based on the presence of gnathiferan-like jaws and ventral plates within the mouth. Its precise affinity within this group is difficult to resolve, they suggested that if it fell in the stem lineage of any extant phylum then it would be a gnathostomulid. A 2022 study supported a stem-chaetognath interpretation, suggesting that gnathiferan-like jaws were lost in the ancestor of chaetognaths. A 2024 study again supported a stem-chaetognath position.

<text>Dookie is the third studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on February 1, 1994, by Reprise Records. The band&#x27;s major label debut and first collaboration with producer Rob Cavallo, it was recorded in 1993 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Written mostly by the singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, the album is largely based on his personal experiences and includes themes such as boredom, anxiety, relationships, and sexuality. It was promoted with four singles: &quot;Longview&quot;, &quot;Basket Case&quot;, a re-recorded version of &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; (which originally appeared on the band&#x27;s second studio album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Kerplunk&quot;), and &quot;When I Come Around&quot;.

After several years of grunge&#x27;s dominance in popular music, &quot;Dookie&quot; brought a livelier, more melodic rock sound to the mainstream and propelled Green Day to worldwide fame. Considered one of the defining albums of the 1990s and of punk rock in general, it was also pivotal in solidifying the genre&#x27;s mainstream popularity. Its influence continued into the new millennium and beyond, being cited as an inspiration by many punk rock and pop-punk bands, as well as artists from other genres.

&quot;Dookie&quot; received critical acclaim upon its release, although some early fans accused the band of being sellouts for leaving its independent label (Lookout! Records) and embracing a more polished sound. The record won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards in 1995. It was a worldwide success, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and reaching top ten positions in several other countries. &quot;Dookie&quot; was later certified double diamond (20-times platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the band&#x27;s best-selling album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has been labeled by critics and journalists as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s and one of the greatest punk rock and pop-punk albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Dookie&quot; on all four iterations of its &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list, and at number 1 on its &quot;The 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums&quot; list in 2017. In 2024, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==

With the success in the independent world of the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;39/Smooth&quot; (1990) and &quot;Kerplunk&quot; (1991), which sold 30,000 units each, a number of major record labels became interested in Green Day. Among them were Sony, Warner Bros., Geffen and Interscope. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances; Armstrong believed that the labels were more than likely looking for something that resembled a grunge band, namely &quot;second- and third-rate Nirvanas and Soundgardens&quot;, and they did not want to conform to a label&#x27;s vision. That changed when they met the producer and A&amp;R representative Rob Cavallo of Reprise, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. The band played Beatles covers for him for 40 minutes, then Cavallo picked up his own guitar and jammed with them. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band the Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo &quot;was the only person we could really talk to and connect with&quot;.

Eventually, the band left their independent record label, Lookout! Records, on friendly terms. They signed a five-album deal with Reprise in April 1993. The deal secured Cavallo as the producer of the first record and allowed the band to retain the rights to its albums on Lookout!. Signing to a major label caused many of Green Day&#x27;s original fans to label them sell-outs, including the influential punk fanzine &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; and the independent music club 924 Gilman Street. After Green Day&#x27;s September 3 gig at 924 Gilman Street, the venue banned the group from entering or playing. Reflecting back on the period, the singer and guitarist, Billie Joe Armstrong, told &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 1999, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.&quot; The group returned in 2015 to play a benefit concert.

==Recording==

Following the band&#x27;s last Gilman Street performance, Green Day demoed the songs &quot;She&quot;, &quot;Sassafras Roots&quot;, &quot;Pulling Teeth&quot; and &quot;F.O.D.&quot; on Armstrong&#x27;s four-track tape recorder and sent it to Cavallo. After listening to it, Cavallo sensed that &quot;[he] had stumbled on something big.&quot; However, he recognized that the band members were struggling to play their best; he reasoned that they were anxious because the most time they had previously spent recording an album was three days while recording &quot;Kerplunk&quot;. To lighten the mood, he invited them to a Mexican restaurant and bar down the street from Fantasy Studios, even though the drummer Tré Cool was not of legal drinking age at the time. Armstrong confirmed the band&#x27;s anxiety in an interview years later, describing the group feeling &quot;like little kids in a candy store&quot; and fearing that the band would lose money on work being scrapped by the label for not meeting standards. Despite this, they focused on making the most of the new production resources at their disposal; unlike their previous albums where the band had to rush to complete them to save money, the band took their time to perfect the quality of their output. Armstrong noted that he learned &quot;how to dial in good sounds, get the best guitar tones. I was able to take a little time doing vocals.&quot;

Recording took place over the course of three weeks at Fantasy, and the album was mixed twice by Cavallo and the producer Jerry Finn. Though the band took their time to make a quality product as a whole, Armstrong&#x27;s vocals were still recorded very quickly; he recorded about 16 or 17 songs in two days, most of them in a single take. Armstrong said the band at first &quot;wanted it to sound really dry, the same way the Sex Pistols record or the early Black Sabbath records sounded&quot;, but the band found the result of this approach to be an unsatisfactory original mix. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Devonshire Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the remixing process, the band took to Music Grinder Studio in Los Angeles to re-record the tracks &quot;Chump&quot; and &quot;Longview&quot; as the original recordings had been &quot;plagued by an inordinate amount of tape hiss&quot;. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, &quot;Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it.&quot; Among the material recorded but not included on the album was &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot;, which would later be re-recorded for the band&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Nimrod&quot; and become a hit in its own right. The band also recorded new versions of the songs &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, &quot;2000 Light Years Away&quot; and &quot;Christie Rd.&quot; from their second album &quot;Kerplunk&quot; and &quot;409 in Your Coffeemaker&quot; from their second EP, &quot;Slappy&quot;, though only &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; would make it onto the final album.

==Writing and composition==
Much of &quot;Dookie&quot;″s content was written by Armstrong, except &quot;Emenius Sleepus&quot;, which was written by the bassist Mike Dirnt, and the hidden track, &quot;All by Myself&quot;, which was written by Tré Cool. The album touched upon various experiences of the band members and included subjects such as anxiety and panic attacks, masturbation, sexual orientation, boredom, mass murder, divorce, domestic abuse, and ex-girlfriends. &quot;PopMatters&quot; summarized the album&#x27;s theme as &quot;a record that speaks of the frustrations, anxieties, and apathy of young people&quot;. Stylistically, the album has been categorized primarily as punk rock, but also as pop-punk and as a &quot;power pop take&quot; on skate punk. Influences from the Ramones and the Sex Pistols were noted in Armstrong&#x27;s guitar technique throughout the album; he recorded the album almost entirely with his Fernandes Stratocaster, which he named &quot;Blue&quot;.

===Songs 1–7===
&quot;Dookie&quot; opens with &quot;Burnout&quot;, a &quot;speedy, antsy rocker&quot; centered around a central character&#x27;s feelings of general apathy toward life. Armstrong wrote the song &quot;Having a Blast&quot; when he was in Cleveland in June 1992. The song revolves around a mentally ill character who plans to use explosives to kill himself and others. This was not regarded as a serious issue at the time, as the social climate could allow the song to be viewed as &quot;mere cathartic fantasy&quot;, but later incidents such as the 1999 Columbine High School massacre have made the song the &quot;most uncomfortable track&quot; on the album. On &quot;Chump&quot;, Armstrong takes the perspective of someone who shows prejudice, insulting another person without actually knowing them. At the end of the song, it is revealed that the disliked person in question matches Armstrong&#x27;s description of himself. &quot;Chump&quot; is also the first of three songs that allude to Amanda, a former girlfriend of Armstrong&#x27;s. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Longview&quot;, had a signature bass line that Dirnt wrote while under the influence of LSD. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2002, Armstrong described the character in the song as based on himself when he lived in Rodeo, California: &quot;There was nothing to do there, and it was a real boring place.&quot; To entertain himself, the character does nothing but watch television, smoke marijuana, and masturbate, and has little motivation to change these habits despite tiring of the same cycle of behaviors.

&quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, the third single from &quot;Dookie&quot;, originally appeared on the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Kerplunk!&quot;. The song was written about Armstrong&#x27;s experiences living in bad neighborhoods around Oakland, California. &quot;Pulling Teeth&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s slower songs, uses dark humor about domestic violence. The typical victim and perpetrator are reversed; the male narrator is at the mercy of his female partner. The band&#x27;s inspiration for this song came from a pillow fight between Dirnt and his girlfriend that ended with the bassist breaking his elbow. The second single, &quot;Basket Case&quot;, which appeared on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong&#x27;s personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong&#x27;s anxiety attacks and feelings of &quot;going crazy&quot; before being diagnosed with a panic disorder. Using a palm mute, Armstrong is the only one who plays on the song until halfway through the song&#x27;s first chorus, with the other instruments&#x27; arrival representing panic setting in. In the third verse, &quot;Basket Case&quot; mentions soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong said, &quot;I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It&#x27;s also looking at the world and saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s not as black and white as you think. This isn&#x27;t your grandfather&#x27;s prostitute – or maybe it was.&#x27;&quot; The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution. It is one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs.

===Songs 8–14===
&quot;She&quot; was written about Amanda, who showed him a feminist poem entitled &quot;She&quot;. In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of &quot;She&quot; and showed them to her. When Amanda broke up with Armstrong in early 1994 and moved to Ecuador to join the Peace Corps, Armstrong decided to put &quot;She&quot; on the album. Musically, &quot;She&quot; is similar to &quot;Basket Case&quot;, although it is slightly faster, and draws inspiration from the Beatles. The song&#x27;s beginnings mirror those of &quot;Basket Case&quot;; whereas Armstrong was the only one to play as &quot;Basket Case&quot; began, Armstrong&#x27;s guitar does not enter until later in &quot;She&quot; while his bandmates provide a musical backdrop. The song tells the story of a young woman who feels trapped in an unsatisfactory life. Amanda is also referenced in the next track, &quot;Sassafras Roots&quot;. Sonically closer to the band&#x27;s material on &quot;Kerplunk!&quot;, it is an unconventional love song that uses irony and sarcasm in an effort to avoid being direct, and centers on a couple wasting time together in a romantic relationship. The tenth track, &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, was the album&#x27;s final single. It was inspired by Adrienne Nesser, Armstrong&#x27;s girlfriend and eventual wife. Following a dispute between the couple, Armstrong left Nesser to spend some time alone. Described as the closest thing to a ballad on the album, &quot;When I Come Around&quot; is driven by a recognizable two-bar, palm-muted guitar riff of four chords, while Dirnt&#x27;s bass part stands out by adding additional pulled-off and hammered-on portions to the guitar&#x27;s accompaniment. The song&#x27;s lyrics highlight two meanings of its title: the narrator begins by talking to someone they believe they could address the needs of, having literally come around; in the second verse, the singer realizes they aren&#x27;t what the other person needs, having &quot;come around&quot; figuratively.

The song &quot;Coming Clean&quot; deals with Armstrong&#x27;s coming to terms with his bisexuality as a teenager. At the time, he was still looking for himself sexually and had no well-defined sexual orientation. In his interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine, he said that although he has never had a relationship with a man, his sexuality has been &quot;something that comes up as a struggle in me&quot;. &quot;Emenius Sleepus&quot;, written by Dirnt, is about two old friends who meet by chance, and the narrator realizes that they have both changed a lot as people. Played in a quick staccato-styled rhythm, Armstrong wrote the song &quot;In the End&quot; about his mother and stepfather, and the reproach Armstrong felt toward his mother for choosing his stepfather as a partner. &quot;F.O.D.&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Fuck Off and Die&quot;, begins calmly with Armstrong alone on acoustic guitar, before the band suddenly arrives in a louder, full-force fashion. The theme of the song centers around the singer&#x27;s grudge for another individual, and wishing misfortune upon them.
A hidden track, &quot;All By Myself&quot;, with vocals and guitar by Cool, plays after &quot;F.O.D.&quot; ends, and is about masturbation.

==Packaging==
&quot;Dookie&quot; is American slang for feces. It is a reference to the diarrhea—&quot;liquid dookie&quot;—that the band members suffered while eating spoiled food on tour. Initially, the band aimed to name the album &quot;Liquid Dookie&quot;, but this was shortened to &quot;Dookie&quot;. Asked in 2014 if the choice was a mistake in hindsight, Armstrong said it had been an impulsive &quot;stoner thing&quot;: &quot;We were smoking a lot of weed [and said] &#x27;Hey, man, wouldn&#x27;t it be funny if...&#x27;&quot; 

For its cover art, the band commissioned artist Richie Bucher, who created a cartoon-like work depicting bombs being dropped on people and buildings. Bucher says Armstrong only told him the album&#x27;s title, so he worked around the theme of fecal matter. As a child, Bucher had associated feces with dogs and monkeys, both of which appear prominently on the album&#x27;s cover. 

The setting is a replica of Berkeley&#x27;s Telegraph Avenue. In the center, there is an explosion with the band&#x27;s name at the top. The cover depicts Patti Smith showing off her armpit as shown on the cover of her album &quot;Easter&quot; (1977), a shootout surrounding Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton, the woman on Black Sabbath&#x27;s self-titled debut album, Angus Young of AC/DC, and the Sather Tower. Friends of the band members are among the foreground figures on whom dogs and monkeys throw their excrement. A dog pilots the plane that drops bombs with the words Dookie written on them, while the name of the group is written in brown in the center of the explosion. Oil refineries in Rodeo, California, can be seen in the distance.

Armstrong has since explained the meaning of the artwork:

When the trio went to Warner&#x27;s offices in Los Angeles to discuss marketing for the album, label officials initially wanted the cover to feature a photograph of the comely young men, but the band refused. George Weiss, Warner&#x27;s marketing director, noted that the band came from a distinctly different culture than most of their artists, and Green Day had gained the leverage with the label to insist on a different choice. The back cover on early prints of the CD featured a plush toy of Ernie from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which was airbrushed out of later prints for fear of litigation; however, Canadian and European prints still feature Ernie on the back cover. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that &quot;Dookie&quot; was a child&#x27;s lullaby album or that the creators of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had sued Green Day.

==Release==

While rehearsing in the house they rented in Berkeley at the end of 1993 in anticipation of a tour for &quot;Dookie&quot;, the band was invited to the Warner offices in Los Angeles to discuss the marketing strategy around the album with Weiss. The latter expected to meet three scornful young men with reputations in punk music, when in reality the band members were intimidated to even be invited to the meeting. They discussed the first single, &quot;Longview&quot;, as well as projected goals for the album&#x27;s sales: Cavallo hoped to sell at least 200,000 units, while Cool looked higher toward 500,000. Demand was well underestimated; when &quot;Dookie&quot; was released on February 1, 1994, the album&#x27;s first 9,000 produced copies quickly sold out. &quot;Longview&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single simultaneously with the album. Despite promising demand from the quick depletion of the album&#x27;s initial supply, it initially resulted in modest total sales as strategies were adjusted to meet demand, and only after the music video for &quot;Longview&quot; debuted on MTV on February 22 did the album begin to attract stronger attention, first entering the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; rankings at number 127.

In March, the group made appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; and &quot;120 Minutes&quot; on &quot;MTV&quot;. Sales for &quot;Dookie&quot; rose greatly following these performances, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. The record became an international success as well; the album peaked in the top ten of the German, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch, Italian, Swedish, and Swiss charts, while it topped the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand charts. By June 14, &quot;Dookie&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold more than 500,000 copies in the United States. That month, an issue of &quot;Time&quot; hailed the album as a work creating an impact comparable to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991).

On August 1, &quot;Basket Case&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. The song&#x27;s music video quickly became an &quot;MTV&quot; staple. The following month, &quot;Longview&quot; was nominated in three categories at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. Green Day performed the unreleased song &quot;Armatage Shanks&quot; at the ceremony, which would later appear on their following album &quot;Insomniac&quot; (1995), but did not win any of the categories which they were nominated for. In October, Warner proposed &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; to be the third single, noting potential to make good sales. However, Armstrong refused because the song evoked a part of his life and he did not feel capable of promoting it with a music video. The song was ultimately only broadcast on the radio domestically, being met with great success despite not being sold to the public. An exclusive United Kingdom single release for the song did proceed on October 17. Near the end of 1994, Don Pardo invited the band to perform on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Ahead of the 37th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;When I Come Around&quot; was released to radio as the album&#x27;s final single in December 1994. The band had been nominated in four Grammy Award categories: Best Alternative Music Album, Best New Artist, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal with &quot;Basket Case&quot;, and Best Hard Rock Performance with &quot;Longview&quot;. They won only the former of the categories. In the meantime, &quot;When I Come Around&quot; had been quickly climbing the charts; it held the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Chart for seven weeks and peaked at number six of the Hot 100 Airplay chart, becoming the band&#x27;s most successful single from the album. Throughout the 1990s, &quot;Dookie&quot; continued to sell well, eventually receiving diamond certification from the RIAA in 1999, signifying ten million copies sold. By 2014, &quot;Dookie&quot; had sold over 20 million copies worldwide and remains the band&#x27;s best-selling album. By 2024, the RIAA had certified it 20× platinum — double diamond — for twenty million copies sold in the United States alone.

==Reception==

&quot;Dookie&quot; was released to critical acclaim. In early 1995, Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Punk turns into pop in fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and channel-surfing; apathy has rarely sounded so passionate.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Paul Evans described Green Day as &quot;convincing mainly because they&#x27;ve got punk&#x27;s snotty anti-values down cold: blame, self-pity, arrogant self-hatred, humor, narcissism, fun&quot;. Jesse Raub, writing for &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, praised &quot;Burnout&quot; for immediately opening with a &quot;huge, polished production value without abandoning their scrappy, loose punk playing&quot; which consistently shines through the rest of the album&#x27;s tracks. In a 20th anniversary retrospective review for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Chris Payne highlighted how Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;sugary, almost bubblegum choruses&quot; were unique for punk at the time, and forcefully brought mainstream attention to punk rock music.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Greg Kot was appreciative of the loudness and urgency in the album&#x27;s sound, detecting influences from the Who and the Zombies. &quot;NME&quot; showcased the record&#x27;s &quot;crashing drums&quot; and &quot;razor-wire guitars&quot;, concluding, &quot;being dumb has never been so much fun.&quot; A 2017 review from &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Marc Hogan summarized the album&#x27;s material as &quot;buzzing, hook-crammed tracks that acted like they didn&#x27;t give a shit&quot;, but resounded so well with its audience because in truth &quot;on a compositional and emotional level they were actually gravely serious,&quot; praising the album&#x27;s outlandish artwork for helping ease the tense nature of the music. Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, opined that &quot;punk lives, and these guys have the toons and sass to prove it to those who can live without,&quot; praising their themes of apathy, insanity, poverty, and &quot;the un-American way&quot;.

Neil Strauss of &quot;the New York Times&quot;, while complimentary of the album&#x27;s overall quality, followed up Pareles&#x27; review by noting that &quot;Dookie&quot;″s pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. The band did not respond initially to these comments, but later claimed that they were &quot;just trying to be themselves&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s our band, we can do whatever we want&quot;. Dirnt claimed that the follow-up album, &quot;Insomniac&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s most aggressive albums lyrically and musically, was the band releasing their anger at all the criticism and distaste from critics and former fans. On the other hand, Thomas Nassiff at Fuse cited it as the most important pop-punk album.

==Legacy==

Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie—&quot;along with the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot;, released two months later—has been credited for helping bring punk rock back into mainstream music culture. &quot;NME&quot; argues, &quot;&quot;Dookie&quot;″s success proved to record label, film and TV [executives] that the teen rock revolution they had been witnessing for much of the early &#x27;90s didn&#x27;t have to be all gloomy nihilism and angsty sonics. &quot;Dookie&quot; made rock fun again.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described &quot;Dookie&quot; as &quot;a stellar piece of modern punk that many tried to emulate but nobody bettered&quot;. On the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote that before its release &quot;rock meant grunge: heavy, monotonic, humorless, and bleak&quot;, but the lighter tone of &quot;Dookie&quot; changed the public&#x27;s general understanding of the term. It &quot;made the entire pop-punk movement possible...it shaped the way people looked, dressed, danced, and spent their summers. &quot;Odeley&quot; is fantastic. So is &quot;OK Computer&quot;. But neither record triggered the sort of commercial tsunami of compatriots and copycats that followed in &quot;Dookie&quot;″s wake.&quot; Berkeley-based Rancid was one of the first bands to capitalize on the hype created by Green Day and the Offspring with &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;, giving the new punk rock movement stability. In 2024, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Some critics claim that &quot;Dookie&quot; allowed numerous similar artists to enjoy long careers, including Rancid, New Found Glory, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, Blink-182, Simple Plan, and Yellowcard. Good Charlotte guitarist Billy Martin, Something Corporate frontman Andrew McMahon, and Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley all claim stylistic influence from the album. &quot;NME&quot; believes Blink-182&#x27;s &quot;Enema of the State&quot; (1999), Sum 41&#x27;s &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; (2001), My Chemical Romance&#x27;s &quot;The Black Parade&quot; (2006), and even Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;The Fame&quot; (2008) could not have been created without &quot;Dookie&quot;. Gaga has said that the album was the first she ever purchased.

In 2014, its twentieth anniversary, the album received several list accolades. In April 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at No. 1 on its &quot;1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative&#x27;s Greatest Year&quot; list, ahead of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; and Weezer&#x27;s self-titled debut. A month later, &quot;Loudwire&quot; placed &quot;Dookie&quot; at No. 1 on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Dookie&quot; at number thirteen in their list &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; that July. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited it as one of the greatest punk rock albums of all time in 2016, and &quot;NME&quot; ranked it as the 18th-best album of 1994, alongside &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; as a top-50 song for the year.

A 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of the album, released on September 29, 2023, includes outtakes, demos, and two live concert recordings. On October 9, 2024, the band announced &quot;Dookie Demastered&quot;, a collaboration with the Los Angeles–based art studio BRAIN where each song on the album was ported onto an &quot;obscure, obsolete and otherwise inconvenient&quot; format, such as a wax cylinder and a Teddy Ruxpin; those who won in a drawing would be eligible to purchase each item.

===Accolades===
&quot;Dookie&quot; has appeared on many prominent &quot;must have&quot; lists compiled by the music media, including:

==Live performances==

In mid-1993, while recording and mixing the album, Green Day opened for several Bad Religion concerts, allowing them to play new songs to a live audience. However, unlike their previous shows, the band was now playing before audiences of two to three thousand people. Two weeks after the release of &quot;Dookie&quot;, the band embarked on an international tour. In the United States, they traveled between shows in a bookmobile belonging to Tré Cool&#x27;s father. From late April to early June 1994, the band toured Europe, playing around 40 concerts in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The band&#x27;s popularity was still rising slowly when they arrived in Europe; in Belgium, the audience numbered about 200 people. Cavallo recorded a few performances during the tour, to show the three young men their evolution on stage, and for use as B-sides on later releases.

After the European tour, Armstrong proposed to Nesser after four years of on-and-off relationships. Because the tour prevented them from properly planning their wedding and their honeymoon, the two married in a small ceremony on July 2, 1994, attended only by Green Day&#x27;s two other members and their girlfriends. Adrienne discovered she was pregnant the next day, and Armstrong was upset about being unable to help and care for her. The trio then joined the second leg of Lollapalooza as the main attraction, and program directors set them to play the opening of the main stage. They missed a date of the traveling festival to perform on August 14 at Woodstock &#x27;94. This event, the 25th anniversary of the original 1969 festival in Saugerties, New York, saw a mud &quot;fight&quot; between the band and the crowd. Although organizers hoped that Green Day would be a big draw, their punk rock style stuck out at the event and the band&#x27;s performance was poorly received by the crowd. When they opened their set with &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; after three days of rain, the audience was provoked by the irony and threw mud at them. Armstrong responded by taunting the crowd, and the event escalated into a mud fight among the audience and the band. During the fight, Dirnt was mistaken for a fan by a security guard, who tackled him and then threw him against a monitor, injuring his arm and breaking two of his teeth. Broadcast on pay-per-view to millions of people, this performance was widely noticed internationally and sales of the album rose sharply.

Further controversy followed the band only weeks later at a free concert in Boston. Alternative radio station WFNX hosted a free Green Day concert at the Hatch Memorial Shell concert venue on September 9, 1994. However, the promoters were accustomed to hosting reggae and acts of similar softness that drew smaller crowds, and were unprepared for the audience of 70,000 to 100,000 people. The fans in attendance were already chanting for Green Day during the show&#x27;s opening act. After several calls for calm, including some from Armstrong, the group began their performance, but the singer let himself be carried away by the energy of the audience and jumped into the middle of it during &quot;Longview&quot;, the seventh song of the set. The security forces, overwhelmed and fearing that the lighting fixtures would collapse, forcibly ended the concert by cutting off the power. A riot ensued and spilled into the streets, leading to numerous arrests and injuries. The Massachusetts State Police were called. Roughly 100 people were injured and 31 were arrested in the aftermath of the concert. In 2006, the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; would list the Green Day Hatch Shell &quot;riot&quot; concert as the sixth-greatest concert in Boston history.

When the band returned to Europe in October 1994, the venues in which they played were much larger, and the band was met with much more enthusiasm. Despite their new notoriety for live performances, the trio continued to sell tickets at affordable prices: $5 to $20 (equivalent to $ to $ in ). Warner proposed several groups to play as opening acts on this tour, but the band rejected these; instead, the band invited German punk band Die Toten Hosen and the American queercore group Pansy Division to join their shows. Following the European shows, the band returned home for one last show at the Z100 Acoustic Christmas at Madison Square Garden in New York. An AIDS benefit show, Armstrong performed the song &quot;She&quot; naked, using his guitar to cover himself.

In 2013, the band played &quot;Dookie&quot; in its entirety at some European dates as a celebration of the album&#x27;s upcoming 20th anniversary. On October 19, 2023, at the Fremont Country Club in Las Vegas, &quot;Dookie&quot; was played in its entirety as part of the evening&#x27;s 29-song set, including &quot;All by Myself&quot;. The album was played in celebration of its upcoming 30th anniversary and announcement of the 2024 tour.

<doc id="195462" wikidata="Q2897108" url="?curid=195462" title="Louis Laguerre">
<text>Louis Laguerre (1663 – 20 April 1721) was a French decorative painter mainly working in England.

Born in Versailles in 1663 and trained at the Paris Academy under Charles Le Brun, he came to England in 1683, where he first worked with Antonio Verrio, and then on his own. He rivalled with Sir James Thornhill in the field of history painting, primarily decorating the great houses of the nobility. His wall paintings can be found in Blenheim Palace, Marlborough House, Petworth House, Burghley House, Fetcham Park House and Chatsworth House. In the 1980s, a restoration project revealed work by Laguerre at Frogmore House also. His subject matter included English victories over the armies of Louis XIV; at Hampton Court Palace he carried out work for William III of England, for whom he depicted the Labours of Hercules.

Laguerre painted religious subjects at St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, Whitchurch, London. In 1731 Alexander Pope wrote, 
On painted ceilings you devoutly stare
Where sprawl the saints of Verrio or Laguerre...

which was taken by some contemporaries to be a reference to Laguerre&#x27;s work for James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos at this church and the nearby Cannons House.
Laguerre was also a director of Godfrey Kneller&#x27;s London Academy of Drawing and Painting, founded in the autumn of 1711. He died in London on 20 April 1721. His father-in-law was Jean Tijou.

<doc id="195468" wikidata="Q18783" url="?curid=195468" title="Ring of Fire">
<text>The Ring of Fire (also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Rim of Fire, the Girdle of Fire or the Circum-Pacific belt) is a tectonic belt of volcanoes and earthquakes.

It is about long and up to about wide, and surrounds most of the Pacific Ocean.

The Ring of Fire contains between 750 and 915 active or dormant volcanoes, around two-thirds of the world total. The exact number of volcanoes within the Ring of Fire depends on which regions are included.

About 90% of the world&#x27;s earthquakes, including most of its largest, occur within the belt.

The Ring of Fire is not a single geological structure. It was created by the subduction of different tectonic plates at convergent boundaries around the Pacific Ocean. These include: the Antarctic, Nazca and Cocos plates subducting beneath the South American plate; the Pacific and Juan de Fuca plates beneath the North American plate; the Philippine plate beneath the Eurasian plate; and a complex boundary between the Pacific and Australian plate. The interactions at these plate boundaries have formed oceanic trenches, volcanic arcs, back-arc basins and volcanic belts. The inclusion of some areas in the Ring of Fire, such as the Antarctic Peninsula and western Indonesia, is disputed.

The Ring of Fire has existed for more than 35 million years but subduction has existed for much longer in some parts of the Ring; many older extinct volcanoes are located within the Ring. More than 350 of the Ring of Fire&#x27;s volcanoes have been active in historical times, while the four largest volcanic eruptions on Earth in the Holocene epoch all occurred at volcanoes in the Ring of Fire.

Most of Earth&#x27;s active volcanoes with summits above sea level are located in the Ring of Fire. Many of these subaerial volcanoes are stratovolcanoes (e.g. Mount St. Helens), formed by explosive eruptions of tephra alternating with effusive eruptions of lava flows. Lavas at the Ring of Fire&#x27;s stratovolcanoes are mainly andesite and basaltic andesite but dacite, rhyolite, basalt and some other rarer types also occur. Other types of volcano are also found in the Ring of Fire, such as subaerial shield volcanoes (e.g. Plosky Tolbachik), and submarine seamounts (e.g. Monowai).

==History==
From Ancient Greek and Roman times until the late 18th century, volcanoes were associated with fire, based on the ancient belief that volcanoes were caused by fires burning within the Earth. This historical link between volcanoes and fire is preserved in the name of the Ring of Fire, despite the fact that volcanoes do &quot;not&quot; burn the Earth with fire.

The existence of a belt of volcanic activity around the Pacific Ocean was known in the early 19th century; for example, in 1825 the pioneering volcanologist G. P. Scrope described the chains of volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s rim in his book &quot;Considerations on Volcanos&quot; . Three decades later, a book about the Perry Expedition to Japan commented on the Ring of Fire volcanoes as follows: &quot;They [the Japanese Islands] are in the line of that immense circle of volcanic development which surrounds the shores of the Pacific from Tierra del Fuego around to the Moluccas.&quot; (&quot;Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan, 1852–54&quot;.) An article appeared in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1878 with the title &quot;The Ring of Fire, and the Volcanic Peaks of the West Coast of the United States&quot;, which outlined the phenomenon of volcanic activity around the boundaries of the Pacific. Early explicit references to volcanoes forming a &quot;ring of fire&quot; around the Pacific Ocean also include Alexander P. Livingstone&#x27;s book &quot;Complete Story of San Francisco&#x27;s Terrible Calamity of Earthquake and Fire&quot;, published in 1906, in which he describes &quot;... the great ring of fire which circles round the whole surface of the Pacific Ocean.&quot;.

In 1912, geologist Patrick Marshall introduced the term &quot;Andesite Line&quot; to mark a boundary between islands in the southwest Pacific, which differ in volcano structure and lava types. The concept was later extended to other parts of the Pacific Ocean. The Andesite Line and the Ring of Fire closely match in terms of location.

The development of the theory of plate tectonics since the early 1960s has provided the current understanding and explanation of the global distribution of volcanoes and earthquakes, including those in the Ring of Fire.

==Geographic boundaries==

There is consensus among geologists about most of the regions which are included in the Ring of Fire. There are, however, a few regions on which there is no universal agreement. (See: ). Indonesia lies at the intersection of the Ring of Fire and the Alpide belt (which is the Earth&#x27;s other very long subduction-related volcanic and earthquake zone, also known as the Mediterranean–Indonesian volcanic belt, running east–west through southern Asia and southern Europe). Some geologists include all of Indonesia in the Ring of Fire; many geologists exclude Indonesia&#x27;s western islands (which they include in the Alpide belt).

Some geologists include the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands in the Ring of Fire, other geologists exclude these areas. The rest of Antarctica is excluded because the volcanism there is not related to subduction.

The Ring of Fire does not extend across the southern Pacific Ocean from New Zealand to the Antarctic Peninsula or from New Zealand to the southern tip of South America because the submarine plate boundaries in this part of the Pacific Ocean (the Pacific–Antarctic Ridge, the East Pacific Rise and the Chile Ridge) are divergent instead of convergent. Although some volcanism occurs in this region, it is not related to subduction.

Some geologists include the Izu Islands, the Bonin Islands, and the Mariana Islands, other geologists exclude them.

==Tectonic plate configurations==

The Ring of Fire has existed for more than 35 million years. In some parts of the Ring of Fire, subduction has been occurring for much longer.

The current configuration of the Pacific Ring of Fire has been created by the development of the present-day subduction zones, initially (by about 115 million years ago) in South America, North America and Asia. As plate configurations gradually changed, the current subduction zones of Indonesia and New Guinea were created (about 70 million years ago), followed finally by the New Zealand subduction zone (about 35 million years ago).

===Past plate configurations ===
Along the coast of east Asia, during the Late Triassic about 210 million years ago, subduction of the Izanagi plate (the Paleo-Pacific plate) was occurring, and this continued in the Jurassic, producing volcanic belts, for example, in what is now eastern China.

The Pacific plate came into existence in the Early Jurassic about 190 million years ago, far from the margins of the then Paleo-Pacific Ocean. Until the Pacific plate grew large enough to reach the margins of the ocean basin, other older plates were subducted ahead of it at the ocean basin margins. For example, subduction has been occurring at the coast of South America since the Jurassic Period more than 145 million years ago, and remnants of Jurassic and Cretaceous volcanic arcs are preserved there.

At about 120 to 115 million years ago, the Farallon plate was subducting under South America, North America and north-east Asia while the Izanagi plate was subducting under east Asia. By 85 to 70 million years ago, the Izanagi plate had moved north-eastwards and was subducting under east Asia and North America, while the Farallon plate was subducting under South America and the Pacific plate was subducting under east Asia. About 70 to 65 million years ago, the Farallon plate was subducting under South America, the Kula plate was subducting under North America and north-east Asia, and the Pacific plate was subducting under east Asia and Papua New Guinea. About 35 million years ago, the Kula and Farallon plates had been subducted and the Pacific plate was subducting around its rim in a configuration closely resembling the outline of the present-day Ring of Fire.

=== Present-day plate configuration === 
The eastern parts of the Ring of Fire result from the collision of a few relatively large plates. The western parts of the Ring are more complex, with a number of large and small tectonic plates in collision.

In South America, the Ring of Fire is the result of the Antarctic plate, the Nazca plate and the Cocos plate being subducted beneath the South American plate. In Central America, the Cocos plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean plate. A portion of the Pacific plate and the small Juan de Fuca plate are being subducted beneath the North American plate. Along the northern portion, the northwestward-moving Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the Aleutian Islands arc. Farther west, the Pacific plate is being subducted at the Kamchatka Peninsula and Kuril arcs. Farther south, at Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, the Philippine Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian plate. The southwest section of the Ring of Fire is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate at the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and New Zealand; this part of the Ring excludes Australia, because that landmass lies in the center of its tectonic plate far from subduction zones.

==Subduction zones and oceanic trenches==

If a tectonic plate&#x27;s oceanic lithosphere is subducted beneath oceanic lithosphere of another plate, a volcanic island arc is created at the subduction zone. An example in the Ring of Fire is the Mariana Arc in the western Pacific Ocean. If, however, oceanic lithosphere is subducted under continental lithosphere, then a volcanic continental arc forms; a Ring of Fire example is the coast of Chile.

The steepness of the descending plate at a subduction zone depends on the age of the oceanic lithosphere that is being subducted. The older the oceanic lithosphere being subducted, the steeper the angle of descent of the subducted slab. As the Pacific&#x27;s mid-ocean ridges, which are the source of its oceanic lithosphere, are not actually in the middle of the ocean but located much closer to South America than to Asia, the oceanic lithosphere consumed at the South American subduction zones is younger and therefore subduction occurs at the South American coast at a relatively shallow angle. Older oceanic lithosphere is subducted in the western Pacific, with steeper angles of slab descent. This variation affects, for example, the location of volcanoes relative to the ocean trench, lava composition, type and severity of earthquakes, sediment accretion, and the amount of compression or tension. A spectrum of subduction zones exists between the Chilean and Mariana end members.

===Oceanic trenches===

Oceanic trenches are the topographic expression of subduction zones on the floor of the oceans. Oceanic trenches associated with the Ring of Fire&#x27;s subduction zones are:

*Peru–Chile Trench
*Middle America Trench
*Aleutian Trench
*Kuril–Kamchatka Trench
*Japan Trench
*Ryukyu Trench
*Izu–Bonin Trench
*Mariana Trench
*Yap Trench
*Philippine Trench
*Sunda Trench
*Tonga Trench
*Kermadec Trench
*Hikurangi Trough

===Gaps===
Subduction zones around the Pacific Ocean do not form a complete ring. Where subduction zones are absent, there are corresponding gaps in subduction-related volcanic belts in the Ring of Fire. In some gaps there is no volcanic activity; in other gaps, volcanic activity does occur but it is caused by processes not related to subduction.

There are gaps in the Ring of Fire at some parts of the Pacific coast of the Americas. In some places, the gaps are thought to be caused by flat slab subduction; examples are the three gaps between the four sections of the Andean Volcanic Belt in South America. In North America, there is a gap in subduction-related volcanic activity in northern Mexico and southern California, due partly to a divergent boundary in the Gulf of California and due partly to the San Andreas Fault (a non-volcanic transform boundary). Another North American gap in subduction-related volcanic activity occurs in northern British Columbia, Yukon and south-east Alaska, where volcanism is caused by intraplate continental rifting.

==Distribution of volcanoes==

==Very large events==

===Volcanic eruptions===
The four largest volcanic eruptions on Earth in the Holocene Epoch (the last 11,700 years) occurred at volcanoes in the Ring of Fire. They are the eruptions at Fisher Caldera (Alaska, 8700 BC), Kurile Lake (Kamchatka, 6450 BC), Kikai Caldera (Japan, 5480 BC) and Mount Mazama (Oregon, 5677 BC). More broadly, twenty of the twenty-five largest volcanic eruptions on Earth in this time interval occurred at Ring of Fire volcanoes.

===Earthquakes===
About 90% of the world&#x27;s earthquakes and most of the world&#x27;s largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire. The next most seismically active region (5–6% of earthquakes and some of the world&#x27;s largest earthquakes) is the Alpide belt, which extends from central Indonesia to the northern Atlantic Ocean via the Himalayas and southern Europe.

From 1900 to the end of 2020, most earthquakes of magnitude ≥ 8.0 occurred in the Ring of Fire. They are presumed to have been megathrust earthquakes at subduction zones, including four of the most powerful earthquakes on Earth since modern seismological measuring equipment and magnitude measurement scales were introduced in the 1930s:
*1960 Valdivia earthquake, Chile (magnitude 9.4–9.6)
*1964 Alaska earthquake, Alaska, United States (magnitude 9.2)
*2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Japan (magnitude 9.0–9.1)
*1952 Severo-Kurilsk earthquake, Kamchatka, Russia (magnitude 9.0)

==Antarctica==

Some geologists include the volcanoes of the South Shetland Islands, off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, as part of the Ring of Fire. These volcanoes, e.g. Deception Island, are due to rifting in the Bransfield back-arc basin close to the South Shetland subduction zone. The Antarctic Peninsula (Graham Land) is also sometimes included in the Ring. Volcanoes south of the Antarctic Circle (e.g. the volcanoes of Victoria Land including Mount Erebus, and the volcanoes of Mary Byrd Land) are not related to subduction; therefore, they are not part of the Ring of Fire.

The Balleny Islands, located between Antarctica and New Zealand, are volcanic but their volcanism is not related to subduction; therefore, they are not part of the Ring of Fire.

==South America==
The world&#x27;s highest active volcano is Ojos del Salado (), which is in the Andes Mountains section of the Ring of Fire. It forms part of the border between Argentina and Chile and it last erupted in AD 750. Another Ring of Fire Andean volcano on the Argentina-Chile border is Llullaillaco (), which is the world&#x27;s highest historically active volcano, last erupting in 1877.

=== Chile ===

Chile has experienced numerous volcanic eruptions from about 90 volcanoes during the Holocene Epoch.

Villarrica is one of Chile&#x27;s most active volcanoes, rising above the lake and town of the same name. It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend perpendicular to the Andes along the Gastre Fault. Villarrica, along with Quetrupillán and the Chilean part of Lanín, are protected within Villarrica National Park.

Villarrica, with its lava of basaltic-andesitic composition, is one of only five volcanoes worldwide known to have an active lava lake within its crater. The volcano usually generates strombolian eruptions, with ejection of incandescent pyroclasts and lava flows. Melting of snow and glacier ice, as well as rainfall, often causes lahars, such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971.

A postglacial caldera is located at the base of the presently active dominantly basaltic-to-andesitic cone at the northwest margin of the Pleistocene caldera. About 25 scoria cones dot Villarica&#x27;s flanks. Plinian eruptions and pyroclastic flows have been produced during the Holocene from this dominantly basaltic volcano, but historical eruptions have consisted of largely mild-to-moderate explosive activity with occasional lava effusion. Lahars from the glacier-covered volcanoes have damaged towns on its flanks.

The Llaima Volcano is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Chile. It is situated northeast of Temuco and southeast of Santiago, within the borders of Conguillío National Park. Llaima&#x27;s activity has been documented since the 17th century, and consists of several separate episodes of moderate explosive eruptions with occasional lava flows.

Lascar is a stratovolcano and the most active volcano of the northern Chilean Andes. The largest eruption of Lascar took place about 26,500 years ago, and following the eruption of the Tumbres scoria flow about 9,000 years ago, activity shifted back to the eastern edifice, where three overlapping craters were formed. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from Lascar in historical time since the mid-19th century, along with periodic larger eruptions that produced ash and tephra fall up to hundreds of kilometers away from the volcano. The largest eruption of Lascar in recent history took place in 1993, producing pyroclastic flows as far as northwest of the summit and ash fall in Buenos Aires, Argentina, more than to the southeast.

Chiliques is a stratovolcano located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, immediately north of Cerro Miscanti. Laguna Lejía lies to the north of the volcano and has been dormant for at least 10,000 years, but is now showing signs of life. A January 6, 2002, nighttime thermal infrared image from ASTER revealed a hot spot in the summit crater, as well as several others along the upper flanks of the volcano&#x27;s edifice, indicating new volcanic activity. Examination of an earlier nighttime thermal infrared image from May 24, 2000, showed no such hot spots.

Calbuco is a stratovolcano in southern Chile, located southeast of Llanquihue Lake and northwest of Chapo Lake, in Los Lagos Region. The volcano and the surrounding area are protected within Llanquihue National Reserve. It is a very explosive andesite volcano that underwent edifice collapse in the late Pleistocene, producing a volcanic debris avalanche that reached the lake. At least nine eruptions occurred since 1837, with the latest one in 1972. One of the largest historical eruptions in southern Chile took place there in 1893–1894. Violent eruptions ejected bombs to distances of from the crater, accompanied by voluminous hot lahars. Strong explosions occurred in April 1917, and a lava dome formed in the crater accompanied by hot lahars. Another short explosive eruption in January 1929 also included an apparent pyroclastic flow and a lava flow. The last major eruption of Calbuco, in 1961, sent ash columns high and produced plumes that dispersed mainly to the southeast and two lava flows were also emitted. A minor, four-hour eruption happened on August 26, 1972. Strong fumarolic emission from the main crater was observed on August 12, 1996.

Lonquimay is a stratovolocano of late-Pleistocene to dominantly Holocene age, with the shape of a truncated cone. The cone is largely andesitic, though basaltic and dacitic rocks are present. It is located in La Araucanía Region of Chile, immediately southeast of Tolhuaca volcano. Sierra Nevada and Llaima are their neighbors to the south. The snow-capped volcano lies within the protected area Malalcahuello-Nalcas. The volcano last erupted in 1988, ending in 1990. The VEI was 3. The eruption was from a flank vent and involved lava flows and explosive eruptions. Some fatalities occurred.

The volcanoes in Chile are monitored by the National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN)

Earthquake activity in Chile is related to subduction of the Nazca plate to the east. Chile notably holds the record for the largest earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. More recently, a magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck central Chile on February 27, 2010, the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcano erupted in 2011, and a M8.2 earthquake struck northern Chile on April 1, 2014. The main shock was preceded by a number of moderate to large shocks and was followed by a large number of moderate to very large aftershocks, including a magnitude-7.6 event on April 2.

===Argentina===
=== Bolivia ===
Bolivia hosts active and extinct volcanoes across its territory. The active volcanoes are located in western Bolivia where they make up the Cordillera Occidental, the western limit of the Altiplano plateau. Some of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with Chile. All Cenozoic volcanoes of Bolivia are part of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andean Volcanic Belt that results due to processes involved in the subduction of the Nazca plate under the South American plate. The Central Volcanic Zone is a major late Cenozoic volcanic province.

=== Peru ===
Sabancaya is an active stratovolcano in the Andes of southern Peru, about northwest of Arequipa. It is the most active volcano in Peru, with an ongoing eruption that started in 2016.

Ubinas is another active volcano of in southern Peru; its most recent eruption occurred in 2019.

Volcanoes in Peru are monitored by the Peruvian Geophysical Institute.

=== Ecuador ===

Cotopaxi is a stratovolcano in the Andes, located about south of Quito, Ecuador, South America. It is the second-highest summit in the country, reaching a height of . Since 1738, Cotopaxi has erupted more than 50 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by mudflows around the volcano.

In October 1999, Pichincha Volcano erupted in Quito and covered the city with several inches of ash. Prior to that, the last major eruptions were in 1553 and in 1660, when about 30 cm of ash fell on the city.

At , Sangay Volcano is an active stratovolcano in central Ecuador, one of the highest active volcanoes in the world and is one of Ecuador&#x27;s most active volcanoes. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity; An eruption, which started in 1934, ended in 2011. More recent eruptions have occurred. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern bound of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay&#x27;s roughly 500,000-year history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today. Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located within the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.

Reventador is an active stratovolcano that lies in the eastern Andes of Ecuador. Since 1541, it has erupted over 25 times, with its most recent eruption starting in 2008 and, , still ongoing, but the largest historical eruption occurred in 2002. During that eruption, the plume from the volcano reached a height of , and pyroclastic flows reached from the cone. On March 30, 2007, the volcano erupted ash again, which reached a height of about .

In Ecuador, EPN monitors volcanic activity.

In 1902, the Santa Maria Volcano erupted violently in Guatemala, with the largest explosions occurring over two days, ejecting an estimated of magma. The eruption was one of the largest of the 20th century, only slightly less in magnitude to that of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The eruption had a volcanic explosivity index of 6. Today, Santiaguito is one of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes.

=== North American Cordillera ===
==== Mexico ====


Volcanoes of Mexico related to subduction of the Cocos and Rivera plates occur in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which extends from west to east across central-southern Mexico. Popocatépetl, lying in the eastern half of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, is the second-highest peak in Mexico after the Pico de Orizaba. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico, having had more than 20 major eruptions since the arrival of the Spanish in 1519. The 1982 eruption of El Chichón, which killed about 2,000 people who lived near the volcano, created a 1-km-wide caldera that filled with an acidic crater lake. Before 1982, this relatively unknown volcano was heavily forested and of no greater height than adjacent nonvolcanic peaks.

==== United States ====

The Cascade Volcanic Arc lies in the western United States. This arc includes nearly 20 major volcanoes, among a total of over 4,000 separate volcanic vents including numerous stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones, along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as tuyas. Volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago, but most of the present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2 million years old, and the highest peaks are less than 100,000 years old. The arc is formed by the subduction of the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates at the Cascadia subduction zone. This is a fault, running off the coast of the Pacific Northwest from northern California to Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone.

Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce very large earthquakes, magnitude 9.0 or greater, if rupture occurred over its whole area. When the &quot;locked&quot; zone stores energy for an earthquake, the &quot;transition&quot; zone, although somewhat plastic, can rupture. Thermal and deformation studies indicate that the locked zone is fully locked for down-dip from the deformation front. Further down-dip, a transition from fully locked to aseismic sliding occurs.

Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, no oceanic trench is present along the continental margin in Cascadia. Instead, terranes and the accretionary wedge have been lifted up to form a series of coast ranges and exotic mountains. A high rate of sedimentation from the outflow of the three major rivers (Fraser River, Columbia River, and Klamath River) which cross the Cascade Range contributes to further obscuring the presence of a trench. However, in common with most other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes such as the magnitude-9 Cascadia earthquake of 1700. Geological evidence indicates that great earthquakes may have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, suggesting a return time of 400 to 600 years. Also, evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake is seen, as the prime reason these earthquakes are known is through &quot;scars&quot; the tsunamis left on the coast, and through Japanese records (tsunami waves can travel across the Pacific).

The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was the most significant to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states in recorded history (VEI = 5, of material erupted), exceeding the destructive power and volume of material released by the 1915 eruption of California&#x27;s Lassen Peak. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain that created a huge bulge and a fracture system on Mount St. Helens&#x27; north slope. An earthquake at 8:32 am on May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock responded by exploding into a very hot mix of pulverized lava and older rock that sped toward Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face.

Alaska is known for its seismic and volcanic activity, holding the record for the second-largest earthquake in the world, the Good Friday earthquake, and having more than 50 volcanoes which have erupted since about 1760. Volcanoes are found not only in the mainland, but also in the Aleutian Islands.

The United States Geological Survey and the National Earthquake Information Center monitor volcanoes and earthquakes in the United States.

==== Canada ====

British Columbia and Yukon are home to a region of volcanoes and volcanic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire. More than 20 volcanoes have erupted in the western Canada during the Holocene Epoch but only 6 are directly related to subduction: Bridge River Cones, Mount Cayley, Mount Garibaldi, Garibaldi Lake, Silverthrone Caldera, and Mount Meager massif. Several mountains in populated areas of British Columbia are dormant volcanoes. Most of these were active during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Although none of Canada&#x27;s volcanoes are currently erupting, several volcanoes, volcanic fields, and volcanic centers are considered potentially active. There are hot springs at some volcanoes. Since 1975, seismic activity appears to have been associated with some volcanoes in British Columbia including the six subduction-related volcanoes as well as intraplate volcanoes such as Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanoes are grouped into five volcanic belts with different tectonic settings.

The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is an area of numerous volcanoes, which are caused by continental rifting not subduction; therefore geologists often regard it as a gap in the Pacific Ring of Fire between the Cascade Volcanic Arc further south and Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Arc further north.

The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in southwestern British Columbia is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the United States (which includes Mount Baker and Mount St. Helens) and contains the most explosive young volcanoes in Canada. It formed as a result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate (a remnant of the much larger Farallon plate) under the North American plate along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt includes the Bridge River Cones, Mount Cayley, Mount Fee, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Price, Mount Meager massif, the Squamish Volcanic Field, and more smaller volcanoes. The eruption styles in the belt range from effusive to explosive, with compositions from basalt to rhyolite. Morphologically, centers include calderas, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes and small isolated lava masses. Due to repeated continental and alpine glaciations, many of the volcanic deposits in the belt reflect complex interactions between magma composition, topography, and changing ice configurations. The most recent major catastrophic eruption in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt was an explosive eruption of the Mount Meager massif about 2,350 years ago. It was similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, sending an ash column about 20 km into the stratosphere.

The Chilcotin Group is a north–south range of volcanoes in southern British Columbia running parallel to the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The majority of the eruptions in this belt happened either 6–10 million years ago (Miocene) or 2–3 million years ago (Pliocene), although with some slightly more recent eruptions (in the Pleistocene). It is thought to have formed as a result of back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone. Volcanoes in this belt include Mount Noel, the Clisbako Caldera Complex, Lightning Peak, Black Dome Mountain, and many lava flows.

Eruptions of basaltic to rhyolitic volcanoes and hypabyssal rocks of the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt in northern Vancouver Island are probably linked with the subducted margin flanked by the Explorer and Juan de Fuca plates at the Cascadia subduction zone. It appears to have been active during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. However, no Holocene eruptions are known, and volcanic activity in the belt has likely ceased.

The active Queen Charlotte Fault on the west coast of the Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, has generated three large earthquakes during the 20th century: a magnitude 7 event in 1929; a magnitude 8.1 in 1949 (Canada&#x27;s largest recorded earthquake); and a magnitude 7.4 in 1970.

The Public Safety Geo-science Program at the Natural Resources Canada undertakes research to support risk reduction from the effects of space weather, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides.

== Asia ==
=== Russia ===

The Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East is one of the most active volcanic areas in the world, with 20 historically active volcanoes. It lies between the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Okhotsk Sea to the west. Immediately offshore along the Pacific coast of the peninsula runs the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, where subduction of the Pacific plate fuels the volcanism. Several types of volcanic activity are present, including stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, Hawaiian-style fissure eruptions and geysers.

Active, dormant and extinct volcanoes of Kamchatka are in two major volcanic belts. The most recent activity takes place in the eastern belt, starting in the north at the Shiveluch volcanic complex, which lies at the junction of the Aleutian and Kamchatka volcanic arcs. Just to the south is the Klyuchi volcanic group, comprising the twin volcanic cones of Kliuchevskoi and Kamen, the volcanic complexes of Tolbachik and Ushkovsky, and a number of other large stratovolcanoes. Ichinsky, the only active volcano in the central belt, is located farther to the west. Farther south, the eastern belt of stratovolcanoes continues to the southern tip of Kamchatka, continuing onto the Kuril Islands, with their 32 historically active volcanoes.

=== Japan ===
About 10% of the world&#x27;s active volcanoes are found in Japan, which lies in a zone of extreme crustal instability. They are formed by subduction of the Pacific plate and the Philippine Sea plate. As many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 6 are not uncommon. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing some slight shaking of buildings. Major earthquakes occur infrequently; the most famous in the 20th century were: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, in which 130,000 people died; and the Great Hanshin earthquake of January 17, 1995, in which 6,434 people died. On March 11, 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit Japan, the country&#x27;s biggest ever and the fifth largest on record, according to US Geological Survey data. Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from tsunamis.

Mount Bandai, one of Japan&#x27;s most noted volcanoes, rises above the north shore of Lake Inawashiro. Mount Bandai is formed of several overlapping stratovolcanoes, the largest of which is O-Bandai, constructed within a horseshoe-shaped caldera that formed about 40,000 years ago when an earlier volcano collapsed, forming the Okinajima debris avalanche, which traveled to the southwest and was accompanied by a plinian eruption. Four major phreatic eruptions have occurred during the past 5,000 years, two of them in historical time, in 806 and 1888. Seen from the south, Bandai presents a conical profile, but much of the north side of the volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Ko-Bandai volcano during the 1888 eruption, in which a debris avalanche buried several villages and formed several large lakes. In July 1888, the north flank of Mount Bandai collapsed during an eruption quite similar to the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens. After a week of seismic activity, a large earthquake on July 15, 1888, was followed by a tremendous noise and a large explosion. Eyewitnesses heard about 15 to 20 additional explosions and observed that the last one was projected almost horizontally to the north.

Mount Fuji is Japan&#x27;s highest and most noted volcano, featuring heavily in Japanese culture and serving as one of the country&#x27;s most popular landmarks. The modern postglacial stratovolcano is constructed above a group of overlapping volcanoes, remnants of which form irregularities on Fuji&#x27;s profile. Growth of the younger Mount Fuji began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8,000 years ago, accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the younger Mount Fuji. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8,000 to 4,500 years ago, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4,500 to 3,000 years ago. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainage against the Tertiary Misaka Mountains on the north side of the volcano, forming the Fuji Five Lakes. The last eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 ejected andesitic pumice and formed a large new crater on the east flank. Some minor volcanic activity may occur in the next few years.

=== Taiwan ===
=== Philippines ===

The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo is the world&#x27;s second-largest eruption of the 20th century. Successful predictions of the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas, saving many lives, but as the surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic flows, ash deposits, and later, lahars caused by rainwater remobilising earlier volcanic deposits, thousands of houses were destroyed.

Mayon Volcano is the Philippines&#x27; most active volcano. It has steep upper slopes that average 35–40° and is capped by a small summit crater. The historical eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic volcano date back to 1616 and range from Strombolian to basaltic Plinian eruptions. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the roughly 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas.

Taal Volcano has had 33 recorded eruptions since 1572. A devastating eruption occurred in 1911, which claimed more than a thousand lives. The deposits of that eruption consist of a yellowish, fairly decomposed (nonjuvenile) tephra with a high sulfur content. The most recent period of activity lasted from 1965 to 1977, and was characterized by the interaction of magma with the lake water, which produced violent phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions. The volcano was dormant from 1977 then showed signs of unrest since 1991 with strong seismic activity and ground-fracturing events, as well as the formation of small mud geysers on parts of the island. An eruption occurred in January 2020.

Kanlaon Volcano, the most active volcano in the central Philippines, has erupted 25 times since 1866. Eruptions are typically phreatic explosions of small-to-moderate size that produce minor ash falls near the volcano. On August 10, 1996, Kanlaon erupted without warning, killing 3 persons who were among 24 mountain climbers trapped near the summit. On June 3, 2024, Mt. Kanlaon erupted, displacing more than 1,000 people.

=== Indonesia ===

Indonesia is located where the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean meets the Alpide belt (which runs from Southeast Asia to Southwest Europe).

The eastern islands of Indonesia (Sulawesi, the Lesser Sunda Islands (excluding Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa and Sangeang), Halmahera, the Banda Islands and the Sangihe Islands) are geologically associated with subduction of the Pacific plate or its related minor plates and, therefore, the eastern islands are often regarded as part of the Ring of Fire.

The western islands of Indonesia (the Sunda Arc of Sumatra, Krakatoa, Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa and Sangeang) are located north of a subduction zone in the Indian Ocean. Although news media, popular science publications and some geologists include the western islands (and their notable volcanoes such as Krakatoa, Merapi, Tambora and Toba) in the Ring of Fire, geologists often exclude the western islands from the Ring; instead the western islands are often included in the Alpide belt.

=== New Zealand ===

New Zealand contains the world&#x27;s strongest concentration of youthful rhyolitic volcanoes, and voluminous sheets of tuff blanket much of the North Island. The earliest historically dated eruption was at Whakaari/White Island in 1826, followed in 1886 by the country&#x27;s largest historical eruption at Mount Tarawera. Much of the region north of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island is made up of seamounts and small islands, including 16 submarine volcanoes. In the last 1.6 million years, most of New Zealand&#x27;s volcanism is from the Taupō Volcanic Zone.

Mount Ruapehu, at the southern end of the Taupō Volcanic Zone, is one of the most active volcanoes in New Zealand. It began erupting at least 250,000 years ago. In recorded history, major eruptions have been about 50 years apart, in 1895, 1945, and 1995–1996. Minor eruptions are frequent, with at least 60 since 1945. Some of the minor eruptions in the 1970s generated small ash falls and lahars that damaged ski fields. Between major eruptions, a warm acidic crater lake forms, fed by melting snow. Major eruptions may completely expel the lake water. Where a major eruption has deposited a tephra dam across the lake&#x27;s outlet, the dam may collapse after the lake has refilled and risen above the level of its normal outlet, the outrush of water causing a large lahar. The most notable lahar caused the Tangiwai disaster on December 24, 1953, when 151 people aboard a Wellington to Auckland express train were killed after the lahar destroyed the Tangiwai rail bridge just moments before the train was due. In 2000, the ERLAWS system was installed on the mountain to detect such a collapse and alert the relevant authorities.

The Auckland volcanic field on the North Island of New Zealand has produced a diverse array of explosive craters, scoria cones, and lava flows. Currently dormant, the field is likely to erupt again within the next &quot;hundreds to thousands of years&quot;, a very short timeframe in geologic terms. The field contains at least 40 volcanoes, most recently active about 600 years ago at Rangitoto Island, erupting of lava.

==Soil==

The soils of the Pacific Ring of Fire include andosols, also known as andisols; they have formed by the weathering of volcanic ash. Andosols contain large proportions of volcanic glass. The Ring of Fire is the world&#x27;s main location for this soil type, which typically has good levels of fertility.

<text>Liquid Swords is the second solo studio album by the American rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member GZA, released on November 7, 1995, by Geffen Records. Recording sessions for the album began midway through 1995 at producer RZA&#x27;s basement studio in the New York City borough of Staten Island. The album heavily samples dialogue from the martial arts film &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; and maintains a dark atmosphere throughout, incorporating lyrical references to chess, crime and philosophy. &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; features numerous guest appearances from the other eight members of Wu-Tang Clan along with Wu-Tang affiliate Killah Priest.

Upon its release, &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum in sales nearly 20 years after its release. &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; received critical acclaim for its complex lyricism and hypnotic musical style. Over the years, its recognition has grown, with a number of famous publishers proclaiming it to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. In 2007, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; cited it as &quot;one of the most substantial lyrical journeys in hip-hop history&quot;.

== Background and recording ==
Following the success of two earlier Wu-Tang Clan solo albums – Method Man&#x27;s &quot;Tical&quot; and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version&quot;, Wu-Tang member Raekwon began recording his acclaimed debut &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; in early 1995. While he and producer RZA were putting the final touches on that album, RZA and GZA began writing and recording what would eventually become &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;. In regards to their decision to begin the album at the time they did, GZA later commented, &quot;We (Wu-Tang) were on a roll, and it was the perfect time to get in the studio and just do it.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m on a different level, trying to be cinematic,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Like that shit in &#x27;Killah Hill&#x27; where the kid gets his leg cut to hide the dope – that shit really happened, but I&#x27;m trying to make it more visual. &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; is a concept of being lyrically sharp, flowing like liquid metal – mercury, y&#x27;know? It comes from this flick, &quot;Legend of the Liquid Sword&quot;, where people would get their head cut off but it would still be on their shoulders. No one else would notice, because the sword was so sharp. Wu-Tang is a sword style, and this here is the sharpest. I&#x27;d rather slip on the pavement than slip on my tongue.&quot;

Similar to other early solo Wu-Tang albums, &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; was recorded in RZA&#x27;s basement studio in Staten Island, with some beats playing for over two days straight while recording. When asked in a later interview about his opinion of the album&#x27;s beats, GZA remarked &quot;I loved them. A lot of them had a grimy, rock-like feel to them. I just remember absolutely loving them.&quot; In the same interview, GZA described the writing process as &quot;real slow.&quot; He further commented &quot;I don’t say slow in the sense that it necessarily took me a long time to finish what I’m writing. I mean, Raekwon and Ghostface can step in and record a song in about forty-five minutes. I on the other hand, would often go back and finish rhymes that I started. I would say I pieced things together more slowly then. Songs generally take me two to three days to write. Sometimes I take different sentences and put them together.&quot;

Regarding the overall sensation of writing &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, GZA stated &quot;It&#x27;s hard to say something is gonna be classic or not. But I can say that I felt the magic with this one. I actually saw it grow and come together, and felt that it was special as we were doing it.&quot; He later noted in an interview with &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;: &quot;It has great songs, it&#x27;s not an ignorant album, it doesn&#x27;t sound dated. If you listen to it and compare it to what&#x27;s out now, it&#x27;s timeless. Lyrically, it&#x27;s not my best work. Not at all. But the chemistry? Production? Overall, I mean, c&#x27;mon! RZA&#x27;s atmospheric production? Yes. It&#x27;s my best album.&quot;

== Promotion ==

The album&#x27;s cover was designed by Milestone Media Founder/Creative Director and chief artist Denys Cowan, according to the album&#x27;s liner notes. Cowan&#x27;s black and white line art was inked by Inker Prentis Rollins. Milestone&#x27;s Color Editor, Jason Scott Jones created the cover color art digitally at a time when digital coloring was emerging in comic art eventually becoming the standard. GZA&#x27;s personal manager Geoffrey L. Garfield, commissioned Cowan. Garfield, an avid comic book fan, said the cover art was supervised under the auspices of GZA GrafX, a subsidiary company of GZA Entertainment owned by GZA and Garfield. The concept of the chessboard with its sword-wielding warriors was conceived by GZA, an avid chess player. The GZA version of the Wu-Tang Clan logo, the &quot;G&quot; using the logo iconography, was rendered by Wu-Tang Clan DJ Mathematics who was also an accomplished graphic artist.

GZA also enjoyed a successful side career as a music video director, and with Garfield as writer and producer, created all four videos for the &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; album (&quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, &quot;Cold World&quot;, &quot;Shadowboxin&#x27;/4th Chamber&quot;, and &quot;I Gotcha Back&quot;), and also did videos for Sunz of Man, Ghostface Killah&#x27;s song (&quot;Motherless Child&quot;) on the &quot;Sunset Park&quot; film soundtrack, Shabazz the Disciple (Penalty Records) and Case (Def Jam). &quot;The Source&quot; recognized their video &quot;Shadowboxin&#x27;/4th Chamber&quot; as one of the Top Five Videos of 1995.

&quot;Liquid Swords&quot; was performed in its entirety on July 13, 2007, at the Pitchfork Music Festival and again in England, on December 9 at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties and on December 10 at KOKO in London, as part of the ATP-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series. After the cancellation of an appearance in Brooklyn, New York, the performance was rescheduled for December 13 and 14 at the Knitting Factory in New York.

=== Singles ===
Four total singles were released for &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;. The first of which was &quot;I Gotcha&#x27; Back&quot;, released August 22, 1994. Similar to Raekwon&#x27;s single &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell,&quot; the song first appeared on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Fresh&quot;, and was the first song written for the album, with its version being re-recorded in 1995. Describing the song&#x27;s background and theme, GZA later stated &quot;This was a short rhyme I wrote for one of my nephews. When I said, &#x27;My lifestyle so far from well, could&#x27;ve wrote a book called Age Twelve and Going Through Hell.&#x27; It&#x27;s for my nephew who was twelve at the time, and whose father, my brother, had been locked up since &#x27;88. So he wasn&#x27;t around for my nephew when times were rough, so I wanted to up my nephew a bit with this track. I had two nephews in the video, they were both real young at the time. And in video, they both had met up and shots rang out from some young gangsters. It&#x27;s a shame because both those kids in the video, both nephews of mine, ended up getting in trouble for ringing out shots and are both doing time right now. It&#x27;s kind of ironic. One of my nephews ended up getting eights years for that shit. So the whole song is a sad irony to me now.&quot;

The second single released for the album, was the title track &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, released over one year later on October 10, 1995. GZA later commented &quot;Usually I take a beat home and write to it for a few days, but it wasn’t like that with this track. I think RZA played the beat for me and I just spit to it right there. The hook was actually a routine from around ‘84 that me RZA and Ol&#x27; Dirty would do: &#x27;When the emcees came, to live out the name.&#x27; Just like that.&quot;

November 28, 1995 saw the release of the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Cold World&quot;. In regards to his writing approach to the song, GZA stated &quot;Normally, when I hear a beat, I already know where to go with it. I can picture the track and just vibe off it. As soon as I heard the beat to “Cold World,” I knew it would be another inner-city story.&quot;

The fourth and final single released for the album was &quot;Shadowboxin&#x27;&quot;, released early 1996, with &quot;4th Chamber&quot; as its B-Side. In an interview with &quot;Wax Poetics&quot;, GZA praised Method Man&#x27;s rapping on &quot;Shadowboxin&#x27;&quot;, saying that the song &quot;seemed more like Meth&#x27;s track&quot;. GZA stated &quot;Making &#x27;4th Chamber&#x27; was crazy because I didn’t have a rhyme ready for that one. That’s why I went last on it. Plus, Ghost killed it with his verse so I knew I had to come correct. It’s not even a GZA song to me—it’s a Wu-Tang song. And Ghost’s verse is just incredible to me. He delivered so well. I don’t know if you saw the video, I directed that too. This song, the guest verses, the video, the crowd response, all turned out perfect for this one.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; received critical acclaim. Selwyn Seyfu Hinds from &quot;The Source&quot; called GZA &quot;a highly focused master-graftsman&quot; and felt that &quot;throughout &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; he maintains a clear, precise flow, one that reflects deadly-sharp purpose and skilled execution.&quot; Hinds also praised RZA&#x27;s production on the album, noting his &quot;increasingly sophisticated style: shuffling kicks, neck snapping snares, haunting melodies via strings or vibe-like textures and penetrating bass tones.&quot; In his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Dimitri Ehrlich said that, &quot;With its tight beat, &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; emphasizes the finesse with which GZA weaves his vocals over straightforward rhythms.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Cheo H. Coker described GZA as &quot;a hip-hop M. C. Escher&quot; whose lyrics &quot;reveal layer after layer of thought with repeated listening&quot;, concluding that the album cements the Wu-Tang Clan as &quot;the kings of New York rap.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; hailed &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; as &quot;the best hip-hop album&quot; in years, citing RZA&#x27;s &quot;spooked, creaky, incredibly dense&quot; production and GZA&#x27;s complex and &quot;quite brilliant&quot; lyrics. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine characterized the album as &quot;creepily beautiful&quot; and &quot;East Coast hip hop with a far more warped and disturbing slant on inner-city sickness than the in-your-face Californian equivalent&quot;. In &quot;Select&quot;, Matt Hall wrote that RZA &quot;provides a series of austere rhythms, sparsely dotting violin stabs and plucked harps to provide the perfect backdrop to Genius&#x27; downbeat tales of New York&#x27;s mean streets… &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; sneaks under the tape to qualify as Rap Album Of The Year.&quot; Tom Doyle of &quot;Q&quot; wrote that GZA can seem &quot;perhaps unreasonably hardcore in some of his approaches...[but] when his rhyming is enhanced by the dislocated soul chorus of &#x27;Cold World&#x27;, the result is dramatic and hypnotic.&quot;

Robert Christgau was somewhat less enthusiastic, giving the album a two-star honorable mention, which indicated a &quot;likable effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy&quot;. In his column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Christgau cited &quot;Shadowboxin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Killah Hills 10304&quot; as highlights and called the record &quot;gangsta [rap] as mystery, religious and literary&quot;.

=== Retrospect ===
&quot;Liquid Swords&quot; continues to be held in high regard as one of the best releases in the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s catalog and among the greatest hip hop albums of all time. According to AllMusic critic Steve Huey, it is &quot;often acclaimed as the best Wu-Tang solo project of all&quot; and &quot;cemented the Genius/GZA&#x27;s reputation as the best pure lyricist in the group—and one of the best of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Huey likewise viewed it as a significant progression for RZA as a producer, noting his experiments &quot;with stranger sounds and more layered tracks&quot;, while evaluating &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; as &quot;one of the group&#x27;s undisputed classics&quot;, along with &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; (1993) and Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; (1995). Reviewing &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; for &quot;RapReviews&quot;″ &quot;Back to the Lab&quot; series, writer Steve Juon called it &quot;an album of 100% Wu-Tang sonic mastery&quot;, adding that among Wu-Tang Clan solo albums, &quot;it may the best—if not one of the top two or three.&quot; Nick Catucci, writing in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), said that, on the album, GZA &quot;went goth, painting the Wu&#x27;s street grime black.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot;″s Paul Bowler stated that &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; represented an artistic peak for the Wu-Tang Clan as a whole, noting what he found to be their subsequent creative decline from &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; (1997) onward. Chris Smith from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote that the group &quot;never yet managed to make anything this memorable, otherworldly, and strangely beautiful again.&quot;

On October 8, 2015, the Recording Industry Association of America announced that &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; had earned a platinum certification for having sold more than 1 million copies. It became the first Wu-Tang-related album to get certified since 2004, when Method Man and Ghostface Killah both earned plaques.

<text>400 Degreez is the commercial debut and overall third studio album by American rapper Juvenile. The album was released on November 3, 1998, by Universal Records and Bryan &quot;Baby&quot; Williams&#x27; Cash Money Records. It remains Juvenile&#x27;s best-selling album of his solo career, with six million copies sold as of 2021. The album received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 19, 2000.

Its two preceding singles, &quot;Ha&quot; and &quot;Back That Azz Up&quot; (censored as &quot;Back That Thang Up&quot;) peaked at numbers 68 and 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. The album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on Billboard&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums; it peaked atop the latter chart for its Year-End list of 1999. The album also features the remix of the single &quot;Ha&quot; with New York rapper Jay-Z, its only guest appearance from outside the Cash Money roster and the first time a rapper from the label worked with an East Coast rapper on a song. The album won the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for Top R&amp;B Album in 1999. The explicit version of the album was not totally uncensored; lines such as &quot;do a (homicide) with me&quot; on &quot;Gone Ride with Me&quot; and &quot;put a (pistol) in his face&quot; can be heard in &quot;Welcome 2 tha Nolia&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 470 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Consequence&quot; in 2023 and &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2024 ranked &quot;400 Degreez&quot; 38 and 44 in their respective all-time best hip hop album lists. In 2017, &quot;The Ringer&quot; ranked it as the third-best Southern hip hop album of all time. &quot;HipHopDX&quot; named it among 18 of the best hip hop and R&amp;B albums of 1998.

<doc id="195474" wikidata="Q2258521" url="?curid=195474" title="Black on Both Sides">
<text>Black on Both Sides is the debut solo studio album by American rapper Mos Def, released on October 12, 1999, by Rawkus and Priority Records. 

Released after his successful collaboration &quot;Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli Are Black Star&quot;, &quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; emphasizes live instrumentation and socially conscious lyrics.

On February 2, 2000, the album was certified Gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following sales in excess of 500,000 copies.

==Music==

===Production===
The album features a mix between established and rising producers. DJ Premier provides the instrumental track for &quot;Mathematics&quot;. Diamond D is credited for &quot;Hip Hop&quot;. Ali Shaheed Muhammad, known mostly as a member of A Tribe Called Quest, produced the seventh song &quot;Got&quot;. Psycho Les of The Beatnuts produced &quot;New World Water&quot; and &quot;Rock N Roll&quot;. Jazz legend Weldon Irvine provided additional production to &quot;Climb&quot;.

Ayatollah produced &quot;Ms. Fat Booty&quot; and &quot;Know That&quot;. 88-Keys produced &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Speed Law&quot; and co-produced the instrumental outro &quot;May–December&quot; with Bey himself. David Kennedy (the second swing of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Umi Says&quot; produced with Bey), Mr. Khaliyl (&quot;Do It Now&quot;), DJ Etch-A-Sketch (&quot;Climb&quot; and &quot;Habitat&quot;), Ge-ology (The first swing of &quot;Brooklyn&quot;) and D. Prosper (&quot;Mr. Nigga&quot;) round out the other contributors.

Bey received production assistance on most of the album&#x27;s tracks. His sole production credit comes at &quot;Fear Not of Man&quot;, but he provided additional production to four tracks (&quot;Hip Hop&quot;, &quot;Rock N Roll&quot;, &quot;Climb&quot; and &quot;Mr. Nigga&quot;) and co-produced three (&quot;Umi Says&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;May–December&quot;).

===Early versions===
On the song &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, a three-movement piece dedicated to Mos&#x27;s neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant, New York, Bey rhymes three verses over three different beats. The first beat is an original composition produced by Ge-ology, while the second verse is a re-creation Smif-N-Wessun&#x27;s &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; and the last verse is set to the instrumental track of The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s 1995 single &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot;. Originally, Bey rhymed three complete verses over Ge-ology&#x27;s musical composition, now referred to as the first movement of the song. On a later version, the first and third verses are set to the instrumentals of two other 1995 New York rap hits, &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot; by Raekwon as well as &quot;Give Up the Goods (Just Step)&quot; by Mobb Deep, respectively. The &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot; verse, with the same vocal take on the released version, is placed in the middle. Bey sings his own interpretation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers song &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;.

===Video===
Bey was involved with two videos for &quot;Umi Says&quot;. One was more traditional, while the second one came when Nike and Jordan Brand chose &quot;Umi Says&quot; as its theme song for its &quot;Much Respect&quot; series of commercials for the Air Jordan XVI. As a result, the second video features appearances from Michael Finley, Eddie Jones, Derek Jeter, Roy Jones Jr., Ray Allen and even Michael Jordan himself.

==Reception==
&quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; received universal acclaim from critics. Matt Diehl of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the album&#x27;s diversity and noted, &quot;Merging old-school bravado with new-school poetics, the Brooklyn legend spouts incisive Afrocentric reality that takes all sides into account.&quot; Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music opined that &quot;Not since Rakim&#x27;s heyday has a mic-rocker so clearly articulated such complex and entertaining thoughts, with the ability to wax eloquently on matters metaphysical (&#x27;Love&#x27;) and just plain physical (&#x27;Ms. Fat Booty&#x27;)&quot; and hailed the album as &quot;a sure pick as one of the year&#x27;s best.&quot;

&quot;The Independent&quot; lauded the record&#x27;s &quot;sharp reflections on a range of subjects from parochialism to pollution, fear to fat booties, rap to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; and wrote that &quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; &quot;stands as a proud example of the heights hip-hop can achieve when its exponents put their minds to it.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau wrote that while he felt the album ran too long, &quot;the wealth of good-hearted reflection and well-calibrated production overwhelms one&#x27;s petty objections&quot;. In a retrospective review, Charles Aaron of &quot;Spin&quot; described Bey as a &quot;restless B-Boy citizen of the world&quot; and called the album &quot;playful, witty, and heart-pounding.&quot;

<text>Tyrannosauridae (or tyrannosaurids, meaning &quot;tyrant lizards&quot;) is a family of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs that comprises two subfamilies containing up to fifteen genera, including the eponymous &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The exact number of genera is controversial, with some experts recognizing as few as three. All of these animals lived near the end of the Cretaceous Period and their fossils have been found only in North America and Asia.

Although descended from smaller ancestors, tyrannosaurids were almost always the largest predators in their respective ecosystems, putting them at the apex of the food chain. The largest species was &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, the most massive known terrestrial predator, which measured over in length and according to most modern estimates up to in weight. Tyrannosaurids were bipedal carnivores with massive skulls filled with large teeth. Despite their large size, their legs were long and proportioned for fast movement. In contrast, their arms were very small, bearing only two functional digits.

Unlike most other groups of dinosaurs, very complete remains have been discovered for most known tyrannosaurids. This has allowed a variety of research into their biology. Scientific studies have focused on their ontogeny, biomechanics and ecology, among other subjects.

==History of discovery==

The first remains of tyrannosaurids were uncovered during expeditions led by the Geological Survey of Canada, which located numerous scattered teeth. These distinctive dinosaur teeth were given the name &quot;Deinodon&quot; (&quot;terrible tooth&quot;) by Joseph Leidy in 1856. The first good specimens of a tyrannosaurid were found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, and consisted of nearly complete skulls with partial skeletons. These remains were first studied by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876, who considered them a species of the eastern tyrannosauroid &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot;. In 1905, Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized that the Alberta remains differed considerably from &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot;, and coined a new name for them: &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot; (&quot;flesh-eating Alberta lizard&quot;). Cope described more tyrannosaur material in 1892, in the form of isolated vertebrae, and gave this animal the name &quot;Manospondylus gigas&quot;. This discovery was mostly overlooked for over a century, and caused controversy in the early 2000s when it was discovered that this material actually belonged to, and had name priority over, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;.

In his 1905 paper naming &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, Osborn described two additional tyrannosaur specimens that had been collected in Montana and Wyoming during a 1902 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Barnum Brown. Initially, Osborn considered these to be distinct species. The first, he named &quot;Dynamosaurus imperiosus&quot; (&quot;emperor power lizard&quot;), and the second, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; (&quot;king tyrant lizard&quot;). A year later, Osborn recognized that these two specimens actually came from the same species. Despite the fact that &quot;Dynamosaurus&quot; had been found first, the name &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had appeared one page earlier in his original article describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was used.

Barnum Brown went on to collect several more tyrannosaurid specimens from Alberta, including the first to preserve the shortened, two-fingered forelimbs characteristic of the group (which Lawrence Lambe named &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot;, &quot;balanced fierce lizard&quot;, in 1914). A second significant find attributed to &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; was made in 1942, in the form of a well-preserved, though unusually small, complete skull. The specimen waited until after the end of World War II to be studied by Charles W. Gilmore, who named it &quot;Gorgosaurus lancesnis&quot;. This skull was re-studied by Robert T. Bakker, Phil Currie, and Michael Williams in 1988, and assigned to the new genus &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;. It was also in 1946 that paleontologists from the Soviet Union began expeditions into Mongolia, and uncovered the first tyrannosaur remains from Asia. Evgeny Maleev described new Mongolian species of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; in 1955, and one new genus: &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; (&quot;terrifying lizard&quot;). Subsequent studies, however, showed that all of Maleev&#x27;s tyrannosaur species were actually one species of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; at different stages of growth. A second species of Mongolian tyrannosaurid was found later, described by Sergei Kurzanov in 1976, and given the name &quot;Alioramus remotus&quot; (&quot;remote different branch&quot;), though its status as a true tyrannosaurid and not a more primitive tyrannosaur is still controversial.

==Description==

The tyrannosaurids were all large animals, with all species capable of weighing at least 1 metric ton. A single specimen of &quot;Alioramus&quot; of an individual estimated at between long has been discovered, although it is considered by some experts to be a juvenile. &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; all measured between long, while &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; reached lengths of from snout to tail. The massive &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; reached in the largest specimen, RSM P2523.8.

===Skull and dentition===

Tyrannosaurid skull anatomy is well understood, as complete skulls are known for all genera but &quot;Alioramus&quot;, which is known only from partial skull remains. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; had skulls that exceeded in length. Adult tyrannosaurids had tall, massive skulls, with many bones fused and reinforced for strength. At the same time, hollow chambers within many skull bones and large openings (fenestrae) between those bones helped to reduce skull weight. Many features of tyrannosaurid skulls were also found in their immediate ancestors, including tall premaxillae and fused nasal bones.

Tyrannosaurid skulls had many unique characteristics, including fused parietal bones with a prominent sagittal crest, which ran longitudinally along the sagittal suture and separated the two supratemporal fenestrae on the skull roof. Behind these fenestrae, tyrannosaurids had a characteristically tall nuchal crest, which also arose from the parietals but ran along a transverse plane rather than longitudinally. The nuchal crest was especially well-developed in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot;. &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; had tall crests in front of the eyes on the lacrimal bones, while &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had extremely thickened postorbital bones forming crescent-shaped crests behind the eyes. &quot;Alioramus&quot; had a row of six bony crests on top of its snout, arising from the nasal bones; lower crests have been reported on some specimens of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, as well as the more basal tyrannosauroid &quot;Appalachiosaurus&quot;. The snout and other parts of the skull also sported numerous foramina. According to the 2017 study which described &quot;D. horneri&quot;, scaly integument as well as tactile sensitivity was correlated with the multiple rows of neurovascular foramina seen in crocodilians and tyrannosaurids.

Tyrannosaurids, like their tyrannosauroid ancestors, were heterodonts, with premaxillary teeth &quot;D&quot;-shaped in cross section and smaller than the rest. Unlike earlier tyrannosauroids and most other theropods, the maxillary and mandibular teeth of mature tyrannosaurids are not blade-like but extremely thickened and often circular in cross-section, with some species having reduced serrations. Tooth counts tend to be consistent within species, and larger species tend to have lower tooth counts than smaller ones. For example, &quot;Alioramus&quot; had 76 to 78 teeth in its jaws, while &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; had between 54 and 60.

William Abler observed in 2001 that &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, so when a tyrannosaur would have pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla would have distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, &quot;impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity&quot; to the wood they work with. The use of a drill to create an &quot;ampulla&quot; of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect airplane surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called &quot;kerfs&quot; and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs and other theropods, ancient predators like phytosaurs and &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.

The skull was perched at the end of a thick, &quot;S&quot;-shaped neck, and a long, heavy tail acted as a counterweight to balance out the head and torso, with the center of mass over the hips. Tyrannosaurids are known for their proportionately very small two-fingered forelimbs, although remnants of a vestigial third digit are sometimes found. &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had the shortest forelimbs compared to its body size, while &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; had the longest.

Tyrannosaurids walked exclusively on their hindlimbs, so their leg bones were massive. In contrast to the forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size than almost any other theropods. Juveniles and even some smaller adults, like more basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of cursorial (fast-running) dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, but not to the extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between the second and fourth metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus. Tyrannosaurids also had large preserved leg muscle attachments and low rotational inertia relative to their body mass, indicating that they could turn more quickly than other large theropods.

It is unclear when the arctometatarsus first evolved; it was not present in the earliest tyrannosauroids like &quot;Dilong&quot;, but was found in the later &quot;Appalachiosaurus&quot;. This structure also characterized troodontids, ornithomimids and caenagnathids, but its absence in the earliest tyrannosauroids indicates that it was acquired by convergent evolution.

===Soft tissue reconstruction===
A comparative analysis of the teeth suggests that tyrannosaurids, as well as the other large theropods, had lips that protected their teeth from external damage. This anatomical feature gave these animals more visual resemblance to lepidosaurs than to closely related crocodilians.

==Classification==
The name Deinodontidae was coined by Edward Drinker Cope in 1866 for this family, and continued to be used in place of the newer name Tyrannosauridae through the 1960s. The type genus of the Deinodontidae is &quot;Deinodon&quot;, which was named after isolated teeth from Montana. However, in a 1970 review of North American tyrannosaurs, Dale Russell concluded that &quot;Deinodon&quot; was not a valid taxon, and used the name Tyrannosauridae in place of Deinodontidae, stating that this was in accordance with ICZN rules. Therefore, Tyrannosauridae is preferred by modern experts.

&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905, along with the family Tyrannosauridae. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;τυραννος&quot; (&#x27;) (&#x27;tyrant&#x27;) and (&#x27;) (&#x27;lizard&#x27;). The very common suffix &quot;-idae&quot; is normally appended to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix &quot;-ιδαι&quot; &quot;-&quot;, which indicates a plural noun.

===Taxonomy===

Tyrannosauridae is a family in rank-based Linnaean taxonomy, within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea and the suborder Theropoda.

Tyrannosauridae is uncontroversially divided into two subfamilies. Albertosaurinae comprises the North American genera &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, while Tyrannosaurinae includes &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, &quot;Teratophoneus&quot;, &quot;Bistahieversor&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, &quot;Nanuqsaurus&quot;, &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; itself. Some authors include the species &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot; in the genus &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; in the genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, while others prefer to retain &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; as separate genera. Albertosaurines are characterized by more slender builds, lower skulls, and proportionately longer tibiae than tyrannosaurines. In tyrannosaurines, the sagittal crest on the parietals continues forward onto the frontals. In 2014, Lü Junchang &quot;et al.&quot; described the Alioramini as a tribe within the Tyrannosauridae containing the genera &quot;Alioramus&quot; and &quot;Qianzhousaurus&quot;. Their phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tribe was located at the base of the Tyrannosaurinae. Some authors, such as George Olshevsky and Tracy Ford, have created other subdivisions or tribes for various combinations of tyrannosaurids within the subfamilies. However, these have not been phylogenetically defined, and usually consisted of genera that are now considered synonymous with other genera or species.

Additional subfamilies have been named for more fragmentary genera, including Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera &quot;Aublysodon&quot; and &quot;Deinodon&quot; are usually considered &quot;nomina dubia&quot;, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, &quot;Raptorex&quot;, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. However, as it is known only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. However, Thomas Carr maintains its validity and finds it to be similar to tyrannosaurines.

===Phylogeny===
With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to either &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Aublysodon&quot; or &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;. However, &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; is often considered to be a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, while &quot;Aublysodon&quot; is usually regarded as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; unsuitable for use in the definition of a clade. Definitions since then have been based on more well-established genera.

In 2001, Thomas R. Holtz Jr. published a cladistic analysis of the Tyrannosauridae. He concluded that there were two subfamilies: the more primitive Aublysodontinae, characterized by unserrated premaxillary teeth; and the Tyrannosaurinae. The Aublysodontinae included &quot;Aublysodon&quot;, the &quot;Kirtland &quot;Aublysodon&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;. Holtz also found that &quot;Siamotyrannus&quot; exhibited some of the synapomorphies of the tyrannosauridae, but lay &quot;outside the family] proper.&quot;

Later in the same paper, he proposed that Tyrannosauridae be defined as &quot;all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Aublysodon&quot;&quot;. He also criticized definitions previously proposed by other workers, like one proposed by Paul Sereno, that the Tyrannosauridae was &quot;all taxa closer to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Aublysodon&quot;, and &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot;&quot;. Holtz observed that since &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; was probably a misidentified &quot;T. rex&quot; juvenile, Sereno&#x27;s proposed definition would have the family Tyrannosauridae as a subtaxon of the genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Further, his proposed definition of the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae would also be limited to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

A 2003 attempt by Christopher Brochu included &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Alioramus&quot;, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 to use all of the above as specifiers except for &quot;Alioramus&quot; and &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a completely different definition, including all theropods more closely related to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Eotyrannus&quot;. The most recent definition is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

Cladistic analyses of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to be sister taxa, with &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; more basal than either. A close relationship between &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, the presence of a crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; as a basal member of a clade also including &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot;, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. &quot;Alioramus&quot; was found to be the closest relative of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.

A related study also noted a locking mechanism in the lower jaw shared between the two genera. In a separate paper, Currie noted the possibility that &quot;Alioramus&quot; might represent a juvenile &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, but stated that the much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in &quot;Alioramus&quot; suggest it is a distinct genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of &quot;Nanotyrannus&quot; to suggest that it may be a distinct genus, rather than a juvenile &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of &quot;Qianzhousaurus&quot; reveals that &quot;Alioramus&quot; is not a close relation to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, instead belonging to a newly described tribe of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. &quot;Qianzhousaurus&quot; further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.

==Paleobiology==
===Growth===

Paleontologist Gregory Erickson and colleagues have studied the growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone histology can determine the age of a specimen when it died. Growth rates can be examined when the age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph. Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. A tyrannosaurid growth curve is S-shaped, with the maximum growth rate of individuals around 14 years of age.

The smallest known &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; individual (LACM 28471, the &quot;Jordan theropod&quot;) is estimated to have weighed only at only 2 years old, while the largest, such as FMNH PR2081 (&quot;Sue&quot;), most likely weighed about , estimated to have been 28 years old, an age which may have been close to the maximum for the species. &quot;T. rex&quot; juveniles remained under until approximately 14 years of age, when body size began to increase dramatically. During this rapid growth phase, a young &quot;T. rex&quot; would gain an average of a year for the next four years. This slowed after 16 years, and at 18 years of age, the curve plateaus again, indicating that growth slowed dramatically. For example, only separated the 28-year-old &quot;Sue&quot; from a 22-year-old Canadian specimen (RTMP 81.12.1). This sudden change in growth rate may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis that is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of an 18-year-old &quot;T. rex&quot; from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as &quot;B-rex&quot;). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that &quot;B-rex&quot; was of reproductive age.

Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes. Compared to albertosaurines, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum growth rate in &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was per year, based on a mass estimate of in adults. Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;; this would change the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern. The youngest known &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about and measured slightly more than in length. The specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. The fastest growth rate is estimated to occur around 12–16 years of age, reaching per year, based on a adult, which is about a fifth of the rate for &quot;T.-rex&quot;. For &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, the calculated maximum growth rate is about during the rapid growth phase, which is comparable to that of &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;.
The discovery of an embryonic tyrannosaur of an as-yet-unknown genus suggests that tyrannosaurids developed their distinctive skeletal features while developing in the egg. Furthermore, the size of the specimen, a dentary from the lower jaw found in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana in 1983 and a foot claw found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in 2018 and described in 2020, suggests that neonate tyrannosaurids were born with skulls the size of a mouse or similarly sized rodents and may have been roughly the size of a small dog at birth. The jaw specimen is believed to have come from an animal roughly while the claw is believed to belong to a specimen measuring around . While eggshells have not been found in association with either specimen, the location where these neonate tyrannosaurids were uncovered suggests these animals were using the same nest sites as other species they lived with and preyed upon. The lack of eggshells associated with these specimens has also opened up speculation to the possibility that tyrannosaurids laid soft-shelled eggs as the genera &quot;Mussaurus&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; are believed to have done.

Fossil footprints from the Wapiti Formation suggest that as tyrannosaurids grew, the feet became wider with thicker toes to support their weight. The broader feet suggest that adult tyrannosaurids were slower-moving than their offspring.

===Life history===

The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals&#x27; lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals, such as humans and elephants. This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.

By tabulating the number of specimens of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in tyranosauridae populations. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. Over half of the known &quot;T. rex&quot; specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, partly due to the stresses of reproduction. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals, like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.

The tyrannosaurids spent as much as half its life in the juvenile phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This is seen in modern Komodo dragons, where hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. For example, &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs.

===Locomotion===
Locomotion abilities are best studied for &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and there are two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° – an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;″s mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.

Scientists have produced a wide range of maximum speed estimates, mostly around , but a few as low as , and a few as high as . Researchers have to rely on various estimating techniques because, while there are many tracks of very large theropods walking, so far none have been found of very large theropods running—and this absence &quot;may&quot; indicate that they did not run.

Jack Horner and Don Lessem argued in 1993 that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was slow and probably could not run (no airborne phase in mid-stride). However, Holtz (1998) concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were the fastest large theropods. Christiansen (1998) estimated that the leg bones of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur&#x27;s maximum speed would have been about , which is about the speed of a human sprinter. Farlow and colleagues (1995) have argued that a 6- to 8-ton &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; would have been critically or even fatally injured if it had fallen while moving quickly, since its torso would have slammed into the ground at a deceleration of 6 &quot;g&quot; (six times the acceleration due to gravity, or about 60 metres/s2) and its tiny arms could not have reduced the impact. However, giraffes have been known to gallop at , despite the risk that they might break a leg or worse, which can be fatal even in a &quot;safe&quot; environment such as a zoo. Thus it is quite possible that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; also moved fast when necessary and had to accept such risks; this scenario has been studied for &quot;Allosaurus&quot; too. Most recent research on &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; locomotion does not narrow down speeds further than a range from , i.e. from walking or slow running to moderate-speed running. A computer model study in 2007 estimated running speeds, based on data taken directly from fossils, and claimed that &quot;T. rex&quot; had a top running speed of . (Probably a juvenile individual.)
Studies by Eric Snively &quot;et al.,&quot; published in 2019 indicate that tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; itself were more manoeuvrable than allosauroids of comparable size due to low rotational inertia compared to their body mass combined with large leg muscles. As a result, it is hypothesized that tyrannosaurids were capable of making relatively quick turns and could likely pivot their bodies more quickly when close to their prey, or that while turning, they could &quot;pirouette&quot; on a single planted foot while the alternating leg was held out in a suspended swing during pursuit. The results of this study potentially could shed light on how agility could have contributed to the success of tyrannosaurid evolution.

Additionally, a 2020 study indicates that tyrannosaurids were exceptionally efficient walkers. Studies by Dececchi &quot;et al.&quot;, compared the leg proportions, body mass, and the gaits of more than 70 species of theropod dinosaurs including tyrannosaurids. The research team then applied a variety of methods to estimate each dinosaur&#x27;s top speed when running as well as how much energy each dinosaur expended while moving at more relaxed speeds such as when walking. Among smaller to medium-sized species such as dromaeosaurids, longer legs appear to be an adaptation for faster running, in line with previous results by other researchers. But for theropods weighing over , top running speed is limited by body size, so longer legs instead were found to have correlated with low-energy walking. The results of the study further indicated that smaller theropods evolved long legs for speed as a means to both aid in hunting and escape from larger predators while larger predatory theropods that evolved long legs did so to reduce the energy costs and increase foraging efficiency, as they were freed from the demands of predation pressure due to their role as apex predators. Compared to more basal groups of theropods in the study, tyrannosaurids showed a marked increase in foraging efficiency due to reduced energy expenditures during hunting and scavenging. This likely resulted in tyrannosaurs having a reduced need for hunting forays and requiring less food to sustain themselves as a result. Additionally, the research, in conjunction with studies that show tyrannosaurs were more agile than other large-bodied theropods, indicates they were quite well-adapted to a long-distance stalking approach followed by a quick burst of speed to go for the kill. Analogies can be noted between tyrannosaurids and modern wolves as a result, supported by evidence that at least some tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; were hunting in group settings.

===Integument===
An ongoing debate in the paleontological community surrounds the extent and nature of tyrannosaurid integumentary covering. Long filamentous structures have been preserved along with skeletal remains of numerous coelurosaurs from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation and other nearby geological formations from Liaoning, China. These filaments have usually been interpreted as &quot;protofeathers,&quot; homologous with the branched feathers found in birds and some non-avian theropods, although other hypotheses have been proposed. A skeleton of &quot;Dilong&quot; was described in 2004 that included the first example of &quot;protofeathers&quot; in a tyrannosauroid. Similarly to down feathers of modern birds, the &quot;protofeathers&quot; found in &quot;Dilong&quot; were branched but not pennaceous, and may have been used for insulation. The discovery and description of the feathered tyrannosauroid &quot;Yutyrannus&quot; in 2012 indicates the possibility large tyrannosaurids were also feathered as adults.

Based on the principle of phylogenetic bracketing, it was predicted that tyrannosaurids might also possess such feathering. However, a study in 2017 published by a team of researchers in Biology Letters described tyrannosaurid skin impressions collected in Alberta, Montana, and Mongolia, which came from five genera (&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;). Although the skin impressions are small, they are widely dispersed across the post-cranium, being collectively located on the abdomen, thoracic region, ilium, pelvis, tail, and neck. They show a tight pattern of fine, non-overlapping pebbly scales (which co-author Scott Persons compared to those seen on the flanks of a crocodile) and preserve no hints of feathering. The basic texture is composed of tiny &quot;basement scales&quot; approximately 1 to 2 mm in diameter, with some impressions showing 7 mm &quot;feature scales&quot; interspersed between them. Additional scales can be seen in tyrannosaurid footprints. Studies find that the facial integument of tyrannosaurids had scales on the dentary and maxilla, cornified epidermis and armor-like skin on the subordinate regions.

Bell &quot;et al.&quot; performed an ancestral character reconstruction based on what is known about integument distribution in tyrannosauroids. Despite an 89% probability that tyrannosauroids started out with feathers, they determined that scaly tyrannosaurids have a 97% probability of being true. The data &quot;provides compelling evidence of an entirely squamous covering in Tyrannosaurus,&quot; the team wrote, although they conceded that plumage may have still been present on the dorsal region where skin impressions haven&#x27;t been found yet. Bell &quot;et al.&quot; hypothesizes that the scale impressions of tyrannosaurids are possibly reticula which are secondarily derived from feathers though evidence is needed to support this. However, others argue that this is because of taphonomic bias in tyrannosaurids.

It has yet to be determined why such an integumentary change might have occurred. A precedent for feather loss can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost, and scales reappeared. Although gigantism has been suggested as a mechanism, Phil R. Bell, who co-authored the study, noted that the feathered &quot;Yutyrannus&quot; overlapped in size with &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;. &quot;The problem here is that we have big tyrannosaurs, some with feathers, some without that live in pretty similar climates. So what&#x27;s the reason for this difference? We really don&#x27;t know.&quot;

===Vision===

The eye-sockets of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; are positioned so that the eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision directly in front of their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is hard to see how natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and the &#x27;keyhole&#x27; shape of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

=== Facial sensitivity ===
Based on comparisons of bone texture of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; with extant crocodilians, a detailed study in 2017 by Thomas D. Carr &quot;et al.&quot; found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts.
At the center of these scales were small keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover bundles of sensory neurons that can detect mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also had bundles of sensory neurons under their facial scales and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and gently pick-up eggs and hatchlings.

===Bony crests===

Bony crests are found on the skulls of many theropods, including many tyrannosaurids. &quot;Alioramus&quot;, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of &quot;Appalachiosaurus&quot;, as well as some specimens of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. In &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.

===Thermoregulation===
&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, like most dinosaurs, was long thought to have an ectothermic (&quot;cold-blooded&quot;) reptilian metabolism but was challenged by scientists like Robert T. Bakker and John Ostrom in the early years of the &quot;Dinosaur Renaissance&quot;, beginning in the late 1960s. &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; itself was claimed to have been endothermic (&quot;warm-blooded&quot;), implying a very active lifestyle. Since then, several paleontologists have sought to determine the ability of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to regulate its body temperature. Histological evidence of high growth rates in young &quot;T. rex&quot;, comparable to those of mammals and birds, may support the hypothesis of a high metabolism. Growth curves indicate that, as in mammals and birds, &quot;T. rex&quot; growth was limited mostly to immature animals, rather than the indeterminate growth seen in most other vertebrates. It has been indicated that the temperature difference may have been no more than 4 to 5 °C (7 to 9 °F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that &quot;T. rex&quot; maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Later they found similar results in &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; specimens, who lived on a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time. Even if &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.

==Paleoecology==

===Coexistence of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;===

In the Dinosaur Park Formation, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; lived alongside a rarer species of the tyrannosaurine &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. This is one of the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. Similarly sized predators in modern predator guilds are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Niche differentiation between the Dinosaur Park tyrannosaurids is not well understood. In 1970, Dale Russell hypothesized that the more common &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; actively hunted fleet-footed hadrosaurs, while the rarer and more troublesome ceratopsians and ankylosaurians (horned and heavily armoured dinosaurs) were left to the more heavily built &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. However, a specimen of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; (OTM 200) from the contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation of Montana preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region.
Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, neither genus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; appears more common in northern formations like the Dinosaur Park, with species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana and in southwestern North America during the Campanian, while centrosaurines and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes. Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. At the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, hadrosaurines like &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; and chasmosaurines like &quot;Triceratops&quot; were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were rare.

===Social behavior===
There is limited evidence of social behavior among the tyrannosaurids. Researchers reported that a subadult and a juvenile skeleton were found in the same quarry as the &quot;Sue&quot; specimen, which has been used to support the hypothesis that tyrannosaurs may have lived in social groups of some kind. While there is no evidence of gregarious behavior in &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, there is evidence of some pack behavior for &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;.

A young specimen of the Dinosaur Park &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite marks on the face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While it is possible that the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, as well as in other theropod genera like &quot;Sinraptor&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.

Evidence that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; lived in social groups comes from a bonebed found in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The bonebed includes the remains of three &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, including a large adult, a small juvenile, and another individual of intermediate size. At least five hadrosaurs are preserved at the same location. Geologic evidence indicates that the remains were not brought together by river currents but that all of the animals were buried simultaneously at the same location. The hadrosaur remains are scattered and bear many marks from tyrannosaur teeth, indicating that the &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; were feeding on the hadrosaurs at the time of death. The cause of death is unknown. Currie speculates that the daspletosaurs formed a pack, although this cannot be stated with certainty. Other scientists are skeptical of the evidence for social groups in &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and other large theropods; Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have suggested that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing each other in the process.

The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 22 &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, the most individuals found in one locality of any Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; assemblage at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase. The near-absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation between the many individuals at the &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; bonebed quarry led Phil Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behavior. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.

While it generally remains controversial, evidence does exist that supports the theory that at least some tyrannosaurids were social. In British Columbia&#x27;s Wapiti Formation, a trackway composed of the footprints of three individual tyrannosaurids (named as the ichnogenus &quot;Bellatoripes fredlundi&quot;) was discovered by a local outfitter named Aaron Fredlund and described in the journal PLOS One by Richard McCrea et al. An examination of the trackway found no evidence of one trackway being left long after another had been made, further supporting the hypothesis that three individual tyrannosaurs were traveling together as a group. Further research revealed the animals were traveling at a speed of between and likely had a hip height of around 7 to 9 feet. As three different genera of tyrannosaurids (&quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, respectively) are known from the formation, it is unknown which genus was the maker of the trackway. Additional evidence in the form of a bone-bed from the Rainbows and Unicorns Quarry in Southern Utah&#x27;s Kaiparowits Formation described in 2021 attributed to &quot;Teratophoneus&quot; suggests other tyrannosaurids were also social animals. The fossils, consisting of four or possibly five different animals ranging from 4–22 years of age, suggest a mass mortality event, possibly caused by flooding, or less likely by cyanobacterial toxicosis, fire, or drought. The fact that all of the animals preserved seemed to have perished within a short timespan further strengthens the argument for gregarious behavior in tyrannosaurids, with the bone beds of such genera as &quot;Teratophoneus&quot;, &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; showcasing suggested social behavior may have been widespread amongst tyrannosauridae in general.

===Feeding===
Tyrannosaur tooth marks are the most commonly preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions. Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviors may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding.

Speculation on the pack-hunting habits of &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; were made by a few researchers who suggest that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between those of the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than an adult &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; in mass. However, as the preservation of behavior in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. Phil Currie speculates that the &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; formed packs to hunt, although this cannot be stated with certainty. There is no evidence of such gregarious behavior in &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;.

The debate about whether &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was a predator or a pure scavenger is as old as the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;″s close relative &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and concluded that it and therefore also &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was a pure scavenger, because the &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;″s teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; most scientists have agreed that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would have been happy to scavenge or steal another predator&#x27;s kill if it had the opportunity.

Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is currently the major advocate of the idea that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some of its potential prey could move quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.

Other evidence suggests hunting behavior in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned so that the eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and &quot;Triceratops&quot; that seemed to have survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators.
In 2023, a juvenile &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; with its &quot;in situ&quot; stomach contents containing two &quot;Citipes&quot; juveniles about a year old intact has been reported from the Dinosaur Park Formation. This juvenile would have been 5-7 years old at the time of death, measuring about long and weighing around . It is much larger than the two &quot;Citipes&quot; juveniles that weigh about , contrary to the assumption that tyrannosaurids fed on prey of their size once they reached , indicating that juvenile tyrannosaurids still consumed much smaller prey after exceeding a certain size threshold. The discovery of this specimen indicated that tyrannosaurids probably did not hunt in multigenerational packs, since its prey size is too small to share with the conspecifics. It is also a direct dietary evidence that reinforces the theory of &#x27;ontogenetic dietary shift&#x27; for tyrannosaurids, as previously inferred by ecological modeling and anatomical features among different age groups. Only the remains of the hindlimbs and caudal vertebrae of juvenile &quot;Citipes&quot; were present in the tyrannosaurid&#x27;s stomach cavity, suggesting that a juvenile &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; may have had preferential consumption of the muscular hindlimbs.

====Cannibalism==== 
Evidence also strongly suggests that tyrannosaurids were at least occasionally cannibalistic. &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; itself has strong evidence pointing towards it having been cannibalistic in at least a scavenging capacity based on tooth marks on the foot bones, humerus, and metatarsals of one specimen. Fossils from the Fruitland Formation, Kirtland Formation (both Campanian in age), and Maastichtian-aged Ojo Alamo Formation suggest that cannibalism was present in various tyrannosaurid genera of the San Juan Basin. The evidence gathered from the specimens suggests opportunistic feeding behavior in tyrannosaurids that cannibalized members of their own species.

===Distribution===
The earliest known tyranosaur remains occurred between 129.4 and 125 million years ago in Ishikawa, Japan near Lat 36.166668 lng 136.633331. Found by Marsh in 1881 and identified by H.F. Osborne in 1906, the age of the remains was determined by H. Matsuoka et al. in 2002. 
While earlier tyrannosauroids are found on all three northern continents, tyrannosaurid fossils are known only from North America and Asia. Sometimes fragmentary remains uncovered in the Southern Hemisphere have been reported as &quot;Southern Hemisphere tyrannosaurids,&quot; although these seem to have been misidentified abelisaurid fossils. 

Tyrannosaurid remains have never been recovered from eastern North America, while more basal tyrannosauroids, like &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot; and &quot;Appalachiosaurus&quot;, persisted there until the end of the Cretaceous, indicating that tyrannosaurids must have evolved in or dispersed into western North America after the continent was divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway in the middle of the Cretaceous. Tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in Alaska, which may have provided a route for dispersal between North America and Asia. &quot;Alioramus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; are found to be related in one cladistic analysis, forming a unique Asian branch of the family. This was later disproven with the discovery of &quot;Qianzhousaurus&quot; and the description of the tyrannosaur family Alioramini. Tyrannosaurid teeth from a large species of unknown variety were discovered in the Nagasaki Peninsula by researchers from the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, further expanding the range of the group. The teeth were estimated to be 81 million years old (Campanian Age).

Of the two subfamilies, tyrannosaurines appear to have been more widespread. Albertosaurines are unknown in Asia, which was home to the tyrannosaurines, such as &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;, and &quot;Qianzhousaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot; of the Alioramini. Both the Tyrannosaurinae and Albertosaurinae subfamilies were present in the Campanian and early Maastrichtian stages of North America, with tyrannosaurines like &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; ranging throughout the Western Interior, while the albertosaurines &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; are currently known only from the northwestern part of the continent.

By the late Maastrichtian, albertosaurines appear to have gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. This pattern is mirrored in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By the end of the Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; on February 2, 2016, by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr &quot;et al&quot;. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The study indicates that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; might have been an immigrant from Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendant of the closely related &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;&#x27; known range.

<text>Tarbosaurus ( ; meaning &quot;alarming lizard&quot;) is a genus of large tyrannosaurid dinosaur that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 70 million years ago (Maastrichtian age). It contains the single type species: Tarbosaurus bataar, which is known from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia, with more fragmentary remains found further afield in the Subashi Formation of China. &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; is represented by dozens of fossil specimens, including several complete skulls and skeletons. These remains have allowed studies focusing on its phylogeny, skull mechanics, and brain structure. Further fossil remains have been reported from other geologic formations of Asia, however, these remains are fragmentary and can not be confidently assigned to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; or the type species.

Like most known tyrannosaurids, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was a large bipedal predator, with the type specimen measuring approximately long, tall at the hips, and weighing up to . It had a unique locking mechanism in its jaw, equipped with about sixty large teeth, and the smallest arms relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered hands.

Although many species have been named, modern paleontologists recognize only one species, &quot;T. bataar&quot;. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which would make the genus &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; redundant. &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, if not synonymous, are considered to be very closely related genera. &quot;Alioramus&quot;, also from Mongolia, has previously been thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, though this has since been disproven with the discovery of &quot;Qianzhousaurus&quot; and the description of the tyrannosaurine tribe Alioramini.

&quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; lived in a humid floodplain dominated by deserts, forests and plains, and criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was an apex predator preying on other large dinosaurs, like ankylosaurids, such as &quot;Tarchia&quot; and &quot;Saichania&quot;, hadrosaurids, such as &quot;Saurolophus&quot; and &quot;Barsboldia&quot;, and sauropods, such as &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot;.

==Discovery and naming==
In 1946, a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert in the Ömnögovi Province turned up a large theropod skull and some vertebrae from the Nemegt Formation. In 1955, Evgeny Maleev, a Soviet paleontologist, made this specimen the holotype (PIN 551–1) of a new species, which he called &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot;. The specific name is a misspelling of the Mongolian word баатар/&quot;baatar&quot;, meaning &quot;hero&quot;. In the same year, Maleev also described and named three new theropod skulls, each associated with skeletal remains discovered by the same expedition in 1948 and 1949. The first of these, PIN 551–2, was named &quot;Tarbosaurus efremovi&quot;, a new generic name composed of the Ancient Greek words &quot;τάρβος&quot; (&#x27;), meaning &quot;terror&quot;, &quot;alarm&quot;, &quot;awe&quot;, or &quot;reverence&quot;, and (&#x27;), meaning &quot;lizard&quot;, and the species was named after Ivan Yefremov, a Russian paleontologist and science fiction author. The other two, PIN 553-1 and PIN 552–2, were also named as new species and assigned to the North American genus &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; as &quot;G. lancinator&quot; and &quot;G. novojilovi&quot;, respectively. All three of these latter specimens are smaller than the first.

A 1965 paper by A. K. Rozhdestvensky recognized all of Maleev&#x27;s specimens as different growth stages of the same species, which he believed to be distinct from the North American &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. He created a new combination, &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;, to include all the specimens described in 1955 and newer material. Later authors, including Maleev himself, agreed with Rozhdestvensky&#x27;s analysis, although some used the name &quot;Tarbosaurus efremovi&quot; instead of &quot;T. bataar&quot;.

American paleontologist Ken Carpenter re-examined the material in 1992. He concluded that it belonged to the genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, as originally published by Maleev, and lumped all the specimens into the species &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot; (except the remains that Maleev had named &quot;Gorgosaurus novojilovi&quot;). Carpenter thought this specimen represented a separate, smaller genus of tyrannosaurid, which he called &quot;Maleevosaurus novojilovi&quot;. George Olshevsky created the new generic name &quot;Jenghizkhan&quot; (after Genghis Khan) for &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot; in 1995, while also recognizing &quot;Tarbosaurus efremovi&quot; and &quot;Maleevosaurus novojilovi&quot;, for a total of three distinct, contemporaneous genera from the Nemegt Formation. A 1999 study subsequently reclassified &quot;Maleevosaurus&quot; as a juvenile &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. All research published since 1999 recognizes only a single species, which is either called &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; or &quot;Tyrannosaurus bataar&quot;.

After the original Soviet-Mongolian expeditions in the 1940s, Polish-Mongolian joint expeditions to the Gobi Desert began in 1963 and continued until 1971, recovering many new fossils, including new specimens of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; from the Nemegt Formation. Expeditions involving Japanese and Mongolian scientists between 1993 and 1998, as well as private expeditions hosted by Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie around the turn of the 21st century, discovered and collected even more &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; material. More than 30 specimens are known, including more than 15 skulls and several complete postcranial skeletons.

===Synonyms===

Chinese paleontologists discovered a partial skull and skeleton of a small theropod (IVPP V4878) in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China in the mid-1960s. In 1977, Dong Zhiming described this specimen, which was recovered from the Subashi Formation in Shanshan County, as a new genus and species, &quot;Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis&quot;. Gregory S. Paul recognized &quot;Shanshanosaurus&quot; as a tyrannosaurid in 1988, referring it to the now-defunct genus &quot;Aublysodon&quot;. Dong and Currie later re-examined the specimen and deemed it to be a juvenile of a larger species of tyrannosaurine. These authors refrained from assigning it to any particular genus, but suggested &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; as a possibility.

&quot;Albertosaurus periculosus&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus luanchuanensis&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus turpanensis&quot;, and &quot;Chingkankousaurus fragilis&quot; were all considered synonyms of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; in the second edition of the Dinosauria, but &quot;Chingkankousaurus&quot; has been assessed as dubious by Brusatte et al. (2013).

Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, &quot;Alioramus&quot; is another genus of tyrannosaurid from slightly older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded &quot;Alioramus&quot; was quite closely related to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that &quot;Alioramus&quot; might represent a juvenile &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, but he noted that the much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.

===Additional specimens===

In 1979 Dong Zhiming described several dinosaur remains from the strata of South China, reporting teeth, a dorsal vertebra, and several fragmentary foot bones of a tyrannosaurid. He tentatively referred these to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; sp. given some similarities in tooth morphology as well as the general geographic proximity to the Nemegt Formation. In 1993 Tomasz Jerzykiewiczz examined the general outcrops from the Bayan Mandahu Formation of China. In this paper, he reported isolated tyrannosaurid premaxillary and maxillary teeth, which he assigned to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; without anatomical comparisons. Lev A. Nessov in 1995 reported a partial femur from the Bostobe Formation of Kazakhstan and referred it as &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; sp. without any diagnosis.

In 2004, David B. Weishampel and team listed a dubious &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;? sp. as a component of the known dinosaur taxa of the Campanian-aged Djadokhta Formation without further ado. Despite this referral, scattered, and very sparse tyrannosaurid remains are occasionally found in the strata of the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia and none of these remains have ever been diagnostically assigned to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; or even &quot;T. bataar&quot;. In addition, the extreme conditions of the Djadokhta Formation suggest that the remains of tyrannosaurids and other large-bodied dinosaurs from this unit represent passing by taxa foreign to the region.

During a large fossil prospection led by the Hayashibara Museum of Natural Sciences-Mongolian Paleontological Center Joint Expedition, a juvenile tyrannosaurid was discovered in 2006 from the highly fossiliferous Bügiin Tsav locality where adult specimens of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; have been recovered. The specimen was found preserving a partial skeleton with a fairly complete skull. In 2011 this juvenile was formally described and referred to &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;, catalogued as MPC-D 107/7 within the collections of the Mongolian Paleontological Center.

===Poached specimens===
&quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; fossils are only found around the Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China, both of which ban their export, though some specimens have been looted by private collectors. A $1 million smuggling deal was uncovered when suspicions were raised about a catalog put out by Heritage Auctions for an event in New York City on May 20, 2012. By Mongolian law, any specimen found in the Gobi Desert was to rest at an appropriate Mongolian institution and there was little reasonable doubt that the &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; advertised on the catalog was a stolen one. The president of Mongolia and many paleontologists raised objections to the sale, which led to a last-minute investigation that confirmed that it was a specimen that can only be found in the Gobi Desert, rightfully belonging to Mongolia. During the court case (United States v. One &quot;Tyrannosaurus Bataar&quot; Skeleton), Eric Prokopi, the smuggler, pleaded guilty to illegal smuggling and the dinosaur was returned to Mongolia in 2013, where it is temporarily displayed on Sukhbaatar Square, the center of the city of Ulaanbaatar. Prokopi had sold the dinosaur with a partner and fellow commercial hunter in England named Christopher Moore. The case led to the repatriation of dozens of Mongolian dinosaurs, including several skeletons of &quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot;.

===Skin impressions and footprints===
Skin impressions were recovered from a large skeleton at the Bugiin Tsav locality that was subsequently destroyed by poachers. These impressions show non-overlapping scales with an average diameter of and pertain to the thoracic region of the individual, although the exact position can no longer be assessed due to the destruction of the skeleton.

Phil Currie and colleagues (2003) described two footprints from the Nemegt locality that probably pertain to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. These tracks represent natural casts, which means that only the sandy infill of the tracks, not the tracks themselves, are preserved. The better-preserved track features skin impressions over large areas on and behind the toe impressions that are similar to those discovered in Bugiin Tsav. It also features vertical parallel slide marks that were left by scales when the foot was pushed into the ground. The track measures in length, thus representing a large individual. The second track, although even larger, was affected by erosion and does not show any detail.

In 1997, Ken Carpenter reported a damaged &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; skull with impressions of a dewlap or throat pouch beneath the lower jaws, based on a personal communication from Konstantin Mikhailov. Carpenter speculated that the pouch may have been used for display, possibly being brightly colored and inflatable like a frigatebird&#x27;s. In a 2019 communication to Mickey Mortimer, Mikhailov confirmed that this specimen had not been collected because it was on a heavy stone slab. He revealed that it had been discovered by Sergei Kurzanov and that it was Kurzanov himself who had originally interpreted the impressions as a throat structure. This specimen may be the same as one that was purportedly destroyed by poachers in 1992.

==Description==

Although slightly smaller than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was one of the largest tyrannosaurines, with the type specimen PIN 551–1 measuring approximately long, tall at the hips, and weighing up to . Other adult specimens were bit smaller, as MPC-D 107/2, ZPAL.MgD-I/4 and PIN 552-1 were likely weigh around to . The largest known &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; skull is about long, which is larger than that of all other tyrannosaurids, aside from &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.
===Skull===

The skull was tall, like that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, but not as wide, especially towards the rear. The unexpanded rear of the skull meant that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;‘s eyes did not face directly forwards, suggesting that it lacked the binocular vision of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Large fenestrae in the skull reduced its overall weight and served as attachment points for muscles. Between 58 and 64 teeth lined its jaws. This tooth count is slightly more than that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, but fewer than in smaller tyrannosaurids, like &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot;.

Most of its teeth were ovalur in cross section, although the teeth of the premaxilla at the tip of the upper jaw had a &quot;D&quot;-shaped cross section. However, this heterodonty is characteristic of the family. The longest teeth were in the maxilla (upper jaw bone), with crowns up to 85 millimeters (3.3 in) long. In the lower jaw, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, creating a locking mechanism unique to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Alioramus&quot;. Other tyrannosaurids lacked this ridge and had more flexibility in the lower jaw.

===Postcranial skeleton===

Tyrannosaurids varied little in overall body form and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was no exception. The head was supported by an &quot;S&quot;-shaped neck, while the rest of the vertebral column, including the tail, was held horizontally. &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had tiny arms, proportionably to body size the smallest of all members in the family. The hands had two clawed digits each, with an additional unclawed third metacarpal found in some specimens, similar to those of closely related genera. Holtz has suggested that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; also has a theropod reduction of fingers IV-I &quot;developed further&quot; than in other tyrannosaurids, as the second metacarpal in the &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; specimens he studied is less than twice the length of the first metacarpal. Other tyrannosaurids have a second metacarpal about twice the length of the first metacarpal. Also, the third metacarpal in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; is proportionally shorter than in other tyrannosaurids. In other tyrannosaurids, like &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, the third metacarpal is often longer than the first metacarpal, while in the &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; specimens studied by Holtz, the third metacarpal is shorter than the first. In contrast to the arms, the three-toed legs were long, thick, and muscular to support the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, while also placing the center of gravity directly over the hips.

==Classification==
&quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; is classified as a theropod in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae of the family Tyrannosauridae. Other members include &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and the earlier &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus &quot;Alioramus&quot;. Animals in this subfamily are more closely related to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and are known for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femurs than in the other subfamily, Albertosaurinae.

&quot;Tarbosaurus bataar&quot; was originally described as a species of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, an arrangement that has been supported by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as sister taxa. A 2003 cladistic analysis based on skull features instead identified &quot;Alioramus&quot; as the closest known relative of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, as the two genera share skull characteristics that are related to stress distribution and are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship would argue against &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; being a synonym of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and would suggest that separate tyrannosaurine lineages evolved in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of &quot;Alioramus&quot;, which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony bumps along the top of their snouts.

The discovery of &quot;Lythronax argestes&quot;, a much earlier tyrannosaurine, further reveals the close relationship between &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. It was also discovered that &quot;Lythronax&quot; is a sister taxon to a clade consisting of Campanian genus &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;, and the Maastrichtian genera &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. Further studies of &quot;Lythronax&quot; also suggest that the Asian tyrannosauroids were part of one evolutionary radiation.

Below is the cladogram of Tyrannosaurinae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Voris and team in 2020.

==Paleobiology==
===Ontogeny===

Most specimens of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; represent adult or subadult individuals, while juveniles remain very rare. Nevertheless, the 2006 discovery of a juvenile individual (MPC-D 107/7) with a complete, long skull was reported and described in 2011, providing information on the life history of this dinosaur. This individual was probably 2 to 3 years old at the time of death. Compared to adult skulls, the juvenile skull was weakly constructed and the teeth were thin, indicating different food preferences in juveniles and adults that reduced competition between different age groups. Examination of the sclerotic rings in this juvenile &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; suggests they may also have been crepuscular or nocturnal hunters. Whether or not the adult &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; were also nocturnal is currently unknown due to the lack of fossil evidence to suggest so. Ontogenetic changes identified in the frontal bones suggests that the allometric growth of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was similar to that of North American tyrannosaurids.

===Senses===

A &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; skull found in 1948 by Soviet and Mongolian scientists (PIN 553–1, originally called &quot;Gorgosaurus lancinator&quot;) included the skull cavity that held the brain. Making a plaster cast, called an &quot;endocast&quot;, of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about the shape of a &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; brain. A newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; brain structure and function.

The endocranial structure of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was similar to that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, differing only in the positions of some cranial nerve roots, including the trigeminal and accessory nerves. Tyrannosaurid brains were more similar to those of crocodilians and other nonavian reptiles than they were to birds. The total brain volume for a long &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; is estimated at only .

The large size of the olfactory bulbs, as well as the terminal and olfactory nerves, suggest that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had a highly keen sense of smell, as was also the case with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The vomeronasal bulb is large and differentiated from the olfactory bulb, which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed Jacobsen&#x27;s organ, which was used to detect pheromones. This may imply that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers because they are not present in any living archosaurs.

The auditory nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, which may have been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which had forward-facing eyes that provided accurate binocular vision, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. It has been suggested that the lack of binocular vision in Asian tyrannosaurs, like &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, might have been correlated with a greater amount of scavenging resources provided by sauropod carcasses, which might have afforded them a less active predatory lifestyle when compared to the North American forms, meaning they would need less predatory adaptations. However, this is contradicted by numerous lines of evidence indicating &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was actively preying on hadrosaurs, titanosaur sauropods, and other large bodied herbivores in its ecosystem.

===Skull mechanics===
The skull of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was completely described for the first time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, force was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.

&quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; lacked these bony struts and the connection between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal, and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw much more rigid.

Another major difference between &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible. While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones in the rear of the mandible and the dentary in the front, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.

Some scientists have hypothesized that the more rigid skull of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was an adaptation to hunting the massive titanosaurid sauropods found in the Nemegt Formation, which did not exist in most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in &quot;Alioramus&quot; from Mongolia, suggesting that it is the closest relative of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. Similarities between &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; might be related to their large size, independently developed through convergent evolution.

===Bite force and feeding===

In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events, they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. None of the eighteen &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; foot bones examined in the study were found to have a stress fracture, but one of the ten examined hand bones was found to have one. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey. The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions, in general, provide evidence for a &quot;very active&quot; predation-based diet instead of obligate scavenging.

As for its bite force, it was revealed in 2005 that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; had a bite force of around 8,000 to 10,000 pounds per square inch of force, meaning that it could crush bones just like its North American relative, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

David W. E. Hone and Mahito Watabe in 2011 reported the left humerus of a nearly complete &quot;Saurolophus&quot; skeleton (MPC-D 100/764) from the Bügiin Tsav locality of the Nemegt Formation, which was heavily damaged from bite marks attributed to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. As suggested by the lack of damage to the rest of the skeleton (such as large wounds in skeletal remains indicative of predation), this tyrannosaurid was likely scavenging an already dead &quot;Saurolophus&quot;. It is unlikely that a large-bodied predator, such as &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, would have left sparse feeding traces on a single humerus when having an entire carcass to feed on. The humerus shows three distinctive feeding methods, interpreted as punctures, drag marks, and bite−and−drag marks. Hone and Watabe noted that bite marks were mostly located at the deltopectoral crest, suggesting that this &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; was actively selecting which biting style to employ so it could scavenge the bone.

In 2012, bite marks on two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype specimen of the large ornithomimosaur &quot;Deinocheirus mirificus&quot; were reported. The size and shape of the bite marks match the teeth of &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified. These include punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.

A 2020 study involving stable isotopes found that &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; primarily hunted large dinosaurs in its environment, most notably titanosaurs and hadrosaurs.

==Paleoenvironment==
=== Nemegt Formation ===

The vast majority of known &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; fossils were recovered from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage at the near end of the Late Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago.

&quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; is found chiefly in the Nemegt Formation, whose sediments preserve large river channels and soil deposits that indicate a far more humid climate than those suggested by the underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.

Occasional mollusk fossils are found, as well as a variety of other aquatic animals, such as fish and turtles. Crocodilians included several species of &quot;Paralligator&quot;, a genus with teeth adapted for crushing shells. Mammal fossils are exceedingly rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds have been found, including the enantiornithine &quot;Gurilynia&quot; and the hesperornithiform &quot;Judinornis&quot;, as well as &quot;Teviornis&quot;, an early representative of the still-existing Anseriformes. Scientists have described many dinosaurs from the Nemegt Formation, including the ankylosaurids &quot;Tarchia&quot; and &quot;Saichania&quot; and pachycephalosaur &quot;Prenocephale&quot;.

By far the largest predator known from the formation, adult &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; most likely preyed upon large hadrosaurs, such as &quot;Saurolophus&quot; and &quot;Barsboldia&quot;, or sauropods, such as &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot;. Adults would have received little competition from small theropods, such as the small tyrannosaurid &quot;Alioramus&quot;, troodontids (&quot;Borogovia&quot;, &quot;Tochisaurus&quot;, &quot;Zanabazar&quot;), oviraptorosaurs (&quot;Elmisaurus&quot;, &quot;Nemegtomaia&quot;, &quot;Rinchenia&quot;) or &quot;Bagaraatan&quot;, sometimes considered a basal tyrannosauroid. Other theropods, like the gigantic &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, might have been herbivorous and ornithomimosaurs, such as &quot;Anserimimus&quot;, &quot;Gallimimus&quot;, and gigantic &quot;Deinocheirus&quot; might have been omnivores that only took small prey and were therefore no competition for &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. However, as in other large tyrannosaurids, as well as modern Komodo dragons, juveniles and subadult &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; would have filled niches between the massive adults and these smaller theropods.

<text>Daspletosaurus ( ; meaning &quot;frightful lizard&quot;) is a genus of tyrannosaurid dinosaur that lived in Laramidia between about 78 and 74.4 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous Period. The genus &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; contains three named species. Fossils of the earlier type species, D. torosus, have been found in Alberta, while fossils of a later species, D. horneri, have been found only in Montana. D. wilsoni has been suggested as an intermediate species between &quot;D. torosus&quot; and &quot;D. horneri&quot; that evolved through anagenesis, though further research may be required to definitively support the theory.

There are also multiple specimens which may represent new species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; from Alberta and Montana, but these have not been formally described. The taxon &quot;Thanatotheristes&quot; has been suggested to represent a species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, &quot;D. degrootorum&quot;, but this has not been widely supported. &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; is closely related to the much larger and more recent tyrannosaurid &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. Like most tyrannosaurids, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was a large bipedal predator, with the average adult measuring and weighing . However, the largest potential specimen measures around long and weighs up to . &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer than in other genera.

As an apex predator equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was at the top of the food chain, probably preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid &quot;Centrosaurus&quot; and the hadrosaur &quot;Hypacrosaurus&quot;. In some areas, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; fossils are not as common as other tyrannosaurid fossils, the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet, and life history.

== Discovery and naming ==

The type specimen of &quot;Daspletosaurus torosus&quot; (CMN 8506) is a partial skeleton including the skull, the shoulder, a forelimb, the pelvis, a femur, and all of the vertebrae from the neck, torso, and hip, as well as the first eleven tail vertebrae. It was discovered in 1921 near Steveville, Alberta, by Charles Mortram Sternberg, who thought it was a new species of &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;. It was not until 1970 that the specimen was fully described by Dale Russell, who made it the type of a new genus, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, from the Greek δασπλής (&#x27;, stem and connective vowel resulting in &#x27;-) (&quot;frightful&quot;) and () (&quot;lizard&quot;). The type species is &quot;Daspletosaurus torosus&quot;, the specific name &quot;torosus&quot; being Latin for &#x27;muscular&#x27; or &#x27;brawny&#x27;. Aside from the type, there is only one other well-known specimen, RTMP 2001.36.1, a relatively complete skeleton discovered in 2001. Both specimens were recovered from the Oldman Formation in the Judith River Group of Alberta. The Oldman Formation was deposited during the middle Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, from about 79.5 to 77 Ma (million years ago).

Dale Russell also suggested that a specimen of an immature &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; (CMN 11315) from the younger Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta actually belonged to a third specimen of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; as &quot;D.&quot; cf. &quot;torosus&quot;, extending the temporal range of the genus by approximately 3.5 million years into the Maastrichtian. He based this referral on features of its limb and pelvic girdle, as well as the curvature of the hand claws, which he interpreted as traits matching &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. This reassignment was not universally accepted, and thorough re-examination of the specimen favored its initial referral to &quot;Albertosaurus sarcophagus&quot;, despite lacking many of the diagnostic skeletal traits used to identify mature tyrannosaurids. An additional maxilla and various teeth from an &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;-dominated bonebed in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was also mistakenly referred to &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, but all the tyrannosaurid material has all since been confirmed to belong to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;.

=== Assigned species ===

Over the years, various additional species have been assigned to the genus &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. Though some have been designated as &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; spp, this does not imply that they all represent the same species.

Along with the holotype, Russell designated a specimen collected by Barnum Brown in 1913 as the paratype of &quot;D. torosus&quot;. This specimen (AMNH 5438) consists of parts of the hindleg, the pelvis, and some of its associated vertebrae. It was discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. The Dinosaur Park Formation was formerly known as the Upper Oldman Formation and dates back to the middle Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8 million years ago. &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; fossils are known specifically from the middle to upper section of the formation, between 75.6 and 75.0 million years ago. In 1914, Brown collected a nearly complete skeleton and skull; forty years later his American Museum of Natural History sold this specimen to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. It was mounted for display in Chicago and labeled as &quot;Albertosaurus libratus&quot; for many years, but after several skull features were later found to be modeled in plaster, including most of the teeth, the specimen (FMNH PR308) was reassigned to &quot;Daspletosaurus torosus&quot; by Thomas Carr in 1999. A total of eight specimens have been collected from the Dinosaur Park Formation over the years since, most of them within the boundaries of Dinosaur Provincial Park. Phil Currie believes that the Dinosaur Park specimens represent a new species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, distinguished by certain features of the skull. Pictures of this new species have been published, but it still awaits a name and full description in print. In 2024, Warshaw and colleagues suggested that the Dinosaur Park specimens likely belong to &quot;D. wilsoni&quot;.

A new tyrannosaurid specimen (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, ribs, and parts of the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus &quot;Aublysodon&quot;. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, along with a few others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus &quot;Bistahieversor&quot;.

In 1992, Jack Horner and colleagues published an extremely preliminary report of a tyrannosaurid from the upper parts of the Campanian Two Medicine Formation in Montana, which was interpreted as a transitional species between &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and the later &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Currie (2003) stated that the tyrannosaurid from the Two Medicine Formation mentioned by Horner &quot;et al.&quot; (1992) may be an unnamed third species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;. Another partial skeleton was reported from the Upper Two Medicine in 2001, preserving the remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its abdominal cavity. This specimen was assigned to &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; but not to any particular species. The remains of at least three more &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; have also been described in a Two Medicine bonebed by Currie &quot;et al.&quot; (2005); the authors stated that this fossil material likely represents then-unnamed species mentioned by Horner &quot;et al.&quot; (1992), but cautioned that further study and description of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; would be necessary before the species can be determined with certainty. In 2017, the Two Medicine Formation taxon was named as the new species &quot;D. horneri&quot;.

Isolated tyrannosaurid teeth in the upper portions of the Judith River Formation are likely from &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; as well as some species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, probably &quot;D. torosus&quot;. In 2009, preliminary preparation of a &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; specimen from the Coal Ridge Member of the Judith River Formation measuring about long was reported. Some researchers assigned this specimen to &quot;D. torosus&quot;, while others considered it to be a distinct species yet to be named, referred to as &quot;D.&quot; sp. In the lower portion of the Judith River Formation, around 78 million years ago, there is some evidence for a new undescribed tyrannosaurid taxon. A specimen in the collections of Triebold Paleontology excavated between 2002 and 2004, known as &quot;Sir William&quot; (RMDRC 2002.MT-001), shows some characteristics of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; suggesting a new earlier species to the genus. However, the specimen shows many characteristics typical of early tyrannosaurines such as &quot;Teratophoneus&quot; and even some of the later &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which may suggest an entirely new genus.

In 2017, John Wilson discovered the bones of a tyrannosaurid, including a partial disarticulated skull, cervical, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, and a rib, chevron, and first metatarsal, from the &quot;Jack’s B2&quot; site of the Judith River Formation. Elías A. Warshaw and Denver W. Fowler described these remains (BDM 107) in 2022 as belonging to a new species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, &quot;D. wilsoni&quot;. It represents a transitional species between &quot;D. torosus&quot; and &quot;D. horneri&quot;, as it existed between them in time. It has been suggested that the three species may have evolved directly through anagenesis, but this theory was disputed by Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad (2024) who suggested that &quot;D. wilsoni&quot; may be a junior synonym of &quot;D. torosus&quot;, while Warshaw et al. (2024) supported the validity of this species and referred other specimens to it. In 2025, Scherer also supported the theory that tyrannosaurines including &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; evolved through anagenesis, and accepted the validity of &quot;D. wilsoni&quot;.

== Description ==

While very large by the standard of modern predators, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was not the largest tyrannosaurid. Adults could reach a length of from snout to tail, a hip height of , and a body mass of . However there is one potential specimen of &quot;D. torosus&quot; or a new unnamed species, CMC VP 15826 (nicknamed &quot;Pete III&quot;), that suggests the genus could reach lengths of nearly and weigh .

===Skull===

&quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; had a massive skull that could reach more than in length. The bones were heavily constructed and some, including the nasal bones on top of the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla at the end of the upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and the &#x27;keyhole&#x27; shape of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Split carinae (edges) have been found on &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; teeth.

===Postcranial skeleton===

&quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; shared the same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck supporting the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with the center of gravity over the hips.

===Soft tissue reconstruction===
From a comparison of the degree of wear of teeth of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; with other extinct and extant animals, it is concluded that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, as well as other non-avian theropods, had lips that protected the teeth from external influences. Due to this feature, the snout of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; more closely resembled lizards than crocodiles, which lack lips.

A skin impression from &quot;Daspletosaurus torosus&quot; has been described, showing small polygonal scales measuring 3 mm in diameter. The placement of the scales on the body is not known.

== Classification and systematics ==
&quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; belongs in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae, along with &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and Alioramini. Animals in this subfamily are more closely related to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; than to &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; and are known – with the exception of &quot;Alioramus&quot; – for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femora than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae. It further belongs to the tribe Daspletosaurini, consisting of it and the taxon &quot;Thanatotheristes&quot;.

&quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; is usually considered to be closely related to &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, or even a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned &quot;D. torosus&quot; to the genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, creating the new combination &quot;Tyrannosaurus torosus&quot;, but this has not been generally accepted. Many researchers believe &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; to be more closely related to &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and other Asian tyrannosaurids like &quot;Alioramus&quot; than to the North American &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; have become clearer as new species have been described.

Below is a cladogram of Tyrannosaurinae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Warshaw &amp; Fowler (2022). Here, it is proposed that the three &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; species evolved through anagenesis in the Tyrannosaurinae in a line leading to &quot;Zhuchengtyrannus&quot;, &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Due to their more fragmentary nature, &quot;Thanatotheristes&quot; and &quot;Nanuqsaurus&quot; were excluded from this analysis.

In 2024, Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad argued that the stratigraphic ranges of &quot;D. torosus&quot;, &quot;D. wilsoni&quot; and an unnamed species from the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation show a clear overlap, indicating that anagenesis may not be the predominant factor of speciation within the genus, since all species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; were contemporaneous with each other at some point during its evolution. Phylogenetic analyzes resolved &quot;D. horneri&quot; as the most basal species, in spite of being the youngest species stratigraphically. While the authors did not completely refute the possibility that anagenesis was the main driver of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; evolution based on the intermediate morphological features, they also suggested that &quot;D. wilsoni&quot; may be a junior synonym of &quot;D. torosus&quot;, since there is a near lack of autapomorphic characters that can differentiate this species. They also claimed that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; did not evolve from &quot;Thanatotheristes&quot;, since they found no support on the basis of morphological and stratigraphical data, and that anagenesis will not be supported unequivocally due to the limited sample and nature of the fossil record, which does not show a great degree of variation in morphology. The cladogram presented for their phylogenetic analysis is shown below.
In the same year, Warshaw and colleagues supported the anagenesis theory by referring other specimens to &quot;D. wilsoni&quot; (including the Dinosaur Park specimen) which they considered as a valid taxon, and by reanalysing the previous study of Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad (2024). They claimed that the known species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; show a gradient of morphologies consistent with them representing a series of ancestors and descendants. They also argued that there is no stratigraphic overlap between &quot;D. torosus&quot; and &quot;D. wilsoni&quot;, since a large specimen (CMC VP 15826) previously referred to as &quot;D. torosus&quot; is from a strata recently dated to be later than &quot;D. wilsoni&quot;, and since this specimen likely belongs to a distinct species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; yet to be named. They also recovered the paraphyletic &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; at the base of Tyrannosaurini, making the genus ancestral to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

In 2025, contrary to his initial skepticism, Scherer supported the theory that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; evolved through anagenesis based on his reevaulation of the evidence for anagenesis and cladogenesis in tyrannosaurines. He recovered the genus &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; as paraphyletic, forming an evolutionary grade within Tyrannosaurinae, but not as a direct ancestor of Tyrannosaurini based on the fragmentary tyrannosaurine specimens probably from the Campanian age, including &quot;Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis&quot;, which bear strong similarities to &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

== Paleobiology ==
===Senses===
There are indications of &quot;D. horneri&quot; possessing integumentary sensory organs, possibly used in touch, modulation of precise jaw movements, temperature reading, and prey detection. The large flat scales may have further protected the snout during prey capture and intra-specific combat.

=== Social behavior ===

A full-grown Dinosaur Park &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; (TMP 85.62.1) exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks on its skull. While it is possible that the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression such as facial biting is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, as well as in other theropod genera like &quot;Sinraptor&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group. A young specimen of the tyrannosaurid (TMP 1994.143.1), initially identified as the Dinosaur Park &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; but subsequently referred to &quot;Gorgosaurus libratus&quot;, also shows bite marks on the face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite.

Evidence that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; lived in social groups comes from a bonebed found in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The bonebed includes the remains of three &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, including a large adult, a small juvenile, and another individual of intermediate size. At least five hadrosaurs are preserved at the same location. Geologic evidence indicates that the remains were not brought together by river currents but that all of the animals were buried simultaneously at the same location. The hadrosaur remains are scattered and bear numerous marks from tyrannosaur teeth, indicating that the &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; were feeding on the hadrosaurs at the time of death. The cause of death is unknown. Currie speculates that the daspletosaurs formed a pack, although this cannot be stated with certainty. Other scientists are skeptical of the evidence for social groups in &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and other large theropods;
Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have suggested that &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing each other in the process.

Fossils of other tyrannosaurids like &quot;Teratophoneus&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; among other genera suggest that gregarious behavior may have been widespread in tyrannosaurs and thus may vindicate the hypothesis of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; being a social animal, as bonebeds of these genera containing multiple specimens in a wide range of ages have been excavated and described from these different genera. 
Evidence of cannibalism in &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was published in 2015.

=== Life history ===

Paleontologist Gregory Erickson and colleagues have studied the growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone histology can determine the age of a specimen when it died. Growth rates can be examined when the ages of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph. Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. Erickson only examined &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum growth rate in &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was 180 kilograms (400 lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of in adults. Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;; this would change the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern.

By tabulating the number of specimens of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in a population of &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;. Their analysis showed that, while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.

A 2009 study found evidence of &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot;-like infection in the jaws of various specimens of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;.

== Paleoecology ==

All known &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; fossils have been found in formations dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 78 and 74.4 million years ago. Since the middle of the Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface. However, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west, which began during the time of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway, carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation, the Judith River Group, and other sedimentary formations in the region. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale.

&quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; lived in a vast floodplain along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support a great deal of plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas, and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.

The excellent vertebrate fossil record of Two Medicine and Judith River rocks resulted from a combination of abundant animal life, periodic natural disasters, and the deposition of large amounts of sediment. Many types of freshwater and estuarine fish are represented, including sharks, rays, sturgeons, gars, and others. The Judith River Group preserves the remains of many aquatic amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, turtles, &quot;Champsosaurus&quot; and crocodilians. Terrestrial lizards, including whiptails, skinks, monitors, and alligator lizards have also been discovered. Azhdarchid pterosaurs, and birds like &quot;Apatornis&quot; and &quot;Avisaurus&quot; flew overhead, while several varieties of mammals coexisted with &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and other types of dinosaurs in the various formations that make up the Judith River wedge.

In the Oldman Formation (the geological equivalent of the Judith River formation), &quot;Daspletosaurus torosus&quot; could have preyed upon the hadrosaur species &quot;Brachylophosaurus canadensis&quot;, the ceratopsians &quot;Coronosaurus brinkmani&quot; and &quot;Albertaceratops nesmoi&quot;, pachycephalosaurs, ornithomimids, therizinosaurs, and possibly ankylosaurs. Other predators included troodontids, oviraptorosaurs, the dromaeosaurid &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;, and possibly an albertosaurine tyrannosaur (genus currently unknown). The younger Dinosaur Park and Two Medicine Formations had faunas similar to the Oldman, with the Dinosaur Park in particular preserving an unrivaled array of dinosaurs. The albertosaurine &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; lived alongside unnamed species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; in the Dinosaur Park and Upper Two Medicine environments. Young tyrannosaurs may have filled the niches in between adult tyrannosaurs and smaller theropods, which were separated by two orders of magnitude in mass. A &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot; dentary has been discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation that bore tooth marks left by the bite of a young tyrannosaur, possibly &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;.

=== Coexistence with &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; ===

In the late Campanian of North America, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; was a contemporary of the albertosaurine tyrannosaurid &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;. This is one of the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Several studies have attempted to explain niche differentiation in &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;.

Dale Russell hypothesized that the more lightly built and more common &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more robust and less common &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, which may have been more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.

Other authors have suggested that competition was limited by geographical separation. Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, there appears to be no correlation with distance from the sea. Neither &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; nor &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, while there is some overlap, &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; appears to be more common at northern latitudes, with species of &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and saurolophine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation and in southwestern North America during the Campanian. Thomas Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. Holtz notes that, at the end of the later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines like &quot;Triceratops&quot; were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were very rare.

<doc id="195486" wikidata="Q826834" url="?curid=195486" title="Vitalogy">
<text>Vitalogy is the third studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released on November 22, 1994, on Epic Records. Pearl Jam wrote and recorded &quot;Vitalogy&quot; while touring behind its previous album &quot;Vs.&quot; (1993). The album&#x27;s sound is more diverse than previous releases and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other styles, making it Pearl Jam&#x27;s most experimental album at that period. Considered a departure from the grunge sound of the band&#x27;s first two albums, the record focuses more on punk rock and hardcore styles in its production.

The album was first released on vinyl, followed by a release on CD and cassette two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until Jack White&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Lazaretto&quot; it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. Upon its CD release, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; became the second-fastest selling album in history, behind only the band&#x27;s previous release &quot;Vs.&quot;, selling 877,000 copies in its first week and quickly going multi-platinum. The album received critical acclaim and has been certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of at least five million copies in the United States. The album was included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 and 2012 &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; lists at number 485, but was dropped from the 2020 edition. It is Pearl Jam&#x27;s second and last album to feature drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who was fired from the band before recording was finished. He was initially replaced by session drummers and later officially replaced by former Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; drummer Jack Irons, who completed the recording of the album.

==Recording==
For the band&#x27;s third album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its Vs. Tour, and the majority of the album&#x27;s tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded &quot;Tremor Christ&quot; and &quot;Nothingman&quot;. The rest of the material was written and recorded in 1994 in sessions in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with the band finishing the album at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle after the tour&#x27;s completion. &quot;Immortality&quot; was written in April 1994 when the band was on tour in Atlanta. Sources state that most of the album was completed by early 1994, but it was not released until November due to either a forced delay by Epic or the band&#x27;s battle with ticket vendor Ticketmaster.

Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by the time they were working on &quot;Vitalogy&quot;. Producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;&quot;Vitalogy&quot; was a little strained. I&#x27;m being polite—there was some imploding going on.&quot; Bassist Jeff Ament said that &quot;communication was at an all-time low&quot;. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese stated that the communication problems started once guitarist Stone Gossard stopped acting as the band&#x27;s mediator. According to Gossard, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was the first album for which lead vocalist Eddie Vedder made the final decisions. At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band. Gossard said the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. He added that &quot;80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.&quot; During the production of &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, lead guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.

Drums on &quot;Satan&#x27;s Bed&quot; were performed by Abbruzzese&#x27;s drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf&#x27;s help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as &quot;Jimmy&quot;. Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members. Gossard said: &quot;It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, &#x27;Hey, we tried, it&#x27;s not working; time to move on.&#x27; On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don&#x27;t think it was all Dave Abbruzzese&#x27;s fault that it was stifled.&quot; Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese&#x27;s successor, plays drums on &quot;Hey Foxymophandlemama, That&#x27;s Me&quot;. Gossard said: &quot;Jack entered the band right at the end of making &quot;Vitalogy&quot;. Jack&#x27;s a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
Overall, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; has been identified as a punk rock album by both critics and members of Pearl Jam, departing the grunge sound of the band&#x27;s previous work. Despite this, some publications have labeled the album as grunge.

In a 1995 interview, &quot;Guitar World&quot; writer Jeff Gilbert described &quot;Vitalogy&quot; as &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;very eclectic&quot;. McCready agreed, saying: &quot;There is some weird stuff on there.&quot; McCready attributed the album&#x27;s sound to the group recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said: &quot;&quot;Vitalogy&quot; is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, &#x27;This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?&#x27;...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.&quot; The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band&#x27;s first two albums. McCready said: &quot;&quot;Vitalogy&quot; is not really a &#x27;solo&#x27; album. I don&#x27;t think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; stands as Pearl Jam&#x27;s most original and uncompromising album.&quot; He added that &quot;in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music—the mantrafunk of &#x27;Aye Davanita&#x27;, the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of &#x27;Bugs&#x27;, and the chilling sonic collage &#x27;Hey Foxymophandlemama, That&#x27;s Me&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Bugs&quot; features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop, while &quot;Hey Foxymophandlemama, That&#x27;s Me&quot; was created using looped recordings of real patients from a psychiatric hospital. Tim Coffman of &quot;WhatCulture&quot; considers &quot;Vitalogy&quot; to be a delve into art rock, commenting that the band &quot;[threw] every outlandish idea into the mix.&quot;

Many of the songs on the album address the pressures of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include &quot;Not for You&quot;, &quot;Pry, To&quot;, &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Bugs&quot;, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Bed&quot; and &quot;Immortality&quot;. Vedder said: &quot;I&#x27;m just totally vulnerable. I&#x27;m way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don&#x27;t have any shell. There&#x27;s a contradiction there, because that&#x27;s probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can&#x27;t necessarily express.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;Not for You&quot; express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and &quot;how youth is being sold and exploited&quot;, while Vedder said &quot;Corduroy&quot; is about &quot;one person&#x27;s relationship with a million people.&quot; In &quot;Pry, To&quot; the phrase &quot;P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me&quot; is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of &quot;Immortality&quot; may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about &quot;the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.&quot; The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of &quot;Immortality&quot; were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said, regarding &quot;Nothingman&quot;, that &quot;if you love someone and they love you, don&#x27;t fuck up...&#x27;cause you are left with less than nothing.&quot; &quot;Better Man&quot; is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote the song when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a &quot;blatantly great pop song&quot; by producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from &quot;Vs.&quot; due to its accessibility.

=== Outtakes ===
&quot;Hard to Imagine&quot;, a song previously rejected from &quot;Vs.&quot;, was also recorded during the &quot;Vitalogy&quot; sessions. This version found its way on to the soundtrack for the 1998 film &quot;Chicago Cab&quot;. &quot;Hard to Imagine&quot; is also included on the 2003 rarities compilation &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;, though that version is the one from the &quot;Vs.&quot; sessions. According to Gossard, &quot;Hard to Imagine&quot; was cut from &quot;Vitalogy&quot; because it did not fit with the other songs the band was writing at the time.

&quot;Out of My Mind&quot;, which is featured as a B-side on the &quot;Not for You&quot; single, was premiered on the band&#x27;s 1994 spring tour of the United States and was played twice. According to Vedder, the song was just a live improv.

==Title and packaging==
The original title for the album was &quot;Life&quot;. The first single, &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot;, was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states: &quot;From the Epic album &quot;Life&quot;&quot;.

The title &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, which literally means &quot;the study of life&quot;, came from an early 20th-century medical book that Vedder found at a garage sale. This book was also the inspiration for the album&#x27;s cover art and liner notes. Ament stated: &quot;Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.&quot; After explaining that, from &quot;Vs.&quot; onward, the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records, he said: &quot;We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.&quot; Packaging the album in this way cost an extra 50 cents per copy. When the band discovered that later versions of the medical book were still under copyright, they had to confer with their lawyers as they worked out which material they wanted to utilize in the final version of the artwork.

The booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being, as well as other notes, dealing with life and death reflections, which seem to be more personal, like a message typed on the &quot;Immortality&quot; page that seems to be referring to the loss of a loved one (&quot;I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.&quot;). It also includes some poems or original sayings that do not belong to the songs&#x27; lyrics, but can be interpreted as commentary on the songs or, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the &quot;Aye Davanita&quot; page. The song&#x27;s subtitle is listed as &quot;The song without words&quot;, as it is an instrumental track, but the page also displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of &quot;intruder words&quot; is on the &quot;Not for You&quot; page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth (&quot;Call me Sisyphus love. Yeh, I move the rock. I just don&#x27;t want to talk about moving the rock. Get pictures taken of me while moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock.&quot;). The lyrics to &quot;Whipping&quot; are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against &quot;pro-life&quot; killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder&#x27;s teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for &quot;Corduroy&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Vitalogy&quot; was released first on vinyl on November 22, 1994, two weeks before its CD and cassette release, and debuted at No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and, until Jack White&#x27;s &quot;Lazaretto&quot; in 2014, it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week on Soundscan. It was also the first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 due to vinyl sales alone since the CD became the dominant format for album sales. When &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was released on CD and cassette on December 6, 1994, it went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, selling more than 877,000 copies in its first week. It was the second-fastest selling album in history, behind only the band&#x27;s previous release &quot;Vs.&quot; &quot;Vitalogy&quot; has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and, as of July 2013, has sold 6.9 million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In July 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Vitalogy&quot; second in a reader&#x27;s poll of Pearl Jam&#x27;s best albums.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer Al Weisel gave &quot;Vitalogy&quot; a positive four out of five stars, describing the album as &quot;a wildly uneven and difficult record, sometimes maddening, sometimes ridiculous, often powerful.&quot; While Weisel praised several songs, saying that &quot; Vitalogy has a number of gripping songs that match the soaring anthems of &quot;Ten&quot;, the extended grooves of &quot;Vs.&quot; or the poetry of either record&quot;, he somewhat criticized some of the more experimental songs as &quot;throwaways and strange experiments that don&#x27;t always work&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the album&#x27;s diversity compared to the band&#x27;s previous records, commenting that the band incorporated &quot;fast but brutal punk, fuzz-toned psychedelia and judicious folk-rock, all of it sounding more spontaneous than before.&quot; He felt the band continued to be &quot;unremittingly glum&quot;, and described the majority of the songs as &quot;tortured first-person proclamations&quot;, commenting that &quot;Vedder sounds more alone than ever.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reviewer Christopher John Farley singled out &quot;Bugs&quot; as one of the album&#x27;s &quot;share of stinkers&quot;, but added &quot;that&#x27;s one admirably experimental failure on a largely successful album.&quot; Despite writing negatively of the album&#x27;s &quot;shapeless high-energy riff-rockers&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot; staff writer Ira Robbins lauded &quot;Vitalogy&quot;″s sound and called it a &quot;compelling triumph of surface over substance&quot;. In a mixed review of the album, Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; perceived a lack of subject matter or lyrical substance as &quot;Vitalogy&quot;″s weakness.

&quot;Q&quot; magazine gave the album four out of five stars, stating: &quot;It speaks volumes for Pearl Jam&#x27;s continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album an A− rating, writing that &quot;Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam&#x27;s book, token experiments like &quot;Bugs&quot; are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [Vedder&#x27;s] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+, saying that &quot;&quot;Vitalogy&quot; marks the first time it&#x27;s possible to respect the band&#x27;s music as much as its stance&quot;, but &quot;despite its musical advances, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it.&quot; &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; writer Jim DeRogatis gave tha album three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album &quot;leaves you wishing that they&#x27;d just lighten up&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen gave &quot;Vitalogy&quot; three and a half out of four stars and stated that it &quot;delivers the band&#x27;s most compelling, inventive and confident music to date&quot;, while calling it &quot;the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn gave &quot;Vitalogy&quot; four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam&#x27;s previous work, writing: &quot;This isn&#x27;t just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making&quot;. AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying: &quot;Pearl Jam are at their best when they&#x27;re fighting, whether it&#x27;s Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons.&quot; According to &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004): &quot;By &quot;Vitalogy&quot; PJ hit their apex … the band&#x27;s creative zenith, finding them doing a &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; on acoustic tracks like &#x27;Corduroy&#x27; and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on &#x27;Bugs&#x27;&quot;.

Three singles were released from &quot;Vitalogy&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; (backed with B-side &quot;Tremor Christ&quot;, also from the album), was the band&#x27;s first to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number 18. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot; won the band its first Grammy Award, receiving the award for Best Hard Rock Performance. Neither of the album&#x27;s other commercially released singles, &quot;Not for You&quot; and &quot;Immortality&quot;, charted on the Hot 100, but both placed on the Album Rock and Modern Rock charts. Album tracks &quot;Better Man&quot; and &quot;Corduroy&quot; also charted. &quot;Better Man&quot; was the most successful song from &quot;Vitalogy&quot; on the rock charts, spending a total of eight weeks at number one on the Album Rock chart and reaching number two on the Modern Rock chart. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; received nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. In 2003, the album was ranked number 492 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The magazine listed the album at number 485 on its revised list in 2012, saying it showed the band&#x27;s &quot;mastery of rock&#x27;s past and future&quot;. In May 2014, Loudwire placed &quot;Vitalogy&quot; at number ten on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed the album on its &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

In 2011, Pearl Jam released a remastered &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, along with &quot;Vs.&quot;, in three formats: an Expanded Version, a three-CD Deluxe Edition, and a Limited Edition Collector&#x27;s Boxed Set. The Expanded Version features three bonus tracks: the previously unreleased guitar/organ-only mix of &quot;Better Man&quot;; a previously unreleased alternate take of &quot;Corduroy&quot; from the &quot;Vitalogy&quot; sessions (recorded by Brendan O&#x27;Brien); and a previously unreleased demo version of &quot;Nothingman&quot;, taken from the original DAT (recorded at John and Stu&#x27;s in Seattle on October 14, 1993, featuring Richard Stuverud on drums). The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of &quot;Vitalogy&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot; with their bonus tracks and a copy of &quot;Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994&quot;.

==Tour==

Pearl Jam promoted the album with tours in Asia, Oceania, and the United States in 1995. The band was joined by new drummer Jack Irons. The short tour of the United States focused on the Midwest and the West Coast. The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster&#x27;s venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues. The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.

The tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said the band and its crew had to &quot;[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went&quot;. In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California&#x27;s Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert, Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of food poisoning. He left the hospital to play the show, but he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said: &quot;That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn&#x27;t seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.&quot; Because of Vedder&#x27;s health, the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were later reinstated, while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said: &quot;I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.&quot; Ament later said: &quot;We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.&quot;

<text>Charles Le Brun (; baptised 24 February 1619 – 12 February 1690) was a French painter, physiognomist, art theorist, and a director of several art schools of his time. He served as a court painter to Louis XIV, who declared him &quot;the greatest French artist of all time&quot;. Le Brun was a dominant figure in 17th-century French art and was influenced by Nicolas Poussin.

==Biography==


===Early life and training===
Born in Paris, Le Brun attracted the notice of Chancellor Séguier, who placed him at the age of eleven in the studio of Simon Vouet. He was also a pupil of François Perrier. At fifteen he received commissions from Cardinal Richelieu, in the execution of which he displayed an ability which obtained the generous commendations of Nicolas Poussin, in whose company Le Brun started for Rome in 1642.

In Rome, he remained four years in the receipt of a pension due to the liberality of the chancellor. There he worked under Poussin, adapting the latter&#x27;s theories of art. While in Rome, Le Brun studied ancient Roman sculpture, made copies after Raphael, and absorbed the influence of the local painters.

On his return to Paris in 1646, Le Brun found numerous patrons, of whom Nicholas Fouquet was the most important, for whom he painted a large portrait of Anne of Austria. Employed at Vaux-le-Vicomte, Le Brun ingratiated himself with Cardinal Mazarin, then secretly pitting Jean-Baptiste Colbert against Fouquet.

Le Brun was the driving force behind the establishment of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1648, and was elected as one of the original twelve elders in charge of its running. He remained a dominant figure at the academy and held the positions of chancellor in 1655 (from 1663 chancellor for life), rector from 1668 and director from 1683. 
When Colbert took control of the institution in 1661, Le Brun was there to assist him in his endeavour to reorganise it with the goal that the academicians would work towards bringing about a theoretical foundation for a national French art . Both also founded the Academy of France at Rome in 1666 as a base for promising young artists who would live and learn there for a certain period on the expense of the crown.

Another project Le Brun worked on was Hôtel Lambert. The ceiling in the gallery of Hercules was painted by him. Le Brun started work on the project in 1650, shortly after his return from Italy. The decoration continued intermittently over twelve years or so, as it was interrupted by the renovation of Vaux le Vicomte.

In 1660 they established the Gobelins manufactory, which at first was a great school for the manufacture, not of tapestries only, but of every class of furniture required in the royal palaces. Commanding the industrial arts through the Gobelins—of which he was director—and the whole artistic world through the academy—in which he successively held every post—Le Brun imprinted his own character on all that was produced in France during his lifetime. He was the originator of &quot;Louis XIV Style&quot; and gave a direction to the national tendencies which endured centuries after his death. The artistic output of artists and students from the Gobelins would also exert a strong influence on art elsewhere in Europe.

===Success years===
The nature of his emphatic and pompous talent was in harmony with the taste of the King, who, full of admiration for the paintings by Le Brun for his triumphal entry into Paris (1660) and his decorations at the Château Vaux le Vicomte (1661), commissioned him to execute a series of subjects from the history of Alexander. The first of these, &quot;Alexander and the Family of Darius,&quot; so delighted Louis XIV that he at once ennobled Le Brun (December, 1662), who was also created &quot;Premier Peintre du Roi&quot; (&quot;First Painter of the King&quot;) with a pension of 12,000 livres, the same amount as he had yearly received in the service of the magnificent Fouquet. The king had declared him &quot;the greatest French artist of all time&quot;. &quot;The Family of Darius,&quot; also known as &quot;The Queens of Persia at the Feet of Alexander,&quot; was later cut down slightly in size by Le Brun, and retouched to disguise the alteration, presumably to make the painting similar in size to a painting by Paolo Veronese that Louis XIV had acquired.

From this date all that was done in the royal palaces was directed by Le Brun. Designs had to be approved by the king before they could be rendered into paintings or sculptures. In 1663, he became director of the &quot;Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture&quot;, where he laid the basis of academicism and became the all-powerful, peerless master of 17th-century French art. It was during this period that he dedicated a series of works to the history of Alexander The Great (&quot;The Battles of Alexander The Great&quot;), and he did not miss the opportunity to make a stronger connection between the magnificence of Alexander and that of the great King. While he was working on &quot;The Battles&quot;, Le Brun&#x27;s style became much more personal as he moved away from the ancient masters that influenced him.
Work on the Gallery of Apollo in the Louvre was interrupted in 1677 when Lebrun accompanied the king to Flanders (on his return from Lille he painted several compositions in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye), and finally—for they remained unfinished at his death—by the vast labours of Versailles, where he reserved for himself the Halls of War and Peace (&quot;Salons de la Guerre&quot; and &quot;de la Paix&quot;, 1686), the Ambassadors&#x27; Staircase, and the Great Hall of Mirrors (&quot;Galerie des Glaces&quot;, 1679–1684). Le Brun&#x27;s decoration is not only a work of art, it is the definitive monument of a reign.

In 1669, Louis XIV elected to completely renovate Versailles, which was then a tiny palace, and transform it into an opulent dwelling where he would meet with his subjects and foreign diplomats. Le Brun was in charge of its decoration down to the most minute details of arrangement and presentation. In addition to classical paintings, depictions of Louis&#x27; reign also adorned the palace walls. The whole structure and its decorations were intended to awe visitors with the splendor, wealth and taste of the king. The &quot;Escalier des Ambassadeurs&quot; was the main staircase at the entryway to Versailles from its completion in 1679 until its destruction in 1752. The king was so pleased with its appearance that he reportedly referred to it as &quot;Monsieur Le Brun&#x27;s staircase&quot; when he showed it to an ambassador from Spain in 1679.

===Later years===
At the death of Colbert, François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, who succeeded as superintendent in the department of public works, showed no favour to Le Brun who was Colbert&#x27;s favorite, and in spite of the king&#x27;s continued support Le Brun felt a bitter change in his position. This contributed to the illness that on 22 February 1690 ended in his death in Gobelins (his private mansion, in Paris).

==Le Brun&#x27;s work and legacy==

Le Brun primarily worked for King Louis XIV, for whom he executed large altarpieces and battle pieces. His most important paintings are at Versailles. Besides his gigantic labours at Versailles and the Louvre, the number of his works for religious corporations and private patrons is enormous. Le Brun was also a fine portraitist and an excellent draughtsman, but he was not fond of portrait or landscape painting, which he felt to be a mere exercise in developing technical prowess. What mattered was scholarly composition, whose ultimate goal was to nourish the spirit. The fundamental basis on which the director of the academy-based his art was unquestionably to make his paintings speak, through a series of symbols, costumes and gestures that allowed him to select for his composition the narrative elements that gave his works a particular depth. For Le Brun, a painting represented a story one could read. Nearly all his compositions have been reproduced by celebrated engravers.

In his posthumously published treatise, &quot;Méthode pour apprendre à dessiner les passions&quot; (1698), he promoted the expression of the emotions in painting. Le Brun&#x27;s view on emotions, which were known as &quot;passions&quot; at the time, drew heavy influence from the work of René Descartes. The facial expressions, which Le Brun outlined as a template for subsequent artists to follow, were believed to reveal the condition of the soul. It had much influence on art theory for the next two centuries.

Many of his drawings are in the Louvre and the Monaco Royal Collection. He was also the teacher of painter Ludovico Dorigny.

The Baroque ceiling in the Chambre des Muses at the Chateau Vaux-le-Vicomte outside Paris, was &quot;decorated by Charles Le Brun&#x27;s workshop&quot;. Many of Charles Le Brun&#x27;s sketches and designs were later rendered into painting or sculpture by artists working under him. A restoration was completed in 2017 by the current owners, the de Vogüé family. The restored ceiling was unveiled to the public in March of that year.
On 23 January 2013, artistic advisors for the Hôtel Ritz Paris, Wanda Tymowska and Joseph Friedman, announced the discovery of &quot;The Sacrifice of Polyxena&quot;, an early work of Le Brun. The picture, dated 1647, ornamented the Coco Chanel suite of the famous Parisian palace, and went unnoticed for over a century.

Posthumously, Le Brun&#x27;s reputation suffered in the years surrounding the French Revolution and its aftermath, due to his close connection with Louis XIV. By the end of the nineteenth century, the academic values he personified were out of fashion, and it was only in 1963, when a major Le Brun exhibition was organized at Versailles, that his work was reevaluated. He is now considered one of the finest and most versatile French artists of his time.

<text>The Rail Delivery Group Limited (RDG), previously the Association of Train Operating Companies, is the British rail industry membership body that brings together passenger and freight rail companies, Network Rail and High Speed 2. The RDG is approximately half-funded by Network Rail, the remainder of its funding being provided by the various transport groups it represents.

The current incarnation of the RDG was created in 2017 from the merger of ATOC and a preceding organisation with the same brand. It performs industry-wide communications, defines ticket validity, participates in the formulation of railway policy, and is responsible for the National Rail Enquiries service. The RDG operates several brands and services, including Interrail and National Rail. Since its creation, it has undertaken several initiatives, such as the opening-up of automatic ticket gates and ticket machines to competition, and the incorporation of new anti-fare evasion technologies at stations. During 2023, the RDG announced the planned closure of many staffed ticket booths across the network; later that same year, the plan was officially abandoned in the face of public opposition. 

==History==
The current RDG has its roots in two preceding organisations, the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC), and the Rail Delivery Group. The original Rail Delivery Group was established in 2011 to formulate policy and undertake communications on behalf of the entire railway industry, its membership having comprised all passenger and freight operators in the UK. ATOC was a representative organisation for the various passenger train operating companies operating in Britain; it was established in the wake of the privatisation of British Rail by the train operators for the purpose of ensuring the continuation of various nationwide services, such as ticket acceptance and railcard schemes. ATOC also lobbied on the operators&#x27; behalf on various matters.

On 24 October 2017, ATOC and the original RDG were merged to form the Rail Delivery Group. The new organisation is owned by its members, which comprise Network Rail, the nationalised owner of Britain&#x27;s rail infrastructure; the various train operating companies that provide passenger services; the freight operating companies; the Rail Supply Group (RSG) that represents suppliers to the industry; and HS2 Ltd, the company building a high-speed line. While the RDG name was publicly adopted following the merger, the company&#x27;s legal name has continued to be ATOC Limited.

==Operations and responsibilities==
The RDG describes its primary purpose as enabling train operating companies and Network Rail to deliver better services for end customers. It performs various key roles in the operation of Britain&#x27;s railways. Amongst these are defining the validity of tickets, producing the definitive National Routeing Guide, and contributing to the &quot;National Fares Manual&quot;, which is distributed by the National Rail website. The organisation is responsible for the allocation and settlement of revenue through ORCATS systems. It also handles the licensing (accreditation) of third party ticket sellers, such as travel agents and online sellers (such as Trainline and Red Spotted Hanky).

RDG also performs industry-wide communications with the public, and is responsible for the National Rail Enquiries service. Between 1997 and 2004, the outsourcing specialist Serco was subcontracted to operate the National Rail Enquiry Service by ATOC. The RDG&#x27;s public relations activities include the sponsorship of various schemes, such as PlusBus, PlusBike, and Bike and Go, as well as staff travel arrangements for both current and retired railway employees.

RDG owns both the National Rail and &#x27;Britain Runs on Rail&#x27; brands. Furthermore, it is responsible for several international products, such as &#x27;Britrail&#x27; and Interrail. The marketing of the Railcard scheme also comes within the organisation&#x27;s scope.

The RDG is partially responsible for railway policy formulation; it works with the Rail Supply Group and other parties to coordinate shared objectives. It also has a relationship with various regional and municipal transport authorities, such as Transport for London.

== Initiatives ==
An early pledge made by RDG was the simplification of the British railway ticketing system. During the summer of 2018, it announced measures in line with this objective, including the renaming of half a million tickets, the adoption of simpler language, and a redesign of ticket machines. The RDG has worked closely with the Community Rail Network to support local organisations active on their railway lines and station facilities; this initiative was claimed to have boosted the accessibility of railway services.

Since its launch, the RDG has supported Rail to Refuge, a joint initiative between several passenger train operators and Women&#x27;s Aid (an English charity), which provides free train travel within Britain for women, men and children travelling to escape domestic abuse. In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the RDG quickly led a scheme to provide free rail travel to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict.

The management of station-based automatic ticket gates and ticket machines across the majority of British railway stations has been a particularly active area for the RDG. Throughout the 2010s, in coordination with the Office of Road and Rail, the organisation worked to open the supply and operation of this equipment to greater market competition. Upgrades to these barriers have also been carried out, including the use of new technology for catching fare evaders; in 2023, the organisation estimated that roughly £240 million in lost revenue was being incurred through fare evasion across Britain&#x27;s railways annually.

The RDG worked with the Department for Transport and other entities to support the rollout of contactless payment methods in the South East of England by the end of 2023. In November 2023, the organisation invited suppliers to present proposals for a nationwide contactless ticketing system.

In July 2023, RDG announced proposals for the closure of many ticket offices across the network. Several organisations spoke out against this change; Disability Rights UK raised concerns, stating: &quot;The outcome will reduce confidence in the whole railway system and end the ability for far too many Disabled people to travel by rail at all.&quot; Negative opinions on public safety and security were also voiced. In October 2023, the planned closures were abandoned in the face of opposition from the public and from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) trade union, which was taking strike action at the time.

==International counterparts==

As rail franchising also takes place in other countries, many of these nations have one or more equivalent organisations.

In Germany, the (German Tariff Association) is responsible for railway ticket revenue distribution. Political representation of established companies is carried out by the Association of German Transport Companies (, VDV), whereas public relations of new entrant TOCs are chiefly dealt with by Mofair e.V.

In Spain the (Spanish Association of Passenger Rail Companies) represents the sector, and aims to contribute to changes and regulatory improvement and support and defend the rail transport mode.

In Sweden, the equivalent organisation is the (Association of Train Operating Companies).

<text>A commercial bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and gives loans for the purposes of consumption and investment to make a profit.

It can also refer to a bank or a division of a larger bank that deals with corporations or large or middle-sized businesses, to differentiate from retail banks and investment banks. Commercial banks include private sector banks and public sector banks. However, central banks function differently from commercial banks, despite a common misconception known as the &quot;bank analogy&quot;. Unlike commercial banks, central banks are not primarily focused on generating profits and cannot become insolvent in the same way as commercial banks in a fiat currency system.

==History==

The name &quot;bank&quot; derives from the Italian word &quot;banco&quot; &#x27;desk/bench&#x27;, used during the Italian Renaissance era by Florentine bankers, who used to carry out their transactions on a desk covered by a green tablecloth. However, traces of banking activity can be found even in ancient times.

In the United States, the term commercial bank was often used to distinguish it from an investment bank due to differences in bank regulation. After the Great Depression, through the Glass–Steagall Act, the U.S. Congress required that commercial banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to capital market activities. This separation was mostly repealed in 1999 by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act.

==Role==
The general role of commercial banks is to provide financial services to the general public and business, ensuring economic and social stability and sustainable growth of the economy.

In this respect, credit creation is the most significant function of commercial banks. While sanctioning a loan to a customer, they do not provide cash to the borrower.

*The function of credit creation is generated on the basis of credit and payment intermediary. Commercial banks use the deposits they absorb to make loans. On the basis of check circulation and transfer settlement, the loans are converted into derivative deposits. To a certain extent, the derivative funds of are increased by interval times the original deposits which greatly improves the driving force of commercial banks to serve the economic development.

Regulations

<text>The Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (; ) was founded in 1648 in Paris, France. It was the premier art institution of France during the latter part of the Ancien Régime until it was abolished in 1793 during the French Revolution. It included most of the important painters and sculptors, maintained almost total control of teaching and exhibitions, and afforded its members preference in royal commissions.

==Founding==
In the 1640s, France&#x27;s artistic life was still based on the medieval system of guilds like the Académie de Saint-Luc which had a tight grip on the professional lives of artists and artisans alike. Some artists had managed to get exemptions but these were based on favoritism rather than merit.

According to the 17th century &quot;Mémoires&quot; about the founding of the &quot;Académie royale&quot;, a few &quot;superior men&quot; who were &quot;real artists&quot;, suffered and felt humiliated under the guild system.

In view of increasing pressure by the Parisian guilds for painters and sculptors to submit to their control, the young but already very successful painter Charles Le Brun conceived a plan to free those he considered to be true artists from the humiliating influence of mere artisans. He involved his two close friends, the brothers Louis and Henri Testelin, to lobby for an independent organisation where membership was based on merit alone, following the examples of the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence and the Accademia di San Luca in Rome.

Soon, the courtier Martin de Charmois and several more artists became involved and drafted a petition for the foundation of the Académie. Charmois assembled as many artists with royal patronage as he could to sign it, which a great number did. With the support of Le Brun&#x27;s patron Pierre Séguier, Chancellor of France, Charmois presented the petition to the nine-year-old King Louis XIV, his mother Anne of Austria who acted as regent and the whole Royal Council on 20 January 1648 at the Palais-Royal. All present approved and the foundation of the &quot;Académie royale&quot; was granted.

The promoters immediately got to work and in January 1648 formulated statutes with 13 articles (approved in February and published on 9 March 1648), a key element of which was a public art school. There were 22 founding members, who, in February 1648, elected 12 &quot;anciens&quot; (elders), who would be in charge of the academy in turn, each for a calendar month. These first &quot;anciens&quot; were the painters Charles Le Brun, Charles Errard, François Perrier, Juste d&#x27; Egmont, Michel I Corneille, Henri Beaubrun, Laurent de La Hyre, Sebastien Bourdon, Eustache Le Sueur and the sculptors Simon Guillain, Jacques Sarazin and Gerard van Opstal. There is a common misconception that &quot;there were twelve founders&quot; and that all of the original members were called &quot;anciens&quot;, but this is not correct.

Charmois was elected &quot;Chef&quot; (Head) of the Académy as stated in article XIII of the statutes.

With revised statutes from 24 December 1654 the offices of &quot;chancelier&quot; and of four &quot;recteurs&quot; were created, and the title &quot;ancien&quot; was abandoned in favour of the title &quot;professeur&quot; (with the exact same duties for a calendar month in turn).

==Vice-protectorate of Jean-Baptiste Colbert==
Following the death of the &quot;Protecteur&quot; of the &quot;Académie royale&quot;, Cardinal Mazarin, in 1661, the office reverted to his predecessor Chancellor Séguier. Later that year, Séguier named Jean-Baptiste Colbert, King Louis XIV&#x27;s trusted minister, as &quot;Vice-protecteur&quot;. Colbert took full strategic control and, working through Charles Le Brun, ensured that the arts were devoted to the glorification of the King. A &quot;royal style&quot; was enforced which in practice meant a classical style.

==Dominance of Charles Le Brun==
The Académie experienced its greatest power during the involvement of Charles Le Brun who, from its beginnings in 1648 until his death in 1690 occupied many positions within the Académie. After being an original &quot;ancien&quot;, in 1655 he was the first to be appointed chancellor of the Académie (from 1663 chancellor for life), then he became rector from 1668 and director from 1683. Despite his short seven-year reign as director, Le Brun controlled a majority of decisions within the Académie. In February 1675 he ordered that no decision would be validated in the Académie without his approval.

Le Brun&#x27;s involvement in the Académie and his position of first painter to the king, allowed him to dictate all painting, sculpture, and tapestry expectations. Specifically, for projects such as the &quot;Grande Galerie du Louvre&quot;, Académie artists found themselves carrying out designs originated by Le Brun. In addition, Le Brun admitted more members into the Académie than during any other comparable time period. Between 1664 and 1683, 107 artists became members of the Académie. In comparison, 89 artists were admitted between 1707 and 1720, and the 57 admitted in 1735–54. Under Le Brun&#x27;s influence the Académie became more accessible than ever before.

Le Brun&#x27;s relationship with the royal court allowed him to assume the position of director after the death of Colbert in 1683. While still extremely influential, Le Brun began to lose power due to the rise of Pierre Mignard, in the years before his death in 1690.

==Suspension==
On August 8, 1793, the Académie was suspended by the revolutionary National Convention, when the latter decreed the abolition of &quot;all academies and literary societies patented or endowed by the Nation&quot; (&quot;toutes les académies et sociétés littéraires patentées ou dotées par la Nation&quot;).

==Later history==
It was later revived as the Académie de peinture et de sculpture after the French Revolution. This Académie is also responsible for the Académie de France in the villa Médicis in Rome (founded in 1666) which allows promising artists to study in Rome. In 1816, it was merged with the Académie de Musique (Academy of Music, founded in 1669) and the Académie d&#x27;Architecture (Academy of Architecture, founded in 1671), to form the Académie des Beaux-Arts, one of the five academies of the Institut de France.

==Documentation==

===Mémoires===
The history of the early &quot;Académie royale&quot; is given in great detail by a contemporary who was involved in its foundation. The 17th century manuscript containing the account was published in 1853 by the French art historian Anatole de Montaiglon as 

Montaiglon has identified the anonymous author as Henri Testelin, the academy&#x27;s secretary from 1650 to 1681, but different names have been suggested by others.

===Procès-verbaux===
In addition to the &quot;Mémoires&quot; Montaiglon also published the minutes of the academy in ten volumes from 1875 to 1892:


===Conférences===
From 2006 to 2015, a critical edition of the &quot;Conférences&quot; held at the &quot;Académie royale&quot; was published by Jacqueline Lichtenstein and Christian Michel as a collaborative Project of the German Center for Art History, the Académie des Beaux-Arts and the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris and made available online:

<text>Joe Randolph Ackerley (4 November 1896 – 4 June 1967) was a British writer and editor. Starting with the BBC the year after its founding in 1927, he was promoted to literary editor of &quot;The Listener,&quot; its weekly magazine, where he served for more than two decades. He published many emerging poets and writers who became influential in Great Britain. He was openly homosexual, a rarity in his time when homosexual activity was forbidden by law and socially ostracised.

Ackerley&#x27;s extramarital half-sister was Sally Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster.

==Family and education==
Ackerley&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Father and Myself&quot; begins: &quot;I was born in 1896 and my parents were married in 1919.&quot; Registered at birth as Joe Ackerley, he later took the middle name Randolph after his uncle, Randolph Payne, first husband of his mother&#x27;s sister Bunny. As an adult, he published under his first two initials and surname. His father, (Alfred) Roger Ackerley, was a successful fruit merchant known as the &quot;Banana King&quot; of London. Roger Ackerley was first married to a young Swiss woman of wealthy parentage named (Charlotte) Louise Burckhardt (1862–1892) who died probably of tuberculosis, before they had children. Louise was the subject of John Singer Sargent&#x27;s painting, &quot;Lady with the Rose&quot;.

His mother was Janetta Aylward (known as Netta), an actress whom Roger met in Paris; the two returned to London together. They had an intermittent relationship, and three years later, in 1895, she gave birth to a son, Peter, then Joe a year later, and Nancy in 1899. According to Joe&#x27;s maternal Aunt Bunny, Peter&#x27;s birth, and likely all of them, were &quot;accidents.&quot; She told him, &quot;Your father happened to have run out of French letters that day,&quot; (when Peter was conceived). His father set up a household with his mother starting in 1903, after which the children saw him more regularly. His business, Elders &amp; Fyffes Ltd, did very well, and the family had a &quot;butler, a gardener, and, evidently, a very good table.&quot;

Ackerley was educated at Rossall School, a public and preparatory school in Fleetwood, Lancashire. During this time, he discovered he was attracted to other boys. His striking good looks earned him the nickname &quot;Girlie,&quot; but he was not very sexually active as a schoolboy. He described himself as 
&quot;a chaste, puritanical, priggish, rather narcissistic little boy, more repelled than attracted to sex, which seemed to me a furtive, guilty, soiling thing, exciting, yes, but nothing whatever to do with those feelings which I had not yet experienced but about which I was already writing a lot of dreadful sentimental verse, called romance and love.&quot; His father gave him a generous allowance and never insisted that he follow him into the business.

==First World War==
After the First World War broke out in August 1914, Ackerley was commissioned as a second lieutenant in September 1914. He was assigned to the 8th Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment, part of the 18th Division, then stationed in East Anglia. In June 1915, he was sent to France. On 1 July 1916, he was wounded at the Battle of the Somme. He was shot in the arm and suffered shards of a whisky bottle becoming imbedded in his side from an explosion. After lying wounded in a shell-hole for six hours, he was rescued and sent home for sick-leave.

He soon volunteered to go back to the front. He was promoted to captain, when his elder brother Peter, also an officer in the East Surrey Regiment, arrived in France in December 1916. At the time, Ackerley was his superior officer. He later wrote that the cheerful Peter saluted his brother &quot;gladly and conscientiously.&quot; In February 1917, Peter was wounded in action on a dangerous assignment. Though Peter got back to the British lines, Ackerley never saw him again, as he was killed on 7 August 1918, two months before the end of the war. Peter&#x27;s death haunted Ackerley all his life; he suffered from survivor&#x27;s guilt.

In May 1917, Ackerley led an attack in the Arras region where he was wounded, this time in the buttock and thigh. While he was waiting for help, the Germans arrived and took him prisoner. As an officer, he was assigned to an internment camp in neutral Switzerland, which was relatively comfortable. Here he began his play, &quot;The Prisoners of War,&quot; which expresses the cabin fever of captivity and his frustrated longings for another English prisoner. Ackerley was not repatriated to England until after the war ended. Temporary Captain Ackerley relinquished his commission on completion of service, 24 April 1919.

==Career==
From the autumn of 1919, Ackerley attended Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was in the same year as Patrick Blackett, Geoffrey Webb and Kingsley Martin. After graduating with a third-class degree in English in 1921, he moved to London, where he enjoyed the cosmopolitan capital and continued to write. In 1923 his play &quot;The Prisoners of War&quot; was included in a collection of young British writers, so he began to receive some recognition.

He met E. M. Forster and other literary bright lights, but was lonely, despite numerous sexual partners. With his play having trouble finding a producer and feeling generally adrift and distant from his family, Ackerley turned to Forster for guidance. Forster, whom he knew from &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, arranged a position as secretary to the Maharaja of Chhatarpur, Vishwanath Singh.

Ackerley spent about five months in India, which was still under British rule. He developed a strong distaste for the several Anglo-Indians (British people living in India) he met. Ackerley&#x27;s comic memoir &quot;Hindoo Holiday&quot; explores some of his experiences. The Maharaja was homosexual, and His Majesty&#x27;s obsessions and dalliances, along with Ackerley&#x27;s observations about Anglo-Indians, account for much of the humour of the work.

In England, &quot;The Prisoners of War&quot; was finally produced in 1925, to some acclaim. Its run began at The Three Hundred Club on 5 July 1925, then transferred to the Playhouse Theatre on 31 August. Ackerley enjoyed his success, returning to London to carouse with its theatrical crowd. Through Cambridge friends, he met John Gielgud and other rising stars of the stage.

In 1928 Ackerley joined the staff of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He worked in the Talks Department, which arranged radio lectures by prominent scholars and public figures. He helped to create the new department, which had an extensive influence on British literary and cultural life.

In 1935 Ackerley was appointed Literary Editor of the BBC&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Listener&quot;. He served in this position until 1959, discovering and promoting many younger writers, including W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Philip Larkin, and Stephen Spender.

Ackerley was one of Francis King&#x27;s two mentors (the other being C. H. B. Kitchin).

==Later life and death==
From 1943, Ackerley lived in a small flat at Putney overlooking the Thames. Almost all his significant work was produced during this period. He had a stable job at the BBC and ended the unsatisfying promiscuity of his younger years. What remained was his search for what he called an &quot;Ideal Friend&quot;.

Ackerley took financial responsibility for his sister Nancy, who was unstable, and his aging Aunt Bunny. In 1946 (the year his mother died), he acquired an Alsatian dog named Queenie. The dog became his primary companion for the next 15 years. During this time, he was most productive. He revised &quot;Hindoo Holiday&quot; (1952), completed &quot;My Dog Tulip&quot; (1956) and &quot;We Think the World of You&quot; (1960), and worked on drafts of &quot;My Father and Myself&quot;.

Ackerley left the BBC in 1959. He visited Japan in 1960 to see his friend Francis King; he was very taken with the beauty of the scenery and even more with Japanese men.

On 30 October 1961 Queenie died. Ackerley, who had lost a brother and both parents, described it as &quot;the saddest day of my life.&quot; He said: &quot;I would have immolated myself as a &quot;suttee&quot; when Queenie died. For no human would I ever have done such a thing, but by my love for Queenie I would have been irresistibly compelled.&quot; In 1962, &quot;We Think the World of You&quot; won the W. H. Smith Literary Award, which came with a substantial cash prize, but this did little to stir him from his grief. (He thought Richard Hughes should have won, and also thought little of the award&#x27;s previous recipients.)

In the years after Queenie&#x27;s death Ackerley worked on his memoir about his father and drank too much. His sister Nancy found him dead in his bed on the morning of 4 June 1967. Ackerley&#x27;s biographer Peter Parker gives the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.

Toward the end of his life Ackerley sold 1,075 letters from Forster, dating from 1922 onwards, for which he received £6,000. He said that it was &quot;a sum of money which will enable Nancy and me to drink ourselves carelessly into our graves&quot;. Ackerley did not live long enough to enjoy the money, but, together with the royalties from his existing works and posthumous works, it allowed Nancy to live in relative comfort until her death in 1979.

==Sexuality==
Ackerley was openly homosexual after his parents&#x27; deaths, having realised his homosexuality while he was interned in Switzerland during the First World War. Ackerley plumbed his sexuality in his writings. He belonged to a circle of notable literary homosexuals. They flouted convention, specifically the homophobia that kept gay men in the closet or exposed openly gay men to legal prosecution.

While he never found the &quot;Ideal Friend&quot; he wrote of so often (at least in human form), he had many long-term relationships. Ackerley was a &quot;twank&quot;, a term used by sailors and guardsmen to describe a man who paid for their sexual services. He described the ritual of picking up and entertaining a young guardsman, sailor or labourer. Forster warned him, &quot;Joe, you &quot;must&quot; give up looking for gold in coal mines.&quot;

His memoir serves as a guide to the sexuality of a gay man of Ackerley&#x27;s generation. W. H. Auden, in his review of &quot;My Father and Myself&quot;, speculates that Ackerley enjoyed the &quot;brotherly&quot; sexual act of mutual masturbation rather than penetration. Ackerley described himself as &quot;quite impenetrable&quot;.

He encouraged Harry Daley to publish &quot;This Small Cloud&quot;, his account of his experiences as a gay police constable on the Bloomsbury beat (Daley was painted in his uniform by Duncan Grant).

==Father&#x27;s second family==
In October 1929, Ackerley&#x27;s father, Roger Ackerley died of tertiary syphilis. Shortly afterward Ackerley found a sealed note from his father addressed to him, which concluded: 
&quot;I am not going to make any excuses, old man. I have done my duty towards everybody as far as my nature would allow and I hope people generally will be kind to my memory. All my men pals know of my second family and of their mother, so you won&#x27;t find it difficult to get on their track.&quot;

Ackerley thus discovered that his father had had a second family for more than 20 years. Roger used to visit his daughters three or four times a year when he was supposedly travelling on business, and sometimes when out to walk his first family&#x27;s dog. His mistress, Muriel Perry, served as a nurse during the First World War and was busy with her career; she seldom saw their three daughters: Sally and Elizabeth, twins born in 1909, and Diana, born in 1912; all were cared for by a Miss Coutts. The birth of the youngest was never registered but they were all given their mother&#x27;s surname. Ackerley described the lives of his half-sisters in his 1968 memoir: &quot;They had no parental care, no family life, no friends.&quot; For years the girls thought that their father was &quot;Uncle Bodger&quot;, who occasionally brought them gifts and money. Ackerley looked after his father&#x27;s second family without telling his mother, who died in 1946.

For years Ackerley was obsessed with his relationship with his father, both because of the tension of his covert homosexuality and what he described as his father&#x27;s domineering personality. In his memoir, &quot;My Father and Myself&quot; (1969), which one reviewer termed the &quot;mystery&quot; of the son on the track of his father, Ackerley speculated that his father had had some homosexual experiences as a young Guardsman. In trying to understand his father&#x27;s life, he grappled with his own.

In 1975 Diana Perry, then Diana Petre, published a memoir, &quot;The Secret Orchard of Roger Ackerley.&quot; &quot;Secret orchard&quot; was Roger&#x27;s term for his second family, used in one of his final notes to his son.

==Works==
* &quot;The Prisoners of War&quot; (first performed 5 July 1925), a play about Captain Conrad&#x27;s comfortable captivity in Switzerland during the First World War. Conrad suffers most from his longing for the attractive young Lieutenant Grayle. Ackerley claimed to prefer the title &quot;The Interned&quot; to &quot;The Prisoners of War&quot;.
* &quot;Escapers All&quot; (1932), 15 first-person accounts by men who had escaped from prisoner-of-war camps during the First World War, edited and introduced by Ackerley (published by The Bodley Head).
* &quot;Hindoo Holiday&quot; (1932, revised and expanded 1952), a memoir of Ackerley&#x27;s brief engagement as secretary to an Indian Maharaja in the city of Chhatarpur, which he calls Chhokrapur (meaning &quot;City of Boys&quot;) in the book. 
* &quot;My Dog Tulip&quot; (1956), an account of living with his dog Queenie. Her companionship enabled him to give up seeking casual sex. The dog&#x27;s name was changed to Tulip in the title when the editors of &quot;Commentary,&quot; who had purchased an excerpt, became concerned that using the name Queenie might encourage jokes about Ackerley&#x27;s sexuality. The book was adapted as an animated feature released in 2009 and starring Christopher Plummer, Lynn Redgrave and Isabella Rossellini.
* &quot;We Think the World of You&quot; (1960), Ackerley&#x27;s only novel; it explores a middle-class intellectual man (based closely on himself) and his working-class London family. It includes a fictionalised account of Ackerley&#x27;s experience with his dog Queenie (called &quot;Evie&quot; in the book). It explores the frustrations of the relationship between the homosexual narrator and Evie&#x27;s former owner, who was (mostly) heterosexual. The novel was adapted as a film of the same title, which starred Alan Bates and Gary Oldman, and was released in 1988.

Works published posthumously: 
* &quot;My Father and Myself&quot; (1968), a memoir of Ackerley&#x27;s life and relationship with his father. Together with a 1975 memoir by his half-sister Diana Petre, it was the basis of the 1979 TV film &quot;Secret Orchards&quot;, about their father&#x27;s two sets of children.
*&quot;E. M. Forster: A Portrait&quot; (1970), short biography of the writer.
*&quot;Micheldever and Other Poems&quot; (1972), poetry volume. 
*&quot;The Ackerley Letters&quot; (1975), edited by Neville Braybrooke.
* &quot;My Sister and Myself&quot; (1982), selections from Ackerley&#x27;s diary, edited by Francis King. Most material refers to Ackerley&#x27;s relationship with his sister Nancy West (née Ackerley).

In the United States Ackerley&#x27;s books have been reissued and are published solely by New York Review of Books Classics.

==Legacy==
In 1980 the BBC series &quot;Omnibus&quot; profiled Ackerley in a dramatised biography starring Benjamin Whitrow. Entitled &quot;We Think The World of You&quot;, it was not an adaptation of the novel as such, although included elements of it. Written by Tristram Powell and Paul Bailey, and directed by Powell, it won a BAFTA award in 1981.

Ackerley&#x27;s sister Nancy endowed the annual J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography, which was awarded beginning in 1982.

==Quotations==
* &quot;If you look like a wild beast, you are expected to behave like one.&quot; (&quot;My Dog Tulip&quot;)
* &quot;To speak the truth, I think that people &quot;ought&quot; to be upset, and if I had a paper I would upset them all the time; I think that life is so important and, in its workings, so upsetting that nobody should be spared.&quot; (Letter to Stephen Spender, December 1955.)
* &quot;If there is good to be said of me, others must report that.&quot; (Notebook for &quot;My Father and Myself&quot;)
* &quot;&#x27;The fair sex? And which sex is that?&#x27;&quot; (Captain Conrad to Mme. Louis in &quot;The Prisoners of War&quot;)

<doc id="195508" wikidata="Q910455" url="?curid=195508" title="Tracheomalacia">
<text>Tracheomalacia is a condition or incident where the cartilage that keeps the airway (trachea) open is soft such that the trachea partly collapses especially during increased airflow. This condition is most commonly seen in infants and young children. The usual symptom is stridor when a person breathes out. This is usually known as a collapsed windpipe.

The trachea normally opens slightly during breathing in and narrows slightly during breathing out. These processes are exaggerated in tracheomalacia, leading to airway collapse on breathing out.

If the condition extends further to the large airways (bronchi) (if there is also bronchomalacia), it is termed tracheobronchomalacia. The same condition can also affect the larynx, which is called laryngomalacia. The term is from &quot;trachea&quot; and the Greek μαλακία, &quot;softening&quot;

==Signs and symptoms==

Tracheomalacia occurs when the walls of the trachea collapse. This can happen because the walls of the windpipe are weak, or it can happen because something is pressing on it. This may include hypotonia of the trachealis muscle. The whole windpipe can be affected, or only a short piece of it. If the collapsed part of the windpipe goes past the area where the windpipe branches off into the two lungs, it is called bronchomalacia.

This problem causes noisy or difficult breathing in the first 1 to 2 months after birth. This is called congenital tracheomalacia (it was present at birth). It is not very common. Babies born with tracheomalacia may have other health issues like a heart defect, reflux or developmental delay. Some children get tracheomalacia because of other health issues. Symptoms can be mild to severe.

Symptoms inside the lung include noisy breathing that may get better when you change your baby&#x27;s position or while he or she is asleep. Breathing problems that get worse during coughing, crying, feeding or colds. High-pitched sound during breathing (stridor).
High-pitched cough. Rattling noise or wheezing with breathing.

==Diagnosis==
There is no standardized, defined set of diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of tracheomalacia, mainly due to the nonspecific symptoms associated with it. Current diagnostic approaches include pulmonary function testing which shows a characteristic reduction in peak expiratory flow (PEF), physical examination, and imaging such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) is considered the best diagnostic method because an inserted camera down the throat shows a direct view of the airways and lungs, detecting changes in the size or appearance of the trachea&#x27;s lumen and mucosa and any signs of inflammation, fistulas, or external compressions to precisely determine the location and severity of the malacia. Cross-sectional radiological images are important in detecting mediastinal structures involved in TM prior to surgery. Tracheography/Bronchography is no longer a preferred diagnostic method. Bronchography provides an accurate measurement of the airway lumen with a dynamic and morphological evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. However, this requires the injection of contrast material within the narrowed airway. Risks include allergic reaction, airway plugging, or complete airway obstruction.

===Classifications===
There are three types of tracheomalacia:
*Type 1—congenital, sometimes associated with tracheoesophageal fistula or esophageal atresia
*Type 2—extrinsic compression sometimes due to vascular rings
*Type 3—acquired due to chronic infection or prolonged intubation or inflammatory conditions like relapsing polychondritis

==Treatment==
According to the 2012 Cochrane review, there is no evidence supporting medical therapy over surgical therapy for significant tracheomalacia, or vice versa. Current recommendations for mild to moderate non-life-threatening tracheomalacia focuses on symptom management. 
* Regular use of hypertonic saline nebulizers 
* Low dose inhaled steroids may help decrease airway inflammation and swelling
* Inhaled Ipratropium may help decrease secretions and stiffen smaller airways 
* Antibiotics during active respiratory infection may decrease severity and length of symptoms 
* Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) provides additional intraluminal pressure

Life is usually saved if the airway is opened via a hole in the throat. If a person survives, they may have symptoms, but usually will get better after the airway is reopened. If the symptoms are severe enough, treatment may be needed. These range from medical management over mechanical ventilation (both continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)), to inserting a tracheal stent and surgery.
Surgical techniques include aortopexy, tracheopexy, tracheobronchoplasty, and tracheostomy. The role of the nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) remains inconclusive.

<doc id="195513" wikidata="Q271628" url="?curid=195513" title="Trident">
<text>A trident (), () is a three-pronged spear. It is used for spear fishing and historically as a polearm. As compared to an ordinary spear, the three tines increase the chance that a fish will be struck and decrease the chance that a fish will be able to dislodge itself if struck badly. On the other hand, they are not so many as to overly reduce the spear&#x27;s concentration of force for piercing.

The trident is the tool of Poseidon (Greek) or Neptune (Roman) used for the protection of the sea realms, the god of the sea in classical mythology. Other sea deities such as Amphitrite or Triton were also often depicted with a trident in classical art. Later, tridents were used in medieval heraldry, sometimes held by a merman or triton. In Hinduism, it is the weapon of Shiva and is known as a &quot;trishula&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;triple-spear&quot;). It is also associated with the superhero Aquaman. The trident is an important military (especially naval) symbol as an element for forces such as Hellenic Navy, United States Navy SEALs, United States Naval Academy, Cyprus Navy, and Nepali Army. It is included in many logos including the corporate logos of Maserati and Club Med and the athletic logos of Manchester United F.C. and Arizona State University.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;trident&quot; comes from the Latin word &#x27; or &#x27;: &quot;tri&quot; meaning &quot;three&quot; and &quot;dentes&quot; meaning &quot;teeth&quot;, referring specifically to the three prongs, or &quot;teeth&quot;, of the weapon.

The Greek equivalent is (&quot;tríaina&quot;), from Proto-Greek &quot;trianja&quot;, meaning &quot;threefold&quot;. The Greek term does not imply three of anything specific, and is vague about the shape, thus the assumption it was originally of &quot;trident&quot; form has been challenged.

Latin &quot;&quot; also means &quot;trident&quot;.

The Sanskrit name for the trident, &quot;trishula&quot;, is a compound of &quot;tri&quot; त्रि for &quot;three&quot; and &quot;śūla&quot; शूल for &quot;thorn&quot;, calling the trident&#x27;s three prongs &quot;thorns&quot; rather than &quot;teeth&quot; or dant in Sanskrit, making the word &quot;Tridant&quot; for trident.

== Mythology and art ==
=== Poseidon ===

The trident is associated with the sea god Poseidon. This divine instrument is said to have been forged by the cyclopes.

Poseidon struck a rock with his trident, causing a sea (or a saltwater spring, called the Erechtheis) to appear nearby on the Acropolis in Athens. And according to Roman sources, Neptune struck the earth with the trident to produce the first warhorse.

Poseidon, as well as being the god of the sea, was also known as the &quot;Earth Shaker&quot;, believed to cause earthquakes; some commentators have extrapolated that the god would have used the trident to cause them, possibly by striking the earth.

In the Renaissance artist Gian Bernini&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Neptune and Triton&quot; (1622–23), Neptune is posed holding a trident turned downwards, and is thought to reenact a scene from &quot;Aeneid&quot; or Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; where he is calming the waves to aid Aeneas&#x27;s ships.

=== Other sea divinities ===

In later Greek and Roman art and literature, other sea deities and their attendants have been depicted holding the trident.

Poseidon&#x27;s consort Amphitrite is often identified by some marine attribute other than a trident, which she never carries according to some scholars, though other commentators have disagreed.

Turning to the retinue or a train of beings which follow the sea deities (the marine thiasos) the Tritons (mermen) may be seen bearing tridents. Likewise, the Old Man of the Sea (&quot;halios geron&quot;) and the god Nereus are seen holding tridents. Tritons, other mermen, and the Nereides can also carry rudders, oars, fish, or dolphins.

Oceanus normally should not carry a trident, allowing him to be clearly distinguished from Poseidon. However, there is conflation of the deities in Romano-British iconography, and examples exist where the crab-claw headed Oceanus also bears a trident. Oceanus holding a trident has been found on Romano-British coinage as well.

Some &quot;amorini&quot; have been depicted carrying tiny tridents.

The trident is even seen suspended like a pendant on a dolphin in Roman mosaic art.

=== Hindu religion ===
In Hindu legends and stories Shiva, the Hindu god uses a trishula as his principal weapon. The trident is also said to represent three gunas mentioned in Indian Vedic philosophy namely sāttvika, rājasika, and tāmasika. The goddess Kali is sometimes portrayed with a trident as well.

A weapon of South-East Asian (particularly Thai) depiction of Hanuman, a character of Ramayana.

=== Miscellaneous ===
In religious Taoism, the trident represents the Taoist Trinity, the Three Pure Ones. In Taoist rituals, a trident bell is used to invite the presence of deities and summon spirits, as the trident signifies the highest authority of Heaven.

A fork Jewish priests (Kohanim) used to take their portions of offerings.
In heraldry within the UK, the trident is often held by the figure identified as either a Neptune or a triton, or a merman.

The trident held up by an arm is depicted on some coats-of-arms.

==Use==
===Fishing===
In Ancient Greece, the trident was employed as a harpoon for spearing large fish, especially tuna fishing.

Tridents used in modern spear-fishing usually have barbed tines, which trap the speared fish firmly. In the Southern and Midwestern United States, &quot;gigging&quot; is used for harvesting suckers, bullfrogs, flounder and many species of rough fish.

=== Agriculture ===
It has been used by farmers as a decorticator to remove leaves, seeds and buds from the stalks of plants such as flax and hemp. A form of trident is used by the gardians in the Camargue of southern France for herding cattle.

===Combat===
In Ancient Rome tridents ( or ) were used by a type of gladiator called a &quot;retiarius&quot; or &quot;net fighter&quot;. The &quot;retiarius&quot; was traditionally pitted against a &quot;secutor&quot;, and cast a net to wrap his adversary and then used the trident to fight him.

Tridents were also used in medieval heraldry.

The trident, known as dangpa, is used as a weapon in the 17th- to 18th-century systems of Korean martial arts.

==Modern symbolism==

The glyph or sigil of the planet Neptune (♆), which alludes to the trident, is used in astronomy and astrology.

=== Political ===

==Botanical nomenclature==
A number of structures in the biological world are described as &quot;trident&quot; in appearance. Since at least the late 19th century the trident shape was applied to certain botanical shapes; for example, certain orchid flora were described as having trident-tipped lips in early botanical works. Furthermore, in current botanical literature, certain bracts are stated to have a trident-shape (e.g. Douglas-fir).

<text>Berylliosis, or chronic beryllium disease (CBD), is a chronic allergic-type lung response and chronic lung disease caused by exposure to beryllium and its compounds, a form of beryllium poisoning. It is distinct from acute beryllium poisoning, which became rare following occupational exposure limits established around 1950. Berylliosis is an occupational lung disease.

While there is no cure, symptoms can be treated.

==Signs and symptoms==
With single or prolonged exposure by inhalation the lungs may become sensitized to beryllium. Berylliosis has a slow onset and progression. Some people who are sensitized to beryllium may not have symptoms. Continued exposure causes the development of small inflammatory nodules, called granulomas. Of note, the authors of a 2006 study suggested that beryllium inhalation was not the only form of exposure and perhaps skin exposure was also a cause, as they found that a reduction in beryllium inhalation did not result in a reduction in chronic beryllium disease or beryllium sensitization.

Granuloma formation is seen in other diseases such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis, like berylliosis, also produces granulomas without a necrotic core, and so distinction between the two processes can be difficult.

Ultimately, this process leads to restrictive lung disease (a decrease in diffusion capacity).

The earliest symptoms are typically cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include chest pain, joint aches, weight loss, and fever.

Rarely, one can get granulomas in other organs including the liver.

The onset of symptoms can range from weeks up to tens of years from the initial exposure. In some individuals, a single exposure to beryllium can cause berylliosis.

== Pathogenesis ==
In susceptible persons, beryllium exposure can lead to a cell-mediated immune response. The T-cells become sensitized to beryllium. Each subsequent exposure leads to an immune response involving CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes and macrophages accumulating in the lungs. As this response continues macrophages, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and plasma cells aggregate together to form the noncaseating granulomas. When beryllium is phagocytized by macrophages, the beryllium triggers macrophage apoptosis, thereby reducing beryllium clearance from the lungs and eventually resulting in secondary necrosis and lysis. Eventually, the outcome is fibrosis of the lung.

Several studies have shown that there is a genetic component to beryllium sensitivity. Specifically, those beryllium-exposed workers with a mutation at the HLA-DPB1 Glu69 position have increased prevalence of beryllium sensitization and chronic beryllium disease. The HLA-DPB1 gene is important for MHC class II molecule function on antigen presenting cells. A study of the immune response to beryllium in individuals who express the HLA-DP2 allele found that CD4 T-cells do not detect the cation itself, but instead detect surface changes in the HLA-DP2/peptide complex in which is embedded. Those researchers concluded that chronic beryllium disease is a predisposition that lies between &quot;allergic hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.&quot; 

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, beryllium and beryllium compounds are Category 1 carcinogens; they are carcinogenic to both animals and humans.

==Diagnosis==

The differential diagnosis for berylliosis includes:
* Sarcoidosis
* Granulomatous lung diseases
** Tuberculosis
** Fungal infections (e.g., histoplasmosis)
** Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
* Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
* Asthma
Diagnosis of berylliosis is based on history of beryllium exposures, documented beryllium sensitivity, and granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy. Given the invasive nature of a lung biopsy, diagnosis can also be based on clinical history consistent with berylliosis, abnormal chest x-ray or CT scan findings, and abnormalities in pulmonary function tests.

The radiologic and pathologic features of berylliosis are very similar to sarcoidosis. Due to the strong clinical and histopathological resemblance of sarcoidosis and berylliosis, patients are sometimes misdiagnosed with sarcoidosis until the history of exposure to beryllium is elicited and beryllium hypersensitivity demonstrated with specific testing. Some studies suggest that up to 6% of all cases of sarcoidosis are actually berylliosis. 

The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) is the standard way of determining sensitivity to beryllium. The test is performed by acquiring either peripheral blood or fluid from a bronchial alveolar lavage, and lymphocytes are cultured with beryllium sulfate. Cells are then counted and those with elevated number of cells are considered abnormal. Those exposed persons with two abnormal BeLPT tested with peripheral blood, or one abnormal and one borderline result, are considered beryllium sensitized. Also, those with one abnormal BeLPT tested with fluid from a bronchial alveolar lavage are considered sensitized.

Chest radiography findings of berylliosis are non-specific. Early in the disease radiography findings are usually normal. In later stages interstitial fibrosis, pleural irregularities, hilar lymphadenopathy and ground-glass opacities have been reported. Findings on CT are also not specific to berylliosis. Findings that are common in CT scans of people with berylliosis include parenchymal nodules in early stages. One study found that ground-glass opacities were more commonly seen on CT scan in berylliosis than in sarcoidosis. In later stages hilar lymphadenopathy, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and pleural thickening.

===Classification===
Berylliosis is an occupational disease. Relevant occupations are those where beryllium is mined, processed or converted into metal alloys, or where machining of metals containing beryllium and recycling of scrap alloys occurs. It is associated with aerospace manufacturing, microwave semiconductor electronics, beryllium mining or manufacturing of fluorescent light bulbs (which once contained beryllium compounds in their internal phosphor coating). Beryllia was used in lamp manufacture because of ceramic&#x27;s obvious virtues for insulation and heat resistance, and also because beryllia could be made transparent. Certain welding anodes along with other electrical contacts and even non-sparking tools are made of beryllium copper alloy and the subsequent machining of such materials would cause the disease as well.

==Prevention==
Because it can be difficult to control industrial exposures to beryllium, it is advisable to use any methods possible to reduce airborne and surface contamination by beryllium, to minimize the use of beryllium and beryllium-containing alloys whenever possible, and to educate people about the potential hazards if they are likely to encounter beryllium dust or fumes. It is important to damp wipe metallographic preparation equipment to prevent accumulation of dry particles. Sectioning, grinding, and polishing must be performed under sufficiently vented hoods equipped with special filters.

On 29 January 2009, the Los Alamos National Laboratory announced it was notifying nearly 2,000 current and former employees and visitors that they may have been exposed to beryllium in the lab and may be at risk of disease. Concern over possible exposure to the material was first raised in November 2008, when a box containing beryllium was received at the laboratory&#x27;s short-term storage facility.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for berylliosis; the goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms and slow the progression of disease.

Although the evidence that stopping exposure to beryllium decreases progression of the disease is limited, it is still considered to be an accepted approach to treatment in any stage of disease.

People with early stages of disease, without lung function abnormalities or clinical symptoms, are periodically monitored with physical exams, pulmonary function testing and radiography.

Once clinical symptoms or significant abnormalities in pulmonary function testing appear, treatments include oxygen and oral corticosteroids and whatever supportive therapy is required.

==Outcomes==
Overall mortality rates are 5–38%.

== Epidemiology ==
The number of workers in the United States exposed to beryllium vary but has been estimated to be as high as 800,000 during the 1960s and 1970s. A more recent study from 2004 estimated the number of exposed workers in the United States to be around 134,000.

The rate of workers becoming sensitized to beryllium varies based on genetics and exposure levels. In one study researchers found the prevalence of beryllium sensitization to range from 9–19% depending on the industry. Many workers who are found to be sensitive to beryllium also meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic beryllium disease. In one study of nuclear workers, among those who were sensitized to beryllium, 66% were found to have chronic beryllium disease as well. The rate of progression from beryllium sensitization to chronic beryllium disease has been estimated to be approximately 6–8% per year. Stopping exposure to beryllium in those sensitized has not been definitively shown to stop the progression to chronic beryllium disease.

The overall prevalence of chronic beryllium disease among workers exposed to beryllium has ranged from 1–5% depending on industry and time period of study.

The general population is unlikely to develop acute or chronic beryllium disease because ambient air levels of beryllium are normally very low (&lt;0.03 ng/m3). However, a study found 1% of people living within 3/4 of a mile of a beryllium plant in Lorain, Ohio, had berylliosis after exposure to concentrations estimated to be less than 1 milligram per cubic metre of air. In the United States the Beryllium Case Registry contained 900 records, early cases relating to extraction and fluorescent lamp manufacture, later ones coming from the aerospace, ceramics and metallurgical industries.

==History==
Since the 1920s, beryllium has been used in electronics, ceramics, research and development labs, aircraft, and the atomic energy and defense industry. Cases of bronchitis and pneumonia-like symptoms were reported in Germany and Russia in the 1930s among workers mining and refining beryllium. By 1946, a cluster of cases associated with fluorescent lamp manufacturers were apparent in the United States, and the lamp industry stopped using beryllium in 1949. At that time, most construction trades and industries were unaware of the potential risks associated with beryllium exposure.

It occasionally killed early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson. The physicist W. W. Hansen who was instrumental in the development of the klystron also died of the disease in 1949.

Beryllium sensitivity testing was first performed as a cutaneous beryllium patch test in the early 1950s, but was discontinued due to the test stimulating sensitization or aggravating existing chronic beryllium disease.

In the 1990s, the DOE began screening employees using the BeLPT test in facilities where beryllium was used, to take preventive measures against beryllium exposure. Somewhat alarmingly, clerical staff who were never involved in handling the material had developed asymptomatic sensitivities.

<doc id="195516" wikidata="Q939654" url="?curid=195516" title="Conversation piece">
<text>A conversation piece refers to a group portrait in a domestic or landscape setting depicting persons chatting or otherwise socializing with each other. The persons depicted may be members of a family as well as friends, members of a society or hunt, or some other grouping who are shown sharing common activities such as hunts, meals, or musical parties. It was an especially popular genre in 18th-century England, beginning from the 1720s, largely due to the influence of William Hogarth. Similar paintings can also be found in other periods and outside of England. The setting of various figures &quot;conversing&quot; in an intimate setting appears to call for small-scale paintings, but some artists treated this subject manner in the Grand Manner, with almost life-size figures.

==Term and origins==

The term derives from the Latin word &#x27;conversatio&#x27; and was related to the French &#x27;conversation&#x27;, the Italian &#x27;conversazione&#x27; and the Flemish/Dutch &#x27;conversatie&#x27;. In the 17th century Habsburg Netherlands &#x27;conversatie&#x27; described paintings of informal groups. In 1629 Rubens referred to a group of women as a &#x27;conversatie van jouffrouwen&#x27; (&#x27;conversation of ladies&#x27;, also known as &quot;conversatie à la mode&quot; and &quot;The Garden of Love&quot; (Prado)). In 1670s Antwerp the low-life genre scenes of Adriaen Brouwer and Joos van Craesbeeck as well as the more elegant dance and social gatherings by Hieronymus Janssens and Christoffel Jacobsz van der Laemen were referred to as &#x27;conversaties&#x27; and &#x27;conversations&#x27;. In England the term &#x27;conversation&#x27; or &#x27;conversation piece&#x27; was first used at the end of the 17th century to describe unpretentious narrative or anecdotal pictures in the Flemish/Dutch style. Somewhat later it was also used for Antoine Watteau&#x27;s &quot;fêtes galantes&quot;. Only in 1730 it was used in England for the type of small-scale intimate portrait paintings painted by British painters such as Gawen Hamilton.

The conversation piece&#x27;s primary characteristic of representing a private interaction were already present in 15th-century paintings such as Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; (1434) and Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Lodovico Gonzaga with his Family&quot; (1471). The genre developed from 17th century portraiture in the Low Countries. The compositions of merrymaking companies (&quot;vrolijk gezelschap&quot;) and garden parties (&quot;buitenpartij&quot;) painted by artists such as Dirck Hals, David Vinckbooms, Adriaen van de Venne and Willem Buytewech were an important influence on the genre. In addition, representations of elegant companies and balls by Hieronymus Janssens and the works of Peter Paul Rubens, in particular his &quot;Garden of Love&quot; (Prado Museum), gave an impetus and direction to the development of the genre. In this last work, Rubens showed how a garden could be used as a setting for amorous dalliance and courtship. More informal forms of portraiture developed showing the sitters in an intimate environment evoking new social ideals of friendship and marriage. Flemish and Dutch painters active in the mid 17th century started to paint families and friends at home in small-scale paintings such as David Teniers the Younger, Gonzales Coques, Gerard ter Borch, Gabriel Metsu, Caspar Netscher and Jacob Ochtervelt.
==Development of the genre in England==
The &#x27;conversation piece&#x27; started with families and friends depicted on a small scale in intimate settings. People were portrayed sharing common activities such as hunts, meals, or musical parties. Dogs and/or horses are also frequently featured. Arthur Devis was a regional painter famous for his small conversation pieces, popular with the gentry of Cheshire. William Hogarth also worked in the genre, and parodied it in his print &quot;A Midnight Modern Conversation&quot;, which depicted a group of men whose conversation has degenerated into drunken incoherence. Johann Zoffany specialized in complicated conversation pieces, and most portraits by George Stubbs take this form, with horses and carriages in the composition. Joshua Reynolds would on request produce conversation pieces in the Grand Manner, and at his usual near-life scale.

<doc id="195519" wikidata="Q462943" url="?curid=195519" title="The Scaffold">
<text>The Scaffold are a comedy, poetry and music trio from Liverpool, England, consisting of musical performer Mike McGear (real name Peter Michael McCartney, the brother of Paul McCartney), poet Roger McGough and comic entertainer John Gorman. They are perhaps most notable for their successful singles &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot; (1967) and the UK number 1 &quot;Lily the Pink&quot; (1968). Since initially disbanding in 1977, the group have occasionally re-formed for performances and projects.

==Career==
===Overview===
The members of the Scaffold were originally part of a performing revue group known as The Liverpool One Fat Lady All Electric Show. (&quot;One Fat Lady&quot; is the bingo term for 8 and the performers mostly lived in the Liverpool 8 district.) McGough&#x27;s fellow Liverpool poet Adrian Henri was also a founding member of this early configuration.

Working almost exclusively as a trio under the name The Scaffold from 1964, Gorman, McGear and McGough performed a mixture of comic songs, comedy sketches and the poetry of McGough (as evidenced on their 1968 live album), and they released a number of singles and albums on Parlophone and EMI between 1966 and 1971, with several more on Island, Warner Bros. and Bronze thereafter.

&quot;Lily the Pink&quot; topped the UK charts in 1968. The group also composed and sang the theme tune to the popular BBC TV comedy &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, which aired from 1969–1978.

The group&#x27;s more musical endeavours were usually augmented with contributions by session musicians. Elton John, Jack Bruce and Graham Nash were among the session musicians who performed on The Scaffold&#x27;s early records. Tim Rice, who was at that time an assistant to their producer Norrie Paramor, also contributed backing vocals to some of their material. Additionally, although not officially credited as a permanent member of the group during its heyday, guitarist Andy Roberts was a frequent musical collaborator from as far back as 1962, acting as musical director and arranger in a live setting throughout their career and playing on a large number of their releases.

The Scaffold achieved Top 10 success in the UK with:

*&quot;Thank U Very Much&quot; (No. 4), composed by McGear. (McGear has been reluctant to explain the reference in the song to &quot;Aintree Iron&quot;.)
*&quot;Lily the Pink&quot; (No. 1), based on a traditional song about Lydia Pinkham. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.
*&quot;Liverpool Lou&quot; (No. 7) (written by Dominic Behan), recorded during the 1974 &quot;McGear&quot; sessions with Wings.

In addition to the hit singles, The Scaffold&#x27;s output included four albums: &quot;The Scaffold&quot; on Parlophone in 1968, &quot;L. the P.&quot; on Parlophone in 1969, &quot;Fresh Liver&quot; on Island in 1973, and &quot;Sold Out&quot; on Warner Brothers in 1975. As a rule their early albums contained a higher ratio of live material and were less musically-driven than their singles, often focusing on McGough&#x27;s poetry and Gorman and McGear&#x27;s extended comic vignettes. Their debut album was an entirely live affair, and their second album featured a side of live tracks paired with a side of studio recordings.

The three members also recorded and toured extensively outside the confines of the original trio: In 1968, even before the release of The Scaffold&#x27;s own debut album, McGough and McGear recorded an album without Gorman (the prosaically-titled &quot;McGough and McGear&quot;) that featured rock-driven musical backing from Jimi Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell among others, and in 1971 the trio joined forces with former members of The Bonzo Dog Band and The Liverpool Scene to form the loose coalition of performers known as Grimms (an outfit that would go on to regularly tour the country and release three albums of its own during the early 1970s). McGear also found time to record two solo albums in 1972 and 1974.

The Scaffold&#x27;s first greatest hits album, entitled &quot;Singles A&#x27;s &amp; B&#x27;s&quot;, was released on See for Miles Records in 1982. This was followed by a second greatest hits collection, the first on Compact Disc, &quot;The Scaffold: The Songs&quot;, in 1992. Three additional compilations of the band&#x27;s Parlophone tracks have since been released (two of which also include the Warner Bros. &quot;Liverpool Lou&quot; track).

===The 1970s===
In 1970 The Scaffold starred in their own popular weekly BBC children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Score with the Scaffold&quot;. The opening and closing theme tune was usually a shortened variation on their earlier single &quot;2 Day&#x27;s Monday&quot;. By this point the group had also recorded enough tracks for a new studio album, but apart from a few songs that found their way onto singles that year, much of this material remained unreleased until it was included on a 1998 compilation, &quot;The Scaffold at Abbey Road 1966-1971&quot;.

In early 1971 The Scaffold provided some catchy tunes for inclusion in a television publicity campaign heralding the introduction of decimal currency to the UK. In this series of informative five-minute programmes, titled &quot;Decimal Five&quot; and shown on BBC1, their songs included such relevant lyrics as &quot;Give more, get change&quot; and &quot;Use your old coppers in sixpenny lots&quot;. In the same year, in order to broaden their musical palate further the trio and erstwhile collaborator Andy Roberts merged into the expanded line-up of Grimms with performers such as Neil Innes, Vivian Stanshall and Zoot Money, alongside McGough&#x27;s fellow Liverpool poets Adrian Henri and Brian Patten. Innes and Stanshall can also be heard contributing to The Scaffold&#x27;s final release for Parlophone, &quot;Do The Albert&quot;, which also featured Keith Moon and Les Harvey. During the same period The Scaffold also recorded the darkly humorous theme tune to the British horror movie Burke And Hare, a version of which saw eventual release on &quot;The Scaffold at Abbey Road 1966-1971&quot; (both versions of the song feature a prominent backing vocal from Vivian Stanshall, suggesting that the session may feature the same lineup of musicians as &quot;Do The Albert&quot;).

In 1972, the group made a half hour musical movie entitled &quot;Plod&quot; based on an earlier stage production that centred around Gorman&#x27;s long-running &quot;P.C. Plod&quot; character. The film was made on location in Liverpool, and included boys from the Liverpool Institute High School, earlier attended by the McCartney brothers and Beatle George Harrison. The film was long thought lost but recently appeared on a DVD of How I Won The War featuring John Lennon. McGear also released his first solo album, &quot;Woman&quot; with some of the musical performers from Grimms, and Grimms as a unit continued with their exhaustive tours of the UK.

By early 1973 The Scaffold had transferred to Island Records and released &quot;Fresh Liver&quot;, their first full album of new material since 1969, and from which no singles were released (aside from &quot;W.P.C Hodges&quot; which was credited to Gorman as a solo artist). The new album again featured most of the musical performers from Grimms and as such, like the earlier &quot;McGough And McGear&quot; album, it relied less heavily than usual on purely spoken-word material. The trio then concentrated on their work as part of Grimms, until the end of the year when McGear left that group after frayed tempers on another demanding UK tour led to an altercation with Brian Patten.

After recording his next solo album &quot;McGear&quot; and the 1974 success of the one-off Scaffold single &quot;Liverpool Lou&quot; recorded with Paul McCartney and Wings (B-side &quot;Ten Years After on Strawberry Jam&quot;, also featured a musical backing composed by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings), McGear reunited The Scaffold to tour and record their final album, &quot;Sold Out&quot;. Following the template set by &quot;Fresh Liver&quot; of more music and less speech, &quot;Sold Out&quot; was released early in 1975 on Warner Bros. Records. After McGough and Gorman temporarily decamped to participate in the final Grimms LP &quot;Sleepers&quot; in 1976 and Gorman released his solo album, &quot;Go Man Gorman&quot;, The Scaffold moved to the Bronze Records label and continued touring and releasing singles through 1977. After that the group amicably disbanded (although there have been occasional reunions over the years, mostly for live performances).

===After The Scaffold===
After releasing a few more singles, McGear retired from the music business in the 1980s. Having proven himself artistically, he reverted to using his family name and has since carved out a career as a professional photographer and author. Gorman remained in the public eye through his regular appearances on such children&#x27;s television programmes as &quot;Tiswas&quot; throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. He continued to perform and record, and later moved into theatrical direction and production. Meanwhile, in 1978, McGough released his spoken-word solo album &quot;Summer With Monika&quot; (based upon his celebrated poetry collection of the same name). Since then he has arguably maintained the highest-profile and most sustained post-Scaffold career, still appearing regularly as a vocal performer on British radio and television, and continuing to be a highly regarded poet and author.
A reunion occurred in 2008, to record a reworking of The Lightning Seeds&#x27; single &quot;Three Lions&quot;, titled &quot;3 Shirts on a Line&quot;, for &quot;Liverpool – The Number Ones Album&quot;, a compilation album commemorating Liverpool being the European Capital of Culture. McCartney and Gorman represented The Scaffold in the Number One Concert in the 10,500-seater Echo Arena, receiving a standing ovation from the capacity audience. In 2009, the classic lineup was reunited in Ronnie Scott&#x27;s London Jazz Club for a BBC TV programme, and in October 2010, they reconvened for a Gala Concert in Shanghai, to celebrate the end of the Liverpool Pavilion as part of the World Expo. They shared the concert with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, OMD and the Liverpool Chinese Children&#x27;s Pagoda Orchestra.

In August 2013, McCartney and Gorman played to an international audience in the O2 as part of the Liverpool Music Festival. In October 2013 and 2014, the two played at the Heswall Arts Festival with musician and poet Keith Wilson, an occasional member of the line-up since 2008. The trio put on a concert to raise funds for the Nordic Church and Cultural Centre in Liverpool in October 2018.

McCartney and Gorman negotiated with promoters in Japan for appearances in Tokyo in 2015.

On 9 April 2020, the original members of the Scaffold released a re-worked version of &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot; in support of the British National Health Service staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. They recorded the new vocals on their iPhones and these were then put on the original backing track, the master of which McCartney had found in his attic.

===Discography notes===
* The album, &quot;McGough and McGear&quot;, is by Roger McGough and Mike McGear. All other releases by The Scaffold.
* Tracks which were first released from 1973 onward show the artist as Scaffold (rather than The Scaffold).
* See also Mike McGear Discography.
* See also Grimms Discography.
* There were probably other albums released in Japan. The two above are included because they have not been released on CD in the UK.
* There has been considerable debate as to the meaning of the place, item, person or event described in the lyric of the song &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot; as the Aintree Iron. The songwriter himself, Mike McGear, has apparently refused to divulge its identity.

<doc id="195520" wikidata="Q13582652" url="?curid=195520" title="Civil engineer">
<text>A civil engineer is a person who practices civil engineering – the application of planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, and operating infrastructure while protecting the public and environmental health, as well as improving existing infrastructure that may have been neglected.

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines because it deals with constructed environment including planning, designing, and overseeing construction and maintenance of building structures, and facilities, such as roads, railroads, airports, bridges, harbors, channels, dams, irrigation projects, pipelines, power plants, and water and sewage systems.

The term &quot;civil engineer&quot; was established by John Smeaton in 1750 to contrast engineers working on civil projects with the military engineers, who worked on armaments and defenses. Over time, various sub-disciplines of civil engineering have become recognized and much of military engineering has been absorbed by civil engineering. Other engineering practices became recognized as independent engineering disciplines, including chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering.

In some places, a civil engineer may perform land surveying; in others, surveying is limited to construction surveying, unless an additional qualification is obtained.

==Specialization==
Civil engineers usually practice in a particular specialty, such as construction engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, land development, transportation engineering, hydraulic engineering, sanitary engineering, and environmental engineering. A civil engineer is concerned with determining the right design for these structures and looking after the construction process so that the longevity of these structures is guaranteed after completion. These structures should also be satisfactory for the public in terms of comfort. Some civil engineers, particularly those working for government agencies, may practice across multiple specializations, particularly when involved in critical infrastructure development or maintenance.

==Work environment==
Civil engineers generally work in a variety of locations and conditions. Much of a civil engineer&#x27;s work is dealing with non-engineers or others from different technical disciplines, so training should give skills preparing future civil engineers in organizational relationships between parties to projects, cost and time. Many spend time outdoors at construction sites so that they can monitor operations or solve problems onsite. The job is typically a blend of in-office and on-location work depending on the focus of each engineer. Most engineers work full-time.

==Education and licensing==
In most countries, a civil engineer will have graduated from a post-secondary school with a degree in civil engineering, which requires a strong background in mathematics and the physical sciences; this degree is typically a bachelor&#x27;s degree, though many civil engineers study further to obtain master&#x27;s, engineer, doctoral and post doctoral degrees. In many countries, civil engineers are subject to licensure. In some jurisdictions with mandatory licensing, people who do not obtain a license may not call themselves &quot;civil engineers&quot;.

===Belgium ===
In Belgium, &quot;Civil Engineer&quot; (abbreviated Ir.) (, ) is a legally protected title applicable to graduates of the five-year engineering course of one of the six universities and the Royal Military Academy. Their speciality can be all fields of engineering: civil, structural, electrical, mechanical, chemical, physics and even computer science. This use of the title may cause confusion to the English speaker as the Belgian &quot;civil&quot; engineer can have a speciality other than civil engineering. In fact, Belgians use the adjective &quot;civil&quot; in the sense of &quot;civilian&quot;, as opposed to military engineers.

The formation of the civil engineer has a strong mathematical and scientific base and is more theoretical in approach than the practical oriented industrial engineer (Ing.) educated in a five-year program at a polytechnic. Traditionally, students were required to pass an entrance exam on mathematics to start civil engineering studies. This exam was abolished in 2004 for the Flemish Community, but is still organised in the French Community.

===Scandinavia===

In Scandinavian countries, &quot;civil engineer&quot; ( in Swedish; in Norwegian; in Danish) is a first professional degree, approximately equivalent to Master of Science in Engineering, and a protected title granted to students by selected institutes of technology. As in English, the word has its origin in the distinction between civilian and military engineers; before the start of the 19th century only military engineers existed, and the prefix &quot;civil&quot; was a way to separate those who had studied engineering in a regular university from their military counterparts. Today the degree spans over all fields within engineering, including civil engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electronics engineering, among others.

There is generally a slight difference between a Master of Science in Engineering degree and the Scandinavian civil engineer degree, the latter&#x27;s programme having closer ties with the industry&#x27;s demands. A civil engineer is the better-known of the two; still, the area of expertise remains obfuscated for most of the public. A noteworthy difference is the mandatory courses in mathematics and physics, regardless of the equivalent master&#x27;s degree, e.g. computer science.

Although a &quot;college engineer&quot; ( or in Swedish; in Norwegian; in Danish) is roughly equivalent to a Bachelor of Science in Scandinavia, to become a &quot;civil engineer&quot; one often has had to do up to one extra year of overlapping studies compared to attaining a B.Sc./M.Sc. combination. This is because the higher educational system is not fully adapted to the international standard graduation system, since it is treated as a professional degree. Today (2009) this is starting to change due to the Bologna process.

A Scandinavian will in international contexts commonly use the title of &quot;Master of Science in Engineering&quot; and will occasionally wear an engineering class ring. At the Norwegian Institute of Technology (now the Norwegian University of Science and Technology), the tradition with an NTH Ring goes back to 1914, before the Canadian iron ring.

===Spain ===
In Spain, a civil engineering degree can be obtained after four years of study in the various branches of mathematics, physics, mechanics, etc. The earned degree is called &quot;Grado en Ingeniería Civil&quot;. Further studies at a graduate school include master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees.

Before the current situation, that is, before the implementation of Bologna Process in 2010, a degree in civil engineering in Spain could be obtained after three to six years of study and was divided into two main degrees. 
In the first case, the earned degree was called &quot;Ingeniero Técnico de Obras Públicas&quot; (&quot;ITOP&quot;), literally translated as &quot;Public Works Engineer&quot; obtained after three years of study and equivalent to a Bachelor of Civil Engineering. 
In the second case, the academic degree was called &quot;Ingeniero de Caminos, Canales y Puertos&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Ingeniero de Caminos&quot; or &quot;ICCP&quot;), that literally means &quot;Highways, Canals and Harbors Engineer&quot;, though civil engineers in Spain practice in the same fields as civil engineers do elsewhere. This degree is equivalent to a Master of Civil Engineering and is obtained after five or six years of study depending on the school granting the title.

The first Spanish Civil Engineering School was the &quot;Escuela Especial de Ingenieros de Caminos y Canales&quot; (now called &quot;Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales y Puertos&quot;), established in 1802 in Madrid, followed by the &quot;Escuela Especial de Ayudantes de Obras Públicas&quot; (now called &quot;Escuela Universitaria de Ingeniería Técnica de Obras Públicas de la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid&quot;), founded in 1854 in Madrid. Both schools now belong to the Technical University of Madrid.

In Spain, a civil engineer has the technical and legal ability to design projects of any branch, so any Spanish civil engineer can oversee projects about structures, buildings (except residential structures which are reserved for architects), foundations, hydraulics, the environment, transportation, urbanism, etc. Mechanical and Electrical engineering tasks are included under the Industrial engineering degree.

===United Kingdom===
A chartered civil engineer (known as certified or professional engineer in other countries) is a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and has also passed membership exams. However, a non-chartered civil engineer may be a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers or the Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors. The description &quot;civil engineer&quot; is not restricted to members of any particular professional organisation although &quot;chartered civil engineer&quot; is.

===Eastern Europe===
In many Eastern European countries, civil engineering does not exist as a distinct degree or profession but its various sub-professions are often studied in separate university faculties and performed as separate professions, whether they are taught in civilian universities or military engineering academies. Even many polytechnic tertiary schools give out separate degrees for each field of study. Typically study in geology, geodesy, structural engineering and urban engineering allows a person to obtain a degree in construction engineering. Mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, hydraulics and even sometimes metallurgy are fields in a degree in &quot;Machinery Engineering&quot;. Computer sciences, control engineering and electrical engineering are fields in a degree in electrical engineering, while security, safety, environmental engineering, transportation, hydrology and meteorology are in a category of their own, typically each with their own degrees, either in separate university faculties or at polytechnic schools.

===United States===
In the United States, civil engineers are typically employed by municipalities, construction firms, consulting engineering firms, architect/engineer firms, the military, state governments, and the federal government. Each state requires engineers who offer their services to the public to be licensed by the state. Licensure is obtained by meeting specified education, examination, and work experience requirements. Specific requirements vary by state.

Typically, licensed engineers must graduate from an ABET-accredited university or college engineering program with a minimum of bachelor&#x27;s degree, pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (FE), obtain several years of engineering experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer, then pass the Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam. After completing these steps and the granting of licensure by a state board, engineers may use the title &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; or PE in advertising and documents. Most states have implemented mandatory continuing education requirements to maintain a license.

==Professional associations==

=== ASCE ===

The ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) represents more than 150,000 members of the civil engineering profession worldwide. Official members of the ASCE must hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree from an accredited civil engineering program and be a licensed professional engineer or have five years responsible charge of engineering experience.
Most civil engineers join this organization to be updated of current news, projects, and methods (such as sustainability) related to civil engineering as well as contribute their expertise and knowledge to other civil engineers and students obtaining their civil engineering degree.

=== ICE ===
The ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers) founded in 1818, represents, as of 2008, more than 80,000 members of the civil engineering profession worldwide. Its commercial arm, Thomas Telford Ltd, provides training, recruitment, publishing and contract services.

=== CSCE ===

Founded in 1887, the CSCE (Canadian Society for Civil Engineering) represents members of the Canadian civil engineering profession. Official members of the CSCE must hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree from an accredited civil engineering program. Most civil engineers join this organization to be updated of current news, projects, and methods (such as sustainability) related to civil engineering; as well as contribute their expertise and knowledge to other civil engineers and students obtaining their civil engineering degree. Local sections frequently host events such as seminars, tours, and courses.

<doc id="195521" wikidata="Q10913761" url="?curid=195521" title="MTV Unplugged">
<text>MTV Unplugged is an American television series on MTV. It showcases recorded live performances of popular music artists playing acoustic or &quot;unplugged&quot; variations of songs. The show aired regularly from 1989 to 1999. From 2000 to 2009, it aired less frequently and was usually billed as MTV Unplugged No. 2.0. Since 2009, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; specials have aired occasionally, sometimes through online or subscription only. Episodes and specials have tended to showcase one artist or group, playing a combination of their hit songs and covers.

Many of the artists who appeared on the show in the 1990s released their &quot;Unplugged&quot; session as an album, and some of these albums were commercial and critical hits. Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; (1992) sold 26 million copies worldwide and became the best-selling live album of all time. Albums such as Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1992), Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; (1994) and Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Unplugged&quot; (1996) became notable hits of the program. Other &quot;Unplugged&quot; albums that went platinum include Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged...and Seated&quot; (1993), 10,000 Maniacs&#x27; &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1993), Tony Bennett&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1994), Page and Plant&#x27;s &quot;No Quarter&quot; (1994), Shakira&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1999), Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged No. 2.0&quot; (2001), Alicia Keys&#x27; &quot;Unplugged&quot; (2005) and Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (2006). Some of these albums produced successful singles as well, including Mariah Carey&#x27;s No. 1 hit cover of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;.

The show received the George Foster Peabody Award and three Primetime Emmy nominations, in its original form.

A limited-run reboot of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; came in 2009, featuring six acts, which won the Emmy Award for Best New Approach.

As of 2021, several episodes are available to watch on Paramount+.

==Unplugged==
The term &quot;unplugged&quot; has come to refer to music that would usually be played on electrified instruments (such as an electric guitar or synthesizer) but is rendered instead on instruments that can be played without electricity, for example acoustic guitar or traditional piano, although a microphone is still used. In most cases, the bass (or bass guitar) is amplified, and a Hammond organ is sometimes used.

MTV launched &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; in 1989. The show featured musicians performing unplugged versions of their electric repertoire. Many of these performances were subsequently released as albums, often featuring the title &quot;Unplugged&quot;. It was believed that the show was inspired by a 1989 MTV Video Music Awards acoustic performance by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora; however, the show was already in production.

==Launch of &quot;Unplugged&quot;==
The MTV show titled &quot;Unplugged&quot;, drawing on this phenomenon, was created by producers Robert Small and Jim Burns. Songwriter Jules Shear hosted the first 13 episodes. The pilot and first seven episodes were produced by Bruce Leddy, after which Associate Producer Alex Coletti took over for the remainder of the series, producing the show through 2001. After the first 13 episodes, the role of host was eliminated. The show was produced by Viacom and RSE Inc and was most frequently directed by Milton Lage and Beth McCarthy.

The first episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; was taped on October 31, 1989, and aired about a month later on November 26.

==Selected list of artists==

===1989–1992===
*The series first aired November 26, 1989, featuring Squeeze, Syd Straw and Elliot Easton. The first 13 episodes were hosted by American singer-songwriter Jules Shear and featured Aerosmith, Elton John, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Poison, Joe Satriani and Stevie Ray Vaughan among others.
* Joe Walsh appeared on the show in 1989 with Dr. John. According to the book &quot;I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution&quot; by Rob Tannenbaum and Craig Marks, Walsh wanted to perform the Eagles classic &quot;Desperado&quot;, but Joel Gallen received a three-page fax from Don Henley denying the use of the song. MTV invited Henley to perform on the show, but Henley wanted to have a show featuring only himself. At that point, MTV was sharing the time between different artists. Dr. John was not originally scheduled to be part of the episode. With only Walsh booked, producers went next door where a VH1 morning show was being taped with Dr. John, and asked if he would be willing to join Walsh on &quot;Unplugged&quot;. Henley performed his solo episode in 1990.
*The Cure performed their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; session in their London studios on January 24, 1991. Their playlist featured classic songs such as &quot;The Walk&quot;, &quot;If Only Tonight We Could Sleep&quot;, &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; and a new song, &quot;A Letter to Elise&quot;, which would later be released on their next album.
*Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1991 appearance was later released on the &quot;Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)&quot; album. Show producer Alex Coletti went on to say that had McCartney not released it, the concept would have never gained the cult status that it went on to enjoy.
*On March 5, 1991, Sting performed a set mostly centered around songs by The Police or from his album &quot;The Soul Cages&quot;. Sting enjoyed the experience to the extent that the following month he did a similar set in his home town of Newcastle at the tiny Buddle Arts Centre.
*On April 10, 1991, &quot;Unplugged&quot; aired its first ever acoustic rap show. The special kicked off with individual performances by LL Cool J along with MC Lyte (&quot;Cappucino&quot;), De La Soul (&quot;Ring Ring Ring&quot;), and A Tribe Called Quest (&quot;Can I Kick It?&quot;) and a five piece back-up band, Pop&#x27;s Cool Love. The highlight of the show was LL Cool J&#x27;s energetic renditions of &quot;Jingling Baby&quot; and &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;.
*In 1992, Mariah Carey performed a cover version of The Jackson 5&#x27;s hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; along with backup singer Trey Lorenz. That live version was released as a single and went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as in Canada, New Zealand, Netherlands, and became a hit elsewhere. Due to high demand, the performance was released as an EP, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, which eventually sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The performance was released in a video form as well, achieving success particularly in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia.
*In 1992, Eric Clapton recorded an &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance at Bray Studios in London. He rearranged many of his classic songs for the acoustic context, and the resulting &quot;Unplugged&quot; album went on to become the best selling &quot;Unplugged&quot; album in the U.S. and worldwide with sales of 10 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide. Clapton earned six Grammy Awards for the album, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year (&quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;), Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Rock Male Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song.
*While MTV has filmed over 101 &quot;Unplugged&quot; performances, fewer than 30 of them have been released as albums. Pearl Jam&#x27;s March 1992 set was not released until 2009 as a DVD for their reissue of their debut album, &quot;Ten&quot;. This has been referred to as a breakout moment for the band during a time where the Seattle grunge scene was in high demand. Intense performances of the songs &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Porch&quot; highlight this show with the latter featuring lead singer Eddie Vedder writing PRO CHOICE on his arm with a Sharpie.
* On April 27, 1992, Seattle-based heavy metal band Queensrÿche filmed their &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance, playing such songs as &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, &quot;The Lady Wore Black&quot;, &quot;I Will Remember&quot;, &quot;The Killing Words&quot;, and a very well received cover of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;.
* On July 3, 1992, Annie Lennox played an &quot;Unplugged&quot; show at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Nine of the twelve songs performed were released as part of the single series &quot;Cold. Colder. Coldest.&quot; Each CD featured the studio version of Lennox&#x27;s &quot;Cold&quot; as well as three songs from the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; show. &quot;Cold&quot; consisting of songs from &quot;Diva&quot;, &quot;Colder&quot; songs Lennox has recorded with the Eurythmics and &quot;Coldest&quot; cover versions of songs originally by Ike &amp; Tina Turner, The Detroit Emeralds and The Beatles.

*In February 1993, Neil Young performed two shows on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. He was not happy with the first show so he came back the next night for the next show and gave a performance that was considered to be much better than the first; said performance was released a few months later. 
*On April 20, 1993, Midnight Oil recorded an episode at Sony Music Studios in New York City. They recorded a 17-song set which included many of their hits and an encore cover of &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; originally recorded by Eric Burdon and the Animals. The set was broadcast in the U.S. edited while Australia received a longer 9 song set. The full set was finally released on DVD in 2017. &quot;One Country&quot; was attempted in their session but was not finished and not released.
*On April 21, 1993, Soul Asylum performed their set two months before the release of &quot;Runaway Train&quot; music video.

They played many of their classic hits as well as their 1990 single &quot;Serious&quot;.
*Nirvana&#x27;s performance on &quot;Unplugged&quot; was one of the last televised performances by Kurt Cobain, recorded on November 18, 1993, about five months before Cobain&#x27;s death. Nirvana&#x27;s set list consisted of some of their lesser known originals, and covers of songs by the Meat Puppets, Lead Belly, David Bowie and The Vaselines. The only real &quot;hits&quot; played during this performance were &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot;. This contrasts with other &quot;Unplugged&quot; performances, where artists largely perform their hit singles and other original material. Nirvana&#x27;s performance was released a year later as &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, about seven months after Cobain&#x27;s death. It sold over 5 million copies and won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996. It was also released on DVD in 2007.
*In 1993, Stone Temple Pilots filmed a 26-minute episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, where they debuted the song &quot;Big Empty&quot; prior to the release of their 1994 album &quot;Purple&quot;.

The concert was released on CD (with four new studio tracks), VHS, and DVD, as &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;.
*On September 29, 1994, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs performed the first Latin/Spanish show at MTV Miami studios. The playlist included covers of The Clash&#x27;s &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; and reggae artist Keith &amp; Tex&#x27;s &quot;Stop That Train&quot;.
* On October 14, 1994 (recorded in August 1994), the long-awaited reunion between Jimmy Page and Robert Plant occurred on a 90-minute &quot;UnLedded&quot; MTV project, recorded in Morocco, Wales, and London, which rated highly on network television. It was not a reunion of Led Zeppelin, however, as former bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones was not present. In fact, Jones was not even told about the reunion by his former bandmates. In addition to acoustic numbers, the album features a reworking of Led Zeppelin classics, along with four Middle Eastern- and Moroccan-influenced songs: &quot;City Don&#x27;t Cry,&quot; &quot;Yallah&quot; (or &quot;The Truth Explodes&quot;), &quot;Wonderful One,&quot; and &quot;Wah Wah&quot;. The resulting album, &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;, was certified Platinum in the U.S. and elsewhere.
* In 1994, Lenny Kravitz performed with his band on MTV Unplugged an acoustic concert, along with an orchestra.

It was released on DVD in 2002 in the &quot;MTV Unplugged / Live&quot; video, and in audio form, originally as part of her &quot;Live Box&quot; compilation and then separately as &quot;Debut Live&quot; in 2004.

*On August 9, 1995, Kiss performed on an episode that would lead to the reunion of the original members. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons invited former members Peter Criss and Ace Frehley to participate in the show.

The recording of the episode was released as the album &quot;Kiss Unplugged&quot;.
*On August 10, 1995, Chris Isaak performed a set on an episode, including his hit song &quot;Wicked Game&quot;.
*On September 14, 1995, Chilean band Los Tres held an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance in Miami Beach, Florida. It was attended by Antonio Restucci and Cuti Aste, two Chilean musician friends of the band. This was the first unplugged album of a Chilean group for MTV and (according to MTV technicians) is the only truly unplugged concert that has been performed at some distance from each instrument as only the dynamic range of analog microphones were used. The resulting album, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, went quadruple platinum and was the most popular album in Chile in 1995. The recording was made just a few months after the death of Chilean musician Roberto Parra, an important inspiration for the band. Because of this, the group dedicated the concert and album to the memory of &quot;Uncle Robert&quot; and played two cuecas, &quot;El arrepentido&quot; and &quot;La vida que yo he pasado&quot;, as well as the popular foxtrot &quot;Quien es la que viene alli&quot;. The latter song became a success of great proportions, possibly the most important in the career of the band. The new song on the album, &quot;traje desastre&quot;, was also touted as a single from the album, and featured a video directed by Chilean film director German Bobe. The album contains 15 songs, of which 12 are their own compositions and three of Roberto Parra.
*On March 12, 1996, Soda Stereo was invited to Miami to record a session for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. After a few refusals by the band, they convinced the network to accept an offer where the band would play plugged in, but with modifications such as orchestration including new arrangements of some of their classic songs. The result was an eclectic mix of music, some electric, some acoustic, but all bearing Gustavo Cerati&#x27;s signature style. A highlight of the album was a soaring rendition of &quot;En la Ciudad de la Furia,&quot; where the chorus was sung by Andrea Echeverri of the Colombian rock band Aterciopelados. The recording of the performance was partially released on the album &quot;Comfort y Música Para Volar&quot; (&quot;Comfort and Music to Fly By&quot;) and in its entirety on a new version of &quot;Comfort&quot; in 2007. The album contained four new tracks from the recording sessions as well as an interactive CD-ROM with pictures and videos from the show.
*On April 10, 1996, Alice in Chains gave their first performance in three years and one of their last concerts as a group for nine years. During the show, lead singer Layne Staley looked visibly weak due to his ongoing drug addictions, but was able to deliver a strong performance. As one of Staley&#x27;s last performances, this is considered to be one of the most popular and most memorable &quot;Unplugged&quot; sessions.
*Oasis were due to tape the show at the Royal Festival Hall on August 23, 1996, when lead singer Liam Gallagher pulled out at the last minute, citing a sore throat. The band performed despite this, with songwriter and guitarist Noel Gallagher handling the vocals, earning much critical praise. Liam watched the performance and heckled the group from a balcony. Their performance of &quot;Round Are Way&quot; later appeared on the 20th anniversary edition of their album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;
*In 1996, pop artist George Michael gave an &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance for a crowd of 200-300 people. He performed a few select tracks from his album &quot;Older&quot; and a few from his earlier recordings (including one from his Wham! days). He also did a cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot;. The performance was critically acclaimed and was the last performance his mother saw, as she died the following year.
* In 1997, neo-soul singer Maxwell performed Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; and Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Closer&quot; on the show to high acclaim.
*On September 26, 1997, Bryan Adams performed on &quot;Unplugged&quot; at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and released an album of the performance. Adams was joined by Irish piper Davy Spillane and Michael Kamen (who wrote orchestrations for many of the songs and brought students from the Juilliard School to play them). Three new songs were included: &quot;Back To You&quot;, &quot;When You Love Someone&quot; and &quot;A Little Love&quot;. The song &quot;If Ya Wanna Be Bad – Ya Gotta Be Good&quot; made its debut on the album. The record sold over 5 million units worldwide.
*On March 10, 1998, Mexican rock group Maná recorded their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance at MTV&#x27;s Miami studios. The concert was released on CD and DVD on June 22, 1999 in the Americas and Spain. It includes exclusive covers of the José Alfredo Jiménez song &quot;Te Solte La Rienda&quot;, the Rubén Blades song &quot;Desapariciones&quot;, and &quot;Se Me Olvidó Otra Vez&quot; by Juan Gabriel. The recording received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album.
* In 1997, Argentine musician Luis Alberto Spinetta performed on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; with his band Los Socios del Desierto (with some invited musicians like Juan &quot;Mono&quot; Fontana on keyboard). This performance was atypical as Spinetta performed longer that an hour, playing seven new songs and mostly ignoring his past hits. This was released as &quot;Estrelicia MTV Unplugged&quot; later that year.
*On September 8, 1999, Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette performed on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, later released in November as &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot;. Twelve tracks were included on the album, but Morissette performed several others, including &quot;Baba&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot; (both from 1998&#x27;s &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;) and &quot;Your House&quot; (the hidden track on 1995&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;). In addition to material from Morissette&#x27;s first two U.S. albums, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; featured performances of &quot;No Pressure over Cappuccino&quot; and &quot;Princes Familiar&quot;, two previously unreleased songs from her tours, a cover of The Police song &quot;King of Pain&quot;, and &quot;These R the Thoughts&quot;, a previously released B-side.
*In 1999, Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira&#x27;s concert became the first episode of the program to be broadcast entirely in another language – her native Spanish. Her &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; release was particularly successful in introducing Shakira into the English-speaking world; it charted at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Charts and became the first Latin &quot;Unplugged&quot; album to win a Grammy Award. 
*In October 1999, Irish band The Corrs performed live on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (recorded in Wicklow, Ireland). The concert was recorded and published an album in November 1999.

On July 30, 2020, Code Orange performed a livestreamed acoustic set on Twitch spoofing &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; under the title of &quot;MUDTV Mudbanger&#x27;s Ball&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic. The band described it as &quot;conceptually akin to classic &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performances, but with nightmarish digital twists and turns.&quot; The performance was later remastered and released on September 4, 2020, as their album &quot;Under The Skin&quot;.

<doc id="195522" wikidata="Q1521282" url="?curid=195522" title="Gluten-free, casein-free diet">
<text>A gluten-free casein-free diet (GFCF diet), also known as a gluten-free dairy-free diet (GFDF diet), is a diet that does not include gluten (found most often in wheat, barley, and rye), and casein (found most often in milk and dairy products). Despite an absence of scientific evidence, there have been advocates for the use of this diet as a treatment for autism and related conditions.

==Uses==

===Autism===
The majority of the available evidence does not support the use of this diet in the treatment of autism.

* American Academy of Pediatrics – Clinical Report (2007) In their report, the AAP did not recommend the use of special diets for children with autism spectrum disorder because of inadequate evidence.
* Cochrane Library – Gluten and Casein-free diets in autism spectrum disorder (2008) The Cochrane review found that while relatively commonly used the evidence to support the diets use in children with autism was poor. All studies as of 2006 had issues with them.
* &quot;Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders&quot; – Gluten-free and casein free diets in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review (2009) It concluded that the results &quot;reveal that the current corpus of research does not support the use of GFCF diets in the treatment of ASD. Given the lack of empirical support, and the adverse consequences often associated with GFCF diets (e.g. stigmatization, diversion of treatment resources, reduced bone cortical thickness), such diets should only be implemented in the event a child with ASD experiences acute behavioral changes, seemingly associated with changes in diet or a child has allergies or food intolerances to gluten or casein.&quot;
* Vanderbilt Evidence-based Practice Center – Therapies for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2011) The review, commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, concluded that, &quot;the evidence supporting GFCF diets in ASD is limited and weak.&quot;
* &quot;Clinical Therapeutics&quot; – The relationship of autism to gluten (2013) This review found one double-blind study, which did not find any benefit from the gluten-free diet, and concluded that &quot;Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support instituting a gluten-free diet as a treatment for autism.&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Child Neurology&quot; – Evidence of the Gluten-Free and Casein-Free Diet in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review (2014) This review found that &quot;...the evidence on this topic is currently limited and weak,&quot; and noted that only a few randomized trials had been conducted on the efficacy of gluten-free diets as an autism treatment. The review also noted that even these trials were of questionable scientific merit because they were based on small sample sizes.
* &quot;Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition &amp; Metabolic Care&quot; – Gluten-free and casein-free diets in the therapy of autism (2015) This review found &quot;limited and weak&quot; evidence that this diet was effective as a treatment for autism, noting that most studies that had been done to assess its effectiveness were &quot;seriously flawed&quot;.
*&quot;Autism Research Institute&quot; – The Autism Research Institute, an organization with a history of advocating unsupported hypotheses regarding autism, including that it can be caused by vaccines or treated with chelation therapy, recommends the GFCF/GFDF diet as a treatment for autism and related conditions. The organization believes that, &quot;Dietary intervention is a cornerstone of an evidence-based medical approach, and there is convincing empirical evidence that special diets help many with autism.&quot;

==Safety==
The diet may have a negative effect on bone health, although there is debate over whether this is actually due to the diet or caused by issues associated with autism.

==Mechanism==
In the 1960s, Curtis Dohan speculated that the low incidence of schizophrenia in certain South Pacific Island societies was a result of a diet low in wheat and milk-based foods. Dohan proposed a genetic defect wherein individuals are incapable of completely metabolizing gluten and casein as a possible cause for schizophrenia. Dohan hypothesized that elevated peptide levels from this incomplete metabolism could be responsible for schizophrenic behaviors. In 1979, Jaak Panksepp proposed a connection between autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children.

The possibility of a relationship between autism and the consumption of gluten and casein was first articulated by Kalle Reichelt in 1991. Based on studies showing correlation between autism, schizophrenia, and increased urinary peptide levels, Reichelt hypothesized that some of these peptides may have an opiate effect. This led to the development of the opioid excess theory, expounded by Paul Shattock and others, which speculates that peptides with opioid activity cross into the bloodstream from the lumen of the intestine, and then into the brain. These peptides were speculated to arise from incomplete digestion of certain foods, in particular gluten from wheat and certain other cereals and from casein from milk and dairy produce. Further work confirmed opioid peptides such as casomorphines (from casein) and gluten exorphines and gliadorphin (from gluten) as possible suspects, due to their chemical similarity to opiates.

Reichelt hypothesized that long term exposure to these opiate peptides may have effects on brain maturation and contribute to social awkwardness and isolation. On this basis, Reichelt and others have proposed a gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet for those with autism to minimize the buildup of opiate peptides. Reichelt has also published a number of trials and reviews concluding that this diet is effective.

==Practical implementation==

The implementation of a GFCF diet involves removing all sources of gluten and casein from a person&#x27;s diet. Gluten is found in all products containing wheat, rye, and barley. Many gluten-free breads, pastas, and snacks are available commercially. Gluten-free cookbooks have been available for decades. Casein is found in dairy products such as milk, yogurt or cheese, but is also present in smaller amounts in many substitute dairy products such as vegetarian cheese substitutes and whipped cream topping, which use casein to provide texture.

<doc id="195523" wikidata="Q2568971" url="?curid=195523" title="Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover">
<text>Benjamin Hall, Baron Llanover (8 November 1802- 27 April 1867) was a Whig / Liberal politician and social, church, health and local government reformer who served in the House of Commons from 1831 until his elevation to the peerage in 1859. As President of the Board of Health from 1854-1855 he was a minister in the Cabinet and thereafter occupied the non-Cabinet position of First Commissioner of Public Works until 1858. In 1859 he was made a Peer as Lord Llanover of Llanover and Abercarn and served in the House of Lords until his death in 1867. He was a Minister under Lords Aberdeen and Palmerston and was a member of the Privy Council.

He was a prominent reformer whose primary focus in parliamentary debates was on church reform, local government and sanitation. He was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first Minister of Health, playing an import role in the development of modern systems for the management of health and sanitation in London and later, as First Commissioner for Works, established the Metropolitan Board of Works, the first metropolis-wide government for London. He also oversaw the completion of the new Houses of Parliament and is today chiefly remembered as the person after whom Big Ben, the largest bell in its Elizabeth Tower, is named.

==Early life==

Lord Llanover was the eldest son of Benjamin Hall, a Welsh ironmaster and Member of Parliament, and Charlotte, the daughter of Richard Crawshay, a prominent ironmaster and pioneer of the Industrial Revolution in Wales and, in his time, one of the wealthiest men in the United Kingdom.
Educated at the Westminster School in London, he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1820.
Thereafter he travelled in the United Kingdom and Europe and in 1826, at the age of only 24, served a year in the ceremonial role of Sheriff of Monmouthshire. During his travels he visited New Lanark, the model settlement and social experiment managed by Robert Owen a philanthropist and social reformer. The visit is said to have influenced Hall&#x27;s management of his own estates in Wales and his general views of the direction of social reform. Upon his return he took up the oversight of his estates at Llanover and Abercarn and served as a Magistrate. From the time of his marriage to Augusta Waddington in 1823, and under her influence, he also became interested in the revival of the Welsh language and culture, a cause the couple championed throughout their lives.

==Member of Parliament for Monmouth Boroughs and Marylebone==
In 1830 he entered politics, standing for election to the Monmouth Boroughs seat in Parliament. In so doing he took on the powerful and conservative Somerset family, headed by the Duke of Beaufort, which had since the time of Henry the VIII dominated Monmouthshire politics and controlled the seat in the House of Commons. At the time Monmouth Boroughs was held by the Marquis of Worcester, son and heir to the Duke. In the General Election of April–June 1831 Hall took the seat from Lord Worcester. His platform was pro-reform against a sitting MP who had publicly announced his opposition to the Reform Bill which Hall, in his first actions in the House of Commons, supported during its first and second readings in June and July 1831. However, Lord Worcester disputed the loss of his seat on the grounds of wrongful appointment of new burgesses in Newport who had voted in the election and, following an investigation by a committee of the House, he was reinstated as MP for Monmouth in July 1831, with Hall losing his seat.

In the election of December of 1832 he again contested the Borough of Monmouth against Lord Worcester whom he once more defeated. He was reelected in January 1835, this time surviving another petition contesting the validity of his support. For the election of 1837 he switched his seat to the Marylebone constituency in London which he continued to represent until his elevation to the peerage in 1857.

As an MP Hall was a noted reformer focusing particularly on social issues and reform of the church and local government. He was also an early opponent of the death penalty and in his first years in Parliament supported the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.

===Religious tolerance and reform of the established church===
Although an Anglican, he was known for his tolerance of other faiths and defence of the rights of Catholics, Jews and dissenters at a time when such views were not held by the majority. He had a reputation for taking up such causes in Parliament, criticising what he believed to be the failings of the leadership of the established church and was an outspoken proponent of church reform. His attitudes and the reasons for his reputation as a vehement critic of the Church are well reflected in a speech delivered during an 1850 debate on remuneration and housing of the Anglican clergy, also published as a pamphlet under the title &quot;A letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury on the state of the Church&quot;. In his speech and pamphlet he emphasised the disparities in stipends, where some bishops received over £50 000 per year while the lower clergy were paid as little is £40 per annum, and a situation where nearly £144 000 had been spent on bishops palaces with only £5 295 allocated for housing of what he called the &quot;working clergy&quot;. In this same debate, he dealt with what he regarded as the many other abuses of the considerable property holdings of the church and how they were used to enrich senior clergy rather than being applied to religious purposes. Other issues covered included nepotism in church appointments, non-residence of clergy in their parishes and pluralism, a practice whereby a clergyman was appointed to more than one parish, receiving stipends from each and then employing curates to serve in the parishes in which he did not reside, pocketing the difference between income from the &#x27;living&#x27; and the lower wages he paid to curates.

As a promoter of Welsh culture and language, he also campaigned for the appointment of Welsh speaking Anglican clergy and bishops in Wales and for Welsh Bishops to be resident in their diocese.

He also spoke out against the practice of barring Jewish MPs from taking their seats because they objected to taking the oath of allegiance due to its wording requiring them to acknowledge being Christian.

As himself the grandson of a senior clergyman, Rev Dr Benjamin Hall (1742-1825), a Canon in and Chancellor of Llandaff Cathedral, many of his views on the church would have been anathema to his grandfather who was a substantial pluralist who simultaneously held three livings and two prebendaries, earning a handsome income from distant parishes that he could rarely if ever have visited.

===Chartism and Irish unrest===

While a critic of the Chartists and their agenda, following the Chartist unrest of 1839, he showed understanding and sympathy for the underlying causes of the discontent, but no support for acts of violent rebellion. He was one of the few to speak in support of John Frost, the leader of the Newport Rising, during his 1840 trial for high treason.

By the time of the European revolutions of 1848, which in the United Kingdom manifested themselves through further Chartist unrest and the Young Ireland rebellion, he remained firmly opposed to violence, condemning the leaders of the Irish unrest as maniacs and propagators of &quot;falsehood and hypocrisy&quot; and those of the Chartists as &quot;contemptible and hateful&quot;.

===The Corn Laws and famine in Ireland===
From the 1830s up to the time of their repeal in 1846, and despite being a large landholder, he opposed the Corn Laws which protected agricultural interests, but led to higher food prices in urban areas. He was a member of the Anti–Corn Law League which campaigned for repeal of the laws. On the matter of relief for Ireland during the course of the Irish Famine, which was exacerbated by the impact of the Corn Laws, he campaigned hard for Irish landlords to be taxed in the same way as their English counterparts and generally to equitably contribute to famine relief.

===Local government and sanitary services===
From the early 1850s, he started to raise matters concerning local government, in particular the need to improve sanitation and the efficiency of the governance of London. In 1850 he commenced his criticism of the Corporation of London which, unlike municipal authorities in other large cities, had been exempted from the provisions of the Municipla Corporation Act of 1835. Reform of the Corporation was his major focus over the following period. In March 1853 he gave notice in Parliament of his intention to introduce a bill to reform the London Corporation, something he eventually achieved during his tenure as First Commissioner for Public Works. This threat appears to have encouraged the government to set up a commission to investigate reform of London&#x27;s system of government.

During debate in the Commons on the Public Health Bill in 1854 he was a vocal critic of the management and operations of the Board of Health, the instrument set up by the Public Health Act of 1848, and in particular the conduct of the leading commissioner, fellow social reformer Edwin Chadwick. This criticism focused on the failure of the Public Health Act to provide a significant role for local government and the side-lining by Chadwick and the third Commissioner, Dr Thomas Southwood Smith of the First Commissioner of Works, who represented the government on the Board. He was particularly concerned about the way in which Chadwick and Southwood Smith set a programme that frequently put the Board at odds with local government and how, in his opinion, this made it ineffective.

===Baronet===
Following publication of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Coronation Honours List on 16 August 1838, he was made a Baronet in the style of &quot;Sir Benjamin Hall of Llanover Court&quot;.

==President of the Board of Health==
Following the passing of the Public Health Bill into law in August 1854 he was appointed President of a reconstituted Board of Health. Previously it had nominally fallen under the First Commissioner for Public Works, but the changes of 1854 expanded the number of Commissioners and created the position of &quot;President&quot;, giving the Board equal status to bodies such as the Board of Trade which were also committees of the Privy Council and who&#x27;s presidents were members of the Cabinet. The President of the Board of Health was therefore a Cabinet Minister, making Benjamin Hall the United Kingdom&#x27;s first &#x27;Minister of Health&#x27;, a title by which he was also referred to.

Very shortly after his appointment there was a new and serious outbreak of cholera in the Broad Street neighbourhood of Soho in London that spread to other parts of the city. Unusually for someone in his position, he made house to house inspections of affected areas in order to fully understand the situation and its causes. This led him to adopt new measures that, according to his biographer, Maxwell Fraser, meant that &quot;... the loss of life was far less than in previous cholera epidemics&quot;. By carefully studying this cholera outbreak Dr John Snow conclusively proved his earlier theory that cholera was spread by the use of contaminated water, a position that was fully accept by Sir Benjamin Hall at a time when others still disputed the veracity of Snow&#x27;s research.

During the 1854 cholera outbreak the Board of Health had been frustrated in its efforts to limit the spread of the disease by the intransigence of the many and fragmented authorities responsible for managing sanitation and implementing instructions of the Board. In a study after the epidemic the Board found that there had been more cases of the disease in parishes where its instructions had been ignored. On 29 January 1855, Sir Benjamin addressed a letter to the Home Secretary and Prime Minister explaining these problems and setting out his observations and those of medical experts. He made it clear that the spread of the disease was localised around areas where there were &quot;Open ditches as sewers. Want of sewers. Badly constructed sewers... sub-soil saturated with filth. Want of house drainage. Absence of any organised daily system of cleaning ... Bad water ... Lastly ... multiplicity of local authorities ...&quot; He went on to say that &quot;The first and most obvious necessity in the metropolis is to sweep away the existing chaos of local jurisdiction.&quot;

While it was to take him a few more years to bring legislation that would reform the government of London, following the 1855 epidemic Benjamin Hall introduced and succeeded in having passed into law further and comprehensive amendments to the Public Health Act. These allowed for decentralisation of responsibility for sanitary services and infrastructure through the establishment of local sanitary boards. The amendments also provided for the employment of officials to ensure the implementation of the measures set out in the Act and permitted the government to intervene in sanitary matters in situations where a local board did not exist or was ineffective. Notably it also introduced regulations governing the construction of houses in order to ensure that they were properly ventilated, insulated, drained and provided with appropriately located sanitary facilities.

He also introduced a bill, which on 14 August 1855, a few weeks after his departure as Minister of Health, was signed into law as the new Nuisances Removal Act for England 1855 (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. 121). This legislation combined and improved two previous acts, the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 123) and the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Amendment Act 1849 (12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. 111), providing local authorities in England with powers to ensure the fitness for consumption of food produce through measures which required that premises used for processing, storage and sale were suitable and ensured that the produce remained hygienic. It also controlled the discharge of effluents from such premises and provided for the appointment of committees and inspectors to enforce its provisions.

===Member of the Privy Council===
On 14 November 1854 he was sworn in as a member of the Queens&#x27; Privy Council at Windsor Castle. This was by virtue of his presidency of the Board of Health and he would have continued to serve in this capacity until he was appointed First Commissioner of Works.

==First Commissioner of Works==

On 21 July 1855 he was appointed First Commissioner of Works (Also referred to as &quot;Chief Commissioner of Works&quot; and &quot;Minister of Public Works&quot;). During his tenure this was a non-cabinet portfolio and he was responsible for the Board of Works and its associated Bureaucracy, the Office of Works and Public Buildings.
During his two and a half year tenure in this position he did much to improve public parks and roads in London in particular and oversaw the final stages of completion of the new Houses of Parliament. Evidence of his improvement of parks remains through the presence of St Govor&#x27;s Well in Kensington Gardens, a drinking fountain which he had erected and named after the patron saint of the church at Llanover. (This site is associated with the fictional character Peter Pan, being mentioned in James Barrie&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel The Little White Bird.) However, his singular and most noted achievement was the creation of the first unified system of government for the metropolis of London.

Another notable achievement as First Commissioner of Works was a transformation and improvement of the efficiency of the bureaucracy that supported his area of responsibility. On his arrival at what was known as the &quot;Office of Works and Public Buildings&quot;, in his own words, he found that despite the required 10am-4pm work hours and six day week, &quot;The Secretary had not attended for two years ... the Surveyor was of doubtful sanity and also absent, but that the Deputy Surveyor attended &#x27;sometimes on Friday&#x27; ... while the clerks of works attended on the second Tuesday of each month&quot;. The finances of the Board of Works were also subject to over 2000 audit queries.

===Establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works===
He had become convinced of the necessity of transformation of the system of government of London since he had begun to take up issues of local government from 1850 and his experience as Minister of Health had brought home to him the necessity of achieving this. In October 1854, shortly after taking up the health portfolio, he commenced work on a bill that would create the first city-wide form of government for London. The bill was informed by the report of a royal commission of the preceding year that had looked into governance and the state of the city, but ultimately differed quite substantially in many of its provisions.

During his work on health and sanitation he had become familiar with the state of the city&#x27;s facilities and realised that they could only be properly managed, and further epidemics avoided, if there was coordination of construction of infrastructure and its management throughout the metropolis. At the time the city was made up of a number of independent boroughs and vestries that were unable to coordinate their efforts due to fierce protection of vested interests. These included the particularly powerful City Corporation which had successfully fended off previous attempts at reform. Recommendations of the royal commission included creation of seven new municipalities in the place of the multitude of existing authorities, but was considered too costly and likely to be firmly opposed by those who wished to retain the status quo.
On 16 March 1855 he introduced his bill on local management in the metropolis with a speech in the House of Commons. In it he supported the royal commission&#x27;s idea of establishing a Metropolitan Board of Works that would have oversight of major public works throughout the greater city and some oversight of district bodies within its areas of operation. In order to work around vested interests the board was to be made up of members appointed by the 39 existing vestries and boroughs, rather than directly elected by voters, thus ensuring that members of existing bodies who were opposed to reform could have fewer objections. The new Board was funded by transfer of receipt of coal duties previously received by the London Corporation. The metropolitan area included parts of the counties of Middlesex, Kent and Surrey. On 16 August 1855 the bill was signed into law as the Metropolis Management Act 1855. Over the following three decades the Metropolitan Board of Works markedly improved the general state of the greater London area, including sanitary services, roads, paving and lighting and their state of maintenance.

When introducing his bill for establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Sir Benjamin Hall had promised the introduction of further reforms of municipal government that would go beyond matters of public works. Over the following decades several attempts were made to expand the powers of the board into other areas and reduce the number of authorities responsible for local government in London, but until the establishment of the London County Council in 1889 all failed.

Concerning his achievement of a unified system of metropolitan government for London, Sir Gwilym Gibbon and Reginald Bell, in their &#x27;History of the London County Council&#x27;, state that &quot;For his work in this alone, [Sir Benjamin Hall] will always stand high in the history of London&quot;.

===Big Ben===

At over 6’4” (1.93m) tall, Sir Benjamin was known as ‘Big Ben’. At the time of the installation of the first casting of the famous and largest bell in the Elizabeth Tower of the Houses of Parliament in 1856, he was in his capacity as First Commissioner of Works responsible for the works and the bell came to be called &quot;Big Ben&quot; in his honour. The following year the bell cracked and had to be recast, but retained its name despite the fact that he was no longer Commissioner of Works.

==Baron Llanover of Llanover and Abercarn==

After the election of 1854 Benjamin Hall sat on the opposition benches, but following the election of May 1859 and the victory of a coalition of Whigs, Radicals, Peelites and a grouping of Irish MPs that formed the first Liberal Party government, he had hopes of returning to office and it was for a time rumoured that he would be offered the position of Home Secretary. On 16 June he was summoned by the Prime Minister and instead of a ministery was offered a barony with elevation to the House of Lords. He took the title &#x27;Lord Llanover of Llanover and Abercarn&#x27;, the names of his estates in Monmouthshire. This effectively marked the end of his career in politics as in the House of Lords he was never as active as he had been in the Commons and seldom contributed to debate.

==Ideology==
The ‘Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography’ says that “His political liberalism was of a very advanced kind” and in a profile in the Monmouthshire Merlin in 1854 he is characterised as “one of the most independent members of the House of Commons – the most liberal and most consistent ... an upright honourable honest man … regardless of the transient glare of popularity….” who&#x27;s speeches were delivered with an “exceedingly good humor”.

A lifelong proponent of Welsh culture and language, he clearly regarded himself as Welshman and, despite spending a large part of his life in London and expending much effort on improving the quality of life of residents of that city, in his writings he always referred to &quot;the English&quot; in a way that defined him differently. This appears to have been an issue of identity rather than an expression of Welsh nationalism.

==Personal life==

On 4 November 1823, he married Augusta Waddington the daughter and heiress of Benjamin Waddington. She was a promoter of Welsh culture and language and the home they built on the Llanover Estate in Monmouthshire was a centre for associated activities.
They had two sons, neither of whom survived into adulthood, and a daughter, Augusta Charlotte Elizabeth, who married the wealthy Catholic John Herbert (12 Nov 1846) and was the mother of Ivor Herbert, 1st Baron Treowen.

Although tolerant of other beliefs, Augusta Herbert&#x27;s parents were concerned regarding the attitudes of their more conservative tenants towards a future Catholic landlord. The Herbert&#x27;s were not agreeable to the suggestion that one of their sons be raised as an Anglican heir and the Llanover&#x27;s turned to Benjamin&#x27; Hall&#x27;s sister, Charlotte Berrington&#x27;s family, agreeing that her son, Arthur, would inherit their estates. He began to take on some of the responsibilities for their management, but after a time he and Lord Llanover disagreed on a suitable marriage partner for Arthur and Arthur declined to follow his uncle into politics. As a result, the relationship between the Llanovers and Berringtons broke down and the Llanover and Abercarn estates were ultimately left to the Herberts.

On 27 April 1867 Lord Llanover died at his home in Mayfair, London aged 64, whereupon the baronetcy and barony became extinct. A keen hunter throughout his life, he lost an eye in a hunting accident in 1848. His death was the result of a facial tumour caused by another shooting accident in November 1866.
