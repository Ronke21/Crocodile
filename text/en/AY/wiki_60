<text>The Atlantic Charter was a statement issued on 14 August 1941 that set out American and British goals for the world after the end of World War II, months before the US officially entered the war. The joint statement, later dubbed the Atlantic Charter, outlined the aims of the United States and the United Kingdom for the postwar world as follows: no territorial aggrandizement, no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people (self-determination), restoration of self-government to those deprived of it, reduction of trade restrictions, global co-operation to secure better economic and social conditions for all, freedom from fear and want, freedom of the seas, abandonment of the use of force, and disarmament of aggressor nations. The charter&#x27;s adherents signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, which was the basis for the modern United Nations.

The charter inspired several other international agreements and events after the war. The dismantling of the British Empire, the formation of NATO, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade all derived from the Atlantic Charter. In 2021, a document titled the New Atlantic Charter was signed by United States President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at their first meeting in Cornwall.

==Background==

The Allies of World War II first expressed their principles and vision for the world after the war in the Declaration of St. James&#x27;s Palace in June 1941. The Anglo-Soviet Agreement was signed in July 1941 and formed an alliance between the two countries.

United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill discussed what would become the Atlantic Charter in August 1941 during the Atlantic Conference in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. They made their joint declaration on 14 August 1941 from the US naval base on the bay, Naval Base Argentia, which had recently been leased from Britain as part of the Destroyers-for-bases deal. The US did not enter the war as a combatant until the attack on Pearl Harbor, four months later. Since the policy was issued as a statement, there was no formal, legal document called &quot;Atlantic Charter.&quot;

Many of the charter&#x27;s ideas came from an ideology of Anglo-American internationalism, which sought British-American co-operation for international security. Roosevelt&#x27;s attempts to tie Britain to concrete war aims and Churchill&#x27;s desperation to bind the US to the war effort helped to provide motivations for the meeting that produced the Atlantic Charter. It was assumed at the time in Britain that the British and the Americans would have an equal role to play in any postwar international organization that would be based on the charter&#x27;s principles.

Churchill and Roosevelt began communicating in 1939, the first of their 13 meetings during the war; however, it was not their first meeting, since they had attended the same dinner at Gray&#x27;s Inn on 29 July 1918. Both men traveled in secret; Roosevelt was on a ten-day fishing trip.

On 9 August 1941, the British battleship HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; steamed into Placentia Bay, with Churchill on board, and escorted by the destroyers HMS &quot;Ripley&quot;, and , and met the American heavy cruiser USS &quot;Augusta&quot;, where Roosevelt and members of his staff were waiting. &quot;Augusta&quot; was escorted by the cruiser , and the destroyers USS &quot;McDougal&quot;, USS &quot;Madison&quot;, USS &quot;Moffett&quot;, USS &quot;Sampson&quot;, and USS &quot;Winslow&quot;.
Once they met, Churchill and Roosevelt were silent for a moment until Churchill said, &quot;At long last, Mr. President.&quot; Roosevelt replied, &quot;Glad to have you aboard, Mr. Churchill.&quot;

Churchill then delivered a letter from King George VI to Roosevelt and made an official statement, but a movie sound crew that was present failed to record it despite two attempts.

==Content and analysis==
The Atlantic Charter made it clear that the United States supported Britain in the war. Both wanted to present their unity regarding their mutual principles and hopes for a peaceful postwar world and the policies that they agreed to follow once Germany had been defeated. A fundamental aim was to focus on the peace that would follow, not specific American involvement and war strategy, although American involvement appeared increasingly likely.

There were eight principal clauses of the charter:
#No territorial gains were to be sought by the United States or the United Kingdom.
#Territorial adjustments must be in accord with the wishes of the peoples concerned.
#All people had a right to self-determination.
#Trade barriers were to be lowered.
#There was to be global economic co-operation and advancement of social welfare.
#The participants would work for a world free of want and fear.
#The participants would work for freedom of the seas.
#There was to be disarmament of aggressor nations and a common disarmament after the war.

The fourth clause, with respect to international trade, consciously emphasized that both &quot;victor [and] vanquished&quot; would be given market access &quot;on equal terms.&quot; That was a repudiation of the punitive trade relations that had been established within Europe after World War I, as exemplified by the Paris Economy Pact.

==Origin of name==
When it was released to the public on 14 August 1941, the charter was titled &quot;Joint Declaration by the President and the Prime Minister&quot; and was generally known as the &quot;Joint Declaration.&quot; The Labour Party newspaper &quot;Daily Herald&quot; coined the name &quot;Atlantic Charter&quot;. Churchill used the term in the British Parliament on 24 August 1941, and it has since been generally adopted.

No signed version ever existed. The document was threshed out through several drafts, and the final agreed text was telegraphed to London and Washington, DC. Roosevelt gave Congress the charter&#x27;s content on 21 August 1941. He later said, &quot;There isn&#x27;t any copy of the Atlantic Charter, so far as I know. I haven&#x27;t got one. The British haven&#x27;t got one. The nearest thing you will get is the [message of the] radio operator on &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. That&#x27;s the nearest thing you will come to it... There was no formal document.&quot;

The British War Cabinet replied with its approval, and a similar acceptance was telegraphed from Washington. During the process, an error crept into the London text, but it was subsequently corrected. The account in Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Second World War&quot; concluded, &quot;A number of verbal alterations were agreed, and the document was then in its final shape.&quot; It made no mention of any signing or ceremony.

Churchill&#x27;s account of the Yalta Conference quoted Roosevelt as saying of the unwritten British constitution that &quot;it was like the Atlantic Charter – the document did not exist, yet all the world knew about it. Among his papers he had found one copy signed by himself and me, but strange to say both signatures were in his own handwriting.&quot;

==Acceptance by Inter-Allied Council and United Nations==

The Allies, which had met in June, and leading organizations quickly and widely endorsed the charter. Then, at the meeting of the Inter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the governments-in-exile of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, together with the Soviet Union and representatives of the Free French Forces, unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by Britain and United States.

On 1 January 1942, a larger group of nations, which adhered to the charter&#x27;s principles, issued a joint Declaration by United Nations, which stressed their solidarity in the defence against Hitlerism.

==Impact on Axis powers==
The Axis powers, particularly Japan, interpreted the diplomatic agreements as a potential alliance against them. In Tokyo, the Atlantic Charter rallied support for the militarists in the Japanese government, which pushed for a more aggressive approach against the United States and Britain.

The British dropped millions of flysheets over Germany to allay its fears of a punitive peace that would destroy the German state. The text cited the charter as the authoritative statement of the joint commitment of Britain and the United States &quot;not to admit any economical discrimination of those defeated&quot; and promised that &quot;Germany and the other states can again achieve enduring peace and prosperity.&quot;

The most striking feature of the discussion was that an agreement had been made between a range of countries that held diverse opinions, which accepted that internal policies were relevant to the international situation. The charter proved to be one of the first steps towards the formation of the United Nations.

==Impact on imperial powers and imperial ambitions==

The problems came not from Germany and Japan but the allies that had empires and so resisted self-determination, especially the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands.

Initially, Roosevelt and Churchill appeared to have agreed that the third point of the charter would not apply to Africa and Asia. However, Roosevelt&#x27;s speechwriter, Robert E. Sherwood, noted that &quot;it was not long before the people of India, Burma, Malaya, and Indonesia were beginning to ask if the Atlantic Charter extended also to the Pacific and to Asia in general.&quot;

With a war that could be won only with the help of those allies, Roosevelt&#x27;s solution was to put some pressure on Britain but to postpone the issue of self-determination of the colonies until after the war.

===British Empire===
The acknowledgment that all people had a right to self-determination gave hope to independence leaders in British colonies. The Americans insisted that the charter was to acknowledge that the war was being fought to ensure self-determination. 

Churchill rejected its universal applicability when it came to the self-determination of subject nations such as British India. Churchill further added that he did not become Prime Minister to administer the liquidation of the British Empire. In a September 1941 speech, Churchill said the charter was meant to apply only to states under German occupation, not to those that were part of the British Empire. Churchill and other British government figures argued that British colonies never had &quot;sovereign rights&quot;, thus there was no pre-existing sovereign government to restore to power after the war.

Mahatma Gandhi in 1942 wrote to Roosevelt: &quot;I venture to think that the Allied declaration that the Allies are fighting to make the world safe for the freedom of the individual and for democracy sounds hollow so long as India and for that matter Africa are exploited by Great Britain...&quot; Self-determination was Roosevelt&#x27;s guiding principle, but he was reluctant to place pressure on the British in regard to India and other colonial possessions, as they were fighting for their lives in a war in which the United States was not officially participating. Gandhi refused to help the British or the American war effort against Germany and Japan in any way, and Roosevelt chose to back Churchill. While Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, the British recruited about 2.5 million from India, the largest ever volunteer force in the world, to fight for the Allies, mostly in West Asia and North Africa.

However, Roosevelt was still in principle willing to support the claims European colonies such as India to independence once the war was over, raising the issue with Churchill frequently even if Churchill refused to engage with it. Roosevelt encouraged other leaders such as Chiang Kai-shek to lobby over it during the war. He also did not support some of Churchill&#x27;s proposals that he believed were intended to secure Britain&#x27;s empire post-war, such as one for an expanded Mediterranean strategy that would increase British presence in the Middle East. Roosevelt believed that Churchill was being obstinate on the matter and refusing to recognise changing geopolitical realities. At the Tehran Conference in 1943, Roosevelt supported Josef Stalin against Churchill on imperial matters, such as opposing to return Indochina to France and even privately suggesting to the Soviet leader that the US and Soviet Union work together to help reform an independent India &quot;from the bottom, somewhat on the Soviet line&quot;, although Stalin dismissed the idea.

===Poland===
Churchill was unhappy with the inclusion of references to the right to self-determination and stated that he considered the charter an &quot;interim and partial statement of war aims designed to reassure all countries of our righteous purpose and not the complete structure which we should build after the victory.&quot; An office of the Polish government-in-exile wrote to warn Władysław Sikorski that if the charter was implemented with regard to national self-determination, it would prevent the desired Polish annexation of Danzig, East Prussia and parts of German Silesia. That led the Poles to approach Britain to ask for a flexible interpretation of the charter.

===Baltic states===
During the war, Churchill argued for an interpretation of the charter that would allow the Soviet Union to continue to control the Baltic states, an interpretation that was rejected by the United States until March 1944. Lord Beaverbrook warned that the charter &quot;would be a menace to our [Britain&#x27;s] own safety as well as to that of the Soviet Union.&quot; The United States refused to recognize the Soviet takeover of the Baltic states but did not press the issue against Stalin while he was fighting the Germans. Roosevelt planned to raise the Baltic issue after the war, but he died in April 1945, before the fighting had ended in Europe.

=== Morocco ===

The Atlantic Charter was also used by Moroccan nationalists to lay claim to independence. Like many other Asian and African elites, Moroccan anti-colonial organizations interpreted the charter as anti-colonial manifesto and in return called for &quot;the fall of the so-called protectorate&quot; in front of the French and Spanish colonial administrations.

==2021 revitalization==
On 10 June 2021, a revised version of the original Atlantic Charter was issued between U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Cornwall, England. A statement issued by the White House described the new &quot;revitalized&quot; Atlantic Charter as aimed to meet the &quot;new challenges of the 21st century,&quot; while also &quot;building on the commitments and aspirations set out eighty years ago.&quot;

<text>Gregory Allyn Palast (born June 26, 1952) is an author and a freelance journalist who has often worked for the BBC and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. His work frequently focuses on corporate malfeasance but he has also worked with labor unions and consumer advocacy groups.

==Early life, family, and education==
Palast was born in Los Angeles, growing up in the San Fernando Valley community of Sun Valley. Geri Palast is his sister.

Palast said his desire to write about class warfare is rooted in his upbringing in the &quot;ass-end of Los Angeles,&quot; a neighborhood wedged between a power plant and a dump. He said that kids in that neighborhood had two choices: Vietnam or the auto plant. &quot;We were the losers,&quot; he said. He was saved from the war by a favorable draft number. &quot;A lot of people didn&#x27;t make it out. Because I made it out, and my sister (Geri, a former Clinton administration assistant secretary of labor) made it out, I feel I have this obligation to tell these stories on behalf of all of those people who didn&#x27;t make it out.&quot;

He attended John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, and transferred to San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge) in 1969 before completing his senior year of high school. Palast said about high school: &quot;Basically they were melting my brain, and I had to save myself. Before I finished high school, I talked my way into college. Before I finished college, I talked my way into graduate school.&quot; Palast then attended the University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Berkeley, and University of Chicago, from which he graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and in 1976 with a Master&#x27;s of Business Administration. Palast majored in economics at Chicago from the advice of a Weather Underground member he met at Berkeley who suggested Palast &quot;familiarize himself with right-wing politics and learn about the &#x27;ruling elite&#x27; from &#x27;the inside.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==

Since 2000, Greg Palast has made more than a dozen films for the BBC program &quot;Newsnight&quot; with the Investigations Producer Meirion Jones, which have been broadcast in the UK and worldwide. In addition to the films on US elections they have investigated oil companies, the Iraq War, the attempted coup against Hugo Chávez, and the vulture funds which target the poorest countries.

Palast spoke at a Think Twice conference held at Cambridge University and lectured at the University of São Paulo.

===Presidential elections===
Palast&#x27;s investigation into the Bush family fortunes for his column in &quot;The Observer&quot; led him to uncover a connection to a company called ChoicePoint. In an October 2008 interview Palast said that before the 2000 election, ChoicePoint &quot;was purging the voter rolls of Florida under a contract with a lady named Katherine Harris, the Secretary of State. They won a contract, a bid contract with the state, with the highest bid.&quot; After subsequently noticing a large proportion of African-American voters were claiming their names had disappeared from voter rolls in Florida in the 2000 election, Palast launched a full-scale investigation into election fraud, the results of which were broadcast in the UK by the BBC on their &quot;Newsnight&quot; show prior to the 2004 election. Palast claimed to have obtained computer discs from Katherine Harris&#x27; office, which contained caging lists of &quot;voters matched by race and tagged as felons.&quot; Palast appeared in the 2003 documentary film, &quot;Florida Fights Back! Resisting the Stolen Election&quot;, along with Vincent Bugliosi, former Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and author of &quot;The Betrayal of America&quot;. Palast also appeared in the 2004 documentary &quot;Orwell Rolls in His Grave&quot;, which focuses on the hidden mechanics of the media.

In May 2007, Palast said he&#x27;d received 500 emails that former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove exchanged through an account supplied by the Republican National Committee. Palast says the emails show a plan to target likely Democratic voters with extra scrutiny over their home addresses, and he also believes Rove&#x27;s plan was a factor in the firing of U.S. Attorneys.

After Palast was invited by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to appear on his Air America talk show to discuss, among other things, election fraud, the pair teamed up to publish a report in October 2008 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, concluding that the 2008 election had already been stolen. &quot;If Democrats are to win the 2008 election, they must not simply beat John McCain at the polls -- they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP vote tampering&quot;, Palast and Kennedy summarized. To combat the extensive acts of voter suppression that Palast and Kennedy uncovered, the duo launched a campaign called Steal Back Your Vote, which features a website and free downloadable voter guide / adult comic book.

Palast has conducted a multi-year investigation into Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach&#x27;s Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program (commonly referred to as &quot;Crosscheck&quot;). The program utilizes states&#x27; voter registration lists to match possible &quot;double voters,&quot; using their first and last names and the last four digits of their Social Security number. In 2014, Palast investigated Crosscheck for &quot;Al Jazeera America,&quot; finding that the program was inherently biased toward removing minority voters from states&#x27; voter rolls. In 2016, he followed up with a documentary film, &quot;The Best Democracy Money Can Buy&quot;, along with an article. 

===Energy companies===
In 1988, Palast directed a U.S. civil racketeering investigation into the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station project, under construction by Stone &amp; Webster and Long Island Lighting Company. A jury awarded the plaintiffs US$4.8 billion; however, New York&#x27;s federal judge Jack B. Weinstein, reversed the verdict, and the case was later settled for $400 million. The racketeering charges stemmed from an accusation that LILCO filed false documents in order to secure rate increases. LILCO sought a dismissal of these charges on the grounds that Suffolk County lacked authority under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and that the allegations of a history of racketeering did not qualify as a continuing criminal enterprise.

Palast has also taken issue with the official story behind the grounding of the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;, claiming the sobriety of the &quot;Valdez&quot;&#x27;s captain was not an issue in the accident. According to Palast, the main cause of the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill in 1989 was not human error, but an Exxon decision not to use the ship&#x27;s radar in order to save money. The Raytheon Raycas radar system would not have detected Bligh Reef itself - as radar, unlike sonar, is incapable of detecting submerged objects. The radar system would have detected the radar reflector, placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping vessels on course via radar. Palast points out that the original owners of the land, the local Alaska Natives tribe, took only one dollar in payment for the land with a promise not to pollute it and spoil their fishing and seal hunting grounds.

In &quot;An Open Letter to Greg Palast on Peak Oil&quot; Richard Heinberg offers friendly criticism of Palast, saying he conflates the &quot;amount of oil left&quot; with &quot;peak (maximal) flow rates&quot; for oil, the latter being key to the Peak Oil concept.

On October 27, 2010, Palast wrote, &quot;The Petroleum Broadcast System Owes Us an Apology. ... BP has neglected warnings about oil safety for years! ... But so has PBS. The Petroleum Broadcast System has turned a blind eye to BP perfidy for decades. If the broadcast had come six months before the Gulf blow-out, after [major accidents in 2005 and 2006 or after years of government fines], I would say, “Damn, that Frontline sure is courageous.” But six months after the blow-out, PBS has shown us it only has the courage to shoot the wounded. ... The entire hour told us again and again and again, the problem was one company, BP, and its &#x27;management culture.&#x27; ... Unlike Shell Oil’s culture which has turned Nigeria into a toxic cesspool; unlike ExxonMobil’s culture which remains in denial about the horror it heaped on Alaska. And unlike Chevron’s culture, which I witnessed in the Amazon. Chevron culture left Ecuadoran farmers with pustules all over their bodies and a graveyard of children dead of leukemia.

===&quot;LobbyGate&quot; scandal===
In 1998, working as an undercover reporter for &quot;The Observer&quot;, Palast, posing as a US businessman with ties to Enron, caught on tape two Labour party insiders, Derek Draper and Jonathan Mendelsohn, boasting about how they could sell access to government ministers, obtain advance copies of sensitive reports, and create tax breaks for their clients.

Draper denied the allegations. At Prime Minister&#x27;s Question Time July 8, 1998 British Prime Minister Tony Blair claimed that all the specific claims had been investigated and found groundless: &quot;every allegation made in &quot;The Observer&quot; has been investigated and found to be untrue&quot;.

===Vulture funds===
Starting in 2007 Palast published a series of investigations on what aid groups and investors call &quot;vulture funds&quot;. A vulture fund is a private equity or hedge fund where companies or people buy the debt of a poor country and litigate to recover the funds, often at the expense of aid and debt relief. Prime Minister Gordon Brown commented on the practices saying &quot;We particularly condemn the perversity where Vulture Funds purchase debt at a reduced price and make a profit from suing the debtor country to recover the full amount owed - a morally outrageous outcome&quot;.

In 2014 Palast detailed the workings of vulture funds during the crisis of the American automotive industry:
===2024 US presidential election suppression===

In January 2025, Palast wrote an article for The Hartmann Report in which he claimed that Donald Trump lost the 2024 United States presidential election. His claims were also repeated on his personal investigative journalism website and Thom Hartmann&#x27;s podcast. He asserted that if all legal ballots had been counted in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin then Kamala Harris would have won the election, attributing her loss to voter suppression, which he compared to Jim Crow, as well as restrictive state voting laws, explaining that the rejection of a postal vote was 400% more likely to occur if the voter was Black.

The methods of voter suppression he outlined included vote purging, a legal process usually used to clean up voter rolls by deleting people from registration lists, voter challenges, the disqualification of ballots for minor clerical errors, the rejection of provisional ballots, and the disproportionately high vote rejection rates for Black voters. According to Palast, the Election Assistance Commission stated that 4,776,706 voters were wrongfully purged. He linked the voter challenges to &quot;vigilante&quot; vote-fraud hunters who targeted people to challenge and block the counting of their ballots, claims he previously made in his documentary Vigilantes Inc. He claimed that by August 2024, the rights of 317,886 voters were challenged with over 200,000 challenges occurring in Georgia.

<text>The Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), formerly known as the Middle East Treaty Organization (METO) and also known as the Baghdad Pact, was a military alliance of the Cold War. It was formed on 24 February 1955 by Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Bangladesh was a province of Pakistan, known as East Pakistan, until its independence in 1971 which also marked the end of its position in the alliance. The alliance was dissolved on 16 March 1979.

U.S. pressure and promises of military and economic aid were key in the negotiations leading to the agreement, but the United States could not initially participate. John Foster Dulles, who was involved in the negotiations as United States Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, claimed that was due to &quot;the pro-Israel lobby and the difficulty of obtaining Congressional Approval.&quot; Others said that the reason was &quot;for purely technical reasons of budgeting procedures.&quot;

In 1958, the U.S. joined the military committee of the alliance. It is generally viewed as one of the least successful of the Cold War alliances.

The organization&#x27;s headquarters was in Baghdad, Iraq from 1955 to 1958 and thereafter in Ankara, Turkey from 1958 to 1979. Cyprus was also an important location for CENTO due to the British military bases in Akrotiri and Dhekelia along with the island’s location in the Middle East.

==History==
Modeled after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), METO committed the nations to mutual cooperation and protection, as well as non-intervention in each other&#x27;s affairs. Its goal was to contain the Soviet Union (USSR) by having a line of strong states along the Soviet Union&#x27;s southwestern frontier. Similarly, it was known as the &#x27;Northern Tier&#x27; to prevent Soviet expansion into the Middle East. Unlike NATO, METO did not have a unified military command structure, nor were many American or British military bases established in member countries, although the United States had communications and electronic intelligence facilities in Iran, and operated U-2 intelligence flights over the Soviet Union from bases in Pakistan. The United Kingdom had access to facilities in Pakistan and Iraq at various times while the treaty was in effect. 

On 14 July 1958, the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown in a military coup. The new government was led by military officer Abd al-Karim Qasim who withdrew Iraq from the Baghdad Pact, opened diplomatic relations with Soviet Union and adopted a non-aligned stance. The organization dropped the name &#x27;Baghdad Pact&#x27; in favor of &#x27;CENTO&#x27; at that time. 

The Middle East and South Asia became extremely volatile areas during the 1960s with the ongoing Arab–Israeli conflict and the Indo-Pakistani wars. CENTO was unwilling to get deeply involved in either dispute. In 1965 and 1971, Pakistan unsuccessfully tried to get assistance in its wars with India through CENTO, but this was rejected under the idea that CENTO was aimed at containing the Soviet Union, not India.

CENTO did little to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence to non-member states in the area. Whatever containment value the pact might have had was lost when the Soviets &#x27;leap-frogged&#x27; the member states, establishing close military and political relationships with governments in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, South Yemen, Somalia, and Libya. By 1970, the Soviet Union had deployed over 20,000 troops to Egypt, and had established naval bases in Syria, Somalia, and South Yemen.

The alliance&#x27;s stance and perceived indifference toward Pakistan losing territory with Indian participation upon Bangladesh&#x27;s independence in 1971 permanently damaged the alliance&#x27;s reputation in Pakistan in particular and harmed its standing in general, as the lack of a collective response to a member&#x27;s territorial integrity being challenged cast doubt on its efficacy and utility and generated skepticism that the alliance was mutually beneficial rather than a tool of Anglo-American and Western hegemony. Whereas other alliance members stayed out of the Indo-Pakistani wars on the grounds that the alliance didn&#x27;t need to defend Pakistan since it was intended to contain the Soviet Union not India, Eastern Bloc members readily assisted less Western-friendly Arab governments&#x27; 1973 attack on Israel. Anti-Western interests engaged in a more activist foreign policy regionally by participating overtly in Middle Eastern conflicts in one form or another and one of the original arguments in favor of the increasingly passive alliance, that it&#x27;d serve as a valuable counterweight to the influence of Nasser&#x27;s Soviet-friendly Arab nationalism, was discredited and weakened.

The Iranian Revolution spelled the end of the organization in 1979, but in reality, it essentially had been finished since 1974, when Turkey invaded Cyprus. This led the United Kingdom to withdraw forces that had been earmarked to the alliance - Nos 9 and 35 Squadrons flying Avro Vulcan bombers, and the United States Congress halted military aid to Turkey despite two Presidential vetoes. With the fall of the Iranian monarchy, whatever remaining rationale for the organization was lost. Future U.S. and British defence agreements with regional countries—such as Pakistan, Egypt, and the Arab-Gulf states—were conducted bilaterally.

With the withdrawal of Iran, the Secretary-General of CENTO, Turkish diplomat Kamuran Gurun, announced on March 16, 1979, that he would call a meeting of the pact&#x27;s council in order to formally dissolve the organization.

** Turkey&#x27;s role in the Baghdad Pact was one of a unique and elevated nature compared to other nations such as Iraq. It was given &quot;special&quot; attention by the West primarily due to its geopolitical importance. It was believed that the Turks could draw Arab countries, such as Iraq, closer to the projected anti-communist Arab alliance, as the former would have been of inspiration for other &quot;like-minded&quot; countries. It was also hoped that by agreeing to the Baghdad Pact the Turkish and the Iraqi relations would get their time in the sun. However, this optimism was not rewarded as Iraq was under constant threat of the infiltration of Turkish troops [against Kurdish separatists], and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri was desperate to strike an agreement. Finally, the Turkish courting by western nations, such as the US, did not have the outcome that was desired as Arab countries, primarily Egypt, turned hostile to the pact.

==Timeline==
* February 1954: Turkey signs a Pact of Mutual Cooperation with Pakistan.
* May 19, 1954: U.S. and Pakistan sign a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement.
* February 24, 1955: Iraq and Turkey sign a military agreement in Baghdad and the term &quot;Baghdad Pact&quot; started to be used. United Kingdom (April 5), Pakistan (September 23) and Iran (November 3) joined the Baghdad Pact in the same year.
* October 1958: Baghdad Pact headquarters moved from Baghdad to Ankara.
* March 5, 1959: U.S. signs military agreements with Pakistan, Iran and Turkey.

* August 19, 1959: METO renamed CENTO.
* 1965: Pakistan tried to get help from its allies in its war against India. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 211 on September 20 and the United States and the United Kingdom supported the UN decision by cutting off arms supplies to both belligerents.
* 1971: In a new war with India, Pakistan again tried unsuccessfully to get allied assistance. (The U.S. provided limited military support to Pakistan, but not under the rubric of CENTO.)
* 1971: Bangladeshi independence causes the alliance to shrink for a second time as the newly sovereign country does not pursue CENTO membership.

* March 11, 1979: The Interim Government of Iran withdraws the country from CENTO.
* March 12, 1979: Pakistan withdraws from CENTO.
* March 16, 1979: CENTO is formally disbanded. United Kingdom and Turkey withdraw from CENTO.

==Secretaries General==
A Secretary General, appointed by the council of ministers for a renewable three years, oversaw CENTO activities. Secretaries general were:

==CENTO railway==
CENTO sponsored a railway line, some of which was completed, to enable a rail connection between London and Tehran via Van. A section from Lake Van in Turkey to Sharafkhaneh in Iran was completed and funded in large part by CENTO (mainly the UK). The civil engineering was especially challenging because of the difficult terrain. Part of the route included a rail ferry across Lake Van with a terminal at Tatvan on the Western side of the lake. Notable features of the railway on the Iranian side included 125 bridges, among them the Towering Quotor span, measuring in length, spanning a gorge deep.

==Cultural and research institutions==
Like its counterparts NATO and SEATO, CENTO sponsored a number of cultural and scientific research institutions:
* CENTO Conferences on Teaching Public Health and Public Health Practice
* CENTO Cultural Works Programme 
* CENTO Institute of Nuclear &amp; Applied Science
* CENTO Scientific Coordinating Board
* CENTO Scientific Council
* CENTO Symposia on Rural Development

The institutions supported a wide range of non-military activities, with a particular focus on agriculture and development, In 1960, for example, CENTO had funded 37 projects covering agriculture, education, health, economic development and transportation. It also arranged at least one symposium on the problem of foot-and-mouth and rinderpest.

The organization that became the CENTO Institute of Nuclear Science was established by Western powers in the Baghdad Pact, as CENTO was then known. It was initially located in Baghdad, Iraq, but was relocated to Tehran, Iran in 1958 after Iraq withdrew from CENTO. Students from Pakistan and Turkey as well as those from Iran were trained at the Institute.

===CENTO Scientific Council===
The CENTO Scientific Council organized a number of scientific symposia and other events, including a meeting in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1962, entitled &quot;The Role of Science in the Development of Natural Resources with Particular Reference to Pakistan, Iran and Turkey&quot;.

<text>Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a type of a Linux installation and the name of a book written by Gerard Beekmans, and as of May 2021, mainly maintained by Bruce Dubbs. The book gives readers instructions on how to build a Linux system from source. The book is available freely from the Linux From Scratch site.

== Projects under LFS==
&quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; is a way to install a working Linux system by building all components of it manually. This is, naturally, a longer process than installing a pre-compiled Linux distribution. According to the &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; site, the advantages to this method are a compact, flexible and secure system and a greater understanding of the internal workings of the Linux-based operating systems.

To keep LFS small and focused, the book &quot;Beyond Linux From Scratch&quot; (BLFS) was created, which presents instructions on how to further develop the basic Linux system that was created in LFS. It introduces and guides the reader through additions to the system including the X Window System, desktop environments (KDE, GNOME, Xfce, LXDE), productivity software, web browsers, programming languages and tools, multimedia software, and network management and system administration tools. Since Release 5.0, the BLFS book version matches the LFS book version.

The book &quot;Cross Linux From Scratch&quot; (CLFS) focuses on cross compiling, including compiling for headless or embedded systems that can &quot;run&quot; Linux, but lack the resources needed to &quot;compile&quot; Linux. CLFS supports a broad range of processors and addresses advanced techniques not included in the LFS book such as cross-build toolchains, multilibrary support (32 &amp; 64-bit libraries side-by-side), and alternative instruction set architectures such as Itanium, SPARC, MIPS, and Alpha.

The Linux from Scratch project, like BitBake, also supports cross-compiling Linux for ARM embedded systems such as the Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone.

The book &quot;Hardened Linux From Scratch&quot; (HLFS) focuses on security enhancements such as hardened kernel patches, mandatory access control policies, stack-smashing protection, and address space layout randomization. Besides its main purpose of creating a security-focused operating system, HLFS had the secondary goal of being a security teaching tool. It has not been updated since 2011. As of 17 February 2025, the HLFS book has disappeared from the LFS web site.

&quot;Automated Linux From Scratch&quot; (ALFS) is a project designed to automate the process of creating an LFS system. It is aimed at users who have gone through the LFS and BLFS books several times and wish to reduce the amount of work involved. A secondary goal is to act as a test of the LFS and BLFS books by directly extracting and running instructions from the XML sources of the LFS and BLFS books.

==Requirements and procedure==
A clean partition and a working Linux system with a compiler and some essential software libraries are required to build LFS. Instead of installing from an existing Linux system, one can also use a Live CD to build an LFS system.

The project formerly maintained the Linux From Scratch Live CD. LFS Live CD contains all the source packages (in the full version of the Live CD only), the LFS book, automated building tools and (except for the minimal Live CD version) an Xfce GUI environment to work in. The official LFS Live CD is no longer maintained, and cannot be used to build the LFS version7 or later. There are, however, two unofficial builds that can be used to build a 32-bit or 64-bit kernel and userspace respectively for LFS 7.x.

First, a toolchain must be compiled consisting of the tools used to compile LFS, like GCC, glibc, binutils, and other necessary utilities. Then, the root directory must be changed, (using chroot), to the toolchain&#x27;s partition to start building the final system. One of the first packages to compile is glibc; after that, the toolchain&#x27;s linker must be adjusted to link against the newly built glibc, so that all other packages that will make up the finished system can be linked against it as well. During the chroot phase, bash&#x27;s hashing feature is turned off and the temporary toolchain&#x27;s bin directory moved to the end of PATH. This way the newly compiled programs come first in PATH and the new system builds on its own new components.

==Standard build unit==
A &quot;standard build unit&quot; (&quot;SBU&quot;) is a term used during initial bootstrapping of the system, and represents the amount of time required to build the first package in LFS on a given computer. Its creation was prompted by the long time required to build an LFS system, and the desire of many users to know how long a source tarball will take to build ahead of time.

As of Linux From Scratch version 10.1, the first package built by the user is GNU binutils. When building it, users are encouraged to measure the build process using shell constructs and dub that time the system&#x27;s &quot;standard build unit&quot;. Once this number is known, an estimate of the time required to build later packages is expressed relative to the known SBU.

Several packages built during compilation take much longer to build than binutils, including the GNU C Library (rated at 4.2 SBUs) and the GNU Compiler Collection (rated at 11 SBUs). The unit must be interpreted as an approximation; various factors influence the actual time required to build a package.

<text>The mulato pepper is one of the two dried varieties of the poblano pepper. Mulatos are dried fully mature poblanos, whereas poblanos that are harvested early and dried are called ancho peppers. 

The mulato is flat and wrinkled, and is always brownish-black in color. The average length and width of the mulato is 10 cm and 5 cm, respectively. Its shape is wide at the top, tapering to a blunt point.

The mulato has been described as tasting somewhat like chocolate or licorice, with undertones of cherry and tobacco. Its heat rating is 2,500 to 3,000 on the Scoville scale.

<doc id="193818" wikidata="Q1252327" url="?curid=193818" title="Douglas Gordon">
<text>Douglas Gordon (born 20 September 1966) is a Scottish artist. He won the Turner Prize in 1996, the Premio 2000 at the 47th Venice Biennale in 1997 and the Hugo Boss Prize in 1998. He lives and works in Berlin, Germany.

==Work==
Much of Gordon&#x27;s work is seen as being about memory and uses repetition in various forms. He uses material from the public realm and also creates performance-based videos. His work often overturns traditional uses of video by playing with time elements and employing multiple monitors.

Gordon has often reused older film footage in his photographs and videos. One of his best-known art works is &quot;24 Hour Psycho&quot; (1993) which slows down Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot; so that it lasts twenty four hours. In &quot;Between Darkness and Light (After William Blake)&quot; (1997), William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Exorcist&quot; (1973) and Henry King&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943) – two films about adolescent girls driven by external forces – are projected on either side of a single free-standing semi-transparent screen so they can be seen simultaneously. The video installation &quot;left is right and right is wrong and left is wrong and right is right&quot; (1999) presents two projections of Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1949) side by side, with the one on the right reversed so that the two sides mirror each other; by digital means, Gordon separated individual frames of the original film so that odd-numbered ones on one side alternate with even-numbered ones on the other. &quot;Feature Film&quot; (1999) is a projection of Gordon&#x27;s own film of James Conlon conducting Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score to &quot;Vertigo&quot;, thus drawing attention to the film score and the emotional responses it creates in the viewer. In one installation, this was placed at the top of a tall building, referencing one of the film&#x27;s main plot points. In &quot;Through a looking glass&quot; (1999), Gordon created a double-projection work around the climactic 71-second scene in Martin Scorsese’s film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), in which the main character addresses the camera; the screens are arranged so that the character seems to be addressing himself. At first, the 71-second loops are in sync, but they get progressively out and then progressively back with each repetition of the whole, hourlong program.

Originally conceived as a site-specific video projection for Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, &quot;Play Dead; Real Time&quot; (2003) consists of two videos projected on two large screens showing a circus elephant named Minnie ponderously performing for an off-screen trainer in the empty, spacious, white-walled gallery room. In each projection the camera circles as the elephant walks around, lies down to play dead and gets up. The footage showing Minnie’s sequences of tricks is simultaneously presented in a front and a rear life-sized projection and on a monitor, with each one depicting the same event from a range of perspectives, including close-ups of the animal&#x27;s eyes. Gordon also made a film about Zinedine Zidane, &quot;Zidane, un portrait du 21e siècle&quot; (2006), an idea first seen in a film by Hellmuth Costard, who, in 1970, made a film about George Best titled &quot;Football as Never Before.&quot; The feature-length film, which he co-directed with fellow artist Philippe Parreno and assembled from footage shot by seventeen synchronised cameras placed around the stadium in real time over the course of a single match, premiered outside the competition of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival before screenings at numerous international venues. &quot;k.364&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2010.

Gordon has also made photographs, often in series with relatively minor variations between each individual piece. His &quot;Blind Stars&quot; (2002) featured publicity photographs of mid-century movie stars in which the sitters&#x27; eyes were replaced by expressionless black, white or mirrored surfaces.

In 2010, Gordon collaborated with Rufus Wainwright, creating the visuals for his tour which accompany Rufus&#x27; &quot;All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu&quot; album. In &quot;Phantom&quot; (2011), another collaboration with Wainwright, Gordon employs slow-motion film produced with a high-speed Phantom camera focusing on Wainright&#x27;s eye — blackened with make-up, weeping, and glaring back at the viewer, echoing melodramatic performances by stars of the silent screen.

==Other activities==
In 2008, Gordon was a member of the Official Competition Jury at the 65th Venice International Film Festival. He was also a member of the jury that selected Hito Steyerl as recipient of the Käthe Kollwitz Prize in 2019.

Gordon&#x27;s first solo show was in 1986. In 1993, he exhibited &quot;24 Hour Psycho&quot; in the spaces of Tramway, Glasgow, and at Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin. The Berlin show was curated by Klaus Biesenbach. In 1996, Gordon was one of the artists invited to Skulptur Projekte Münster, and in 1997 he represented Britain at the Venice Biennale. His work was the subject of a 2001 retrospective organised by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, which travelled to the Vancouver Art Gallery, Canada; Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City; and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. In 2005, he put together an exhibition at the Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin called &quot;The Vanity of Allegory.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Douglas Gordon Superhumanatural&quot; opened at the National Galleries of Scotland complex in Edinburgh, being Gordon&#x27;s first major solo exhibition in Scotland since he presented &quot;24 Hour Psycho&quot; in 1993. Also in 2006, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York showed a retrospective of Gordon&#x27;s work, called &quot;Timeline,&quot; which was curated by Klaus Biesenbach. Another 2006 retrospective was on view at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh. A survey of his textworks was shown at Tate Britain, London in 2010. Retrospective solo exhibitions were shown at Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main in 2011 to 2012, Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2013 and at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in Melbourne in 2014. Further solo exhibitions have been held at Museum Folkwang, Essen, Germany 2013, Musée D&#x27;art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 2014. Gordon took part in the Biennale of Sydney 2014 and Documenta 17.

<text>The Cairo Conference (codenamed Sextant), also known as the First Cairo Conference, was one of 14 summit meetings during World War II, which took place on November 22–26, 1943. The Conference was held at Cairo in Egypt between China, the United Kingdom and the United States. Attended by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it outlined the Allied position against the Empire of Japan during World War II and made decisions about post-war Asia.

The Conference agenda was to formulate a strategy to counterattack the Empire of Japan, make arrangements for the post-war international situation and coordinate the counter-attack on Burma and the aid to China. The Cairo Declaration, issued after the conference, demanded Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender, the return to China of all occupied lands, and the shaping of a new post-war East Asia.

The Cairo Conference established China&#x27;s status as one of four world powers, which was of great political and strategic significance to China. Although many of the resolutions and promises made at the conference were not implemented, and the plan of action was repeatedly postponed and changed, the aim of a joint Chinese, British, and American counter-attack on Burma was eventually achieved.

== Background ==
=== International relations ===
After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the British Empire, the United States, and the Republic of China signed a new treaty, formally renouncing their extraterritoriality in China and upholding China&#x27;s sovereignty. On January 11, Britain and the United States issued a joint declaration, announcing the abrogation of all unequal treaties against China over the past century. On the other hand, Sino-British relations were not harmonious, as it became apparent that the British sphere of influence in East Asia was crumbling.

In 1942, the Chinese government was both surprised and angry when the British did not agree to the Chinese National Army&#x27;s military interference in Burma (now Myanmar). China wanted to end imperialism, but British imperialism had a long history. Churchill also held on to the conservative British colonialist mindset and refused to believe that Asians could unite and fight for an Allied victory He was also prejudiced against China and did not want it to become a world power.

Politically, the United Kingdom was both suspicious and contemptuous of China to the point of hoping to isolate it. The British feared that China&#x27;s strong independence from Western powers could influence independence movements in its Asian colonies, such as India, where discontent was already brewing. They were therefore reluctant to spend material or troops to assist China. Even if both the Kingdom of Italy and Nazi Germany surrendered, the British Navy still preferred to field its spare forces in the Pacific Ocean, rather than Burma. Lord Alan Brooke, the British Chief of Staff, was even more contemptuous of China.

There was a fundamental difference between the British and the Americans in their post-war expectations. Churchill wanted the post-war world to be dominated by the United Kingdom and the United States, but Roosevelt envisioned a new world in which the European colonialists would grant independence to their colonies and shape Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s vision of self-determination for all countries alike. Furthermore, Roosevelt wanted the Four Policemen (the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China) to guide and guard the post-war world from potential conflicts. That was partly due to the rise of the Soviet Union, as US military experts became increasingly worried of the Soviet Union losing or making peace with Nazi Germany, since that meant Britain would be defeated as well. The US was not confident of winning the war even if it had mobilised all its forces into the European battlefield. Hence, the US military believed that consolidating relations with the Soviet Union was necessary for victory.

=== Development war ===
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese Empire took control of Southeast Asia, and Burma became the only area in which the Chinese, British, and American military forces could jointly fight the Japanese. Each of their forces were then under their own command and rarely conducted joint military operations. Furthermore, the British commander in India and Chiang Kai-shek had conflicting views on how to counterattack the Japanese in Burma. As such, no real alliance was formed between the three.

In Asia, the primary task of the Allies was to unite the Asian countries and to open up the China Burma India theatre of war. However, there was a disagreement between China and Britain about the restoration of Burma. Burma was strategically important to China, and with the fall of Burma in April 1942, China&#x27;s last international supply route was blocked, the only available supply route now being the 500-mile airlift, Hump route, over the Himalayas.

The British wanted to concentrate all their forces in Europe and attached far less importance to the Far East than to the European theatre of war. The recovery of Burma was only a political affair for Britain, not a matter of immediate interest, and the only real beneficiary from the opening of the Yunnan-Burma highway was China. As such, Britain, which was less than enthusiastic about the Chinese war effort, was not willing to fight for the opening of the Yunnan-Burma highway. After the defeat of Rangoon, Britain lost its enthusiasm for Burma. The British military felt that its navy was needed to recover Burma, but the British Navy was engaged in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Ocean. Politically, after the Japanese Army conquered Burma, the Burmese became pro-Japanese and anti-British. Roosevelt raised the notion of an independent Burma yet again, but since Burma would cease to be a British colony after the war, the British were wholly uninterested.

=== First Quebec Conference (1943) ===
In October 1942, British and American generals had already reached a preliminary agreement to participate in the battle to recover Burma with British and Indian divisions. However, Britain repeatedly tried to overturn the decision afterwards. In August 1943, Churchill and Roosevelt decided at the Quebec Conference, codenamed Quadrant, to establish a new joint &quot;South East Asia Command&quot; with British Field Marshal Lord Mountbatten as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in the region. He would be directly under the command of the British-American Combined Chiefs of Staff, with the main task of establishing an airlift route through China as soon as possible and sending troops to seize Myanmar and link up with Chinese troops invading from Yunnan.

Churchill, however, wanted Britain to defeat Japan by force and to restore Britain&#x27;s position in her Asian colonies even though he and the British military had no real intention of retaking Rangoon and fighting all the way to China. Eventually, he agreed reluctantly when he was prompted by the Americans to mobilise the British Navy to move east from Europe in preparation for a counterattack on Burma.

On October 2, Mountbatten went to Chongqing with the Quebec Resolution to present it to Chiang Kai-shek with a secret letter from Churchill that specifically mentioned that military action in southern Burma would depend on Chinese military action in northern Burma. Mountbatten wanted the Chinese troops to support the British in their recovery of Burma and suggested for him to be in command all Chinese troops entering Burma along with the Allied Southeast Asian Command. China believed that the counterattack on Burma should be carried out simultaneously in southern and northern Burma and that fighting in southern Burma should be to cut off the enemy&#x27;s rear and that otherwise attacking from only the north would be a waste of manpower. That made China was reluctant to field troops.

Meanwhile, the US military had established an island-hopping strategy in the Pacific, the efficacy of which had not yet been tested, but the Allies already had already developed the tendency of ignoring the Chinese Theatre. In October 1943, the British and American Joint Chiefs of Staff began to formulate a plan to attack Japan from the Pacific without going through mainland China, and the US military hierarchy doubted the strategic importance of China.

Regarding the European Theatre, Churchill and Roosevelt had several disagreements. Churchill wanted to meet Roosevelt alone before the Cairo Conference to discuss the Grand Alliance plan of action in Europe for fear of heavy casualties to British forces, but the United States did not want to postpone the counterattack because of Stalin&#x27;s insistence for the Anglo-Americans to open a second front to relieve the pressure faced by Soviet troops against Germany. Churchill strongly advocated action in the eastern Mediterranean to hold the Germans back so that they could not be drawn into France since if the Allies controlled the eastern Mediterranean, they would not have to go through Iran to support the Soviet Union, and the British Navy in the Indian Ocean could be used elsewhere. The United States, however, resolutely opposed action in the eastern Mediterranean.

== Planning for the conference ==
The idea of the Cairo Conference originated from the Moscow Conference, in October 1943, of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. The United States believed that the meeting confirmed the importance of joint action by the four powers, and at the meeting the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the ROC signed a declaration of continued cooperation and issued a declaration on the joint establishment of international institutions after the war. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull lobbied the Soviet Union to include China in the Quadruple Powers, but the Soviet Union had signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact with Japan and so found it difficult to do so. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom hence did not recognise China as a power, but both of them eventually accepted the American proposal to include the Republic of China as a signatory of the Moscow Declaration of 1 November 1943. The declaration by the four powers stated their intentions to fight to the end until victory and in particular citing their intentions not to sign a separate peace treaty with the enemy, and demanding that all countries fight for the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, the tripartite occupation of post-war Germany, and allied cooperation for international peace and security after the war.

The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union agreed to a meeting of the three leaders. On 1 November, and Roosevelt telegraphed an invitation to Chiang Kai-shek. Stalin noted that the Soviet Union had not declared war on Japan and was not ready to meet with Chiang to avoid angering Japan, because of its non-aggression pact. Chiang was less than willing to meet Stalin, as he was unhappy with the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact and with the Soviet Union&#x27;s aid to the Chinese Communists. Chiang asked for a first separate meeting with Roosevelt. If that meeting could not be arranged, Chiang would rather postpone the meeting with the Soviet Union. Thus, the planned meeting was split into two and held in two places instead, Cairo, for Chiang Kai-shek, and Tehran, for Stalin. Churchill, fearing that Roosevelt would favour China and make too many promises that would affect the European Theatre, asked for a meeting with Roosevelt before the Cairo Conference, but Roosevelt feared that such a move would arouse suspicion from China and the Soviet Union and so he decided to attend the Cairo Conference directly. He telegraphed to Churchill to assure that both of them would have another opportunity to discuss privately before meeting with Chiang and Stalin. Roosevelt further invited Churchill and Chiang to meet at Cairo at the same time.

As security in Cairo was poor, and the meeting place was known to the Axis powers, Roosevelt&#x27;s advisors had suggested meeting instead in Khartoum or Malta, but neither place could provide suitable accommodation. Churchill insisted on going to Cairo, insisting that local protection by British troops could guarantee their security [11]:216 and sent a brigade of British troops to install anti-aircraft guns and a defensive radar network in Cairo.

== The conference ==
The Cairo meeting was held at a residence of Alexander Comstock Kirk, the American ambassador to Egypt, near the Giza pyramid complex, about 8 miles (13 km) from the centre of Cairo. In addition to the leaders of the three countries, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United Kingdom and the United States attended the meeting. Chinese generals included General Shang Zhen, Lieutenant General Lin Wei, Lieutenant General Zhou Zhirou, Lieutenant General Yang Xuancheng, Yu Jishi etc. Chiang Kai-shek also invited American Chief of Staff Joseph Warren Stilwell to attend the meeting.

=== November 21–22 ===
On Saturday, November 20, 1943, Stilwell first arrived in Cairo, and on Sunday, November 21, Chiang arrived with his wife, the First Lady Soong Mei Ling, and with Churchill. Churchill arrived in Alexandria Harbour aboard HMS Wilhelm and then flew to Cairo. Churchill invited Chiang and his wife to dinner and then brought Chiang to the map room to brief him on the status and planning of British forces in the various theatres of war. Roosevelt crossed the Atlantic on the battleship USS Iowa and arrived in Tunis that day on the Air Force One from Oran (modern-day Algeria) to meet General Eisenhower. That day, Stilwell met with Chiang, Marshall, Hurley, and General Blaine Somerville. Roosevelt arrived on Monday, November 22, and that afternoon, Chiang paid a visit to Roosevelt with Soong and Churchill. That evening, Churchill, Roosevelt, and their aides held a preliminary meeting. John Patton Davies, Second Secretary of the US Embassy in Chongqing, sent a memorandum to Roosevelt against the use of US troops to help the British, Dutch, and French rebuild their colonial empires by pointing out the levels of corruption and incompetence of the Chinese National Army and suggesting the value of opening an overland line of communication to China from northern Burma.

=== November 23 ===
On Tuesday, November 23, the conference officially began. Chiang, together with Soong and the other Chinese generals, paid an early morning visit to Roosevelt. He then met with the president&#x27;s representative Patrick Hurley to discuss the Tehran Conference and other issues. At 11:00 a.m., the preliminary session was held with Chiang, Roosevelt, Churchill, and the three men&#x27;s aides. It was here that Chiang insisted on &quot;strong and powerful naval operations&quot; and that &quot;Burma is the key to the entire Asian campaign.&quot; That afternoon, a meeting of the British and American Joint Chiefs of Staff was held to discuss plans for an offensive on Burma. Chiang eventually decided not to attend that meeting and was represented by his generals. He arrived at 3:30 p.m. the British and American officials had believed that the Chinese would show up only while the Chiefs of Staff were discussing issues of interest to them. Marshall criticised Chiang for being too keen to acquire US transports. However, he could neither guarantee a stronger ground force, which prevented Chinese troops from being trained at Langga in India, nor agree to equip the army in Yunnan. Stilwell presented a memorandum proposing alternative actions: aid northern Burma; fight for overland lines of communication to China; train and increase the combat power of the Chinese Army; intensify bombing of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines; prevent Japanese control of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea; and recover Canton and Hong Kong. He suggested increasing the strength of three Army divisions, moving US troops in India to China after the occupation of northern Burma, and attacking Shanghai and Taiwan if necessary.
At the conference, Commander-in-Chief of the Southeast Asia Command Lord Louis Mountbatten presented an outline of a land campaign for Burma by proposing three plans of action: Operation Tarzan, an attack on Burma by British and Chinese forces; Operation Musket, the capture of Cape Sumatra; and Operation Buccaneer, an amphibious operation to seize the Andaman Islands located 300 miles south of Rangoon in the Bay of Bengal since the Andaman Islands would threaten Japanese Burma, Thailand, and Malaya and cut off the Japanese supply lines. Of the three options, Churchill was particularly fond of Operation Musket since he hoped to send troops to Achab Island and seize Sumatra in an attempt to recapture Singapore.

Operation Tarzan called for four Indian divisions of the British Fourteenth Army&#x27;s XV Corps to concentrate their men in Chittagong and cross the Maungdaw-Buthidaung line in mid-January and, the following year, to capture the Burmese coast in order to defend Chittagong and occupy Sittwe on the Burmese coast. Three divisions of IV Corps, assembled at Imphal, would then move east with the objective of destroying Japanese lines of communication and advancing to Arak and various parts of Sidon in northern Burma. In March, the British long-range infiltration force &quot;Chindit&quot; Special Forces would be parachuted into Burma, behind the Japanese lines. The Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEF) in India would cross the Ho Kang Valley and advance eastward into Myitkyina. The Chindit special forces would then support the Chinese forces and occupy Bhamo in April, while the Yunnan Army would begin operations on 15 March and advance to Lashio in April to join the British forces at Lashio and Bhamo. In the Bay of Bengal, a massive amphibious offensive would be launched, with 3,000 British and American long-range infiltration troops participating.

Lord Mountbatten pointed out that overland communications to China depended on the army in Yunnan operating in conjunction with the British. Stilwell, on the other hand, was optimistic and insisted that they could compensate for the Chinese Army&#x27;s personnel shortage. The Chinese generals present did not comment on Mountbatten&#x27;s plans but repeatedly stressed the need to plan for an early counteroffensive against the Japanese in Burma and the reopening of Chinese supply lines. Chiang believed that any offensive on land should be timed with naval operations, because the Japanese were very motivated to defend and reinforce their important position in Burma and would also benefit from the new infrastructure and supply lines that they had been building. The British, however, believed that land and naval operations could run separately from each other, citing the long distances separating inland Burma from its seas and the time it would take for the British Navy to prepare due to its existing engagements in the Atlantic.

That evening, Roosevelt held a banquet for Chiang and Soong. The two spoke of the establishment of a coalition government in China as well as issues such as British interests in Shanghai and Canton, the use of American warships rather than British warships in subsequent military operations, and the future status of Malaya, Burma, and India.

=== November 24 ===
On November 24, Churchill, Mountbatten and Chiang met. Chiang demanded for land operations in northern Burma and amphibious operations to be conducted simultaneously. He expressed support for Operation Tarzan and was willing to include troops from Langga and Yunnan, but he insisted for it to be coupled with a massive naval operation in the Bay of Bengal to establish air and sea superiority for the operation to succeed. The problem with the operation was that the troops lacked the tools for amphibious landing operations.

Although the British supported Operation Tarzan, they were not keen on a large-scale naval offensive in the Bay of Bengal, and Churchill told Chiang that the navy could not be dispatched to the Indian Ocean until after the defeat of Italy. Churchill further insisted that land operations in northern Burma were not necessarily dependent on naval operations in the Bay of Bengal and that amphibious operations did not affect land operations. Chiang disagreed by pointing out that amphibious operations could attract some of the enemy&#x27;s air power. British Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke, on the other hand, pointed out that if amphibious landings were to be pursued, the landing of the Maharajah in France would have to be postponed.

Admiral Ernest King of the US Navy was less enthusiastic about a counteroffensive on Burma and was reluctant to push hard for large-scale operations in the Southeast Asia Command. He pointed out that those operations had to be considered in the context of an overall plan to defeat Japan, but that the overall plan had not been negotiated at all. King stated that to defeat Japan, the main theatre of operations should be in the Pacific, and land operations on the continental Asia were not strictly necessary.

Churchill explained that Britain could dispatch large fleets, but no date was set for an amphibious pincer attack. As the US representatives pressured him over amphibious operations, Churchill eventually agreed to land on the Andaman Islands. The Chiefs of Staff then agreed to drive Japan out of Burma and reopen land links with China, with Stilwell conducting the ground attack in the north and Mountbatten commanding the amphibious landing in the south, attacking the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The amphibious landing in Burma would be pursued &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; but it was not appropriate to set a date. The Southeast Asia Command could propose changes to the planned operations.

The US delegation also told Chiang that for the following six months, only 8,900 tonnes of supplies could be flown to China via the Hump route each month. Chiang demanded that the US raise that number to 10,000 tonnes. The US delegation made it clear to Chiang he had to choose between opening the Yunnan-Burma highway and having 10,000 tons of military aid flown in. Chiang was also told that the US military could not provide any more transport or aircraft. However, Chiang continued to demand for the US to provide more transport planes and to commence large-scale operations to supply China.

On that same day, British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden met with former Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Tsung-Hui.

=== November 25 ===
On the afternoon of November 25, Mountbatten reported the results of his talks with Chiang the previous day to the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff, who asked that Mountbatten draft a paper to Chiang, asking him to agree in writing to the plan on the counteroffensive of Burma, which were still under discussion.

Roosevelt met with Marshall and Stilwell, who indicated that Chiang had agreed to the Burma plan and requested the use American heavy bombers in the Andaman Islands. However, Stilwell pointed out that Chiang had backtracked on his request and Roosevelt promised to pressure Chiang.

At a meeting of US Army officers, Marshall made clear his disapproval of Chiang&#x27;s insistence for the US Air Force to airlift 10,000 tonnes of supplies to China each month despite British and American opposition. He further disapproved of the use of American ground troops, but Roosevelt overruled the military&#x27;s decision.

At a later meeting, Roosevelt promised an early amphibious landing to attack Burma. He also promised Chiang that Operation Tarzan would be supplemented by a massive amphibious offensive in the Bay of Bengal and to support Chiang in his struggle against imperialism. Both men agreed that the Indochina Peninsula should not be returned to the French as a colony. They also discussed Soviet interests in East Asia, especially the Soviet desire to have access to the sea in north-eastern China. Roosevelt tried to persuade Chiang to negotiate with the communists, and Chiang countered by demanding that Roosevelt obtain assurances from Stalin that he would not interfere with Chiang&#x27;s relations with the communists&#x27; Mao Zedong. Chiang also wanted Stalin to respect Chinese sovereignty in the north-eastern China.

=== November 26–27 ===

On November 26, Soong Mei-ling met Roosevelt to discuss a $US1 billion loan plan, and Roosevelt immediately agreed. Chiang then met with Admiral Ernest King to finalise plans for a joint counterattack on Burma the following March. In the afternoon, Roosevelt invited the leaders of China and Britain to his residence for tea, where the plan of action was finalised for the following March. Chiang met Mountbatten and thanked Roosevelt in person for his promise to lend China money.

On November 27, Chiang met with Dwight Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, and then left Cairo [10]:3128. Soong wrote to Roosevelt to express Chiang&#x27;s great gratitude. Roosevelt and Chiang had long and cordial talks, with Soong acting as the interpreter.

Soong&#x27;s chic costumes became one of the focal points of the press. During the meeting, Churchill was said to have visited the Sphinx and the Pyramids with his daughter Sarah Churchill and with Roosevelt.

On November 28, Churchill and Roosevelt arrived in Tehran for the Tehran Conference.

==Outcome==
Militarily, the United States, Great Britain, and the Republic of China resolved to launch a three-pronged attack against the Empire of Japan, with the British forces spearheading amphibious operations in southern Burma, the Chinese Expeditionary Force joining the British Indian troops to invade northern Burma, and ROC National Army and the U.S. Army attacking eastern Burma together from Yunnan. Operational plans were tasked to General Stilwell. Roosevelt also promised that Operation Tarzan be coupled with a massive amphibious landing offensive. It was decided that the Allies, including the ROC National Army at Langga should be committed to the battlefield first, several months before the ROC National Army departed from Yunnan in the spring of 1944. However, Roosevelt did not issue written assurances of naval operations in the Bay of Bengal. On the subject of military aid, Roosevelt agreed to increase the number of transport flights over the Hump Route in the Himalayas to supply China and to execute distant bombardments of Japan, hoping that through incentives, China would strengthen its fight against the enemy. Roosevelt also verbally promised to increase the airlift supply to China to 12,000 tons, and promised that the USAF B-29 Superfortress bombers would bomb Japan from Chinese bases. Roosevelt further verbally pledged to equip and train 90 army divisions for China, equipping 30 Chinese divisions immediately and another 60 divisions later.

Politically, Roosevelt and Churchill supported the territorial claims of the Republic of China, returning Taiwan and Manchuria to the Republic of China, and deciding to allow Korea to become independent &quot;in due course&quot;. The Cairo Declaration, however, made no specific mention of the future of the Ryukyu Islands. China believed that the Ryukyu Islands should be returned to China entirely, but the United Kingdom and the United States disagreed. The United States believed that the Ryukyu Islands could be left to Japan after the war if they were completely demilitarised. It was agreed between China and the United States that Lushun would be used as a public military port for China and the United States after the war, and that Dalian would become a free port. Within the resolution, there was no mention of interference in the Japanese state of governance. Roosevelt also consulted Chiang on the possibility of the abolition of the Japanese imperial system along with the emperor, Hirohito, but Chiang mentioned that the cause of the war was the Japanese warlords, and that the issue could be left to the Japanese people decide for themselves after the war. The Americans, not wanting the French to return to Indochina, had offered Chiang entire control of French Indochina, but he publicly declined. Chiang strongly advocated the independence of Korea and wanted to assist in the independence of Vietnam. Roosevelt firmly supported Chiang&#x27;s efforts to end imperialism in East Asia. On the subject of Europe, Churchill was unable to reach an agreement with Roosevelt, since Chiang and Churchill arrived in Cairo almost at the same time.

=== Cairo Declaration ===

On December 1, the United States, Britain, and the Republic of China issued the Cairo Declaration. It was released in a &quot;Cairo Communiqué&quot; through radio on 1 December 1943.

The declaration was drafted by Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt&#x27;s special secretary, amended by Roosevelt and revised by Churchill before being decided upon. The Cairo Declaration stated that the purpose of the war was to stop and punish Japanese aggression and reaffirm China&#x27;s status as one of the four powers, stating that &quot;the territories occupied by the Empire of Japan from the Republic of China after the September 18 Incident (including the Lushun and Dalian leases), such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China&quot;, &quot;Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed&quot;, and that &quot;Japanese public and private industries in China, as well as Japanese merchant ships, should be fully received by the government of the Republic of China&quot;.

The Declaration stated that &quot;in due course Korea shall become free and independent&quot;, supporting Korean independence after the war.

The Cairo Declaration demanded for the first time that Japan must &quot;surrender unconditionally&quot; and return to the Japanese home islands.

In the Roosevelt draft, in the sentence &quot;Plan of attack on Japan&quot;, it mentions the &quot;attack from China and Southeast Asia&quot; route. Churchill&#x27;s revised draft deleted this figure. Churchill explained that the landings in the Bay of Bengal would require the mobilisation of landing ships and would hinder the Normandy landings.

== Thoughts of the participants ==
Chiang was generally satisfied with the Cairo meeting and the results were &quot;as expected, which is certainly an important achievement in the revolutionary cause.&quot; He found Roosevelt&#x27;s demeanour superb and had the feeling of having met him at first sight. However, he had no high hopes for either Britain or the United States, and left Cairo predicting that &quot;Britain would never sacrifice the slightest interest to help others, … although Roosevelt promised that the navy would act in concert with our army when it disembarked in Burma I know it is impossible, but I trust it... However, regarding the timing of the counter-offensive in Burma, I can conclude that there is no hope of implementation until autumn next year (1944).&quot; He was also wary of the American decision of wanting the Soviet Union to get involved in the war against Japan. To show his appreciation to his wife the first lady, Soong Mei-ling, who assisted him so much in the conference, Chiang awarded her the Order of the Blue Sky and White Sun upon his return to China.

Roosevelt, partly influenced by Stilwell, felt that the Chinese Nationalist army was only intent on spying on the Chinese Communist forces, and not on fighting, and obstructed Stilwell&#x27;s training program simply because there was no one else in China to lead, except Chiang.

Churchill originally only wanted Chiang and his wife to visit the Pyramids as a holiday, while military decisions were to be discussed between him and Roosevelt alone, complaining that the meetings with Chiang were too long and a waste of time. He was unhappy with the fact that Roosevelt took so long to confer with Chiang, saying that &quot;the talks between British and American personnel were disturbed and distressingly confused by Chinese matters. … Chinese affairs, which had been of the least importance in Cairo, have taken precedence.&quot; The discussions between the British and American advisors were interrupted by Chinese matters, which were long and complicated and not important at all. However, Churchill&#x27;s attitude was friendlier than Chiang expected, and Chiang proclaimed that he (Churchill) was &quot;far-sighted and sophisticated, which is rare among modern statesmen&quot;. Churchill, on the other hand, felt that Chiang was &quot;calm, poised and agile, … at the height of his fame and power.&quot;

The British Chief of Staff, Alan Brooke, felt that Chiang was shrewd and cunning, and was determined to take advantage of the bargain despite failing to grasp the situation.

== Execution of the agreement ==

=== Burmese counter-offensive ===
The resolutions of the Cairo Conference concerning the counterattack on Burma can be said to have changed drastically, while Operation Buccaneer was later cancelled. In November that year, as agreed at the Cairo Conference, Field Marshal William Joseph Slim&#x27;s XV Corps departed for Burma, while the two Chinese divisions at Langga were mobilised to Lido, Assam, to engage the Japanese in December. Mountbatten returned to India and was instructed to draw up a new plan of action for the pirates. He intended to mobilize 50,000 men, but both Roosevelt and Churchill insisted that the operation should not include any more troops than the 14,000 originally planned. Roosevelt and George Marshall argued over the number of men, while Churchill sought to abandon the operation and concentrate supplies on the Aegean in Greece, a plan that the American military leadership was less than enthusiastic about. On November 29, Churchill told the Chief of Staff to record the Prime Minister&#x27;s &quot;special rejection of Commissar General Chiang&#x27;s request that we should conduct both amphibious and land operations in Burma&quot;.

==== The Cancellation of Operation Buccaneer ====

At the Tehran Conference from November 28 to December 1, Stalin controlled everything, with Roosevelt and Churchill seemingly doing his bidding. Stalin proposed the option of a rapid end to World War II, making the strategic importance of China secondary. He strove to open up the Western Front in Europe, with the Soviet Union fighting against Japan as soon as Germany was defeated. He also disapproved of the counter-offensive in Southeast Asia as he felt that the main theatre of war against Japan should be the in Pacific. Churchill also declared that fighting the Japanese deep in the swampy jungle of Burma was like jumping into the sea and fighting sharks. He felt that if China were really one of the real Four Powers, they should prove it themselves. Hence, Churchill urged Roosevelt to go back on his promise to Chiang. Roosevelt believed that if the Soviet Union cooperated, the war could be ended early and China&#x27;s position was no longer important. Churchill&#x27;s argument was all the more convincing for Roosevelt since the US and Britain needed to use their landing ships to open up the Western Front in France.

After the Tehran conference, the two returned to Cairo together and Churchill formally proposed to call off Operation Buccaneer. Roosevelt initially insisted that he had made a promise to Chiang and hence could not break it without Chiang&#x27;s acknowledgement. He justified his insistence by pointing out that since the shortage of landing craft was only about 18–20, it would not excessively impede allied plans on the Western Front. In December, the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to cancel Operation Tarzan, while arguing that the occupation of the Andaman Islands was more than worth the loss. Churchill was unhappy that Operation Buccaneer required such a large amount of supplies, suggesting that the operation should be postponed until after the end of the monsoon season and that landing craft should be allocated to the more costly European theatre. Churchill insisted on the cancellation of Operation Buccaneer, while US Admiral Ernest King opposed it.

On December 5, after consulting with his military advisers, Roosevelt finally agreed to Churchill&#x27;s demands and decided that Operation Buccaneer should be cancelled. Roosevelt telegraphed Chiang suggesting that China launch the counterattack alone first, or wait until November 1944, when the Allies had a major offensive capability at sea. He attempted to reverse this decision by informing Churchill that China would continue to build up its Yunnan forces but would not move into Burma unless the planned amphibious operation was launched as scheduled.

==== Tripartite troop movements ====

On December 21, 1943, Churchill authorised Mountbatten to mobilise 20,000 men for an amphibious operation, but instead of taking the Andaman Islands, an attack on the Rakhine coast behind the Japanese lines was launched. The landing gear for the Southeast Asia command was sent back to Europe. On December 23, Churchill&#x27;s chief of staff reiterated that Operation Maharaja and the landing in southern France, Operation &quot;Anvil&quot; was the priority operation of 1944, and nothing in other areas could affect either operation. After the amphibious operations were cancelled, Mountbatten&#x27;s Southeast Asia Command drew up alternative operational plans for an attack on northern and central Burma.

In January 1944, Stilwell commanded the American-trained Chinese Expeditionary Force in India to advance on Mon-Kwan. Chiang refused to accept a small attack on the Rakhine coast as a substitute for Operation Buccaneer and for some time was reluctant to send troops into Burma from Yunnan. Roosevelt pressured Chiang to send Chinese troops from Yunnan to Burma or he would cut military aid. In March, Churchill also telegraphed Chiang in Chongqing, urging China to send military aid to Burma. In April, the US issued an ultimatum to cut off Lend-Lease aid to China if the Yunnan troops were not mobilised for Burma. Chiang finally agreed to deploy Chinese troops in Yunnan to attack Japanese forces in Burma, explaining that it was necessary for China to achieve &quot;joint warfare between China, Britain and the US&quot; and enforce &quot;the desire of the US to come directly to China to fight against Japan&quot;.

=== Military aid to China ===
Roosevelt did not prioritise his commitment to China. After learning of the cancellation of Operation Buccaneer, Chiang asked to borrow US$1 billion. Although Roosevelt verbally agreed to it, Chiang&#x27;s request was seen as &quot;extortion&quot; by American officials, and as a result, Roosevelt turned down the request before the US$1 billion loan was submitted to Congress. He also decided that the monthly cost of U.S. troops in China would be limited to US$25 million, and that Stilwell should negotiate with China to subcontract the terms. He promised to provide equipment for 30 Chinese divisions immediately and 60 divisions after, but the latter was never fulfilled. In August 1945, Soong Tse-vung visited the United States and mentioned the matter, but US president Harry Truman reneged on the promise of equipment for 60 divisions. He promised, however, a military mission to China and full military assistance. Roosevelt failed to fulfil his verbal promises to China, having told Marshall: &quot;I am still so disgusted with what is going on in the China-Burma-India theatre that … The worst thing is that we have broken our word every time and we have not fulfilled any of our promises&quot;. In order for the United States Air Force to bomb the Japanese, 450,000 civilian workers were mobilised in Chengdu to build nine airfields with 9,000 feet of runways, and 60 days after construction began, the first American Air Fortress B-29 bombers landed, and 90 days later all airfields were completed.

=== Post-war plans ===
China&#x27;s demand at the Cairo Conference to recover lost territories was subsequently endorsed by Stalin, to end the Japanese puppet Manchukuo after the war. Roosevelt and Chiang discussed making Dalian a free port after the war, and at the Yalta Conference in February 1945, one of the agreements reached between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was for Dalian to become a free port under international supervision, but the decision of the Yalta Conference to make Lushun a Soviet leased military port resulted in a loss of territorial sovereignty as announced in the Cairo Declaration. The day after the Cairo Declaration, the provisional government of Korea issued a statement thanking the Cairo Conference for guaranteeing Korean independence. In order to make Korea free and independent, Roosevelt planned to establish an international trusteeship as a transitional phase of arrangement, and his proposal was accepted by Stalin at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences.

== Significance ==

The Cairo Conference was an example of wartime cooperation among the allied leaders and together with the Tehran Conference, formalised the framework for collaboration among the four powers. The Cairo Conference was the only meeting of Allied leaders that China participated in, and the Chinese were pleased that Roosevelt and Churchill regarded Chiang as a powerful world leader and determined that China would play a greater role in post-war international affairs. China was arranged as an important member of the Allies at the conference, and with Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang on equal footing, Chiang returned to Chungking to a hero&#x27;s welcome. The Cairo conference showed that Sino-American friendly relations were reaching their peak. In his Christmas address, Roosevelt enthusiastically declared to American citizens that &quot;Today, we and the Republic of China stand closer together today than ever before in deep friendship and in common purpose.&quot;

The Cairo Conference was also a turning point in Sino-American relations during the war. The Americans, who had more favourable impressions of China had tried to convince Churchill that Chinese power could help win the war against Japan and maintain post-war peace beforehand. Yet following the conference, Roosevelt also began to feel that China was insignificant. Roosevelt no longer trusted Chiang as much because Chiang had asked for too much but was less willing to fight in northern Burma. According to Mountbatten, Roosevelt and Churchill were angered by Chiang&#x27;s demands. Some historians argue that Roosevelt granting great power status to China was only a gesture of friendship and was not help solve China&#x27;s real problems or save the Kuomintang.

In the early 2000s, and especially leading up to the 70th anniversary in 2013, the legacy of the Cairo Conference attracted wider interest in China compared to the West. Historian Rana Mitter has written this is due to both the symbolism of it being the only conference in which Chiang was treated as an equal with other allied leaders, but also because the present Chinese government believes the Cairo Conference text legitimizes their claim to the disputed Senkaku Islands.

The Cairo Conference also made clear the demands on Japan. Following the announcement of the Cairo Declaration, Emperor Hirohito convened the Imperial Council, at which moderate forces grew in power compared to the weakening militarists and nationalists. In October 1944, former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro&#x27;s brother Konoe Tadamaro secretly negotiated a peace deal with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces based on the Cairo Declaration. In July 1945, the Potsdam Proclamation of China, Britain, and the United States made an ultimatum to Japan, also using the Cairo Declaration as the basis for unconditional surrender.

Strategically, however, the Cairo Conference was of limited significance, and Stalin&#x27;s commitment to join the war against Japan at the Tehran Conference made military operations against Burma and even Southeast Asia irrelevant. By 1945, aid to China was only brought in by the Stilwell Highway, and by then it was no longer significant.

<text>George Vertue (1684 – 24 July 1756) was an English engraver and antiquary, whose notebooks on British art of the first half of the 18th century are a valuable source for the period.

==Life==
Vertue was born in 1684 in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, his father, perhaps a tailor, and mother are noted as &#x27;Roman Catholic&#x27;. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to a prominent heraldic engraver of French origin who became bankrupt and returned to France. Vertue worked seven years under Michael Vandergucht, before operating independently. He was amongst the first members of Godfrey Kneller&#x27;s London Academy of Painting, who had employed him to engrave portraits. It was there that he became a pupil of Thomas Gibson, a leading portrait painter.

Vertue had a deep interest in antiquarian research, and much of his labour was given to this subject. From 1713 on, Vertue was a keen researcher on details of the history of British art, accumulating about forty volumes of notebooks. He was a member of the Rose and Crown Club, with William Hogarth, Peter Tillemans and other artists and connoisseurs, and kept some records of it. His travels to sites across England, with enthusiasts such as Edward Harley (Earl of Oxford), Lord Coleraine and others, were recorded in Vertue&#x27;s highly detailed drawings and notes. In 1717 he was appointed official engraver to the Society of Antiquaries, the same year as its formal foundation, and the only engraver to be made a Fellow of the Society. Most of the illustrations in &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;, up to his date of death, are his work.

After the death of the Earl of Oxford in 1741, Vertue was patronised by the Duchess of Portland and others. The Duke of Norfolk commissioned a work after Van Dyck of the Earl of Arundel and his family. He produced a catalogue detailing the collections of the royal family, at the request of Frederick, Prince of Wales, an avid buyer of the engraver&#x27;s work.

A portrait of Vertue was painted in 1715 by Gibson, his widow donated this to the Society of Antiquaries; Vertue had produced an engraving of this. A later painting, of the artist aged around 50, by Jonathan Richardson was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, a plate of this by Thomas Chambers was engraved for Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes.&quot; An 1849 edition of Walpole&#x27;s book contained an engraving, by George Thomas Doo, of a self-portrait—sitting in a library—that shows him displaying a portrait of the Earl of Oxford; this was previously published in 1821 as a lithograph. Another self-portrait, with his wife on their wedding-day, was etched by William Humphrey. Richardson also drew the profile used in James Basire&#x27;s plate in Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Literary Anecdotes.&quot;

Vertue died in London on 24 July 1756 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Vertue&#x27;s brother James (d. 1765) was an artist in Bath who produced the interior view of the abbey that was engraved by him. The second of his three brothers, Peter, was a dancing master of Chelmsford.

==Works==
Approximately five hundred portraits are attributed to Vertue, a similar number of published plates were devoted to antiquarian subjects. Many of the portraits were printed as frontispieces, most are regarded as accurate representations of the subject and many are not without artistic merit.

Vertue&#x27;s works of portraiture include:
* A portrait of Archbishop Tillotson, after Kneller, commissioned by John Somers, 1st Baron Somers
* The head of George I of Great Britain, produced on his accession to the throne, a work that established his reputation.
* &quot;Twelve Heads of Poets&quot;, set of plates issued 1730
* Rapin&#x27;s &quot;History of England,&quot; Knapton Brothers edition, 1736. A task that took three years. The same publisher commissioned plates for Thomas Birch&#x27;s &quot;Heads of Illustrious Persons&quot;, though his contribution is submerged by the popularity of Houbraken&#x27;s &quot;brilliant but less truthful productions&quot;.
As official engraver to the Society of Antiquaries, with works relating to this field of natural history, Vertue was prolific: Richard II at Westminster; a view of Waltham Cross; the shrine of Edward the Confessor; are notable mentions from his works in &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;

He executed a series of nine &quot;Historic Prints&quot; in 1740, imitations of works from the Tudor period, these included &quot;Visit of Queen Elizabeth to Blackfriars&quot; (miscalled the &quot;Procession to Hunsdon House&quot;); &quot;Henry VII and his Queen, with Henry VIII and Jane Seymour;&quot; &quot;The Cenotaph of Lord Darnley;&quot; and &quot;Edward VI granting a Charter to Bridewell Hospital.&quot; The copperplates of these were acquired by the Society of Antiquaries, and reprinted in 1776.

His publications include &quot;A Description of the Works of Wenceslaus Hollar,&quot; 1745 (reprinted 1759); and &quot;Medals, Coins, Great Seals, Impressions from the Works of Thomas Simon,&quot; 1753 (reprinted 1780).
Vertue was also involved with the pre-production of surveys of royal collections, Vanderdoort&#x27;s catalogue of the collection of Charles I, Chiffinch&#x27;s James II collection and his on that of Queen Caroline at Kensington; these saw print after his death, prefaced by Walpole.

Horace Walpole purchased Vertue&#x27;s notebooks after his death. Although disorderly and mainly unreflective, Walpole based his &quot;Anecdotes of Painting in England&quot; (5 vols., 1762–1771) on these notes. The original wording of the manuscripts was only published in the 20th century by the Walpole Society.

The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, 1900, makes special note of one reproduction by Vertue, in the article on Ralph Agas,

In 1737 George Vertue, the engraver and antiquary, published a pretended copy of Agas&#x27;s map of London [the &quot;Woodcut&quot; map], stating that it was executed in 1560, and that it gave a true representation of the metropolis as it existed at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. Vertue crowned his pretended copy with the date 1560 in Roman numerals, made palpable alterations and omissions in order that he might retain the delusive date, and took other unwarrantable liberties with the object of disguising the fraud. The unhappy result of this tinkering of the original design was that numerous subsequent antiquaries were victims of the deception. Mr. Overall is of opinion that Vertue, having become possessed of the parts of a copy of the map made by some unknown Dutch engraver in the reign of William III, caused them to be &quot;tinkered,&quot; probably for the purpose of deceiving his antiquarian friends. Of course the numerous copies of the spurious map issued by Vertue are of little or no value; …

<doc id="193822" wikidata="Q1591801" url="?curid=193822" title="Hay–Pauncefote Treaty">
<text>The Hay–Pauncefote Treaty is a treaty signed by the United States and Great Britain on 18 November 1901, as a legal preliminary to the U.S. building of the Panama Canal. It nullified the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 and gave the United States the right to create and control a canal across the Central American isthmus to connect the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. In the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, both nations had renounced building such a canal under the sole control of one nation.

==Background==
In the United States, for some years public irritation had been growing over the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty&#x27;s restriction on that country&#x27;s independent action. The British recognized their diminishing influence in the region and determined to cultivate the United States as a counterweight to Germany&#x27;s influence in Central and South America. Fresh negotiations were opened, and Great Britain gave its diplomat very liberal instructions, to concede whatever did not nullify the essential principle of neutrality of access.

==Negotiations==
A draft treaty was sent to the United States Senate by U.S. President William McKinley on 5 February 1900. It provided (1) that a canal might be constructed by the United States, or under its direction, (2) that the canal should be permanently neutralized on the model of the Suez Canal agreement — to be kept open at all times, either of war or peace, to all vessels, without discrimination, and no fortifications to be constructed commanding the canal or the waters adjacent, and (3) that other powers should be invited to join in this guaranty of neutrality. These provisions excited intense hostility in the U.S., and Senator Henry G. Davis offered an amendment adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The amendment provided that the neutralization clause should not prevent the United States from any measures it thought needful for its own defense or the preservation of order, specifically declared the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty abrogated, and struck out the third clause inviting the concurrence of other powers. The Senate ratified the Treaty with this amendment on 20 December 1900, but Great Britain refused to accept the amended treaty, and it expired by limitation on 5 March 1901.

==Final treaty==
The two diplomats, United States Secretary of State John Hay and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Pauncefote, set to work on a compromise, which they signed on 18 November 1901. President Theodore Roosevelt sent it to the Senate, which ratified it on 16 December. In its final form, the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty abrogated the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, did not forbid the United States from constructing fortifications, and did not require that the canal be kept open in time of war. The Treaty ceded to the United States the right to build and manage a canal, provided that all nations would be allowed access, and that the canal should never be taken by force.

==Tolls controversy==
Prior to the opening of the Panama Canal to traffic on 15 August 1914, a controversy with Great Britain respecting the interpretation of the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty arose. Under the Panama Canal Act of 1912, United States vessels engaged in the coast-to-coast trade between U.S. ports were to be exempted from canal tolls. Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, lodged a protest and claimed that the act discriminated against British and other foreign vessels in contravention of the Treaty, and requested that the Senate forgo action on the bill in order that a detailed statement might be sent, but President Taft signed the Act on 24 August.

In a formal protest lodged on 9 December, Grey declared that &quot;while the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty left the United States free to build and protect the canal, it expressly maintained the principle of Article VIII of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, guaranteeing to England the use of the canal on a complete equality with the United States of America.&quot; On 27 February 1913 he pressed for arbitration. In the United States, the British contention was generally regarded as an attempt to interfere with the United States&#x27; sovereign rights to regulate its own commerce, and to use the canal in whatsoever manner it saw fit. A minority, led by Republican Senator Elihu Root, held that the British objection was based on solid grounds.

President Wilson took office in 1913 and on 5 March 1914, Wilson sent a message to Congress strongly urging the repeal of the exemption. He regarded the exemption as a plain breach of the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty and declared that it was only in the United States that there was any doubt as to its language. He proposed a &quot;voluntary withdrawal from a position everywhere questioned and misunderstood.&quot; He faced strong opposition from his own party members whose 1912 Democratic Party platform had committed them to guaranteeing free passage for U.S. Nevertheless, President Wilson forced his own party members to accept a repeal of the exemption, but not before a provision had been inserted in the bill expressly reserving to the United States the right to exempt ships from tolls in the future. Wilson signed these revisions to the Panama Canal Act on 15 June 1914. Repealing the exemption meant that American ships would pay the same rate as ships of every other nation, at the time 90 cents per cargo ton.

<text>The Hay–Herrán Treaty was a treaty signed on January 22, 1903, between United States Secretary of State John M. Hay of the United States and Tomás Herrán of Colombia. Had it been ratified, it would have allowed the United States a renewable lease of 100 years on a six-mile-wide strip across the isthmus of Panama (then part of Colombia) for $10 million and an annual payment of $250,000, both payments being in gold coin. It was ratified by the United States Senate on March 14, but it was not ratified by the Senate of Colombia, so it had no effect. 

It has been considered by later observers that this happened mainly because Herrán had negotiated the treaty with little government or legislative oversight. It has also been mentioned that many of the politicians and congressmen found the amount offered to fall short, considering that the United States was willing to pay $40 million for the New Panama Canal Company and its construction equipment and excavations. 

The United States government was not willing to renegotiate the treaty with Colombia or alter the amounts involved and soon gave its support, both political and military, to a planned uprising in Panama, which led to its independence and to the eventual construction of the Panama Canal.

<text>The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty () was a treaty signed on November 18, 1903, by the United States and Panama, which established the Panama Canal Zone and the subsequent construction of the Panama Canal. It was named after its two primary negotiators, Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, the French diplomatic representative of Panama, and United States Secretary of State John Hay.

==Background==
From 1882, Ferdinand de Lesseps, who had built the Suez Canal, started work on a canal traversing the Isthmus of Panama, which was then part of Colombia. By 1889, with engineering challenges caused by frequent landslides, slippage of equipment and mud, plus disease, the effort failed in bankruptcy. After the collapse of the de Lesseps efforts to build the Panama Canal, Bunau-Varilla became an important shareholder of the &quot;Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama&quot;, which still had the concession, as well as certain valuable assets, for the building of a canal in Panama. 

The US intent to influence the area, especially the Panama Canal&#x27;s construction and control, led to the separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and its establishment as an independent state.

The US had negotiated the Hay–Herrán Treaty with Colombia in early 1903 that would give it control of the canal and would include the purchase of the French-held land for $40 million. When the Congress of Colombia rejected that Treaty on August 12, 1903, Bunau-Varilla and the other French investors were faced with the prospect of losing everything. Justly confident that American President Theodore Roosevelt would support his initiative, he met with Manuel Amador, the leader of the Panamanian independence movement, in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York where he wrote him a $100,000 check to fund a renewed Panamanian revolt. In return, Bunau-Varilla would become Panama&#x27;s representative in Washington.

In November 1903 Panama, tacitly supported by the United States, proclaimed its independence, and on November 13, the United States formally recognized the Republic of Panama. Although not Panamanian himself, Bunau-Varilla was promptly appointed Panamanian ambassador to the United States. He had not, however, been in Panama for seventeen years, nor did he ever return.

The treaty was negotiated in Washington, D.C., and New York City. As part of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla negotiations, the U.S. bought the shares and assets of the &quot;Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama&quot; for $40 million as originally stipulated in the Hay–Herrán Treaty. The treaty was quickly drafted and signed by Bunau-Varilla and Hay the night before the Panamanian delegation arrived in Washington.

==Terms==
The terms of the treaty stated that the United States was to receive rights to a canal zone which was to extend five miles on either side of the canal route in perpetuity, and Panama was to receive a payment from the U.S. up to $10 million and an annual rental payment of $250,000. Panama never legally became a colony of the United States; the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty gave the United States governance only in the Canal Zone.

==Aftermath==
This treaty was a source of conflict between Panama and the United States since its creation. The Canal Zone became a racially and socially segregated area, set aside from the country of Panama. The push for environmental determinism seemed to be the best framework to justify American practices in Panama. The conflict from the treaty reached its peak on January 9, 1964, with riots over sovereignty of the Panama Canal Zone. The riot started after a Panamanian flag was torn during conflict between Panamanian students and Canal Zone Police officers, over the right of the Panamanian flag to be flown alongside the U.S. flag. U.S. Army units became involved in suppressing the violence after the Canal Zone Police were overwhelmed. After three days of fighting, about 22 Panamanians and four U.S. soldiers were killed. This day is known in Panama as Martyrs&#x27; Day.

The events of January 9 were considered to be a significant factor in the U.S. decision to negotiate the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which finally abolished the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty and allowed the gradual transfer of control of the Canal Zone to Panama and the handover of full control of the Panama Canal on December 31, 1999.

<text>The &quot;Baltimore&quot; crisis was a diplomatic incident that took place between Chile and the United States, after the 1891 Chilean Civil War, as a result of the growing American influence in the Pacific Coast region of Latin America in the 1890s. It marked a dramatic shift in United States–Chile relations. It was triggered by the stabbing of two United States Navy sailors from in front of the &quot;True Blue Saloon&quot; in Valparaíso on October 16, 1891. The United States government demanded an apology. Chile ended the episode when it apologized and paid a $75,000 indemnity.

==Escalating tensions==
In 1884, Chile emerged from the War of the Pacific as a potential threat to the hegemony of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The Chilean navy, then the strongest fleet in the Pacific, was able to confront American policy. In 1882, Chile refused US mediation in the War of the Pacific. During the Panama crisis of 1885, when the United States Navy occupied Colón, then part of Colombia, the Chilean government sent its most powerful protected cruiser (which represented a serious threat to the wooden American warships) to Panama City, and ordered it not to leave until after the American forces evacuated Colon. Finally, in 1888, Chile annexed Easter Island, located some west of Valparaíso, and joined the ranks of imperial nations.

By 1891, however, the equation had changed. The United States possessed more naval power and, more significantly, applied the theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan to secure the growing influence of the United States in Latin America by the usage of shows of force using the now expanded navy.

During the Chilean Civil War, the American government supported the forces of President Jose Manuel Balmaceda and enforced a ban on exports for the congressional forces that was supported partially by the United Kingdom. Those and another circumstances troubled relations between the United States and the victorious congressional side, which defeated the presidential forces in 1891 to take power in Chile.

Just before the end of the Civil War, the United States sent a group of ships, including , to force the Chilean congressional cargo ship &quot;Itata&quot;, which had illegally loaded arms in San Diego for the congressional forces, to return to San Diego. The US ships reached Iquique before &quot;Itata&quot;. The new Chilean government ordered the ship back to San Diego to face outstanding charges.

During the war, the American-owned Central and South American Cable Company, by order of the Balmaceda administration, restored submarine telegraph cable service between Santiago and Lima, and sundered the cable connection to the congressional headquarters.

In addition, the United States minister in Santiago, Patrick Egan, gave diplomatic asylum to various insurgent congressional leaders during the war, and to Balmaceda&#x27;s supporters after the war. The victorious side called upon Egan to surrender those supporters to them but was refused.

From the point of view of the congressionals, the United States had tried to stop them from purchasing weapons, denied them access to international telegraph traffic, spied on their troops, and refused to surrender war criminals.

==USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; incident==

On October 16, 1891, a mob attacked a group of sailors on shore leave from the cruiser USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; outside a bar in the Chilean port of Valparaíso after one of the American sailors spat on a picture of Arturo Prat, one of Chile&#x27;s national heroes. Two sailors were killed and seventeen or eighteen were injured.

The new Chilean government initially rejected American protests. It denied responsibility, and the foreign minister attacked the U.S. US President Benjamin Harrison demanded full satisfaction as a point of honor and demanded $75,000 in reparations. He issued an ultimatum and hinted at war. European powers favored Chile; they recognized American dominance in the region and did not intervene. Argentina and Perú had their own grievances against Chile and supported the U.S. Chile capitulated to Washington&#x27;s terms, apologized, and paid $75,000 in gold. Afterward it built up its navy and its European connections.

<doc id="193829" wikidata="Q591829" url="?curid=193829" title="Alabama Claims">
<text>The &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims were a series of demands for damages sought by the government of the United States from the United Kingdom in 1869, for the attacks upon Union merchant ships by Confederate Navy commerce raiders built in British shipyards during the American Civil War. The claims focused chiefly on the most famous of these raiders, the , which took more than sixty prizes before she was sunk off the French coast in 1864.

After international arbitration endorsed the American position in 1872, Britain settled the matter by paying the United States $15.5 million, ending the dispute and leading to a treaty that restored friendly relations between Britain and the United States. That international arbitration established a precedent, and the case aroused interest in codifying public international law. The case too resulted in the warming of relations between Britain and the US, which had begun the 1800s as rivals, and ended the century as something of partners.

==British political involvement==

The British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell failed to stop the &quot;Alabama&quot; from putting to sea from the shipyards of John Laird Sons and Company in Birkenhead. The United States Legation in London had explicitly opposed this, and the American Minister to Britain, Charles Francis Adams, charged that the ship was bound for the Confederacy, where it would be used against the United States.

Though both the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary were thought to favor the Confederacy at the time of &quot;Alabama&quot; construction, British public opinion was divided on the issue, and MPs such as Richard Cobden campaigned against it. The subsequent departure of the &quot;Alabama&quot; proved to be publicly embarrassing, and Palmerston and Russell were later forced to admit that the ship should not have been allowed to depart. The Government had requested advice from the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Sir Alexander Cockburn, who ruled that her release did not violate Britain&#x27;s neutrality, because she was not outfitted with guns at the time that she left British ports.

In the next year, Britain detained two ironclad warships constructed in Birkenhead and destined for the Confederacy. As a result of the uproar over the &quot;Alabama&quot;, Palmerston instructed the British Admiralty to tender an offer for the purchase of the ships. They had been bought by a go-between, Monsieur Bravay of Paris (who had ordered their construction as an intermediary for Confederate principals).

==The claims==
In what were called the &quot;Alabama Claims&quot;, in 1869 the United States claimed direct and collateral damage against Great Britain. In the particular case of the &quot;Alabama&quot;, the United States claimed that Britain had violated neutrality by allowing five warships to be constructed, especially the &quot;Alabama&quot;, knowing that it would eventually enter into naval service with the Confederacy.

Other particulars included the following: In the summer of 1862, the British-built steam warship &quot;Oreto&quot; was delivered to Nassau in the Bahamas with the secret understanding that it would be later transferred to the Confederate States Navy. Upon transfer, it was commissioned CSS &quot;Florida&quot;. British Royal Navy Admiral George Willes Watson (1827–1897) aided the transfer, and Watson&#x27;s actions were reviewed by the tribunal.

Other warships included the (built at Alexander Stephen and Sons in Glasgow), (built at John Laird and Sons, like the &quot;Alabama&quot;), and (built at J &amp; W Dudgeon in London).

Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also demanded that &quot;indirect damages&quot; be included, specifically the British blockade runners. British blockade runners played a pivotal role in sustaining the war effort of the Confederacy, smuggling through the Union blockade thousands of tons of gunpowder, half a million rifles, and several hundred cannons to the Confederacy. Such acts may have lengthened the Civil War by two years and cost 400,000 more lives of soldiers and civilians on both sides.

===Payment===

Sumner originally asked for $2 billion in damages, or alternatively, the ceding of Canada to the United States. When American Secretary of State William H. Seward negotiated the Alaska Purchase in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, primarily for its commercial advantages to the United States. Seward expected the West Coast Province of British Columbia to seek annexation to the United States and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims. Soon other U.S. politicians endorsed annexation, with the goal of annexing British Columbia, the central Canadian Red River Colony (later Manitoba), and eastern Nova Scotia, in exchange for dropping the damage claims.

The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for several reasons: London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute in cash, Canada offered to have British Columbia enter the Canadian Confederation on very generous terms, which bolstered nationalist sentiment in British Columbia that already favored fealty to the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion after the long years, expenses and losses of the Civil War.

===Treaty of Washington===
In 1871, Hamilton Fish, President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Secretary of State, worked out an agreement with British representative Sir John Rose to create a commission in Washington comprising six members from the British Empire and six members from the United States. Its assignment was to resolve the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims, refinancing, and other international disputes between Canada and the United States by treaty. On March 8, 1871, the Treaty of Washington was signed at the State Department and the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty on May 24, 1871. In accord with the treaty, an international arbitration tribunal met in Geneva. The treaty had provisions regarding the settlement process for the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims but did not include &quot;indirect damages&quot;, settled disputed Atlantic fisheries and the San Juan Boundary (concerning the Oregon boundary line). Britain and the United States became perpetual allies after the treaty, with Britain having expressed regret over the &quot;Alabama&quot; damages.

==The tribunal==

The tribunal was composed of representatives:
*Britain: Sir Alexander Cockburn
*United States: Charles Francis Adams, with William Maxwell Evarts serving as counsel
*Italy: Federico Sclopis
*Switzerland: Jakob Stämpfli
*Brazil: Marcos Antônio de Araújo, Viscount of Itajubá.

Negotiations had taken place in Suitland, Maryland, at the estate of businessman Samuel Taylor Suit. The tribunal session was held in a reception room of the Town Hall in Geneva, Switzerland. This has been named .

The final award of $15,500,000 formed part of the Treaty of Washington and was paid out by Great Britain in 1872. This was balanced against damages of $1,929,819 paid by the United States to Great Britain for illegal Union blockade practices and ceded fishing privileges.

==Legacy==
This established the principle of international arbitration and launched a movement to codify public international law with hopes for finding peaceful solutions to international disputes. The arbitration of the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims was a precursor to the Hague Convention, the League of Nations, the World Court, and the United Nations. The Alabama Claims inspired international jurist Gustave Moynier to pursue legal arrangements to enforce international treaties in the 1870s. The Soviet Union carefully studied the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims when assessing whether it could claim damages in response to Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.

According to Vladimir Nabokov, the core incident has a legacy in literary reference, being used as a plot device in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, by Leo Tolstoy. In one early passage, Stiva Oblonsky has a dream that may show his having read of the Alabama Claims through the &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&quot;. And in the Jules Verne novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; Inspector Fix warns Phileas Fogg that the riot they encounter in San Francisco may be connected to the claim.

<text>The Burlingame Treaty (), also known as the Burlingame–Seward Treaty of 1868, was a landmark treaty between the United States and Qing China, amending the Treaty of Tientsin, to establish formal friendly relations between the two nations, with the United States granting China the status of most favored nation with regards to trade. It was signed in the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. in 1868 and ratified in the Chinese capital, Peking in 1869. The most significant result of the treaty was that it effectively lifted any former restrictions in regards to emigration to the United States from China, leading to large-scale immigration to the United States beginning in earnest by Chinese immigrants.

==History==

China and the United States concluded the Burlingame–Seward Treaty in 1868 to expand upon the Treaty of Tientsin of 1858. The new treaty established some basic principles that aimed to ease immigration restrictions and represented a Chinese effort to limit foreign interference in internal Chinese affairs.

On June 14, 1861, president Abraham Lincoln appointed Anson Burlingame as minister to the Qing Empire. Burlingame was an experienced diplomat, having a long record of faithful employment in the diplomatic service. Upon his arrival in China, he chose to establish a cooperative and friendly diplomatic policy rather than an aggressive and uncompromising one and developed close and amicable relationships with the reform elements of the Qing court. 

The United States also wished to gain access to profitable trading opportunities and foster the continued spread of Christianity in Asia by missionaries, which had already been initiated by Catholic missionaries who arrived in China starting in the 16th century. As a part of the general effort to convince the Chinese to adopt a more Western approach to diplomacy and governance, the Western powers also encouraged the Qing government to send diplomatic missions abroad. Finally persuaded to do so, the Chinese requested that Burlingame accompany their representatives on a tour that included stops in the major capitals of Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin. Burlingame, originally a representative of the U.S. government, gave up his post to assist the Chinese in their treaty negotiations with Secretary of State William H. Seward.

While in Washington, Burlingame negotiated a treaty with Seward, his former superior, to revise and expand upon the points established in the Treaty of Tientsin of 1858. The first several articles of the new treaty protected commerce conducted in Chinese ports and cities, and established the right of China to appoint consuls to American port cities. The more groundbreaking articles included measures that promised the Chinese the right to free immigration and travel within the United States and allowed for the protection of Chinese citizens in the United States in accordance with the most-favored-nation principle. Another article gave the citizens of the two nations reciprocal access to education and schooling when living in the other country. All of these articles served to reinforce the principle of equality between the two nations.

The final article of the Burlingame–Seward Treaty offered China some protection from external influence in internal matters. In this article, the U.S. recognized that the decision to begin new construction projects or similar improvements belonged in the hands of the local government, not foreign powers or their representatives. This point was intended to safeguard against undue U.S. involvement in Chinese domestic affairs.

On November 16, 1867, Burlingame was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to head a Chinese diplomatic mission to the United States and the principal European nations. The mission, which included two Chinese ministers, two Western secretaries, six students from Peking, and a considerable retinue, arrived in the United States in March 1868. Burlingame used his personal relations with the Republican administration to negotiate a relatively quick and favorable treaty. In a series of speeches across the country, he displayed eloquent oratory to advocate equal treatment of China and a welcoming stance toward Chinese immigrants. On July 28, 1868, the mission concluded at Washington a series of articles, supplementary to the Reed Treaty of 1858, later known as the Burlingame Treaty.

==Terms==

The treaty:
*Recognized China&#x27;s right of eminent domain over all of its territory;
*Gave China the right to appoint consuls at ports in the United States, &quot;who shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities as those enjoyed by the consuls of Great Britain and Russia&quot;;
*Provided that &quot;citizens of the United States in China of every religious persuasion and Chinese subjects in the United States shall enjoy entire liberty of conscience and shall be exempt from all disability or persecution on account of their religious faith or worship in either country&quot;; and
*Granted certain privileges to citizens of either country residing in the other, the privilege of naturalization, however, being specifically withheld.

==Impact==
Chinese immigration to the United States was initially encouraged. Opposition in Congress to Chinese immigration led President Rutherford B. Hayes to authorize James Burrill Angell to renegotiate the treaty in 1880. On November 17, 1880, the renegotiated treaty, called the Treaty Regulating Immigration from China (and more informally as the Angell Treaty of 1880), was passed. This would suspend, but not prohibit, Chinese immigration, while confirming the obligation of the United States to protect the rights of those immigrants already arrived.

Despite the reciprocal protections that the Treaty afforded Chinese in the United States and Americans in China, the Treaty ultimately reinforced U.S. trade interests with China under the principle of the most-favored-nation concept, and it ensured a steady flow of low-cost Chinese immigrant labor for U.S. firms. For these reasons, American industrial leaders initially celebrated the Treaty as a major advancement for American commercial interests.

However, the success of the treaty was short-lived. By the late 1870s, U.S. industrial leaders and politicians could no longer ignore the increasing anti-Chinese sentiment and violence in the United States, particularly in the western states; in fact, industrialists and politicians often promoted anti-Chinese activities. A new treaty signed in 1880 revised the Burlingame–Seward agreement, and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 abrogated its free immigration clauses altogether.

<text>A lockstitch is the most common mechanical stitch made by a sewing machine. The term &quot;single needle stitching&quot;, often found on dress shirt labels, refers to lockstitch.

==Structure==
The lockstitch uses two threads, an upper and a lower. Lockstitch is named because the two threads, upper and lower, &quot;lock&quot; (entwine) together in the hole in the fabric which they pass through. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, through the take-up arm, and finally through the hole in the needle. Meanwhile, the lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine below the material.

To make one stitch, the machine lowers the threaded needle through the cloth into the bobbin area, where a rotating hook (or other hooking mechanism) catches the upper thread at the point just after it goes through the needle. The hook mechanism carries the upper thread entirely around the bobbin case so that it has made one wrap of the bobbin thread. Then the take-up arm pulls the excess upper thread (from the bobbin area) back to the top, forming the lockstitch. Then the feed dogs pull the material along one stitch length, and the cycle repeats.

 Ideally, the lockstitch is formed in the center of the thickness of the material — that is, ideally the upper thread entwines the lower thread in the middle of the material. The thread tension mechanisms, one for the upper thread and one for the lower thread, prevent either thread from pulling the entwine point out of the middle of the material.

Prior to the invention of the rotating hook, lockstitch machines placed the lower bobbin inside a miniature shuttle which would be passed through the loop formed when the needle passed through the fabric and then began to retract again.

==Geometry==

The geometry of the lockstitch is controlled by the presence or absence of:
* sideways movements of the machine&#x27;s needle
* backwards movements of the machine&#x27;s feed dogs

In older machines, the needle and feed motion are controlled by mechanical cams. Some modern household machines offer a slot for user-replaceable custom stitch cams. In more recent designs, the needle and feed motion are directly motorized.

===Straight===

Straight stitch geometry is produced when the needle has no sideways movements and when the feed dogs are following only in the normal forward &quot;four motion&quot; movement.

Because its two threads run straight and parallel, a straight stitch is not natively stretchable.

===Zigzag===

Zigzag stitch geometry is produced when the needle moves rhythmically side to side while stitching, while the feed dogs are following only in the normal forward &quot;four motion&quot; movement. Most lockstitch machines made after the 1960s are capable of doing this; older machines achieve the same stitch with a specialist presser foot which moves the fabric beneath the stationary needle.

Zigzag stitches are used when a stretchable stitch is required, such as when sewing stretchy fabrics.

====Blind====

Blind stitch geometry is a derivative of the zigzag. It is created in the same manner, except that the needle zigs to the side and then zags back only once every fourth or fifth stitch. It is used to reduce the visibility of hems and other seam edges.

===Stretch===

Stretch stitch geometry is specifically for stretchability. While the needle is moving, as for straight or zigzag stitches, the feed dogs automatically move the fabric forward and backward. As with zigzag stitches, stretch stitching is controlled by mechanical cams, but because of the dual action, stretch stitch machines have &quot;double&quot; cams. As the double cam rotates, the first follower rides along one track to move the needle bar from side to side, while the second follower rides along a different track to move the feed dogs forward and reverse.

===Decorative===

By adding controlled motion of the material being sewn through an additional set of motors, arbitrary customized patterns of 100 cm or more in each direction can be sewn, opening the door to the very popular category of programmable household embroidery machines.

Most home sewing machines are lockstitch machines, although overlockers (aka sergers) have entered the home market since the 1980s. A lockstitch can also be performed by hand using a sewing awl.

===Industrial===

Of a typical garment factory&#x27;s sewing machines, half might be lockstitch machines, and the other half divided between overlock machines, chain stitch machines, and various other specialized machines.

Industrial lockstitch machines with two needles, each forming an independent lockstitch with its own bobbin, are also very common. There are different types of lockstitch industrial machines. The most commonly used are the drop feed for light and medium duty, and walking foot for medium and heavy duty like the Class 7 with an impressive 3/4&quot; foot lift. This makes the Class 7 able to stitch through heavy materials up to 3/4&quot; with threads as strong as 57 lbs. Originally made by Singer in the US and Europe for supplying the demand for heavy-duty clothing for the troops, for many years after the war this class was not available as new because the market was filled. With the outsourcing of many sewing manufacturing jobs, nowadays many Chinese Class 7 machines are available and built by Federal Specifications giving them a performance equal to the original ones (FSN:3530-3111-1556, FSN: 3530-3111-3675, FSN: 3530-311-1556, FSN: 3530-3111-3075).

Most industrial lockstitch machines sew only a straight line of stitches. Industrial &quot;zig-zag&quot; machines are available but uncommon, and there are essentially no fancy-pattern stitching industrial machines other than dedicated embroidery and edge decoration machines. Even something as simple as a bar-tack or a buttonhole stitch is usually done by a dedicated machine incapable of doing anything else. When a variety of decorative stitching is required rather than a single stitch, a &quot;commercial&quot; machine (basically a heavy-duty household machine) is usually employed.

<text>The De Lôme Letter, a note written by Señor Don Enrique Dupuy de Lôme, the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, to Don José Canalejas y Méndez, the Foreign Minister of Spain, reveals de Lôme’s opinion about the Spanish involvement in Cuba and US President McKinley’s diplomacy.

==Publication==
Cuban revolutionaries intercepted the letter from the mail and released it to the Hearst press, which published it on February 9, 1898, in the &quot;New York Journal&quot;, in an article titled &quot;Worst Insult to the United States in its History.&quot; Much of the press in New York began to demand De Lôme&#x27;s resignation, and Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot; began a &quot;Go Home De Lôme&quot; campaign. These campaigns did, ultimately, lead to De Lôme&#x27;s resignation. De Lôme’s unflattering remarks about McKinley helped stoke the flames that would become the Spanish–American War. Two months later, on April 11, 1898, McKinley delivered a war message to Congress suggesting &quot;forcible intervention&quot; by the United States to establish peace in Cuba.

<text>The Walpole Society, named after Horace Walpole, was founded in 1911 to promote the study of the history of British art and artists.

From 1762 on, Walpole had published the first history of art in Britain, based on the manuscript notebooks of George Vertue, the most important source of information concerning British art before the mid-eighteenth century. One of the first goals of the Society was to publish these notebooks in their original form, which included much material that Walpole omitted.

The Society, based in London, publishes an annual volume of studies written by its members and scholars around the world. The field of research includes paintings, drawings, prints, miniatures, sculpture and illuminated manuscripts as well as patronage, collecting and travel. The period covered is the whole of the history of British art, from the Middle Ages to the present.

== Berger Prize ==
In 2024, the Walpole Society agreed with the Berger Collection Educational Trust (BCET) to run The Berger Prize, an annual book prize for art history.

<doc id="193835" wikidata="Q163573" url="?curid=193835" title="Algeciras Conference">
<text>The Algeciras Conference of 1906 took place in Algeciras, Spain, and lasted from 16 January to 7 April. The purpose of the conference was to find a solution to the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905 between France and Germany, which arose as Germany responded to France&#x27;s effort to establish a protectorate over the independent state of Morocco. Germany was not trying to stop French expansion. Its goal was to enhance its own international prestige, and it failed badly. The result was a much closer relationship between France and Britain that strengthened the Entente Cordiale since both London and Paris were increasingly suspicious and distrustful of Berlin. An even more momentous consequence was the heightened sense of frustration and readiness for war in Germany that spread beyond the political elite to much of the press and most of the political parties except for the Liberals and Social Democrats on the left.

The Pan-German element grew in strength, denounced the government&#x27;s retreat as treason and stepped up chauvinistic support for war.

==Background==
Britain and France&#x27;s &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; of 1904 had defined diplomatic cooperation between them and recognized British authority over Egypt and French control in Morocco (with some Spanish concessions). Germany saw that development putting an end to the rivalry between Britain and France, which would further isolate Germany in European affairs.

On 31 March 1905, Germany&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm II visited Tangier and delivered a speech calling for an international conference to ensure Morocco&#x27;s independence, with war the alternative. The historian Heather Jones argues that Germany&#x27;s use of warlike rhetoric was a deliberate diplomatic ploy:Another German strategy was to stage dramatic gestures, and dangerously play up the threat of war, in the belief that this would impress upon other European powers the importance of consultation with Germany on imperial issues: the fact that France had not considered it necessary to make a bilateral agreement with Germany over Morocco rankled, especially given Germany was deeply insecure about its newly acquired Great Power status. Hence Germany opted for an increase in belligerent rhetoric and, theatrically, Kaiser Wilhelm II dramatically interrupted a Mediterranean cruise to visit Tangier, where he declared Germany&#x27;s support for the Sultan&#x27;s independence and integrity of his kingdom, turning Morocco overnight into an international &#x27;crisis.&#x27; German diplomats believed they could convince US President Theodore Roosevelt to challenge French intervention in Morocco. Roosevelt, who was mediating the Russo-Japanese War and aware of the US Senate&#x27;s stance to avoid involvement in European affairs, was disinclined to become involved in the Moroccan crisis. However, with the situation in June 1905 worsening to the point of war between Germany and France and possibly Britain, Roosevelt in July persuaded the French to attend a January peace conference in Algeciras.

Germany had hoped that the conference would weaken the Entente Cordiale. Wilhelm II had thought he could form an alliance with France if most of its demands were met. He also thought that better relations with Russia were possible because the Revolution of 1905 and the Russo-Japanese War had put it in a weak ally-hungry position. However, Germany was somewhat excluded in the initial decisions, and British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey showed Britain&#x27;s support of France in the conference via meetings with French Ambassador Jules Cambon, which made the Entente Cordiale actually grow stronger. Russia likewise wholeheartedly supported France&#x27;s position in order to secure French financial markets in the hope of acquiring a large loan to recuperate losses incurred by the Russo-Japanese War.

Following its failed attempt to isolate Britain, Germany furthered the growing Anglo-German Naval Race by the passage of the Third Naval Law in 1906. The overall contribution towards the outbreak of the First World War can then seem to be the separation of Germany and its allies (Triple Alliance) of Britain, France and Russia, which the following year became the Triple Entente.

The next major event to thicken the tension between them would be the Bosnian Crisis.

== Moroccan delegation ==

Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco was represented by Muhammad al-Muqri and Muhammad Torres. Al-Muqri expressed frustration at the translation situation and commented: &quot;We&#x27;re sitting here like statues; we can&#x27;t understand a thing of what is said.&quot; The Moroccan delegation had no choice but to use Abdelqader Benghabrit, an Algerian translator who was present at the conference in the service of France. 
Another difficulty the Moroccans faced was the difficulty of contacting the sultan, who should have been informed of every detail of what transpired at the conference. The researcher Bazegh Abdessamad wrote:&quot;No decision could be made—whether affirmative or negative—without his instruction and ordinance. The representatives of the US and European nations could easily contact their capitals to consult their respective governments, while Fes had no telephone or telegraph, nor was it served by any rail or paved road that would allow them to inform the sultan of developments at the conference.&quot;

==Outcome==
The final Act of the conference was signed on 7 April 1906 and covered the organisation of Morocco&#x27;s police and customs, regulations concerning the repression of the smuggling of armaments and concessions to the European bankers from a new State Bank of Morocco to issue banknotes backed by gold with a 40-year term. The new state bank was to act as Morocco&#x27;s central bank, with a strict cap on the spending of the Sherifian Empire and administrators appointed by the national banks, which guaranteed the loans, from the German Empire, United Kingdom, France and Spain. Spanish coinage continued to circulate. The right of Europeans to own land was established, and taxes were to be levied towards public works.

The Sultan of Morocco retained control of a police force in the six port cities, which was to be composed entirely of Moroccan Muslims and budgeted at an average salary of a mere 1000 pesetas a year but was to be instructed by French and Spanish officers. They would oversee the paymaster (the &quot;amin&quot;), regulate discipline and have the ability to be recalled and replaced by their governments. The Inspector-General in charge would be Swiss and reside in Tangiers.

At the last moment, the Moroccan delegates found that they were unable to sign the final Act, but a decree of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco on 18 June finally ratified it.

<doc id="193837" wikidata="Q2663605" url="?curid=193837" title="List of named matrices">
<text>This article lists some important classes of matrices used in mathematics, science and engineering. A matrix (plural matrices, or less commonly matrixes) is a rectangular array of numbers called &quot;entries&quot;. Matrices have a long history of both study and application, leading to diverse ways of classifying matrices. A first group is matrices satisfying concrete conditions of the entries, including constant matrices. Important examples include the identity matrix given by
:formula_1
and the zero matrix of dimension formula_2. For example:

:formula_3.

Further ways of classifying matrices are according to their eigenvalues, or by imposing conditions on the product of the matrix with other matrices. Finally, many domains, both in mathematics and other sciences including physics and chemistry, have particular matrices that are applied chiefly in these areas.
== Constant matrices ==

The list below comprises matrices whose elements are constant for any given dimension (size) of matrix. The matrix entries will be denoted &quot;aij&quot;. The table below uses the Kronecker delta δ&quot;ij&quot; for two integers &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; which is 1 if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; and 0 else.

== Specific patterns for entries ==
The following lists matrices whose entries are subject to certain conditions. Many of them apply to &quot;square matrices&quot; only, that is matrices with the same number of columns and rows. The main diagonal of a square matrix is the diagonal joining the upper left corner and the lower right one or equivalently the entries &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;i&quot;. The other diagonal is called anti-diagonal (or counter-diagonal).

== Matrices satisfying some equations ==
A number of matrix-related notions is about properties of products or inverses of the given matrix. The matrix product of a &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; and a &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;k&quot; matrix &quot;B&quot; is the &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;k&quot; matrix &quot;C&quot; given by
:formula_4
This matrix product is denoted &quot;AB&quot;. Unlike the product of numbers, matrix products are not commutative, that is to say &quot;AB&quot; need not be equal to &quot;BA&quot;. A number of notions are concerned with the failure of this commutativity. An inverse of square matrix &quot;A&quot; is a matrix &quot;B&quot; (necessarily of the same dimension as &quot;A&quot;) such that &quot;AB&quot; = &quot;I&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;BA&quot; = &quot;I&quot;. An inverse need not exist. If it exists, &quot;B&quot; is uniquely determined, and is also called &quot;the&quot; inverse of &quot;A&quot;, denoted &quot;A&quot;−1.

==Matrices used in statistics==
The following matrices find their main application in statistics and probability theory.
*Bernoulli matrix — a square matrix with entries +1, −1, with equal probability of each.

<text>Complutum was an ancient Roman city located in the present-day city of Alcalá de Henares, Spain. It has been partially excavated and the impressive remains can be seen today at the Complutum archaeological site south west of the current city, about a kilometre from the medieval centre.

==History==


The town grew up at a favourable site near the junction of several communication routes and near natural resources, such as the Henares river and the arable meadows around it.

It was a town of the Celtiberian Carpetani tribe in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC whose hill fort (&quot;oppidum&quot;) occupied the Viso Hill nearby on the far side of the Henares river at a defensive position.

After the Roman conquest in the first century BC there was a first, unsuccessful city project on the same site but soon afterwards the citizens themselves chose to build a new city in the fertile valley of the Henares. This major project was in two stages, first under Augustus and then under Claudius (around 50 AD). In 74 AD Vespasian gave the city the status of &quot;municipium&quot;. It became the main urban centre and capital of a vast political territory, covering most of the current region of Madrid and Guadalajara.

The city was greatly enhanced in the 3rd century, despite the crisis that the empire experienced from then until its fall in the 5th.

During the Diocletian persecutions (r. 284–305) two young brothers (Justus was 13 years old, Pastor less than 9) were killed as Christian martyrs and are today the patron saints of Alcalá.

During the Visigothic period, an important road ran south from Complutum to the Mediterranean and north to Gaul. 

The absence of archaeological legislation in the 19th century led to many objects being taken and sold. About half of Complutum was destroyed between 1970 and 1974 with the construction of the Reyes Católicos suburb.

In 1985 the Spanish Historical Heritage Law was approved, and the first scientific and regulated campaigns were carried out between 1985 and 1990, and again in 2003.

==The Site==

The limits of the city are known since archaeological surveys were carried out when the adjoining buildings were built. As in almost all the cities that were founded or rebuilt from the first century BC, the Romans used a Greek-inspired Hippodamian orthogonal grid of streets.

Complutum was built in two main sections: an older one to the east, built in the 20–30s AD, where the &quot;insulae&quot; are rectangular, approximately 32 × 42 m, and another to the west, from the 60s AD, with square insulae of 32 × 32 m.

15 &quot;decumani&quot; and 16 &quot;cardines&quot; were traced, occupying an approximate area of 48 hectares that housed 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants in its heyday before the crisis of the 3rd century. The two main avenues, the &quot;cardo maximus&quot; and the &quot;decumanus maximus&quot;, intersected at the forum with the commercial areas, the main public and religious buildings, and the houses of the most important citizens.

The &quot;decumanus maximus&quot; is the most important street, because it was the road from Emerita Augusta (Mérida) and Toletum (Toledo) to CaesarAugusta (Zaragoza). Beside the road at the western gate was a fountain where nymphs and the goddess Diana were venerated, known today as Fuente del Juncal. At the southern end of the &quot;cardo maximus&quot;, on the banks of the Henares, another spring performed a similar function, the so-called &quot;de la Salud&quot;, in what was then a small river port.

===Forum complex===


The monumental forum complex of the 3rd century included a basilica, a curia, baths and two porticos with numerous shops (&quot;tabernae&quot;). It was built over an earlier forum and buildings from the 1st century.

A monumental façade adorned the forum, a high stone wall with large columns imitating the stage fronts of a theatre, covered in marble, topped with sculptures, and in the central opening a poetic inscription, a &quot;Carmen Epigraphicum&quot; (based on Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid) that commemorated the renovation of the forum at the end of the 3rd century. The &quot;cryptoporticus&quot; was built to raise the floor and provide a more impressive facade and monumental entrance to the curia. To build this it was also necessary to demolish the east wing of the quadriporticus which until then had stood beside the baths. It stands above an aqueduct that supplied the north baths and therefore lost its original function.

The basilica was one of the most important places in the city as courts of justice and office of commercial agreements. It was built in the 3rd century over an earlier basilica and the north baths. The building had a central nave with a surrounding corridor, separated by a row of columns.

The north baths of the 1st century were attached to the early basilica. The &quot;caldarium&quot; consisted of a large heated room with &quot;opus signinum&quot; floor over a hypocaust whose heat was produced in a &quot;praefurnium&quot; of two large ovens located to the south. An apse on the south side included a hot water pool above which windows made the most of the sun. At the end of the 3rd century the baths were transformed into the curia, the meeting place of the senate. The hypocaust heating system was preserved to serve the senate members.
The curia was where the Paredón del Milagro (miracle wall) was situated, an object of Christian worship throughout the centuries, since tradition places the martyrdom of Saints Justus and Pastor on this wall, although it was probably here that the sentence was passed but was executed in the Campo Laudable just outside Complutum.

The southern baths were built at this time to replace the north baths. They were smaller than the earlier baths but, to maximise their size, the Decumanus IV was built over. Their layout was of a simpler linear provincial type with a succession of four heated environments: first, facing north, the &quot;apodyterium&quot; (changing room), second the &quot;frigidarium&quot; with a cold pool, then the &quot;tepidarium&quot; and finally the &quot;caldarium&quot; to make the most of the sun. The heated hypocaust with &quot;praefurnium&quot; remains in place for the last two rooms.

===&quot;Auguraculum&quot;===

Located next to the forum, the &quot;auguraculum&quot; is an unusual public building: the &quot;collegium&quot; of the augurs (the priests who celebrate the rituals of divination and other purifying offerings), regulating religious lives of citizens and public activity.

The main hall had two offering wells and six small sacrifice reservoirs, each containing a ceramic jug and remains of one or more sacrificial animals (mostly chicken). In another room, another reservoir with a buried child was found and remains of weighing instruments and a statuette of Mercury, messenger of the gods and god of commerce.

===House of Griffins===
In the centre of the city is the House of the Griffins, built in the middle of the 1st century and in use until the 4th century, when it was destroyed by an accidental fire. It was one of the best &quot;domus&quot; in the city, with unusual comforts (a fireplace in room F and a water storage and distribution system). It had a large area (900 m²), with a large inner courtyard (99 m²) surrounded by a peristyle with twelve columns (two of them double) leading to a series of rooms. Wall paintings of all kinds have been found in them, among which some well-preserved ones stand out. Those on the west wall of room E, the &quot;tablinum&quot; of 48.6 m², the guests and clients reception room, are of the second Pompeian style, in fashion during Hadrian&#x27;s time (117-138). They represent a simulated architecture of 7.6 × 4.9 m with two Ionic columns on a plinth that imitates marble panels, among which an elaborate yellow plinth supporting a framed flower in its centre stands out.

Other frescos include panels with plants or candelabra, &quot;kraters&quot;, fountains, &quot;clipei&quot;, &quot;situlas&quot;, and cornucopias. In &quot;room D&quot; there is a floating human figure; in the south corridor a horseman in a hunting scene; and in room J a sun god, a triumphant swan (Jupiter metamorphosis), a naturalistic bird and the griffins that give the house its name. In the peristyle, wooden latticework and metal gates are imitated.

===House of Hippolytus===
Although known as the House of Hippolytus, it was in fact the headquarters of the Youth College and all the rooms were related to leisure. The largest room has a large mosaic with a fishing scene. The work is signed by Hippolytus, a master mosaicist of possibly North African origin (present-day Tunisia is the most feasible place) and was made for one of the most important families in the city.

===Other buildings===
Other buildings stand out for their wealth of mosaics, such as that of the four seasons from the House of Bacchus, House of Cupids and House of Leda. The House of Mars is an atrium house built for a family unit. The atrium was without columns and the &quot;impluvium&quot; in the centre collected rainwater and around it were situated all the rooms.

==Villa of El Val==

5 km to the east, in the village of El Val, was found a Roman villa. It is a large palatial complex with agricultural parts whose main use was breeding horses for chariot races (auriga). Themes related to chariot races were repeated in the ornamentation of its main buildings, both in mural painting and in mosaics. A large mosaic stands out in particular, &quot;The Victorious Charioteer&quot;, which occupied the large reception room of which some 90 m² have been recovered and restored. The mosaic is dated between late 3rd century to early 4th century AD. Its design is made up of a peripheral geometric design and a central emblem in which a charioteer is represented, with a winning gesture, on a horse-drawn chariot.

The villa was developed in three phases: it was built in the first century AD and it was remodeled during the late 3rd century to early 4th century. When Christianised in the 5th century a basilica and a necropolis were added.

It was discovered in 1970 during work on the site, when a large part of the remains were destroyed. It was situated on the Camino de los Afligidos, a route that coincided with the hypothetical Roman road to Caesaraugusta.

It extended over 500x150m. The palatial residence was arranged around a semicircular peristyle. There was a large reception room and a funerary mausoleum with a cruciform plan. To the north and west, the façades were completed with circular and rectangular towers. In the south were private baths and a basilica. The complex also housed workshops, warehouses and stables.

<text>Joanne Gignilliat Trimmier Woodward (born February 27, 1930) is an American retired actress. She made her career breakthrough in the 1950s and earned esteem and respect playing complex women with a characteristic nuance and depth of character. Her accolades include an Academy Award, three Primetime Emmy Awards, a British Academy Film Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She is the oldest living winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress at the age of 95. 

Woodward is perhaps best known for her performance as a woman with dissociative identity disorder in &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; (1957), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. She was until his death married to actor Paul Newman, with whom she often collaborated either as a co-star, or as an actor in films directed or produced by him. In 1990, Woodward earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Sarah Lawrence College at age 60, graduating alongside her daughter Clea.

==Early life==
Joanne Gignilliat Trimmier Woodward was born on February 27, 1930, in Thomasville, Georgia, the daughter of Elinor (&quot;née&quot; Trimmier) and Wade Woodward, Jr. Her middle names, &quot;Gignilliat Trimmier&quot;, are of Huguenot origin. She was influenced to become an actress by her mother&#x27;s love of film. Her mother named her after Joan Crawford. She has an older brother, Wade, Jr.

Attending the premiere of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in Atlanta, nine-year-old Woodward rushed into the parade of stars and sat on the lap of Laurence Olivier, star Vivien Leigh&#x27;s partner. She eventually worked with Olivier in 1977 in a television production of &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;. During rehearsals, she mentioned this incident to him, and he told her he remembered.

Woodward lived in Thomasville, then lived in Blakely and Thomaston before her family relocated to Marietta, Georgia, where she attended Marietta High School. She remains a supporter of Marietta High School and of the city&#x27;s Strand Theater.

The family moved once again to Greenville, South Carolina, when she was a junior in high school, after her parents divorced. She attended and graduated from Greenville High School. She also performed at Greenville&#x27;s Little Theater.

Woodward majored in drama at Louisiana State University, where she was an initiate of Chi Omega sorority, then headed to New York City to perform on the stage. There, she studied at the Actors Studio and also studied under Sanford Meisner in the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.

==Career==

===Early career===

In 1952, Woodward made her first television appearance on an episode of &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; entitled &quot;Penny.&quot; She also auditioned for roles on the stage, becoming an understudy during the run of the William Inge drama &quot;Picnic&quot; in 1953–1954. It was there that she met her future husband Paul Newman, although at that time he was still married to his first wife Jacqueline Witte.
In 1960, she costarred with Marlon Brando &amp; Anna Magnani in &quot;The Fugitive Kind.&quot;

Woodward appeared in many other TV drama shows such as &quot;Tales of Tomorrow,&quot; &quot;Goodyear Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;You Are There&quot;, &quot;The Web&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Elgin Hour&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Star and the Story&quot;, &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;Star Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Ponds Theater&quot;.

Woodward&#x27;s first feature film was a post-Civil War Western, &quot;Count Three and Pray&quot; (1955). Woodward was billed second, and played a strong-willed orphan. She was signed to a long-term contract by 20th Century Fox in January 1956. For her next role, she starred in &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; (1956) as an heiress pursued by a college student (Robert Wagner) who will stop at nothing to win her over.

Woodward&#x27;s career included TV, stage and feature film acting. In 1956 she returned to Broadway to star in &quot;The Lovers.&quot; It had only a brief run (but was later filmed as &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965)). She also appeared on television drama shows including &quot;Philco Playhouse, The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;Climax&quot;.

=== Film stardom ===

In 1957, Woodward astounded audiences and critics alike with her performance in &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;. She portrayed a woman with three distinct personalities — a southern housewife, a sexually voracious &#x27;bad girl,&#x27; and a normal young woman — and gave each their own unique voices and gestures. For her work on the film, Woodward won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a dress she sewed herself, the only Best Actress winner to date to do so. 

With Woodward&#x27;s credentials as a star attraction established, Fox gave her top billing in &quot;No Down Payment&quot; (1957), directed by Martin Ritt and produced by Jerry Wald. She was re-united with Ritt on another Faulkner adaptation, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1959), with Yul Brynner. Sidney Lumet cast Woodward alongside Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani in &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; (1960), a box office disappointment. More popular was a third film with Newman, &quot;From the Terrace&quot; (1960), which Woodward later admitted to having &quot;affection&quot; for &quot;because of the way I looked like Lana Turner&quot;. The couple then made &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961) with Ritt. For her title role in &quot;The Stripper&quot; (1963), Joanne was coached in technique by burlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1966, she appeared as Mary in &quot;A Big Hand for the Little Lady,&quot; and starred alongside Sean Connery in &quot;A Fine Madness&quot;. In &quot;Rachel Rachel&quot; (1968), produced and directed by Newman, Woodward played a schoolteacher hoping for love. This film won her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

In 1972, Woodward starred in &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.&quot; For this performance as a single mother challenged by her daughters (one of them played by her actual daughter, Nell), she won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. She then starred in the mid-life crisis drama &quot;Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams&quot; (1973), written by Stewart Stern, for which she received another Oscar nomination for Best Actress.

Woodward was to have co-starred with Robert Shaw in Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; at Lincoln Center in 1974, but withdrew from the production during rehearsals. &quot;New York puts a pressure on you that I don&#x27;t react well to, with the critics and all that,&quot; she later said. &quot;I like to act in a relaxed atmosphere.&quot;

Woodward supported Burt Reynolds in &quot;The End&quot; (1978), and as the 70s progressed did more television drama. She did &quot;A Christmas to Remember&quot; (1979) on TV. The decade ended with &quot;The Streets of L.A.&quot; (1979). Woodward also directed an episode of &quot;Family&quot; in 1979. For TV, she appeared in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; (1977) with Laurence Olivier, and &quot;See How She Runs&quot; (1978). The latter won her an Emmy.

Woodward&#x27;s credits in the 1980s included &quot;The Shadow Box&quot; (1980), directed by Newman, and &quot;Crisis at Central High&quot; (1981) for TV. She also returned to Broadway for &quot;Candida&quot; (1981–1982), a production directed by Michael Cristofer that was filmed in 1982. She starred in &quot;Harry &amp; Son&quot; (1984), again directed by and co-starring Newman, and some television films, &quot;Passions&quot; (1984) and &quot;Do You Remember Love&quot; (1985). Woodward also did some screenwriting and direction at this time, for instance writing and directing a 1982 production of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s story &quot;Come Along with Me;&quot; and starred in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1987).

Woodward also found critical success on the small screen. She won Emmy Awards for her work as an actress on &quot;See How She Runs&quot; (1978) and &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; (1985). As a producer, she won another Emmy for &quot;Broadway&#x27;s dreamers: The Legacy of the Group Theater&quot; in 1990. Woodward also returned to TV to do &quot;The 80 Yard Run&quot; for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

=== Partnership with Paul Newman ===

Woodward met Paul Newman on the set of the stage drama &quot;Picnic&quot;, in the early 1950s, and the two married on January 29, 1958, after his divorce from his first wife Jacqueline Witte was finalized. Woodward was soon an Academy Award winner, winning her Oscar on March 28. Although he was nominated many times, Newman did not achieve a win until 1986. Woodward and Newman worked together on many projects, including films where they costarred, or where he was the director or producer.
Woodward and Newman appeared in many films together during the 1950s and &#x27;60s. The first was &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; (1958), followed by &quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag, Boys!&quot; (1958), &quot;From the Terrace&quot; (1960), &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961), and &quot;A New Kind of Love&quot; (1963). They returned to Broadway in &quot;Baby Want a Kiss&quot; (1964), which ran for more than a hundred performances. Woodward was also directed by her husband in many projects. The first of these was Newman&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; (1968). Husband and wife both earned Golden Globe Awards and Oscar nominations. They also acted together in &quot;Winning&quot; (1969), &quot;WUSA&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; (1975). Woodward also collaborated with her daughters, appearing with Nell in &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot; (1972), which was directed by Paul Newman, and with Melissa in the TV movie &quot;See How She Runs&quot; (1978).

Only two months after their wedding, Woodward won her first Academy Award. Newman got his first nomination later that year, 1958, for &quot;Cat On a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. Both at the top of their game as film stars, Woodward and Newman became a celebrity power couple and were featured in countless magazines and articles for the next fifty years. Woodward&#x27;s family life, she felt, deepened at the expense of her film career. She later said:Initially, I probably had a real movie-star dream. It faded somewhere in my mid-30s, when I realized I wasn&#x27;t going to be that kind of actor. It was painful. Also, I curtailed my career because of my children. Quite a bit. I resented it at the time, which was not a good way to be around the children. Paul was away on location a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t go on location because of the children. I did once, and felt overwhelmed with guilt. Woodward&#x27;s final screen performance with Newman (and last appearance to date, excluding voiceover roles) was in the 2005 cable miniseries &quot;Empire Falls&quot;.

=== Later years ===
In 1990, Woodward again appeared opposite Newman in &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot; (1990), directed by James Ivory. Woodward had read this, the first of Evan S. Connell&#x27;s two novels, when it was published in 1959. She hoped for many years to adapt it into a television production. Originally, she did not intend to play the character of Mrs. Bridge because she was too young. By the late 1980s, that was no longer the case. One of her most acclaimed performances, she garnered her fourth Academy Award nomination, and was selected as the year&#x27;s Best Actress at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards.

In 1993, Woodward appeared in the film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, with Tom Hanks, and, in the same year, narrated Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. Woodward did two additional television films: &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; (1993) and &quot;Blind Spot&quot; (1993). Woodward was a co-producer of &quot;Blind Spot&quot;, a drama about drug addiction, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress – Mini-Series or a Movie. She co-starred in the television film &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot; (1995). Also in 1995, Woodward directed off-Broadway revivals of Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Golden Boy&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; at the Blue Light Theater Company in New York.

In the twenty-first century, Woodward moved more into production and directorial roles. She served as the artistic director of the Westport Country Playhouse from 2001 to 2005. She was executive producer of the 2003 television production of &quot;Our Town&quot;, featuring Newman as the stage manager (for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award). She and Newman also appeared in &quot;Empire Falls&quot; (2005) for TV. Woodward also recorded a reading of singer John Mellencamp&#x27;s song &quot;The Real Life&quot; for his box set &quot;On the Rural Route 7609&quot;.

Woodward had the lead in &quot;Change in the Wind&quot; (2010). In 2011, she narrated the Scholastic/Weston Woods film &quot;All the World&quot;.

In 2022, Woodward and Newman were the subject of a six-part documentary by Ethan Hawke, &quot;The Last Movie Stars&quot;, which premiered on HBO Max.

==Personal life==
Woodward was reported to have been engaged to author Gore Vidal before she married Paul Newman. However, there was no real engagement; Woodward claims that she was a &quot;beard&quot; for Vidal, who was gay. Woodward shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles for a short time, and they remained friends.

Woodward first met Newman at their agent&#x27;s office. They were both understudies for the play &quot;Picnic&quot; in 1953. In the midst of this they starred in &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; in 1957. Newman divorced his wife Jackie Witte, with whom he already had three children, and married Woodward on January 29, 1958, in Las Vegas. On March 28 of the same year, Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;. The couple remained married for 50 years until Newman&#x27;s death from lung cancer on September 26, 2008. Woodward has said: &quot;He&#x27;s very good-looking and very sexy and all of those things but all that goes out the window finally, and what finally is left is if you can make somebody laugh. And he sure does keep me laughing.&quot; Newman attributed their relationship success to &quot;some combination of lust and respect and patience. And determination.&quot;
When Paul Newman was asked, in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, how he remained faithful to Woodward, Newman responded, &quot;I have steak at home; why go out for hamburger?&quot;

Woodward has three daughters with Newman: Elinor Teresa &quot;Nell&quot; (1959), Melissa Stewart (1961), and Claire Olivia &quot;Clea&quot; (1965).

She took up ballet in her thirties as a way to stay in shape, eventually going en pointe.

Woodward and Newman were mentors to Allison Janney, whom they had met when Janney, a Kenyon College freshman, was cast in a play that Newman directed. Janney acknowledged this support in a 2018 speech.

Woodward and Newman were active supporters of the Democratic Party. They were conspicuous supporters of Senator Eugene McCarthy in his unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign, attending a benefit for his campaign at Arthur&#x27;s Restaurant on April 1, 1968. Documents declassified in 2017 show that the National Security Agency had created a biographical file on Woodward as part of its monitoring of prominent US citizens whose names appeared in signals intelligence.

In 1988, Newman and Woodward established the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a nonprofit residential summer camp, and year-round center named after the Wyoming mountain hideaway of the outlaws in Newman&#x27;s film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. The camp, located in Ashford, Connecticut, provides free services to 20,000 children and their families coping with cancer and other serious illnesses. In 2012, their daughter Clea Newman took charge of the camp&#x27;s parent organization, the SeriousFun Children&#x27;s Network.

In 1990, after working toward her bachelor&#x27;s degree for more than 10 years, Woodward graduated from Sarah Lawrence College along with her daughter Clea. Paul Newman delivered the commencement address, during which he said he dreamed that a woman had asked, &quot;How dare you accept this invitation to give the commencement address when you are merely hanging on to the coattails of the accomplishments of your wife?&quot; In 1992, along with Newman, Woodward was awarded the Kennedy Center honors for lifetime achievement.

Woodward, widowed since 2008, lived for many years in Westport, Connecticut, where she and Newman raised their daughters. She retreated from public life following a diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2007. She relocated to Santa Monica, California to be near her daughters following her diagnosis. Woodward last publicly appeared in 2013.

In 1958, Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;. In 1960, she won the Silver Shell for Best Actress at the San Sebastián International Film Festival for her work on &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; . She was nominated for Best Actress in 1969 for &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot;; in 1974 for &quot;Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams&quot;; and in 1991 for &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot;. She was named Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974 for her performance in &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;.

Woodward won 2 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie: for &quot;See How She Runs&quot; as a divorced teacher who trains for a marathon; and in &quot;Do You Remember Love&quot; as a professor who begins to suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She has been nominated an additional 5 times for her roles on tv.

A popular (but untrue) bit of Hollywood lore is that Woodward was the first celebrity to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In fact, the original 1,550 stars were created and installed as a unit in 1960; no one star was officially &quot;first&quot;. The first star actually completed was director Stanley Kramer&#x27;s. The origin of this legend is not known with certainty, but according to Johnny Grant, the long-time Honorary Mayor of Hollywood, Woodward was the first celebrity to agree to pose with her star for photographers, and therefore was singled out in the collective public imagination as the first awardee.

In 1994, Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman were jointly presented the Award for Outstanding Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

<text>The Three Faces of Eve is a 1957 American drama film presented in CinemaScope, based on the book of the same name about the life of Chris Costner Sizemore, which was written by psychiatrists Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley, who also helped write the screenplay. Sizemore, referred to by Thigpen and Cleckley as Eve White, was a woman they suggested might have dissociative identity disorder (then known as multiple personality disorder). Sizemore&#x27;s identity was concealed in interviews about this film and was not revealed to the public until 1977. The film was directed by Nunnally Johnson.

Joanne Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first actress to win an Oscar for portraying three personalities (Eve White, Eve Black, and Jane). &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; also became the first film since 1936—when Bette Davis won for &quot;Dangerous&quot; (1935)—to win the Best Actress award without getting nominated in any other category.

==Plot==
In 1951, Eve White is a timid, self-effacing wife and mother who has severe and blinding headaches and occasional blackouts. Eve eventually goes to see psychiatrist Dr. Luther, and while having a conversation, a &quot;new personality&quot;, the wild, fun-loving Eve Black, emerges. Eve Black knows everything about Eve White, but Eve White is unaware of Eve Black.

Eve White is sent to a hospital for observation after Eve Black is found strangling Eve White&#x27;s daughter, Bonnie. When Eve White is released, her husband Ralph finds a job in another state and leaves her in a boarding house, while Bonnie stays with Eve&#x27;s parents. When Ralph returns, he tells her that he doesn&#x27;t believe she has multiple personalities and tries to take her to Jacksonville, Florida, with him but she feels she isn&#x27;t well enough to leave, and, afraid Eve Black will try to harm Bonnie again, refuses to go. Eve Black confronts Ralph at his motel, where he realizes Eve Black is real, but allows her to convince him to take her to Jacksonville. When Eve Black goes out dancing with another man, Ralph slaps her when she returns and ends up divorcing Eve White.

Dr. Luther considers both Eve White and Eve Black to be incomplete and inadequate personalities. The film depicts Dr. Luther&#x27;s attempts to understand and deal with these two faces of Eve. Under hypnosis at one session, a third personality emerges, a relatively stable woman but with no name and little memory of her past. She chooses to take the name Jane. Dr. Luther eventually prompts her to remember a traumatic event in Eve&#x27;s childhood. Her grandmother had died when she was six, and according to family custom, relatives were supposed to kiss the dead person at the viewing, making it easier for them to let go. While Eve screams, her mother forces her to kiss the corpse. Apparently, Eve&#x27;s terror led to the creation of different personalities.

After discovering the trauma, Jane remembers her entire past. When Dr. Luther asks to speak with Eve White and Eve Black, Jane says they are gone. Jane marries a man named Earl whom she met when she was Jane and reunites with her daughter Bonnie.

==Cast==
* Joanne Woodward as Eve White/Eve Black/Jane
** Mimi Gibson as Eve - Age 8
* David Wayne as Ralph White
* Lee J. Cobb as Doctor Curtis Luther
* Edwin Jerome as Doctor Francis Day
* Alena Murray as Secretary
* Nancy Kulp as Mrs. Black
* Douglas Spencer as Mr. Black
* Terry Ann Ross as Bonnie White
* Ken Scott as Earl
* Alistair Cooke as the narrator of the film

==Original book==
The book by Thigpen and Cleckley was rushed into publication, and the film rights were immediately sold to director Nunnally Johnson in 1957, apparently to capitalize on public interest in multiple personalities following the publication of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Nest,&quot; which was also made into a film in 1957 titled &quot;Lizzie&quot;.

===The real Eve===
Chris Costner Sizemore has written at some length about her experiences as the real &quot;Eve&quot;. In her 1958 book &quot;The Final Face of Eve&quot;, she used the pseudonym Evelyn Lancaster. In her 1977 book &quot;I&#x27;m Eve&quot;, she revealed her true identity. She also wrote a follow-up book, &quot;A Mind of My Own&quot; (1989).

==Reception==
Critics uniformly praised Joanne Woodward&#x27;s performance, but opinions of other aspects of the film were more mixed. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Woodward played her part &quot;with superlative flexibility and emotional power&quot;, but that &quot;when you come right down to it, this is simply a melodramatic exercise—an exhibition of psychiatric hocus-pocus, without any indication of how or why. It makes for a fairly fetching mystery, although it is too verbose and too long.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;frequently an intriguing and provocative motion picture&quot; and that Woodward &quot;fulfills her assignment excellently&quot;, but believed that the comedy elements &quot;will undoubtedly confuse many viewers who won&#x27;t quite be sure what emotions are suitable&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;a fascinating adult drama&quot; and said that Woodward&#x27;s performance was &quot;of Academy Award caliber&quot;. John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Woodward &quot;does well in a role that is inevitably full of confusion&quot;, but the film &quot;seems rather fantastic when it depicts the heroine going through her mental gyrations at top speed&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; agreed, writing that Woodward &quot;manages the triple role cleverly&quot;, but found that the depiction of psychiatric treatment &quot;all looks a good deal too easy, and in spite of Alistair Cooke&#x27;s introductory assurances of authenticity one is always conscious of being given the case history in capsule form&quot;.

The film holds a score of 94% on the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.

==Accolades==
Joanne Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and later went on to play Dr. Cornelia Wilbur in the film &quot;Sybil&quot; (1976), which was a reversal of roles for Woodward. In &quot;Sybil&quot;, she played the psychiatrist who diagnosed Sybil Dorsett (played by Sally Field, who subsequently won an Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal) with multiple personality disorder and subsequently led her through treatment.

<doc id="193847" wikidata="Q1196849" url="?curid=193847" title="Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison">
<text>Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison is a 1957 American CinemaScope war film directed by John Huston. It stars Deborah Kerr as an Irish nun and Robert Mitchum as a U.S. Marine, both stranded on a Japanese-occupied island in the Pacific Ocean during World War II.

The film was adapted by John Huston and John Lee Mahin from the 1952 novel by Charles Shaw and was directed by Huston. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Deborah Kerr) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.

The movie was filmed on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago in what was then the British West Indies. Producer Eugene Frenke later filmed &quot;The Nun and the Sergeant&quot;, a low-budget variation on the story, (1962), starring his wife Anna Sten.

==Plot==
In the South Pacific in 1944, U.S. Marine Corporal Allison and his reconnaissance party are disembarking from a U.S. Navy submarine when they are discovered and fired upon by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). The submarine&#x27;s captain is forced to dive and leave the scouting team behind. Allison reaches a rubber raft and, after days adrift, reaches an island. He finds an abandoned settlement and a chapel with one occupant: Sister Angela, a novice Irish nun who has not yet taken her final vows. She has been on the island for only four days, having come with an elderly priest to evacuate another clergyman only to find that the Japanese had arrived first. The frightened natives who had brought them to the island left the pair without warning, and the priest died soon after.

For a while, they have the island to themselves, but then a detachment of Japanese troops arrives to set up a meteorological camp, forcing them to hide in a cave. When Sister Angela is unable to stomach the raw fish that Allison has caught, he sneaks into the Japanese camp for supplies, narrowly avoiding detection. That night, they watch flashes from naval guns being fired in a sea battle over the horizon.

The Japanese unexpectedly leave the island and Allison professes his love for Sister Angela, proposing marriage. But she shows him her engagement ring and explains that it is a symbol of her forthcoming final holy vows. Later both in celebration and frustration, Allison gets drunk on sake. He blurts out that he considers her devotion to her vows to be pointless since they are stuck on the island &quot;like Adam and Eve.&quot; She runs out into a tropical rain and falls ill as a result. Allison, now sober and contrite, finds her shivering. He carries her back, but the Japanese have returned, forcing them to retreat to the cave. Allison sneaks into the Japanese camp to get blankets. He kills a soldier who discovers him, alerting the enemy. To force him into the open, the Japanese set fire to the vegetation.

When a Japanese soldier discovers the cave, Allison and Sister Angela have two options: surrender or die from a hand grenade thrown inside. An ensuing explosion is not a grenade, but a bomb; the Americans have begun attacking the island in preparation for a landing. Allison comments that the landing will not be easy because when they returned, the Japanese brought four artillery pieces and concealed them well on the island.

Responding to what he attributes to a message from God, Allison disables the artillery during the barrage that will precede the American assault while the Japanese are still in their bunkers. He is wounded but sabotages all the guns by removing their breechblocks, saving many American lives. After the landing, the Marine officers are puzzled by the missing breechblocks.

Sister Angela and the wounded Allison then say their goodbyes as the Marines begin occupation. Allison has reconciled himself to Sister Angela&#x27;s dedication to Jesus, but she reassures him that they will always be close &quot;companions.&quot; After being found, Allison is transferred by the Marines to the ship, with Sister Angela walking beside him.

==Cast==
==Production==
John Lee Mahin, who wrote the script, called the original novel &quot;a very dirty book&quot; and claims producer Gene Frenke kept pushing for more sex to be added. However this was resisted by Mahin and John Huston.

Filming took place in Trinidad and Tobago, allowing Huston and Fox to use blocked funds in the UK, receive British film finance and qualify for the Eady Levy. The film was set later in the war than it was in the novel, which had Allison escaping from the Battle of Corregidor. In the film, the Allies are on the offensive and U.S. Marines capture the island.

The screenplay compares the rituals and commitment of the Catholic Church and the United States Marine Corps. The National Legion of Decency monitored the production of the film closely, sending a representative to watch the filming; Kerr and Mitchum ad-libbed a scene (not included in the final print) in which their characters wildly kissed and grabbed at each other.

The Marines provided troops for the invasion climax. Six Japanese persons living in Brazil played some of the leading Japanese characters, and Chinese people from some of the laundries and restaurants of Trinidad and Tobago played the rest of the Japanese soldiers.

Screen Archives Entertainment released &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; on Blu-ray on June 10, 2014.

==Reception==
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot;, the film was &quot;in the money&quot; at the British box office in 1957.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic wrote, &quot;Both stars&#x27; performances are excellent. However, I fail to see why Miss Kerr was hampered by the necessity to assume a brogue, which doesn&#x27;t come naturally. Mr. Mitchum has the edge on her as far as being well cast, and will, I think, be most believeable to the average audience, altho I doubt that any veteran Marine would stand out and do a jig under shellfire—even if it comes from the guns of the United States Navy as a prelude to a welcome American invasion. The film, in script and direction, was obviously aimed at mass audience appeal. That it probably will have.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; was complimentary: &quot;That frequent and often popular story of a pious woman and an impious man cast together in circumstances that test the righteousness and fiber of each is tackled again by John Huston (he tackled it last in &quot;The African Queen&quot;)...And once more, Mr. Huston comes up with a film that is stirring and entertaining...with Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum in the leading roles—indeed, the only real roles in the picture—he has got it buckled to solid characters...If there does seem to be some repetition, that is something that has to be blamed on the singleness of the location and the meagerness of the cast. There are not many variations to be wrung from the situation. However, the location is exciting...and it is drenched with atmosphere. And the cast, while small, is excellent.&quot;

<text>Raintree County is a novel by Ross Lockridge Jr. published in 1948. It tells the story of a small-town Midwestern teacher and poet named John Shawnessy, who, in his younger days before his service as a Union soldier in the Civil War, met and married a beautiful Southern belle; however, her emotional instability leads to the destruction of their marriage.

==Structure==

The novel, set in fictional Raintree County, Indiana, is essentially in two parts; before the Civil War and after. It spans the 19th century history of the United States, from the pre-Civil War westward expansion, to the debate over slavery, to the Civil War, to the Industrial Revolution and the Labor Movement which followed. The book is often surreal, with dream sequences, flashbacks and departures from the linear narrative. It has been described as an effort to mythologize the history of America, which to a great degree it succeeds in doing through the eyes and the commentary of John Shawnessy. For example, a number of turning points in John&#x27;s life seem to coincide with Fourth of July celebrations.

John, or &#x27;Johnny&#x27;, as he was called before The War, is a lover of literature, and is influenced by three separate cultural icons: the concept of becoming a Hero, in the sense of the legendary figures of ancient Greece; Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, in which legend predicts that a great man will appear whose face is identical to the natural stone face which, in the Hawthorne story, is a local landmark; and finally, the quest to find the legendary Golden Raintree, for which the county was named, and which was supposedly planted somewhere in the county by John Chapman, or Johnny Appleseed as he was more commonly known. Johnny Shawnessy tends to view the events of his life through the prism of one or more of these contexts, and to draw parallels to these legends, frequently with considerable justification.

On Johnny&#x27;s return from the war, he learns that he has been reported as killed in action, and that the love of his life, believing him dead, has married his longtime friend and rival, and has died in childbirth.

John, as he is now known, has to set about building a new life. He becomes a teacher, runs unsuccessfully for political office, moves briefly to New York to try to become a playwright, and finally comes back home to Indiana, where he remarries. Although he finds contentment in his marriage, he encounters various other personal difficulties, and is a first-hand observer to a number of historical turning points.

It is a long novel, around 400,000 words. Most editions run to about 1000 pages.

The fictional town of Waycross was based on Straughn, Indiana and the fictional Raintree County was based on Henry County, Indiana.

==The film==

The novel was made into a 1957 film starring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Eva Marie Saint, Nigel Patrick, Lee Marvin, Rod Taylor and Agnes Moorehead. It was adapted by Millard Kaufman and directed by Edward Dmytryk.
The film varies significantly in content from the novel.

<text>I Want to Live! is a 1958 American independent biographical film noir drama film directed by Robert Wise, and starring Susan Hayward, Simon Oakland, Virginia Vincent, and Theodore Bikel. It follows the life of Barbara Graham, a prostitute and habitual criminal, who is convicted of murder and faces capital punishment. The screenplay, written by Nelson Gidding and Don Mankiewicz, was adapted from personal letters written by Graham, in addition to newspaper articles written by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ed Montgomery in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. The film presents a highly fictionalized version of the case, indicating the possibility that Graham may have been innocent.

Released in late 1958, &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; was a commercial and critical success, garnering favorable reviews from critics for Hayward&#x27;s performance, as well as the film&#x27;s realistic depiction of capital punishment. The film earned a total of six Academy Award nominations, with Hayward winning a Best Actress Oscar at the 31st Academy Awards as well as the Golden Globe Award in the same category.

==Plot==
In 1950 San Francisco, petty criminal and prostitute Barbara Graham faces a misdemeanor charge for soliciting sex. She returns to her native San Diego, but is soon charged with perjury after she provides two criminal friends a false alibi. She subsequently returns to prostitution and other criminal activities to make a living and begins working for thief Emmett Perkins by luring men to his gambling parlor. Barbara manages to earn a significant amount of money, and quits working for Emmett to marry Hank, her third husband. The couple have a son, Bobby, but their marriage is in turmoil because of Hank&#x27;s heroin addiction and physical abuse.

Barbara forces Hank to leave, but she is soon evicted from her apartment. Desperate, she leaves Bobby in the care of her mother and returns to working for Emmett, who is now associated with thugs John Santo and Bruce King. Police crack down on the operation and Barbara surrenders. During the interrogation, she is stunned when authorities accuse her of helping Perkins and Santo murder Mabel Monohan, an elderly Burbank woman. Barbara insists that she was home with her husband and son on the night of the murder but is indicted by a grand jury. Barbara&#x27;s childhood friend Peg visits her in jail and agrees to help care for Bobby.

Attorney Richard Tibrow is assigned to Barbara&#x27;s case and informs her that her alibi is meaningless unless Hank can corroborate it. Barbara furtively concocts a phony alibi with Ben Miranda, supposedly a friend of a fellow prisoner. At the trial, it is revealed that Ben is a police officer who recorded her confession with a hidden microphone during their meeting. Barbara insists that she sought the false alibi only to avoid the death penalty, and that her admission is false. She is ultimately convicted, along with Emmett and John, and all three are sentenced to death.

Tibrow withdraws from Barbara&#x27;s case and is replaced by Al Matthews. In prison, Barbara is relentlessly defiant, refusing to wear her uniform and demanding a radio. Matthews has psychologist Carl Palmberg evaluate Barbara, hoping to ultimately administer a lie detection test. After visiting with her, Carl states that while Barbara appears to be amoral, she is averse to violence. He also observes that she is left-handed, and the murder was committed by a right-handed person. Journalist Edward Montgomery, who has covered Barbara&#x27;s case all along, questions her conviction and publishes a sympathetic series of articles describing her troubled life. As her execution date draws near, Barbara grows increasingly anxious. A Supreme Court stay gives her hope that her sentence may be commuted, but it is overturned when Carl dies unexpectedly of heart disease. Al&#x27;s petition for a retrial is denied, and Barbara&#x27;s execution date is set.

The day before her execution, a demoralized Barbara is transferred to San Quentin Prison, where she meets with a priest. That evening, she is angered to hear that multiple couples are seeking to adopt her son. She stays awake all night, wistfully recounting to a prison nurse her marriage with Hank. In the morning, 45 minutes before Barbara&#x27;s scheduled execution, California governor Goodwin J. Knight declares a stay, but her attorney Al&#x27;s writ is invalidated and the execution is ordered to proceed. Barbara is taken to the gas chamber, but the execution is again halted when Al&#x27;s amended writ is declared.

The uncertainty and desperation surrounding her fate reduces Barbara to hysterics. She is returned to her cell, where she and the prison staff wait several minutes for a response to Al&#x27;s writ. They are informed that it has again been rejected and that Barbara&#x27;s execution is to proceed immediately. Before entering the gas chamber, Barbara demands a mask, as she does not want to see the faces of the witnesses to what she regards as her murder. She is strapped to the chair and executed with cyanide gas. After Barbara is pronounced dead, a despondent Edward Montgomery leaves the prison. On his way out, he is met by Al, who gives him a note from Barbara thanking him for his efforts to help her.

==Accuracy==
According to historian Kathleen Cairns, &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; &quot;implied that Graham&#x27;s guilt or innocence was largely irrelevant, that the real crime was committed by a justice system that framed her and a media that abetted the effort... In reality, the film took liberty with many facts of the case.&quot; The film also suggests that Graham, though believed to have sociopathic tendencies in real life, was dangerous only to herself as a result of her loveless childhood and abusive mother.

A prologue and epilogue contributed to the film by Edward Montgomery, the journalist who covered Graham&#x27;s case for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, characterize the film&#x27;s content, which largely portrays Graham as innocent of the murder, as factual. However, there may have been substantial evidence of Graham&#x27;s complicity in the crime, including her taped confession to an undercover officer. In an interview with Robert Osborne, Susan Hayward admitted that her research on the evidence and letters in the case led her to believe that Graham was guilty.

Despite some of the liberties taken with Graham&#x27;s story, the film&#x27;s depiction of the California gas chamber was regarded as accurate.

==Production==
===Development===
The film&#x27;s screenplay was originally written by Don Mankiewicz based on letters by convicted murderer Barbara Graham, who was executed in 1955, and a series of articles by journalist Edward S. Montgomery. In early 1958, after a draft of the screenplay was completed, Nelson Gidding was commissioned to write a redraft and tighten the narrative as it &quot;lacked focus&quot; and contained too many pages concentrating on Graham&#x27;s troubled childhood. Gidding&#x27;s redraft omitted any depiction of the murder of Mable Monohan as well as Graham&#x27;s months spent at San Quentin State Prison during her appeals.

===Casting===
When questioned about taking the controversial role, Susan Hayward said: &quot;I just had to play her. If I hadn&#x27;t thought they should make [the film], I wouldn&#x27;t have played the part.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography began in March 1958. Production was stopped after Hayward contracted measles.

To ensure that the execution sequence was depicted as accurately as possible, Wise attended a public execution at San Quentin. Hayward commented after completing filming that her simulated experience of execution convinced her that the practice was &quot;medieval.&quot;

===Musical score===

In addition to Mandel&#x27;s score, the film features jazz themes performed by Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s combo. Two soundtrack albums were released by United Artists Records in 1958.

==Release==
===Box office===
Although some sources state that the film grossed $3.5 million, the Walter Wanger biography &quot;Walter Wanger, Hollywood Independent&quot; indicated that the film grossed $5,641,711, with a net profit of $2,455,570. Hayward was entitled to 37% of the film&#x27;s overall profit.

===Critical response===

Upon release, &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; was met with a largely favorable critical response, with many critics heralding the film as an &quot;indictment against capital punishment,&quot; citing its clinical, harrowing depiction of execution. Producer Walter Wanger received numerous congratulatory letters praising the film after its release, including those from writers Arthur Miller, Paddy Chayefsky, Leon Uris and Albert Camus, all of whom were ardent opponents of capital punishment.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine published a favorable review: &quot;There is no attempt to gloss the character of Barbara Graham, only an effort to understand it through some fine irony and pathos. She had no hesitation about indulging in any form of crime or vice that promised excitement on her own, rather mean, terms ... Hayward brings off this complex characterization. Simon Oakland, as Montgomery, who first crucified Barbara Graham in print and then attempted to undo what he had done, underplays his role with assurance.&quot;

Film critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Miss Hayward plays it superbly, under the consistently sharp direction of Robert Wise, who has shown here a stunning mastery of the staccato realistic style. From a loose and wise-cracking B-girl she moves onto levels of cold disdain and then plunges down to depths of terror and bleak surrender as she reaches the end. Except that the role does not present us a precisely pretty character, its performance merits for Miss Hayward the most respectful applause.&quot;

Gene Blake, the reporter who covered the actual murder trial for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Mirror&quot;, called the film &quot;a dramatic and eloquent piece of propaganda for the abolition of the death penalty.&quot;

By March 1959, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that the popularity of the film and of Mandel&#x27;s and Mulligan&#x27;s albums &quot;prompted a rush of jazz film scores&quot; and cited as examples Duke Ellington&#x27;s score for &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;, the release of &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; (a biopic about the jazz band leader Red Nichols) and the 1960 documentary &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;.

In a 1993 reappraisal, film critic Danny Peary wrote that Hayward is &quot;...the actress of that era [the 1940s and &#x27;50s] who most needs rediscovery, and the best film to start with is &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;.&quot;

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 94% approval rating based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10.

===Awards and honors===
===Home media===
MGM Home Entertainment released &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; on DVD on May 7, 2002. Kino Lorber reissued the film on DVD featuring a restored print in October 2015. In November 2016, Twilight Time released the film on Blu-ray disc in a limited edition of 3,000 units.

==Adaptation==
&quot;I Want to Live!&quot; was remade for television in 1983. The television film features Lindsay Wagner, Martin Balsam, Pamela Reed, Harry Dean Stanton, Dana Elcar, Ellen Geer, Robert Ginty and Barry Primus.

<text>Alphabet City is a neighborhood located within the East Village in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Its name comes from Avenues A, B, C, and D, the only avenues in Manhattan to have single-letter names. It is bounded by Houston Street to the south and 14th Street to the north, and extends roughly from Avenue A to the East River. Some famous landmarks include Tompkins Square Park, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the Charlie Parker Residence.

The neighborhood has a long history, serving as a cultural center and ethnic enclave for Manhattan&#x27;s German, Polish, Hispanic, and immigrants of Jewish descent. However, there is much dispute over the borders of the Lower East Side, Alphabet City, and East Village. Historically, Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side was 14th Street at the northern end, bound on the east by East River and on the west by First Avenue; today, that same area is Alphabet City. The area&#x27;s German presence in the early 20th century, in decline, virtually ended after the &quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster in 1904.

Alphabet City is part of Manhattan Community District 3 and its primary ZIP Code is 10009. It is patrolled by the 9th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Etymology==
The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which laid out the grid scheme of Manhattan above Houston Street, designated 16 north-south &quot;avenues.&quot; Twelve numbered avenues were to run continuously to Harlem, while four lettered ones—A, B, C and D—appeared intermittently wherever the island widened east of First Avenue. The plan called for stretches of Avenue A and Avenue B north of midtown, all of which have been renamed. In 1943, Avenue A went as far north as 25th Street, Avenue B ended at 21st Street and Avenue C reached 18th Street. Stuyvesant Town, a post–World War II private residential development, blotted out the rest of A and B above 14th Street (sparing only a few blocks of Avenue C). What remained of 1811&#x27;s lettered avenues came to be called, by some, Alphabet City.

There is disagreement about the earliest uses of the name. It is often characterized as a marketing invention of realtors and other gentrifiers who arrived in the 1980s. However, sociologist Christopher Mele connects the term to the arts scene of the late 1970s which in turn attracted real estate investors. As such, argues Mele, Alphabet City and its many variants—Alphaville, Alphabetland, etc.—were &quot;playful&quot; but also &quot;concealed the area&#x27;s rampant physical and social decline and downplayed the area’s Latino identity.&quot; Pete Hamill, a longtime New York City journalist, cites darker origins. NYPD officers, he claims, referred to the most degraded areas east of Avenue B as Alphabet City in the 1950s.

Whatever its origins, the name began to appear in print around 1980 with all three associations—crime, art, and gentrification. A December 1980 article in the &quot;Daily News&quot; reported on the eastward flow of gentrification:

&quot;The Official Preppy Handbook&quot;, published in October 1980, caricatured a subgroup of preppies as &quot;connoisseurs of punk ... who spend their weekends in alphabet city (Avenues A, B, C, and D) on the Lower East Side.&quot; Similarly, a November 1984 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;Younger artists ... are moving downtown to an area variously referred to as Alphabetland, Alphabetville, or Alphabet City (Avenues A, B, C and so forth on the Lower East Side of Manhattan).&quot;

The term appeared in March 1983 in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; regarding anti-drug raids in the area. It also appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in an April 1984 editorial by Mayor Ed Koch justifying recent police operations:

In common, Mele notes, the early uses shared the &quot;mystique of &#x27;living on the edge.&#x27;&quot; As early as 1989, however, a &quot;Newsday&quot; article suggested the mood, even among newcomers, had changed:

Several local nickname sets associated with the ABCD denotation have included Adventurous, Brave, Crazy and Dead and, more recently by writer George Pendle, &quot;Affluent, Bourgeois, Comfortable, Decent&quot;.

==History==

===Before urbanization===
Prior to development, most of present-day Alphabet City was a salt marsh, regularly flooded by the tides of the East River (technically an estuary, not a river). Marshes played a critical role in the food web and protected the coast. The Lenape Native Americans who inhabited Manhattan before European contact presided over similar ecosystems from New York Bay to Delaware Bay. They tended to settle in forest clearings. In summer, however, they foraged shellfish, gathered cordgrass for weaving, and otherwise exploited the wetlands.

Dutch settlers brought a different model of land ownership and use. In 1625, representatives of the Dutch West India Company set their sights on lower Manhattan, with plans for a fortified town at its tip served by farms above. In 1626, they &quot;purchased&quot; the island from a local Lenape group and began parceling the land into boweries (from the Dutch for &quot;farm&quot;). The northern half of the Alphabet City area was part of Bowery Number 2. The southwest quarter was part of Bowery Number 3. Both belonged initially to the company but were soon sold to individuals. By 1663, a year before surrendering the colony to England, Director General Peter Stuyvesant had acquired the relevant part of Number 2 and much of Number 3 from other settlers. The company divided the southeast quarter of Alphabet City into small lots associated with larger parcels further away from the shore. In this way, upland farmers gained access to the unique tidal ecosystem—&quot;salt meadow&quot; as they called it—and with it, &quot;salt hay,&quot; a cordgrass species valued as fodder. In his influential &quot;Description of New Netherland&quot; (1655), Adriaen van der Donck informed his fellow Dutchmen:

The Dutch, then, were singularly attuned to the potential for land reclamation. During the city&#x27;s first two centuries, however, large-scale landfill was limited to the more commercial southern end of the island, particularly wharfs at the mouth of the East River. Stuyvesant and his heirs, with the help of slave labor, continued to occupy their farm as a country estate, cultivating it lightly and making few changes to the land.

===Development of the avenues===
After the Revolutionary War, with a surge in population and trade, the city was poised to grow northward. Around 1789, Peter Stuyvesant, great-grandson of the Director General by that name, came up with a plan for the area, mapping out streets to build and lots to sell. In doing so, he was following the precedent of landowners to the south. However, by this time, the city was laying out roads of its own and wanted to connect the whole. The first proposal for a unified street system was the Mangin–Goerck Plan. Presented in 1799, it extended Stuyvesant&#x27;s grid into the cove above Alphabet City, straightening the shoreline such that Alphabet City and the Lower East Side were no longer an isolated bulge. When this plan succumbed to political squabbles and landowner demands, the city appealed to the state to dictate a design. The result was the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, setting out the street grid of Manhattan above Houston Street.

&quot;In general,&quot; the commissioners resolved, everything &quot;should be rectangular.&quot; However, the new roads were rotated relative to the existing ones just below Alphabet City. Moreover, the commissioners could do little to straighten the shoreline. They were limited by charter to reclaiming 400 feet beyond the low-water mark, much less than the Mangin-Goerck plan entailed. First Avenue reflected this limit. It was drawn parallel to Fifth Avenue (called Middle Road in earlier designs) as far east as possible while not straying too far into the water. Irregular bits of land protruded beyond First Avenue and, for these cases, the commissioners turned to lettered avenues. Avenues A and B appeared around Alphabet City, popped up again above midtown, and once more in Harlem (they were eventually renamed or eliminated above Alphabet City). Avenues C and D existed only in Alphabet City. Thus the neighborhood was misaligned with the old grid and relatively disconnected to the new one.

On the other hand, Alphabet City retained its long, arcing bank along the East River, just north of the ever-growing ports and shipyards that animated the city. The commissioners placed the avenues on the east side of the island closer together in anticipation of denser development there. For Alphabet City proper, they envisioned a wholesale food market supplying the entire city. It would extend from 7th to 10th Street and from First Avenue to the river, with a canal up the middle. The commissioners wrote: &quot;The place selected for this purpose is a salt marsh, and from that circumstance, of inferior price, though in regard to its destination, of greater value than other soil.&quot;

Despite having sought a binding plan, the city requested many modifications from the state during execution, generally along lines demanded by property interests. Given the marshy environs, Alphabet City landowners, mostly Stuyvesants, argued for an extra measure of deference and the city concurred:

To this end, the proposed market place, like most of the public spaces in the plan, was returned to private hands. It was reduced to a sliver in 1815, then scrapped altogether in 1824. The city argued that the land was too remote to serve its intended purpose at the time and that holding onto it would deter development. Urban historian Edward Spann lamented, &quot;What was perhaps the most far-sighted feature of the Plan was the first to be completely eliminated.&quot;

In the same act that abolished the market place, the state accommodated a landowner petition to narrow just the lettered avenues. From the standard avenue width of , Avenue A was reduced to , Avenues B, C and D to , the width of most cross-streets. &quot;Incapable of use as thoroughfares to and from the City,&quot; wrote the city council, &quot;they cannot be considered as avenues in the proper Sense of the term.&quot; Instead, they should &quot;correspond as far as possible with the Old Streets [below Houston] of which they will form the Continuation &amp; be called by the Same names &amp; be regulated by the Corporation as Streets.&quot;

Weighing heavily in these decisions was the marsh itself and the water that drained—or failed to drain—through it. The debate about grading and draining Alphabet City&#x27;s streets went round and round for over a decade, even as filling proceeded. The standard design called for the land to slope down to the river uniformly throughout the watershed, which extended as far inland as Bowery. However, landowners, who would be assessed the cost of road construction, objected to the expense of so much landfill. In 1823, a newly created committee, with latitude to amend the 1811 plan, proposed to save money with a network of closed sewers, but these suffered a bad reputation from repeated clogging in older parts of the city. Another proposal, from a new committee, echoed the former market place design, calling for open, ornamented canals on 6th, 9th and 14th Streets. In 1832, as no amount of fill seemed to stem periodic flooding, the city resolved on a simpler sewer system. In this design, the land would slope down to Avenue C from both east and west like a trough, and flow through a sewer to the river at 14th Street (Avenue C was widened to 80 feet for the purpose). With this decided, roads and buildings went forward, though sewer construction itself would wait for decades. Archaeological excavations along Avenue C at 8th Street show that the site was incrementally raised 10–12 feet between 1820 and 1840, occupied from the 1840s (with the aid of a private cistern), and only drained by the proposed sewer line in 1867.

===Dry dock district===


The Alphabet City area initially developed along the riverfront, during the 1820s, as part of the city&#x27;s expanding shipbuilding and repair industry. Shipyards tended to form tight clusters in close proximity to specialized workers, such as ship carpenters, and ancillary manufacturers, such as iron works. They also required lots of cheap space. Hence, the city&#x27;s growth forced the shipyards to migrate periodically to peripheral sites: above Dover Street around 1750, below Corlears Hook (some five blocks south of Houston Street) around 1800, then, beginning in the 1820s, the marshes of Alphabet City. During the 1840s and 50s, the East River, from Corlears Hook to 13th Street, and inland as far as Avenue C, represented the greatest concentration of shipbuilding activity in the country. After the Civil War, land and labor costs, along with the switch from wood to more massive iron hulls, would push the industry off the island entirely.

Shipyards first appeared along the southern end of the area&#x27;s shoreline, roughly between Stanton and 3rd Street. This location was not only close to existing yards but also a relative high point. Indeed, it was called, rather confusingly, Manhattan Island, in reference to a knoll in the salt marsh, increasingly buried under wharfs. Here, in 1806-7, Charles Brownne built the first commercial steamboat, Robert Fulton&#x27;s Clermont, which helped establish the city&#x27;s shipbuilding reputation. Brothers Adam and Noah Brown (no relation to Charles) and Henry Eckford took over the spot and, by 1819, extended the wharf along Lewis Street, east of the new grid plan, to 5th Street. The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 called for a wholesale food market between 7th and 10th Street, but local landowners put a stop to this, clearing the way for more of the same. In 1825, a well-capitalized group of shipowners and builders formed the New York Dry Dock Company to upgrade the city&#x27;s repair facilities. They bought a chunk of waterfront recently sold off by Stuyvesants, running from 6th to 13th Street, and built an elaborate campus around 10th Street including Dry Dock Bank, Dry Dock Street (present-day Szold Place), and novel marine railways to elevate ships for repair. Hence, the neighborhood as a whole was often called Dry Dock.

In 1828, an observer wrote, &quot;No place on this island has the destroying hand of man done more to alter the face of nature... Hills of great magnitude have been entirely levelled, or cut down, and used to fill up docks and wharves.&quot; By the early 1840s, the shipyards formed a solid line along the riverfront, jutting out several hundred feet from the former low-water mark of the marsh. Shipbuilders included Smith &amp; Dimon (4th to 5th Street), William H. Webb (5th to 7th Street), Jacob A. Westervelt (7th to 8th Street) and William H. Brown (11th to 12th Street). Alongside them were sparmakers, who built masts for the booming clipper trade, as well as iron works, which manufactured steam engines. Morgan Iron Works (9th to 10th Street) and Novelty Iron Works (12th to 14th Street) soon became the area&#x27;s largest employers. Novelty had about 1200 workers at its peak in the 1850s, and was regarded as a marvel of engineering and operations.

As shipyards filled the riverfront, housing popped up nearby. In many cases, shipbuilders themselves played the role of developer. Noah Brown, for example, built a boardinghouse for apprentices south of Houston and invested in large plots to the north. Beginning around 1830, the Ficketts, another shipbuilding clan, built numerous three-story brick houses along Avenue D as well as cross streets west to Avenues C. They occupied some themselves and rented lesser variants to skilled laborers. By the early 1840s, shipyard owners dotted the neighborhood, and the majority of the city&#x27;s ship carpenters lived in a narrow strip of blocks along Avenue D and Lewis Street, a stone&#x27;s throw from the wharfs.

Throughout this period, the industry was dominated by in-migrants drawn to the booming shipyards from surrounding countryside and boatbuilding regions across New England. They shared a traditional production model in which artisans progressed from apprentices to journeymen to masters, all while living and working side by side. Sean Wilentz, who documented the sweatshop proclivities of antebellum New York City, points to shipbuilding as the rare industry where tradition persisted and kept wages, skill and respect generally high. He and others also credit shipyard workers with pioneering the reduction of work hours in the United States. A &quot;Mechanics&#x27; Bell&quot; hung for decades along the Alphabet City riverfront to enforce the ten-hour day that journeymen secured around 1834. Labor reformer George McNeill likened it to a &quot;&#x27;Liberty Bell&#x27; ... for the sons of toil.&quot;

===19th century===
The Commissioners&#x27; Plan and resulting street grid was the catalyst for the northward expansion of the city, and for a short period, the portion of the Lower East Side that is now Alphabet City was one of the wealthiest residential neighborhoods in the city. Following the grading of the streets, development of rowhouses came to the East Side and NoHo by the early 1830s. In 1833, Thomas E. Davis and Arthur Bronson bought the entire block of 10th Street from Avenue A to Avenue B. The block was located adjacent to Tompkins Square Park, located between 7th and 10th Streets from Avenue A to Avenue B, designated the same year. Though the park was not in the original Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, part of the land from 7th to 10th Streets east of First Avenue had been set aside for a marketplace that was ultimately never built. Rowhouses of 2.5 to 3 stories were built on the side streets by such developers as Elisha Peck and Anson Green Phelps; Ephraim H. Wentworth; and Christopher S. Hubbard and Henry H. Casey. Following the rapid growth of the neighborhood, Manhattan&#x27;s 17th ward was split from the 11th ward in 1837. The former covered the area from Avenue B to the Bowery, while the latter covered the area from Avenue B to the East River.

By the middle of the 19th century, many of the wealthy had continued to move further northward to the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. Some wealthy families remained, and one observer noted in the 1880s that these families &quot;look[ed] down with disdain upon the parvenus of Fifth avenue.&quot; In general, though, the wealthy population of the neighborhood started to decline as many moved northward. Immigrants from modern-day Ireland, Germany, and Austria moved into the neighborhood.

The population of Manhattan&#x27;s 17th ward, which included the western part of the modern Alphabet City, doubled from 18,000 people in 1840 to over 43,000 in 1850, and nearly doubled yet again to 73,000 persons in 1860, becoming the city&#x27;s most highly populated ward at that time. As a result of the Panic of 1837, the city had experienced less construction in the previous years, and so there was a dearth of units available for immigrants, resulting in the subdivision of many houses in lower Manhattan. Another solution was brand-new &quot;tenant houses&quot;, or tenements, within the East Side. Clusters of these buildings were constructed by the Astor family and Stephen Whitney. The developers rarely involved themselves with the daily operations of the tenements, instead subcontracting landlords (many of them immigrants or their children) to run each building. Numerous tenements were erected, typically with footprints of , before regulatory legislation was passed in the 1860s. To address concerns about unsafe and unsanitary conditions, a second set of laws was passed in 1879, requiring each room to have windows, resulting in the creation of air shafts between each building. Subsequent tenements built to the law&#x27;s specifications were referred to as Old Law Tenements. Reform movements, such as the one started by Jacob Riis&#x27;s 1890 book &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, continued to attempt to alleviate the problems of the area through settlement houses, such as the Henry Street Settlement, and other welfare and service agencies.

Because most of the new immigrants were German speakers, modern Alphabet City, East Village and the Lower East Side collectively became known as &quot;Little Germany&quot; (). The neighborhood had the third largest urban population of Germans outside of Vienna and Berlin. It was America&#x27;s first foreign language neighborhood; hundreds of political, social, sports and recreational clubs were set up during this period. Numerous churches were built in the neighborhood, of which many are still extant. In addition, Little Germany also had its own library on Second Avenue in nearby East Village, now the New York Public Library&#x27;s Ottendorfer branch. However, the community started to decline after the sinking of the &quot;General Slocum&quot; on June 15, 1904, in which over a thousand German-Americans died.

The Germans who moved out of the area were replaced by immigrants of many different nationalities. This included groups of Italians and Eastern European Jews, as well as Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Slovaks and Ukrainians, each of whom settled in relatively homogeneous enclaves. In &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, Riis wrote that &quot;a map of the city, colored to designate nationalities, would show more stripes than on the skin of a zebra, and more colors than any rainbow.&quot; One of the first groups to populate the former Little Germany were Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, who first settled south of Houston Street before moving northward. The Roman Catholic Poles as well as the Protestant Hungarians would also have a significant impact in the East Side, erecting houses of worship next to each other along 7th Street at the turn of the 20th century. By the 1890s, tenements were being designed in the ornate Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival styles, though tenements built in the later part of the decade were built in the Renaissance Revival style. At the time, the area was increasingly being identified as part of the Lower East Side.

===20th century===

The New York State Tenement House Act of 1901 drastically changed the regulations to which buildings in the East Side had to conform. Simultaneously, the Yiddish Theatre District or &quot;Yiddish Rialto&quot; developed within the East Side, centered around Second Avenue. It contained many theaters and other forms of entertainment for the Jewish immigrants of the city. By World War I, the district&#x27;s theaters hosted as many as 20 to 30 shows a night. After World War II, Yiddish theater became less popular, and by the mid-1950s few theaters were still extant in the District.

The city built First Houses on the south side of East 3rd Street between First Avenue and Avenue A, and on the west side of Avenue A between East 2nd and East 3rd Streets in 1935–1936, the first such public housing project in the United States. The Polish enclave in the East Village persisted, though numerous other immigrant groups had moved out, and their former churches were sold and became Orthodox cathedrals. Latin American immigrants started to move to the East Side, settling in the eastern part of the neighborhood and creating an enclave that later came to be known as Loisaida.

The East Side&#x27;s population started to decline at the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s and the implementation of the Immigration Act of 1924, and the expansion of the New York City Subway into the outer boroughs. Many old tenements, deemed to be &quot;blighted&quot; and unnecessary, were destroyed in the middle of the 20th century. The Village View Houses on First Avenue between East 2nd and 6th Streets were opened in 1964, partially on the site of the old St. Nicholas Kirche.

Until the mid-20th century, the area was simply the northern part of the Lower East Side, with a similar culture of immigrant, working-class life. In the 1950s and 1960s, the migration of Beatniks into the East Village attracted hippies, musicians, writers, and artists who had been priced out of the rapidly gentrifying Greenwich Village. Among the first displaced Greenwich Villagers to stray as far east as Alphabet City was poet Allen Ginsberg, who moved to 206 East 7th Street in 1951. His apartment served as a &quot;nerve center&quot; for writers such as William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Gregory Corso. Further change came in 1955 when the Third Avenue elevated railway above the Bowery and Third Avenue was removed. This in turn made the East Side more attractive to potential residents, and by 1960, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;this area is gradually becoming recognized as an extension of Greenwich Village ... thereby extending New York’s Bohemia from river to river&quot;. The area became a center of the counterculture in New York, and was the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including punk rock and the Nuyorican literary movement.

By the 1970s and 1980s, the city in general was in decline and nearing bankruptcy, especially after the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. Residential buildings in Alphabet City and the East Village suffered from high levels of neglect, as property owners did not properly maintain their buildings. The city purchased many of these buildings, but was also unable to maintain them due to a lack of funds. In spite of the deterioration of the area&#x27;s structures, its music and arts scenes were doing well. By the 1970s, gay dance halls and punk rock clubs had started to open in the neighborhood. These included the Pyramid Club, which opened in 1979 at 101 Avenue A; it hosted musical acts such as Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers, as well as drag performers such as RuPaul and Ann Magnuson.

===Gentrification===

Alphabet City was one of many neighborhoods in New York to experience gentrification in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Multiple factors resulted in lower crime rates and higher rents in Manhattan in general, and Alphabet City in particular. Avenues A through D became distinctly less bohemian in the 21st century than they had been in earlier decades. In the 1970s, rents were extremely low and the neighborhood was considered one of the least desirable places in Manhattan to live in. However, as early as 1983, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that because of the influx of artists, many longtime establishments and immigrants were being forced to leave the area due to rising rents. By the following year, young professionals constituted a large portion of the neighborhood&#x27;s demographics. Even so, crime remained prevalent and there were often drug deals being held openly in Tompkins Square Park.

Tensions over gentrification contributed to the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot, which occurred following opposition to a proposed curfew that had targeted the park&#x27;s homeless. The aftermath of the riot slowed gentrification somewhat, as real estate prices declined. However, by the end of the 20th century, real estate prices had resumed their rapid rise. About half of Alphabet City&#x27;s stores had opened within the decade since the riot, while vacancy rates in that period had dropped from 20% to 3%, indicating that many of the longtime merchants had been pushed out.

The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space opened on Avenue C in the building known as C-Squat in 2012. An archive of urban activism, the museum explores the history of grassroots movements in the East Village and offers guided walking tours of community gardens, squats, and sites of social change.

==Political representation==
Politically, Alphabet City is in New York&#x27;s 7th and 12th congressional districts. It is also in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 27th and 28th districts, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 65th and 74th districts, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 1st and 2nd districts.

==Architecture==
===Historic buildings===
Local community groups such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP) are working to gain individual and district landmark designations for Alphabet City to preserve and protect the architectural and cultural identity of the neighborhood. In early 2011, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) proposed a small district along the block of 10th Street that lies north of Tompkins Square Park. The East 10th Street Historic District was designated by the LPC in January 2012.

Several notable buildings are designated as individual landmarks. These include:

===Other structures===
Other buildings of note include &quot;Political Row&quot;, a block of stately rowhouses on East 7th Street between Avenues C and D, where political leaders of every kind lived in the 19th century; the landmarked Wheatsworth Bakery building on East 10th Street near Avenue D; and next to it, 143-145 Avenue D, a surviving vestige of the Dry Dock District, which once filled the East River waterfront with bustling industry.

Alphabet City has a large number of surviving early 19th century houses connected to the maritime history of the neighborhood, which also are the first houses ever to be built on what had been farmland. Despite efforts by the GVSHP to preserve these houses, the LPC has not done so. An 1835 rowhouse at 316 East 3rd Street was demolished in 2012 for the construction of a 33-unit rental called &quot;The Robyn&quot;. In 2010, GVSHP and the East Village Community Coalition asked the LPC to consider for landmark designation 326 and 328 East 4th Street, two Greek Revival rowhouses dating from 1837–41, which over the years housed merchants affiliated with the shipyards, a synagogue, and most recently an art collective called the Uranian Phalanstery. However, the LPC has not granted these rowhouses landmark status. The LPC also declined to add 264 East 7th Street (the former home of illustrator Felicia Bond) and four neighboring rowhouses to the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District.

In 2008, nearly the entire Alphabet City area was &quot;downzoned&quot; as part of an effort led by local community groups including GVSHP, the local community board, and local elected officials. In most parts of Alphabet City, the rezoning requires that new development occur in harmony with the low-rise character of the area.

==Loisaida==
Loisaida is a term derived from the Spanish (and especially Nuyorican) pronunciation of &quot;Lower East Side&quot;. Originally coined by poet/activist Bittman &quot;Bimbo&quot; Rivas in his 1974 poem &quot;Loisaida&quot;, it now refers to Avenue C in Alphabet City, whose population has largely been Hispanic (mainly Nuyorican) since the 1960s.

Since the 1940s the demography of the neighborhood has changed markedly several times: the addition of the large labor-backed Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village after World War II at the northern end added a lower-middle to middle-class element to the area, which contributed to the eventual gentrification of the area in the 21st century; the construction of large government housing projects south and east of those and the growing Latino population transformed a large swath of the neighborhood into a Latin one until the late 1990s, when low rents outweighed high crime rates and large numbers of artists and students moved to the area. Manhattan&#x27;s growing Chinatown then expanded into the southern portions of the Lower East Side, but Hispanics are still concentrated in Alphabet City. With crime rates down, the area surrounding Alphabet City, the East Village, and the Lower East Side, is quickly becoming gentrified; the borders of the Lower East Side differ from its historical ones in that Houston Street is now considered the northern edge, and the area north of that between Houston Street and 14th Street is considered Alphabet City. But, because the Alphabet City term is largely a relic of a high-crime era, English-speaking residents refer to Alphabet City as part of the East Village, while Spanish-speaking residents continue to refer to Alphabet City as &quot;Loisaida&quot;.

==Police and crime==
Alphabet City is patrolled by the 9th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 321 East 5th Street. The 9th Precinct ranked 58th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010.

The 9th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 78.3% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 0 murders, 40 rapes, 85 robberies, 149 felony assaults, 161 burglaries, 835 grand larcenies, and 32 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

Local residents were kept out of the filming area unless they happened to live on that block or joined on as extras.
* &quot;Alphabet City&quot; (1984), about a drug dealer&#x27;s attempts to flee his life of crime, takes place in the neighborhood. Director Amos Poe had long covered the local punk scene. This was his first commercial film, starring Vincent Spano, Zohra Lampert and Jami Gertz.

Unlike the stage musical, which is not set in a specific period of time, the film is clear that the story takes place between 1989 and 1990. Although this leads to occasional anachronisms in the story, the time period is explicitly mentioned to establish that the story takes place before the gentrification of Alphabet City.

<doc id="193862" wikidata="Q832487" url="?curid=193862" title="Pillow Talk">
<text>Pillow Talk is a 1959 American romantic comedy film in CinemaScope directed by Michael Gordon and starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day. The supporting cast features Tony Randall, Thelma Ritter, Nick Adams, Allen Jenkins, Marcel Dalio and Lee Patrick. The film was written by Russell Rouse, Maurice Richlin, Stanley Shapiro, and Clarence Greene.

It tells the story of Jan Morrow (Day), an interior decorator, and Brad Allen (Hudson), a womanizing composer and bachelor, who share a telephone party line. When she unsuccessfully files a complaint on him for constantly using the line to woo his conquests, Brad finds out she is rather pretty and decides to trick her by masquerading as a Texas rancher. The scheme seems to work until their mutual friend Jonathan Forbes (Randall) finds out about it and exposes Brad.

According to a &quot;Rambling Reporter&quot; (August 28, 1959) item in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, RKO originally bought the script by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene in 1942, but since it was not produced, the writers bought it back in 1945. In 1947, they sold it as a play, but bought it back once again four years later, finally selling it in 1958 to Arwin Productions, the company owned by Doris Day&#x27;s husband, Martin Melcher. Although the film was originally titled &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;, according to a February 2, 1959 &quot;Rambling Reporter&quot; item in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the title &quot;displeased&quot; the PCA, and was changed to &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows&quot;. In August 1959, however, the original title was reinstated.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Doris Day), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Thelma Ritter), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color (Richard H. Riedel, Russell A. Gausman, Ruby R. Levitt) and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.

This is the first of three romantic comedies in which Day, Hudson, and Randall starred together, the other two being &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (1961) and &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1964).

Upon its release, &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; brought in a then staggering domestic box-office gross of $18,750,000 and gave Rock Hudson&#x27;s career a comeback after the failure of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; two years earlier.

On July 14, 1980, Jack Martin reported on &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; as &quot;biggest hit of 1959&quot;.

In 2009, it was entered into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant and preserved.

==Plot==
Jan Morrow is an interior decorator in New York City. She lives alone and claims to be happy when questioned on that subject by her drunken housekeeper, Alma. The only irritant in her life is the party line that she shares with Brad Allen, a Broadway composer and playboy who lives in a nearby apartment building. She cannot obtain a private phone line for her business, which she runs from home, because the telephone company has been overwhelmed by recent demand for new phone lines.

Jan and Brad, who have only ever &quot;met&quot; on the telephone, develop a feud over the use of the party line. Brad constantly uses the phone to chat with one young woman after another, singing to each of them an &quot;original&quot; love song supposedly written just for her, though he only changes the name or language he sings in. Jan needs the line for work and tries to make him more considerate. Brad suggests that the single Jan is jealous of his popularity and has a problem in &#x27;the bedroom department&#x27;. He charms the telephone inspector who is sent to investigate Jan&#x27;s complaint. Later, Brad and Jan agree to share the phone line on alternate half hours.

One of Jan&#x27;s clients is millionaire Jonathan Forbes, who repeatedly asks her to marry him. She refuses. Unknown to Jan, Jonathan is also Brad&#x27;s old college buddy and his current Broadway benefactor. Jonathan makes Brad aware of his latest love interest and Brad realises this must be his feuding partner. He is intrigued.

One evening in a nightclub, Brad sees Jan dancing and learns who she is. Attracted to her, he fakes an accent and invents a new persona: Rex Stetson, a wealthy Texan rancher. He succeeds in wooing Jan, in part because he has Brad make insinuations that he can then work to Rex&#x27;s favour. For example, Brad suggests Rex will stop by his hotel room on their date and try to seduce her; when Rex does this but only shows Jan the view, she thinks he is a perfect gentleman. When Jan brags to Brad about this, he suggests Rex may be gay. This leads Jan to question Rex about his attraction to her, thereby allowing him to kiss her.

Jonathan uses a private eye to find out who Jan is dating. After discovering the truth about Brad&#x27;s masquerade, he forces Brad to put Jan in a taxi and send her home. Brad is to leave New York and go to Jonathan&#x27;s cabin in Connecticut to complete his new songs. However, Brad double crosses him by inviting Jan to join him. Once there, kissing ensues until Rex leaves to fetch logs for the fire and Jan stumbles upon a copy of Rex&#x27;s sheet music. She plunks the melody on the nearby piano and recognizes Brad&#x27;s &#x27;inspiration&#x27; song. She confronts Brad and asks to be taken home by Jonathan, who has just arrived at the cabin.

In New York, Jonathan is less in love with Jan because she cries so much over Brad. He is pleased to learn that the playboy has fallen in love, while conversely Jan will have nothing to do with Brad. Brad turns to Alma for advice. Alma, pleased to meet Brad after listening in on the party line for so long, suggests he hire Jan to decorate his apartment so they will be forced to collaborate. Jan only concedes so that her employer will not lose the commission. Brad leaves all the design decisions up to Jan, telling her only to design a place that she would want to live in herself.

Still resentful, Jan decorates Brad&#x27;s apartment in the most gaudy decor she can muster. Horrified by what he finds, Brad storms into Jan&#x27;s apartment and carries her in her pajamas through the street back to his apartment to explain herself. Brad mentions all the changes he has made to end his bachelor lifestyle because he thought they were getting married. Her face lights up and, as he leaves in anger, she uses one of his &quot;playboy&quot; remote control switches to lock the door. She flips another switch and the player piano pounds out a honky-tonk version of Brad&#x27;s standard love song. He turns around, their eyes meet, and they embrace.

Some time later, Brad goes to tell Jonathan that he is going to be a father, only to be pulled by Dr. Maxwell (an obstetrician) and Nurse Resnick into their office for an examination, when he says that he is going to have a baby.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===

The film&#x27;s script was turned down and bought back by RKO a few times in the late 1940s and early 1950s until Martin Melcher (the husband of Doris Day at the time) and his Arwin Productions label bought the script and took it to Universal. According to Day in A.E. Hotchner&#x27;s biography &quot;Doris Day: Her Own Story&quot;, the film was titled &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;, but the title displeased the Production Code Administration (PCA). Melcher tried to get co-producer Ross Hunter to change the name to &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows&quot;, the name of a song he was about to publish, but Hunter stuck with the original name. The original ending planned for the film was to have Jan, after using the trick switch to lock the door and then smiling at Brad, shut off the light and say &quot;All apartments look alike in the dark.&quot; This open-ending was changed in the final film to show that Jan and Brad got married and are now expecting a baby.

===Casting===

The film is noted for reinventing the screen images of Rock Hudson and, particularly, Doris Day. Hunter identified Day&#x27;s potential to be sexy, and recruited legendary costume designer Jean Louis, who designed 18 or 24 costumes for Day to wear. Hunter said to Day, &quot;You are sexy, Doris, and it&#x27;s about time you dealt with it...if you allow me to get Jean Louis to do your clothes, I mean a really sensational wardrobe that will show off that wild fanny of yours, and get some wonderful makeup on you, and chic you up and get a great hairdo that lifts you, why, every secretary and every housewife will say, &#x27;Look at that—look what Doris has done to herself. Maybe I can do the same thing&#x27;&quot;. Day acknowledged that the film transformed her image from &quot;the girl next door&quot; to classy sex symbol, describing that the plot, for the time, was very sexy, involving a climactic scene in which the leading man carries her out of bed in her pajamas and out into the streets. In addition, Laykin et Cie lent $500,000 worth of jewels for Day to wear.

This is Hudson&#x27;s first comedy film, after a slew of dramas that he made throughout the 1950s including &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1956) and &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957). It was Hunter who saw Hudson&#x27;s potential to do comedy. The advice he received from director Michael Gordon was &quot;Comedy is the most serious tragedy in the world. Play it that way and you can&#x27;t go wrong. If you ever think of yourself as funny, you haven&#x27;t got a chance.&quot; On February 2, 1959, Thelma Ritter was cast as Alma, Jan&#x27;s housekeeper, while Lee Patrick was cast as Mrs. Walters the following month. Hope Emerson was recruited by Hunter to play an Indian princess called &quot;Dessert Flower&quot; in the film. She does not appear in the final cut. A cameo appearance by Day&#x27;s friend and actress Miriam Nelson occurs in the scene where Brad ducks into Dr. Maxwell&#x27;s (the obstetrician) office to avoid running into Jan. Nelson was given the walk-on part as a patient in the waiting room so she could have lunch with Day in the commissary.

===Filming===

According to Hudson, the final scene, in which Brad storms into Jan&#x27;s apartment and yanks her out of bed, and carries her through the streets of Manhattan, back to his re-decorated apartment, was actually shot first. Due to back problems, Hudson carried Day on a shelf with her sheets and blankets over her to get through the many takes. According to Hudson, &quot;I could have managed if only one take had been involved, but we went on endlessly, primarily because there was a bit actor who played a cop on the street, and as we passed him Doris&#x27; line was &#x27;Officer, arrest this man,&#x27; and the cop was supposed to say to me, &#x27;How you doing, Brad?&#x27; but that stupid actor kept calling me Rock (01:39:36). So back to our marks we went for another take and another and another. I&#x27;ll bet we did that scene twenty times. That&#x27;s why the shelf for Doris to sit on.&quot; Also, Hudson related that when he pulled Doris Day out of bed, he forgot to let go of her ankles &quot;…with the result that my leading lady crashed to the floor.&quot;

Day and Hudson developed chemistry during filming and the cast and crew acted as if they were family. Hudson recalled that, as per a &quot;Modern Screen&quot; article, &quot;they had to add a week on to the shooting schedule because we could not stop laughing&quot;. Day clarified this during interviews she had with Merv Griffin on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (1976), during her 1976 press tour to promote her biography &quot;Doris Day: Her Own Story&quot; by A.E. Hotchner. &quot;Every day on the set was a picnic—sometimes too much of a picnic, in that we took turns at breaking each other up.&quot; According to an article in the October 1959 issue of &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, Jean Louis designed 24 costumes for Doris Day and Laykin et Cie loaned the production $500,000 worth of jewels. The film is notable for its usage of split-screens during which Jan and Brad/Rex have telephone conversations. Triple split-screens are featured at the beginning of the film when Brad is using the party line to flirt with Eileen and Yvette.

==Songs==
Day sings three songs in the film: &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; during the opening credits, &quot;Roly Poly&quot; in the piano bar with Blackwell and Hudson, and &quot;Possess Me&quot; on the drive up to Jonathan&#x27;s cabin. Singer Perry Blackwell performs three songs in the piano bar: &quot;I Need No Atmosphere&quot;, &quot;Roly Poly&quot; (in part), and &quot;You Lied&quot;—a song directed at Hudson&#x27;s character, Brad. Hudson sings &quot;Inspiration&quot; in the film to three of his conquests: Eileen, Yvette and Marie. It then becomes an instrumental motif to represent Brad and his playboy ways: when the telephone inspector comes to interview Brad (00:13:24), when Brad calls Jan to apologize for his behavior and ask her on a date (00:26:26) and when Jan realizes that &quot;Rex&quot; was Brad the whole time after discovering the sheet music of the song and playing its notes on the piano in Jonathan&#x27;s home during their stay in Connecticut (01:17:54). For their commercial releases, Doris Day recorded the title song for Columbia Records and Rock Hudson recorded &quot;Roly Poly&quot; and the title song for Decca Records.

==Release==

===Promotions===
Universal&#x27;s efforts to promote the film were significant. The studio sponsored press tours by the cast, director and producers in cities across the United States throughout the late summer and early fall of 1959. Promotional materials included original production photos and press material (a copy of which is available at the New York Public Library for Performing Arts at Lincoln Center), print advertisements and recordings sent to radio stations with Day and Hudson narrating introductions to audio clips from the film. Also, Hudson recorded a voice message that would play when people called a number given by K-B&#x27;s Ontario Theatre in local newspaper and magazine ads for the film. Even though the number was only expected to receive about 60,000 calls daily, it was so successful it wound up receiving twice that many, or 120,000 calls a day. The posters for the film differed in content in the United States and international markets. In the United States, the posters were clean and non-explicit, with no trace of the film&#x27;s verbal and visual innuendo. Consistent with the European Foreign-Language films being introduced in the states, the ads running in Europe were more explicit. For example, the Danish release poster features an illustration of Doris Day in the bathtub from a high-angle, showing the water inside and giving a sexy appearance.

===Premieres===
Producer Ross Hunter convinced Sol Schwartz, owner of the Palace Theatre on Broadway, to book &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; for a two-week run following its premiere on October 6, 1959. Cast members Hudson and Day attended the event with celebrities, including Gloria Swanson and Tallulah Bankhead. A second premiere also took place at the same time at the re-opened Murray Hill Theatre on 34th Street as a way to benefit the United Nations International School, where Tony Randall was present. An international premiere at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood also took place on October 13, with Hudson, Day, Esther Williams and Jeff Chandler in attendance.

===Box office===
The film was a box office hit, grossing $18,750,000 domestically. It was number one at the U.S. box office for seven consecutive weeks. This made Hunter&#x27;s vision of pairing Day and Hudson together so successful, that they earned Allied&#x27;s &quot;male and female star of the year&quot; awards for 1959.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics upon its release. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;A nice, old-fashioned device of the theatre, the telephone party line, serves as a quaint convenience to bring together Rock Hudson and Doris Day in what must be cheerfully acknowledged one of the most lively and up-to-date comedy-romances of the year.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;dripping with the trappings of glamor. The premise is dubious, but an attractive cast, headed by Rock Hudson and Doris Day, give the good lines the strength to overcome this deficiency. It plays.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; agreed, writing: &quot;Although the basic premise of the plot is slightly incredulous, and the plot itself wafer thin, the entire production is endowed with superb production values that more than compensate for the script deficiencies.&quot; Paul V. Beckley of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Pillow Talk&quot; is a melange of legs, pillows, slips, gowns and decor and is about as light as it could get without floating away, but it has a smart, glossy texture and that part of the population likely to be entranced at the sight of a well groomed Rock Hudson being irresistible to a silver-haired Doris Day will probably enjoy it.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was dismissive, calling the film &quot;an attempt at farce that is hardly what I would call farcical.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that director Michael Gordon &quot;maintains a lively pace and handles his players with an expert feeling for timing and emphasis. Doris Day gives possibly her best comedy performance to date; Tony Randall works several more variations on his tired dilettante act; and Rock Hudson&#x27;s beefcake charmer has all the necessary physical ingredients for success.&quot;

The film holds a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.

==Unproduced sequel==
In 1960, &quot;Baby Talk&quot;, a sequel starring Hudson and Day, was announced. In 1980, a sequel was planned for the film, set 20 years after the original film ended. The story involved Jan and Brad having their first daughter (who would have been played by Kristy McNichol), and getting a divorce, which allows Jonathan (who would have been played again by Tony Randall) to have another chance of proposing to Jan. She schemes to get Brad back while Brad does a scam of his own. According to David Kaufman&#x27;s biography &quot;Doris Day: The Untold Story of the Girl Next Door&quot;, Day was enthusiastic about the project and wanted to be involved. Hudson also expressed interest in returning. Ross Hunter was set to produce again, with Delbert Mann (who directed Day and Hudson in &quot;Lover Come Back&quot;) directing the script written by Bruce Kane. Despite making changes according to Day&#x27;s wishes and getting approval from Universal to make the sequel, the project did not materialize; Day&#x27;s retirement was one of the reasons.

<doc id="193864" wikidata="Q1646944" url="?curid=193864" title="Suddenly Last Summer">
<text>Suddenly Last Summer is a one-act play by Tennessee Williams, written in New York in 1957. It opened off Broadway on January 7, 1958, as part of a double bill with another of Williams&#x27; one-acts, &quot;Something Unspoken&quot; (written in London in 1951). The presentation of the two plays was given the overall title &quot;Garden District,&quot; but &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; is now more often performed alone. Williams said he thought the play &quot;perhaps the most poetic&quot; he had written, and Harold Bloom ranks it among the best examples of the playwright&#x27;s lyricism.

== Plot ==
In 1936, in the Garden District of New Orleans, Mrs. Violet Venable, an elderly socialite widow from a prominent local family, has invited a doctor to her home. She talks nostalgically about her son Sebastian, a poet who died under mysterious circumstances in Spain the previous summer. During the course of their conversation, she offers to make a generous donation to support the doctor&#x27;s psychiatric research if he will perform a lobotomy on Catharine, her niece, who has been confined to St. Mary, a private mental institution, at her expense since returning to America. Mrs. Venable is eager to &quot;make her peaceful&quot; once and for all by erasing her memories of Sebastian&#x27;s violent death and his homosexuality; Mrs. Venable is especially adamant that Catharine stop talking about the latter, in order to preserve her late son&#x27;s reputation.

Catharine arrives, followed by her mother and brother. They are also eager to suppress her version of events, since Mrs. Venable is threatening to keep Sebastian&#x27;s will in probate until she is satisfied, something Catharine&#x27;s family can&#x27;t afford to challenge. But the doctor injects Catharine with a truth serum and she proceeds to give a scandalous account of Sebastian&#x27;s moral dissolution and the events leading up to his death, how he used her to procure young men for his sexual exploitation, and how he was set upon, mutilated, and partially devoured by a mob of starving children in the street. Mrs. Venable lunges at Catharine but is prevented from striking her with her cane. She is taken off stage, screaming &quot;cut this hideous story from her brain!&quot; Far from being convinced of Catharine&#x27;s insanity, however, the doctor concludes the play by stating he believes her story could be true.

== Analysis ==
From its first page, the script is rich in symbolic detail open to many interpretations. The &quot;mansion of Victorian Gothic style&quot; immediately connects the play with Southern Gothic literature, with which it shares many characteristics. Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;jungle-garden,&quot; with its &quot;violent&quot; colours and noises of &quot;beasts, serpents, and birds ... of savage nature&quot; introduces the images of predation that punctuate much of the play&#x27;s dialogue. These have been interpreted variously as implying the violence latent in Sebastian himself; depicting modernity&#x27;s vain attempts to &quot;contain&quot; its atavistic impulses; and standing for a bleak &quot;Darwinian&quot; vision of the world, equating &quot;the primeval past and the ostensibly civilised present.&quot;

The Venus flytrap mentioned in the play&#x27;s opening speech can be read as portraying Sebastian as the &quot;pampered&quot; son, or &quot;hungry for flesh&quot;; as portraying the &quot;seductive deadliness&quot; concealed beneath Mrs. Venable&#x27;s &quot;civilized veneer,&quot; while she &quot;clings desperately to life&quot; in her &quot;hothouse&quot; home; as a joint &quot;metaphor for Violet and Sebastian, who consume and destroy the people around them&quot;; as symbolising nature&#x27;s cruelty, like the &quot;flesh-eating birds&quot; of the Galapagos; as symbolising &quot;a primitive state of desire,&quot; and so on.

Williams referred to symbols as &quot;the natural language of drama&quot; and &quot;the purest language of plays.&quot; The ambiguity arising from the abundance of symbolism is therefore not unfamiliar to his audiences. What poses a unique difficulty to critics of &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; is the absence of its protagonist. All we can know of Sebastian must be gleaned from the conflicting accounts given by two characters of questionable sanity, leaving him &quot;a figure of unresolvable contradiction.&quot;

In spite of its difficulties, however, the play&#x27;s recurrent images of predation and cannibalism point to Catharine&#x27;s cynical pronouncement as key to understanding the playwright&#x27;s intentions: &quot;we all use each other,&quot; she says in Scene 4, &quot;and that&#x27;s what we think of as love.&quot; Accordingly, Williams commented on a number of occasions that Sebastian&#x27;s death was intended to show how:
Man devours man in a metaphorical sense. He feeds upon his fellow creatures, without the excuse of animals. Animals actually do it for survival, out of hunger ... I use that metaphor [of cannibalism] to express my repulsion with this characteristic of man, the way people use each other without conscience ... people devour each other.

== Adaptations and productions ==
=== 1958 original production ===
The original production of the play was performed off Broadway on January 7, 1958, along with &quot;Something Unspoken&quot;, under the collective title of &quot;Garden District&quot;, at the York Theatre on First Avenue in New York, staged by the York Playhouse. Anne Meacham won an Obie Award (Annual Off-Broadway Theatre Awards 1956 –) for her performance as Catharine. The production also featured Hortense Alden as Mrs. Venable, Robert Lansing as Dr. Cukrowicz, Eleanor Phelps as Mrs. Holly, and Alan Mixon as George Holly, and was directed by Herbert Machiz, with stage set designed by Robert Soule and the costumes by Stanley Simmons. Incidental music was by Ned Rorem.

=== 1959 film ===

The film version was released by Columbia Pictures, in 1959, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, and Montgomery Clift; it was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz from a screenplay by Gore Vidal and Williams. The movie differs greatly from the stage version, adding many scenes, characters, and subplots. The Hollywood Production Code forced the filmmakers to cut out the explicit references to homosexuality.

The movie received three Academy Award nominations: Hepburn and Taylor were both nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and it was also up for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White.

===1993 BBC TV play===

The play was adapted for BBC Television in 1993 under the direction of Royal National Theatre head Richard Eyre, and starring Maggie Smith, Rob Lowe, Richard E. Grant, and Natasha Richardson. It aired in the United States on PBS as an episode of &quot;Great Performances&quot;. Smith was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie. According to Lowe, his personal driver during the production of the telefilm was also the personal driver for Montgomery Clift on the 1959 film.

=== 1995 Broadway debut ===
The play made its Broadway debut in 1995. It was performed together with &quot;Something Unspoken&quot;, the other one-act play that it originally appeared with under the title &quot;Garden District&quot;. It was presented by the Circle in the Square Theatre. The cast included Elizabeth Ashley, Victor Slezak and Celia Weston.

=== 1999 London West End debut ===
The play debuted in the West End in 1999 at the Comedy Theatre, London, starring Sheila Gish as Mrs. Venable, Rachel Weisz as Catharine, Gerard Butler as Dr. Cukrowicz and directed by Sean Mathias.

=== 2004 London West End revival ===
Michael Grandage directed a 2004 stage production at the Lyceum Theatre, Sheffield, featuring Diana Rigg as Mrs. Venable and Victoria Hamilton as Catharine. The production toured nationally before transferring to the Albery Theatre, London. The production received enthusiastic reviews, and Hamilton won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Actress for her performance.

=== 2006 off-Broadway ===
An off-Broadway production in 2006 by the Roundabout Theatre Company starred Blythe Danner, Gale Harold and Carla Gugino.

=== 2015 Sydney Theatre Company ===
The play was part of the 2015 season at the Sydney Theatre Company. Director Kip Williams blended live camera work with traditional stage craft in a production starring Eryn Jean Norvill as Catherine and Robyn Nevin as Venable. The production received three nominations at 2015 Helpmann Awards, with Nevin nominated for Best Actress, the production nominated for Best Play, and Williams winning for Best Director.

=== 2017 Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon, Paris ===
A French translation of the play was staged at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon in March and April 2017. Stéphane Braunschweig directed Luce Mouchel as Mrs. Venable, Marie Rémond as Catherine, Jean-Baptiste Anoumon as Dr. Cukrowicz, Océane Cairaty as Miss Foxhill, Virginie Colemyn as Mrs. Holly, Glenn Marausse as George, and Boutaïna El Fekkak as Sœur Félicité.

<text>BUtterfield 8 is a 1960 American drama film directed by Daniel Mann, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey. Taylor won her first Academy Award for her performance in a leading role. The film was based on a 1935 novel of the same name by John O&#x27;Hara.

==Plot==
Gloria Wandrous wakes up in the apartment of wealthy executive Weston Liggett, and finds that he has left her $250. Insulted, she finds her dress was torn, and takes Liggett&#x27;s wife Emily&#x27;s mink coat to cover herself, scrawling &quot;No Sale&quot; in lipstick on the mirror. She orders her telephone answering service, BUtterfield 8, to put Liggett through if he calls.

Gloria visits a childhood friend, pianist Steve Carpenter, who chastises her for wasting her life on one-night stands, but agrees to ask his girlfriend Norma to lend her a dress. Norma later tells Steve he must choose between Gloria and her.

Liggett takes a train to the countryside, where his wife Emily is caring for her mother. His friend, Bingham Smith, advises him to end his adulterous relationships and return to Bing&#x27;s law firm, instead of working for his father-in-law&#x27;s chemical business. Meanwhile, Gloria lies to her mother Annie, claiming to have spent the night at Norma&#x27;s.

Liggett returns home. Finding the lipstick and money, he phones Gloria to explain the money was meant for her to buy a new dress, to replace the one that he had torn. While drinking later that night, Liggett advises her to ask a high price for her lovemaking talents. She insists she does not take payment from her dates, and claims she has been hired as a model to advertise the dress she is wearing at three bistros that night. Liggett follows Gloria, watching her flirt with various men at several clubs. He drives her to a run-down motel. After sleeping together, Liggett and Gloria decide to explore their relationship further. They spend five days together, eventually falling in love with one another. They part only after Liggett&#x27;s wife Emily returns.

Returning home, Gloria confesses to her mother about having been the &quot;slut of all time&quot;, but declares that that is all over now, since she is truly in love. Gloria visits her psychiatrist, Dr. Tredman, to insist that her relationship with Liggett has cured her of promiscuity.

For his part, Liggett also plans to change his life, taking up Bing&#x27;s offer of a job at the law firm. When he returns home, Emily has noticed that her mink is gone. Liggett makes excuses and rushes out to search for Gloria at her regular clubs. He cannot locate her, but in his search, he is repeatedly confronted with the reality of Gloria&#x27;s promiscuous past. When Gloria finds Liggett at a bistro the following evening, he drunkenly launches into insults. Gloria drives Liggett to his apartment building where Emily, spotting them from a window, watches as her husband throws the coat at Gloria, saying he would never give the tainted object back to his wife.

Heartbroken, Gloria goes to Steve, saying that she feels she has &quot;earned&quot; the mink coat she is wearing. Having never before taken payment from the men she slept with, she now has and laments &quot;what that makes me&quot;. She recounts that when she was 13, a friend of her widowed mother, Major Hartley, taught her about &quot;evil&quot;. She hates herself because she loved it and thus went on to make her life out of it. Steve insists that Gloria stay the night, since both Gloria and he have to decide what to do next. Norma arrives the next morning, finding Gloria asleep on Steve&#x27;s couch; having at last made up his mind, he asks Norma to marry him.

The next day, a now-sober Liggett admits to himself that he still loves Gloria and asks Emily for a divorce. Meanwhile, Gloria tells her mother she is moving to Boston to begin a new life.

Upon discovering Gloria&#x27;s destination, Liggett drives until spotting her car at a roadside café. He tries to apologize by asking Gloria to marry him, but she insists that his insults have &quot;branded&quot; her and that her past is a sore spot that no husband would ever truly be able to accept. They profess their love for each other, and though Gloria initially agrees to go with Liggett to the motel, she ultimately changes her mind and flees in her car. Pursuing Gloria&#x27;s car, Liggett sees her miss a sign for road construction and accidentally hurtle over an embankment to her death. Returning to the city, Liggett tells his wife about Gloria&#x27;s death, announces that he is leaving to &quot;find my pride&quot;, and says that if Emily is still home when he returns, they will see if it has any value to them.

==Title==
The title of the novel and film &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; is the number of a telephone exchange for an answering service that follows the pattern of old telephone exchange names in the United States and Canada. Before all-number calling was common, telephone exchanges were referred to by name instead of by number. BUtterfield 8 was an exchange that provided service to upper-class neighborhoods of Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. Dialing the letters &quot;BU&quot; equates to 28 on the lettered telephone dial, so &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; would equate to 288 as the first three digits of a seven-digit phone number.

The preface to the novel is a notice by the telephone company that an extra digit will be added to all exchanges, &quot;for instance, the exchange BUtterfield will become BUtterfield 8.&quot;

==Production==

=== Casting ===
Elizabeth Taylor did not want to appear in &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot;, which she and husband Eddie Fisher called &quot;Butterball Four&quot;, and made the film only to fulfill a contractual obligation to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer before being allowed to depart to 20th Century Fox to make &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.

In an archival audiotape played during the 2024 documentary film &quot;Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes&quot;, Taylor recalled her disdain for the film:I hated it so much. I thought, &quot;fuck them!&quot;—they made me do the film. I didn&#x27;t want to. I did it with a pistol at my head. The lines were so diabolical. It was such a piece of shit. And it made me angry. And out of the anger, it kind of gave me an incentive. ... It was done out of anger.

===Screenplay===
The screenplay was adapted by John Michael Hayes and Charles Schnee from O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 1935 novel, which in turn was based on the mysterious death of Starr Faithfull in Long Beach, New York, in 1931. Faithfull was found dead of drowning on a beach after having apparently been beaten. In O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s novel, Gloria Wandrous, the character based on Faithfull, is killed by falling under the paddle wheel of a steamboat. Aside from optioning the rights to his story, O&#x27;Hara was not involved in writing the screenplay for the film, and the film&#x27;s plot bears only a slight resemblance to his novel.

===Filming===
Location filming was done on City Island in the Bronx; and Stony Point and West Nyack in Rockland County, New York. Studio filming took place at Chelsea Studios in Manhattan.

The café where Liggett finds Gloria as she is going to Boston is an office building, 54 South (Liberty Drive), Stony Point. Happy&#x27;s Motel, where Gloria and Liggett stay, is the Budget Motor Inn, 87 South Liberty Drive, Stony Point. Liggett takes Gloria to his boat at the Hudson Water Club, Beach Road, West Haverstraw, New York.

In his autobiography &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;, Fisher wrote that he and Taylor had sex during a lovemaking scene. The scene was cut from the film before its release.

==Release==
===Box office===
According to MGM records, the film made $6.8 million in the US and Canada and $3.2 million in other countries, resulting in a profit to the studio of $1,857,000 and making it MGM&#x27;s biggest hit of the year.

===Critical reception===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;we have the ancient, hackneyed story of the tinseled but tarnished prostitute who thinks she has finally discovered the silver lining for her life in Mr. Right … By the odds, it should be a bomb. But a bomb it is not, let us tell you … all we can say is that Miss Taylor lends a certain fascination to the film.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared &quot;The fact that it manages to be a reasonably arresting experience even though it is carved out of a highly questionable melodrama can be attributed to the keen sense of visual excitement possessed by those who pooled their talents to put it on the screen … The picture&#x27;s major asset, dramatically as well as financially, is Miss Taylor, who makes what is becoming her annual bid for an Oscar.&quot; John L. Scott of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that although the material had a &quot;somewhat flimsy narrative&quot; and &quot;Harvey seems miscast,&quot; Taylor gave a &quot;daring, brilliant performance&quot; and &quot;gains another chance to be nominated for an Oscar.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it an &quot;immensely handsome but painfully shallow film&quot; with Taylor its &quot;redeeming feature.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote &quot;Elizabeth Taylor is magnificent in her portrayal of the model, while Laurence Harvey makes an ideal playboy whose vice-presidency in his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s company calls only for his entertaining of customers. The script is ultra-frank. A big minus is Eddie Fisher, whose Thespian inability harms the otherwise brilliantly acted production.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated &quot;In this case, the mixture resolutely refuses to come to the boil, due mainly to an inadequate script and theatrical, styleless direction. None of the players is able to sustain interest in the unending stream of smart talk and literary wisecracks and Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey, in particular, strive for an intensity which only leads to bathos.&quot;

The film holds a score of 47% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 17 reviews.

===Accolades===

In 2005, the American Film Institute nominated Gloria Wandrous&#x27;s quote &quot;Mama, face it. I was the slut of all time.&quot; from this film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.

<doc id="193868" wikidata="Q1569632" url="?curid=193868" title="Sunrise at Campobello">
<text>Sunrise at Campobello is a 1960 American biographical film telling the story of the struggles of future President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt and his family when Roosevelt was stricken with paralysis at the age of 39 in August 1921. Based on Dore Schary&#x27;s 1958 Tony Award-winning Broadway play of the same name, the film was directed by Vincent J. Donehue and stars Ralph Bellamy, Greer Garson, Hume Cronyn and Jean Hagen.

The film was produced with the cooperation of the Roosevelt family. Eleanor Roosevelt was present on the set during location shooting at the Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park, New York.

==Plot==
At the Roosevelt family&#x27;s summer home on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada (on the border with Maine) in the summer of 1921, Franklin D. Roosevelt is vigorously athletic, enjoying games with his children and sailing his boat.

Roosevelt is suddenly stricken with fever and then paralysis. Conflict ensues between the bedridden Roosevelt, his wife Eleanor, his mother Sara and his close political adviser Louis Howe. Later, as Roosevelt drags himself up the stairs, he painfully strives to overcome his physical limitations and resist remaining an invalid.

Roosevelt reenters public life as he walks to the speaker&#x27;s rostrum at a party convention, aided by heavy leg braces and crutches.

==Cast==

* Ralph Bellamy as Franklin D. Roosevelt
* Greer Garson as Eleanor Roosevelt
* Hume Cronyn as Louis Howe
* Jean Hagen as Marguerite &quot;Missy&quot; LeHand
* Ann Shoemaker as Sara Roosevelt
* Alan Bunce as Governor Alfred E. Smith
* Tim Considine as James Roosevelt
* Zina Bethune as Anna Roosevelt
* Frank Ferguson as Dr. Bennett
* Pat Close as Elliott Roosevelt
* Robin Warga as Franklin Roosevelt Jr.
* Tom Carty as Johnny Roosevelt
* Lyle Talbot as Mr. Brimmer
* David White as Mr. Lassiter
* Walter Sande as Captain Skinner
* Herbert Anderson as Vincent Dailey

Director Dore Schary had originally considered Anthony Quayle for the role of Roosevelt until Schary&#x27;s wife suggested Bellamy.

==Production==
&quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; presents events that took place over three years, from August 1921 to July 1924, culminating in Roosevelt&#x27;s speech at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. Before and during Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, the extent of his disability was minimized. &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; depicts the debilitating effects of his paralytic illness to a greater extent than had been previously disclosed by the media.

Exteriors were filmed at the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, the Roosevelt Campobello International Park on Campobello Island and the Roosevelts&#x27; former Manhattan residence. Interiors were shots on sets at Warner Bros. The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles was used to represent for Madison Square Garden for the 1924 convention.

The film was scored by Franz Waxman.

==Reception==
The film faced competition from &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, &quot;The World of Suzy Wong&quot;, &quot;The Apartment&quot; and &quot;Butterfield 8&quot;, films that all dealt with sex and that impacted the box-office performance of &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot;. At the time the film was made, Roosevelt&#x27;s affair with Lucy Mercer was not generally known and could not be portrayed on screen.

The film was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. At its screening on July 19, 1961, at the Russia Theatre, the audience started to leave within minutes. More than 2,000 attendees departed before the end of the screening, possibly after realizing that the film did not depict the war years.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;...loses none of its poignant and inspirational qualities.&quot; It called Bellamy &quot;brilliant&quot;, and noted Garson&#x27;s &quot;deeply moving, multifaceted characterization.&quot;

In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther called &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; &quot;a well-done, moving biographical film&quot; and wrote: &quot;Ralph Bellamy&#x27;s performance of Mr. Roosevelt is every bit as strong, as full of feeling and characteristic gesture, as Mr. Bellamy made it on the stage. ... However, it must be mentioned that a tendency to overdo some of the famous Roosevelt expressions ... induces a bit of vexation, especially when they are shown in close-up, which glaringly discloses their forced and theatrical quality.&quot; Crowther also criticized Greer Garson&#x27;s &quot;singsong manner of speech&quot; that sounded like a caricature of Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s voice.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; review concluded that &quot;the play was an excellent job and has been improved upon.&quot;

More recently, Darragh O’Donoghue considers the film a hagiography but notes: &quot;Hume Cronyn is the heart and soul of the film as Louis Howe, FDR’s right-hand man, an asthmatic whose relish for the &#x27;real world&#x27; of compromised politics disgusts FDR’s patrician mother played with haughty relish by Ann Shoemaker.&quot;

<doc id="193869" wikidata="Q3747845" url="?curid=193869" title="Women's gridiron football">
<text>Women&#x27;s [[gridiron football]], more commonly known as women&#x27;s tackle football, women&#x27;s [[American football]], women&#x27;s [[Canadian football]], or simply women&#x27;s football, is a form of gridiron football (American or Canadian) played by women. Most leagues play by similar rules to the men&#x27;s game. Women primarily play on a semi-professional or amateur level in the United States. Very few high schools or colleges offer the sport solely for women and girls. However, on occasion, it is permissible for a female player to join the otherwise male team.

== History ==

Women and girls were playing tackle football not long after the sport was invented in the 1880s, often in educational settings. For over 70 years, however, female involvement in football was reported in the media as a novel &quot;spectacle&quot;. According to &quot;The Women&#x27;s Football Encyclopedia&quot;, during this period, &quot;powder bowl&quot; events were &quot;unusual and nonrecurring, and they were universally treated by the press as more farce than competitive football.&quot;

=== Early participation ===
The first recorded instance of women playing football in the United States was in 1892, when students at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women played with &quot;modified tackling rules&quot;. Starting in the 1890s, there were also numerous articles alluding to students at women&#x27;s colleges playing football, at Wellesley College in Massachusetts and at Vassar College in New York. However, sports historian Katie Taylor questions the veracity of these accounts, and suggests that any games that did take place at Seven Sisters schools during these years were informal rather than competitive.

On November 21, 1896, a men&#x27;s social club in New York set up a scrimmage between two teams of five women each, wearing the colors of Yale and Princeton, outside the casino at Sulzer&#x27;s Harlem River Park, as entertainment before a masked ball. &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that after only a few plays, the local police captain had to step in to halt the event, after the crowd of men watching the women tackling each other started pushing, and it looked like someone could get crushed. In 1897, the San Francisco Grays played against the Oakland Browns, winning 20 to 8, in a women&#x27;s football game played at the Velodrome under rugby rules.

=== 1920s ===
On December 8, 1922, Maui High School in the Territory of Hawaii held the first of two girls&#x27; football games that month with a team of sophomores and seniors playing against a team of juniors and freshman. &quot;The Maui News&quot; described it as &quot;a game which afforded much amusement to the masculine element&quot;, but also noted that &quot;The Hi girls proved that when it comes to grit, they&#x27;re there with the goods.&quot; In 1925, a woman&#x27;s football game played at San Jose State Teachers&#x27; College between two teams drawn from the school&#x27;s gymnasium classes was covered by the Associated Press and &quot;The New York Times.&quot;

On November 6, 1926, the Frankford Yellow Jackets of Philadelphia, who went on to win the NFL championship that year, featured &quot;Lady Yellow Jackets&quot; as halftime entertainment during their game against the Chicago Cardinals, in front of an audience of 8,000. Although the NFL connection has led many to pinpoint this event as the start of women&#x27;s football, a detailed account in the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot; makes it clear that it was nothing more than a comedy act. The eleven Lady Yellow Jackets danced the Charleston, and the team they faced consisted of two old men. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that this was more than a one-time event, or that other NFL franchises had similar ladies&#x27; &quot;teams&quot;.

=== 1930s ===
A few women&#x27;s football leagues emerged in the 1930s, including one in Ohio in 1934 and another in Los Angeles in 1939, but were short-lived.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
The women&#x27;s game started to formalize in the 1960s, after entrepreneur Sid Friedman founded the Women&#x27;s Professional Football League in 1965.

==Women in college and professional football==

Of the women who have seen action in men&#x27;s college and pro football, almost all have been in special teams positions that are protected from physical contact. The first professional player was a placekick holder (a position usually occupied by a person who holds another position on the team), while the best known female college football players were all placekickers, with all having primarily played women&#x27;s soccer prior to converting.

Patricia Palinkas is on record as being the first female professional football player, having played for the Orlando Panthers of the Atlantic Coast Football League in 1970. Palinkas was a placekick holder for her placekicker husband.

On October 18, 1997, Liz Heaston became the first woman to play and score in a college football game, kicking two extra points. Prior to this game, female athletes at Duke and Louisville had come close to playing in a game but did not. In 2001, Ashley Martin became the second female athlete to score in a college football game, this time in the NCAA.

In 2003, Katie Hnida became the first woman to score in an NCAA Division I-A game. She accomplished this as placekicker for the University of New Mexico Lobos on August 30, 2003. She later became the second professional player, when she signed with the Fort Wayne FireHawks.

Julie Harshbarger, a placekicker for numerous Chicago-based Continental Indoor Football League teams, became the first female player to win a most valuable player award in an otherwise all-male league in 2014. By kicking five field goals that season, she earned the title of special teams player of the year, leading all kickers in the league in scoring; with a career spanning seven seasons, Harshbarger&#x27;s career was the longest documented of any woman playing in a predominantly men&#x27;s professional league.

In 2020, Sarah Fuller became the first woman to play in a Power Five football game when she took the opening kickoff of the second half of the Vanderbilt Commodores&#x27; game against the Missouri Tigers with a 30-yard squib kick on November 28, 2020. The term &quot;Power Five&quot; was not in use when Katie Hnida became the first woman to score in an NCAA Division I-A game in 2003; Hnida played at the Mountain West Conference, which did not have Automatic Qualifying status in the Bowl Championship Series.)

Jennifer Welter became the first female skill position player at the male professional level by playing as a running back in the Texas Revolution in 2014.

To date, no women have ever played a line position above the high school level. Holley Mangold, whose brother Nick played several years in the NFL and who herself played as a lineswoman in high school, declined to further pursue football in college, fearing she had no chance to play professionally as a woman; she later went on to become an Olympic weightlifter.

Brittanee Jacobs is the first female football coach at the collegiate level. She helped coach safeties at Central Methodist University during the 2012 season. Welter became the first female coach at the professional level when she took a preseason position with the Arizona Cardinals in 2015; a year later, Kathryn Smith, who had spent several years as a front office assistant, took a quality control coaching position with the Buffalo Bills, making her the first permanent female coach in National Football League history. In 2020, Callie Brownson became the first woman to coach an NFL position group in a regular-season game when she filled in for the Cleveland Browns tight ends coach Drew Petzing.

In 2013, Lauren Silberman became the first woman to try out at the NFL Regional Scouting Combine (2013). Silberman tried out for the NFL after playing club soccer in college and taking up kicking footballs as a hobby several months before the tryout. During her tryout, she met with medical staff to address a leg injury after making two kicks, and did not complete the remaining kicks.

==International competition==
The world governing body for American football associations, the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), held the first Women&#x27;s World Cup in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2010. Six nations participated in the inaugural event: Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. The United States won the gold by beating Canada, 66–0. The 2013 World Championship, in Finland, was held from 30 June 2013 to 7 July 2013. The United States won gold again, beating Sweden 84-0 and Germany 107–7 in order to make it to the gold medal match with Canada, whom they beat 64–0. In the 2017 IFAF Women&#x27;s World Championship, held in Canada, the six teams invited were; Australia, Canada, Finland, Great Britain, Mexico and the United States. The United States continued their dominance, claiming gold, while Canada and Mexico won silver and bronze respectively.

IFAF has confirmed Palma, located on the Spanish island of Mallorca, Spain as host for 2021 IFAF Flag Football World Championship from October 6 to 10 2021. It will be the first time Spain has staged the World Championships which have been held since 1998. Normally conducted every two years, Denmark was scheduled to host the 2020 edition only for it to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<doc id="193870" wikidata="Q228611" url="?curid=193870" title="Melina Mercouri">
<text>Maria Amalia &quot;Melina&quot; Mercouri (, 18 October 1920 – 6 March 1994) was a Greek actress, singer, activist, and politician. She came from a political family that was prominent over multiple generations. She received an Academy Award nomination and won a French Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her performance in the film &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; (1960) and an Italian David di Donatello for Topkapi. Mercouri was also nominated for one Tony Award, three Golden Globes and two BAFTA Awards in her acting career. In 1987 she was awarded a special prize in the first edition of the Europe Theatre Prize.

Mercouri was a member of the Hellenic Parliament, elected as a representative of PASOK. In October 1981, she became the first female Minister of Culture and Sports. She has the longest tenure of any of Greece&#x27;s Ministers of Culture, having served from 1981 to 1989, and then from 1993 until her death in 1994, during PASOK governments. Mercouri&#x27;s political activism included her long campaign for the return of the Parthenon Marbles. One of her greatest achievements was the establishment of the European Capitals of Culture, with Athens chosen as the first capital in 1985.

==Biography==
=== Family ===
The Mercouri family were an Arvanite family from Argolida who settled in Athens. Its members had fought in the Greek war of independence of 1821. Melina&#x27;s grandfather, Spyridon Mercouris, had served for many years as mayor of Athens. Her father, Stamatis Mercouris, was an officer of the cavalry and served as a member of parliament and minister (People&#x27;s Party, National Radical Party), and for many years he participated in the administration of the Panathinaikos team. During the Axis occupation of Greece, Stamatis Mercouris founded the resistance organisation Rizospastiki Organosis (&quot;Radical Organisation&quot;) in January 1942.

Melina&#x27;s mother, Irene Lappa, was the sister of Admiral Pyrros Lappas, who served as Chief of the Naval Staff, Secretary General of the Olympic Games Committee and Chief of the Military House of King Paul. Melina&#x27;s uncle, George S. Mercouris, held extreme right-wing political views. He was a founder of the Greek National Socialist Party and a governor of the National Bank during the occupation. This so angered the Mercouri family that they refused to attend his funeral in 1943.

=== Education ===
In September 1938, she was accepted at the Drama School of the National Theatre with fellow students including Despo Diamantidou and Alexis Damianos.

=== Marriage ===
In the winter of 1939 she married the much older wealthy landowner Panagis Harokopos. She travelled as Melina Harokopou or Melina Charocopou. 

=== During the occupation ===
During the occupation, Melina became romantically involved with businessman Phidias Yadikiaroglou while still married to Harokopos although their marital relationship had effectively ended. 

Mercouri was later criticized for living in comfort in a 400 sq. m. apartment at avenue Akademias 4, much of which had been commandeered by the Germans at a time when the Greek people were starving, and for not contributing to the national resistance. Melina had commented on this period of her life, both in her autobiography, &quot;I was born a Greek,&quot; and on television as Minister of Culture, taking responsibility for her non-participation in the Resistance during the Occupation.

Lycurgos Kallergis, a member of EAM and the Left during the Occupation, said: &quot;Although I was and am a left-winger, the issue of the opulence in which she lived did not bother me. After all, Melina was hosting people, feeding people, helping friends.[...] &quot; The great Greek writer Alkis Zei also agrees with this view, stating that during the period of occupation, Melina was hiding left-wingers and giving them money.

At the same time, her brother, Spyros Mercouris, had joined the Resistance as a member of the EPON. Many times, according to testimonies, Melina would secretly take Yadikiaroglou&#x27;s money and give it to her brother for the Resistance, hiding both him and his comrades in the organization while helping her impoverished colleagues. It was known that during the occupation, despite her then-husband&#x27;s objections, Melina&#x27;s house, on her own instruction, was always open and welcoming to many people in need, providing them with food and shelter.

Despite occasional criticisms, her dislike of the Nazi occupiers is demonstrated by an incident during the occupation where she disobeyed SS men while at a bar, despite the threat of being shot.

A number of people with strong resistance activities during the occupation became close friends of hers, including writer Iakovos Kambanellis (who wrote &#x27;Stella with the Red Gloves&#x27; especially for her), actress Olympia Papadouka, actor Manos Katrakis, actor and secretary of the EAM theatre Dimitris Myrat, writer Alkis Zei, director Nikos Koundouros, and Manolis Glezos.

During the civil war, although Melina Mercouri lived in Kolonaki, which was controlled by the British, she visited her friends and colleagues who had been arrested for their political beliefs. Years later, Aleka Paizi gratefully recounted Melina&#x27;s visit to the prison where she was being held, to support her.

=== Later relationships ===
In the late 1940s, Melina met Pyrros Spyromilios, whom she was with for seven years. He was alleged to be the great love of her life before she met Jules Dassin. Pyrros Spyromilios was a naval officer and a hero of the Albanian front. He died in March 1961 due to heart hypertrophy, which devastated Melina, even though five years had passed since their separation.

In 1955 she starred in her first feature film, &quot;Stella&quot;. The film competed at the Cannes Film Festival and during its screening, she met and fell in love with Julius &quot;Jules&quot; Dassin. She was married to him until the end of her life.

==Performing career==
===Early years on stage===
After her graduation, Mercouri joined the National Theatre of Greece and played the role of Electra in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; in 1945. In 1949, she had her first major success in the theatre playing Blanche DuBois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, staged by Karolos Koun&#x27;s Art Theatre.

After 1950 she moved to Paris, where she appeared in boulevard plays by Jacques Deval and Marcel Achard, and met French playwrights and novelists such as Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Colette and Françoise Sagan. In 1953, Mercouri received the Marika Kotopouli Prize. Mercouri returned to Greece in 1955. At the Kotopouli-Rex Theatre, Mercouri starred in &quot;Macbeth&quot; by William Shakespeare and &quot;L&#x27;Alouette&quot; by Jean Anouilh.

===International success===

Mercouri&#x27;s first film was the Greek language film &quot;Stella&quot; (1955), directed by Michael Cacoyannis, later known for &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964). The motion picture received special praise at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, where she met expatriate American film director Jules Dassin, with whom she would share not only her career but also her life. Their first professional pairing was &quot;He Who Must Die&quot; (1957). Other films by Dassin and featuring Mercouri followed, such as &quot;The Law&quot; (1959).

She garnered international acclaim when she starred in &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; (1960), of which Dassin was the director and co-star. For this film, she earned the Best Actress Award at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

After this, she starred in &quot;Phaedra&quot; (1962), for which she was nominated again for Best Actress in the BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. Her role in &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964) garnered her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The directors with whom Mercouri worked included Joseph Losey, Vittorio De Sica, Ronald Neame, Carl Foreman, and Norman Jewison. She starred in the Spanish language film &quot;The Uninhibited&quot; (1965) by Juan Antonio Bardem.

On June 11, 1967, Mercouri appeared on one of the final episodes of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; (the venerable panel show would leave the air that fall, after eighteen years). After the panel were blindfolded, a strange man appeared onstage and proclaimed himself &quot;the second mystery guest&quot;. Host John Daly quickly called for &quot;the relieving unit&quot; and said, &quot;schedule two&quot; (a code word used on live broadcasts in case of an emergency: the cameras are turned to a neutral position and the sound is cut off). The man talked a bit about a dating service he apparently owned before being hustled off the stage by announcer Johnny Olson and executive producer Gil Fates. Daly merely apologized to the panel, and the program continued. 

Mercouri continued her stage career in the Greek production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1960), under the direction of Karolos Koun. In 1967, she played the leading role in &quot;Illya Darling&quot; (from 11 April 1967 to 13 January 1968) on Broadway, for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical. Mercouri&#x27;s performance in &quot;Promise at Dawn&quot; (1970) earned her another Golden Globe Award nomination.

Mercouri concentrated on her stage career in the following years, playing in the Greek productions of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; and, for a second time, &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, in addition to the ancient Greek tragedies &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Oresteia&quot;. She retired from film acting after making her last film, &quot;A Dream of Passion&quot; (1978), directed by her husband, Jules Dassin.

In 1987 the jury of the Europe Theatre Prize awarded her a special prize of the presidency with the motivation: &quot;For the devotion and the commitment of an artist who joins her own theatrical experience with the political belief and the ideal of European culture.&quot;

Mercouri&#x27;s last performance on stage was in the opera &quot;Pylades&quot; at the Athens Concert Hall in 1992, portraying Clytemnestra.

===Work as a singer===
One of her first songs was by Manos Hadjidakis and Nikos Gatsos. It was titled &quot;Hartino to Fengaraki&quot; (&quot;Papermoon&quot;) and was a part of the Greek production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 1949, in which she starred as Blanche DuBois. The first official recording of this song was made by Nana Mouskouri in 1960, although the company Sirius, created by Hadjidakis, issued a recording Mercouri made for French television during the 1960s in 2004.

Her recordings of &quot;Athenes, ma Ville&quot;, a collaboration with Vangelis, and &quot;Melinaki&quot;, were popular in France. Her recording of &quot;Feggari mou, Agapi mou&quot; (Phaedra) was later covered by Marinella in 1965.

==Political career==

===Activism against the Greek junta===
At the time of the coup d&#x27;état in Greece by a group of colonels of the Greek military on 21 April 1967, she was in the United States, playing in &quot;Illya Darling&quot; on Broadway. She immediately joined the struggle against the Greek military junta and started an international campaign, travelling all over the world to inform the public and contribute to the isolation and fall of the colonels. As a result, the dictatorial regime revoked her Greek citizenship and confiscated her property.

When her Greek citizenship was revoked, she said: &quot;I was born a Greek and I will die a Greek. Those bastards were born fascists and they will die fascists&quot;. In London, she worked with Amalia Fleming and Helen Vlachos of Kathimerini against the junta of the colonels.

===Involvement in politics===
After the fall of the Junta and during the &quot;metapolitefsi&quot; in 1974, Mercouri settled in Greece and was one of the founding members of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), a centre-left political party. She was a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee and a rapporteur for the Culture Section while being involved in the women&#x27;s movement as well.

In the Greek legislative elections of 1974, she was a PASOK candidate in the Piraeus B constituency, but the 7,500 votes were not enough to secure a seat for her in the Hellenic Parliament (she needed 33 more votes), but she was successful in the elections of 1977, after conducting a grass-roots campaign.

===Minister for Culture: 1981–1989===

When PASOK won the elections of 1981, Mercouri was appointed Minister for Culture of Greece, being the first woman in the post. She would serve in that position for two terms until 1989, when PASOK lost the elections and New Democracy formed a cabinet.

As Minister for Culture, Mercouri took advantage of her earlier career to promote Greece to other European leaders. She strongly advocated the return to Athens of the Parthenon Marbles that were removed from Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, and are now part of the British Museum collection in London.

In 1983, she engaged in a televised debate with the then director of the British Museum, David M. Wilson, which was interpreted by many as a public relations disaster for the British Museum. In anticipation of the return of the marbles, she held an international competition for the construction of the New Acropolis Museum, designated to display them and finally established in 2009.

One of her greatest achievements was the establishment of the institution of the European Capital of Culture within the framework of cultural policy of the European Union. She had conceived and proposed the idea in 1983, with Athens being the first title-holder in 1985. She was also a devoted supporter of the Athens bid to host the Centennial Olympic Games.

In 1983, during the first Greek presidency of the Council of the European Union, Mercouri invited the Ministers for Culture of the other nine member states of the European Union at Zappeion, in order to increase the people&#x27;s cultural awareness, since there was not any reference to cultural questions in the Treaty of Rome, which led to the establishment of formal sessions between the Ministers of Culture of the European Union.

During the second presidency of Greece in 1988, she supported the cooperation between Eastern Europe and the European Union, which was finally implemented one year later with the celebration of the Month of Culture in Eastern countries.

Mercouri commissioned a study to integrate all the archaeological sites of Athens to create a traffic-free archaeological park to promote the Greek culture. She introduced free access to museums and archaeological sites for Greek citizens, organized a series of exhibitions of Greek cultural heritage and modern Greek art worldwide, supported the restoration of buildings of special architectural interest and the completion of the Athens Concert Hall, and backed the establishment of the Museum of Byzantine culture in Thessaloniki.

In June 1986, Melina Mercouri spoke at the Oxford Union, the debating society, on the matter of the Parthenon Marbles and whether they should remain in London or be returned to Greece. She argued passionately for the Marbles&#x27; reunification. She said the Marbles are more to Greece than just works of art: they are an essential element of Greek heritage, which ties directly into cultural identity. She said: &quot;You must understand what the Parthenon Marbles mean to us. They are our pride. They are our sacrifices. They are our noblest symbol of excellence. They are a tribute to the democratic philosophy. They are our aspirations and our name. They are the essence of Greekness.&quot;

===Minister for Culture: 1993–1994===
In the legislative elections of November 1989, PASOK lost and Mercouri was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament and remained a member of the party&#x27;s Executive Bureau. In 1990, she was a candidate for Mayor of Athens but she was defeated by Antonis Tritsis.

After PASOK&#x27;s win in the election of 1993, she was reappointed to the Ministry for Culture. Her major goals in this brief second term in office were: to create a cultural park in the Aegean Sea in order to protect and enhance the environment and civilization of the Aegean Islands, and to link culture with education at all education levels, introducing a system of post-training of teachers.

==Death==
Mercouri died on 6 March 1994 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, from lung cancer.

Her sole immediate survivor was her husband, Jules Dassin. The couple had no children. She received a state funeral with Prime Minister&#x27;s honours. She was buried at the First Cemetery of Athens four days later.

The Melina Mercouri Foundation was founded by her widower. After her death, UNESCO established the Melina Mercouri International Prize for the Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes (UNESCO-Greece) which rewards outstanding examples of action to safeguard and enhance the world&#x27;s major cultural landscapes.

<doc id="193872" wikidata="Q212068" url="?curid=193872" title="Jean-Jacques Dessalines">
<text>Jean-Jacques Dessalines (Haitian Creole: &quot;Jan-Jak Desalin&quot;; ; 20 September 1758 – 17 October 1806) was the first Haitian Emperor, leader of the Haitian Revolution, and the first ruler of an independent Haiti under the 1805 constitution. Initially regarded as governor-general, Dessalines was later named Emperor of Haiti as Jacques I (1804–1806) by generals of the Haitian Revolutionary army and ruled in that capacity until being assassinated in 1806. He spearheaded the resistance against French rule of Saint-Domingue, and eventually became the architect of the 1804 massacre of the remaining French residents of newly independent Haiti, including some supporters of the revolution. Alongside Toussaint Louverture, he has been referred to as one of the fathers of the nation of Haiti. Dessalines was directly responsible for the country, and, under his rule, Haiti became the first country in the Americas to permanently abolish slavery.

Dessalines served as an officer in the French army when Saint-Domingue was fending off Spanish and British incursions. Later he rose to become a commander in the revolt against France. As Toussaint Louverture&#x27;s principal lieutenant, he led many successful engagements, including the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot.

In 1802, Louverture was betrayed and captured, and sent to prison in France, where he died. Thereafter, Dessalines became the leader of the revolution and Général-Chef de l&#x27;Armée Indigène on 18 May 1803. His forces defeated the French army at the Battle of Vertières on 18 November 1803. Saint-Domingue was declared independent on 29 November and then as the independent Republic of Haiti on 1 January 1804, under the leadership of Dessalines, chosen by a council of generals to assume the office of governor-general.

Fearing a new French military expedition and the annihilation of the black population, he ordered the 1804 Haitian massacre of the remaining French population in Haiti, resulting in the deaths of between 3,000 and 5,000 people, including women and children, and an exodus of thousands of refugees. Some modern historians classify the massacre as a genocide due to its systemic nature. Notably, he excluded surviving Polish Legionnaires, who had defected from the French legion to become allied with the enslaved Africans, as well as the Germans who did not take part in the slave trade. He granted them full citizenship under the constitution and classified them as &quot;black&quot;, along with all other Haitian citizens. Tensions remained with the minority of mixed-race or free people of color, who had gained some education and property during the colonial period. 

As Emperor, Dessalines enforced plantation labor to promote the economy and began a dictatorship. In 1806, he was assassinated by members of his own administration and dismembered by a violent mob shortly thereafter. 

For much of the 19th century, Dessalines was generally reviled by Haitians for his autocratic ways. But by the beginning of the 20th century, Dessalines began to be reassessed as an icon of Haitian nationalism. The national anthem of Haiti, &quot;&quot;, written in 1903, is named in his honor.

== Early life ==
Of Afro-Caribbean origin, Jean-Jacques Duclos was born into slavery on Cormier, a plantation near Grande-Riviere-du-Nord, Saint-Domingue. His enslaved father had adopted the surname from his owner Henri Duclos. The names of Jean-Jacques&#x27;s parents, as well as their region of origin in Africa, are not known. Most slaves trafficked to Saint-Domingue were from west and central West Africa. He later took the surname Dessalines, after a free man of color who had purchased him.

Working in the sugarcane fields as a laborer, Dessalines rose to the rank of &quot;commandeur&quot;, or foreman. He worked on Duclos&#x27;s plantation until he was about 30 years old. Still enslaved, Jean-Jacques was bought by a man with the last name of Dessalines, an &quot;affranchi&quot; or free man of color, who assigned his own surname to Jean-Jacques. From then on he was called Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Dessalines kept this name after he gained his freedom. He worked for that master for about three years.

When the slave uprising of 1791 began, it spread across the Plaine-du-Nord. This was an area of very large sugar cane plantations, where the mass of enslaved Africans lived and worked. Mortality was so high that French colonial planters continued to buy more enslaved people from Africa during the eighteenth century. Dessalines received his early military training from a woman whose name was either Victoria Montou or Akbaraya Tòya.

Dessalines became increasingly embittered toward both the whites and &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; (the mixed-race residents of Saint-Domingue) in the years of conflict during the revolution. Haitian insurgents fought against French colonists and foreign troops in Saint-Domingue. During the years of warfare and changing rule, these included French, British, and Spanish forces. All three European nations had colonies in the Caribbean, where their control and revenues were threatened by the Haitian Revolution.

After the expulsion of French forces during the last phase of the Haitian Revolution, Dessalines ordered all remaining Europeans (overwhelmingly French people) in the new Republic of Haiti to be killed, men, women and children, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population. Many free people of color were also killed. Yet, after declaring himself Governor-for-Life in 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines took his old master Dessalines into his house and gave him a job.

== Family ==
Dessalines was married to Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité Bonheur from the city of Léogane. The wedding celebration took place in St-Marc Church and Toussaint Louverture was the witness. Marie-Claire was empress under the 1805 Constitution, and she has been credited with the concoction of the soup lendepandans or Pumpkin Independence Soup, now a UNESCO Patrimoine. She was older than her husband and died when she was 100 years old. She was referred to as the adopted wife of the Nation in a letter by Pétion after the Emperor&#x27;s assassination. The couple had or adopted a total number of 16 children including Jacques&#x27; from the previous relationship. Innocent, one of his sons, has a fort named in his honor. Dessalines offered one of his daughters to Pétion in an attempt to relieve racial tensions, as Pétion was the most prominent mulatto figure, but Pétion refused under the pretext that she was in a relationship with Chancy, one of Toussaint&#x27;s nephews.

Euphémie Daguile, one of his best known concubines, was the choreographer of the Karabiyen dance known also as Jacques&#x27; favorite dance. It is still danced by Haitian families all over the country.

Dessalines had two brothers, Louis and Joseph Duclos, who also later took the surname Dessalines. Two of his brothers&#x27; sons became high-ranking members of the post-Revolutionary Haitian government.

== Revolution ==

===Ending slavery===
In 1791, along with thousands of other enslaved persons, Jean-Jacques Dessalines joined the slave rebellion of the northern plains led by Jean François Papillon and Georges Biassou. This rebellion was the first action of what would become the Haitian Revolution. Dessalines became a lieutenant in Papillon&#x27;s army and followed him to Santo Domingo, occupying the eastern half of the island, where he enlisted to serve Spain&#x27;s military forces against the French colony of Saint-Domingue. During that period, Dessalines met the rising military commander Toussaint Bréda (later known as Toussaint Louverture), a mature man also born into slavery. He was fighting with Spanish forces on Hispaniola. These men wanted above all to defeat slavery. In 1794, after the French declared an end to slavery as a result of the French Revolution, Toussaint Louverture switched allegiances to the French. He fought for the French Republic against both the Spanish and British, who were trying to get control of the lucrative colony of Saint-Domingue. Dessalines followed, becoming a chief lieutenant to Toussaint Louverture and rising to the rank of brigadier general by 1799.

Dessalines commanded many successful engagements, including the captures of Jacmel, Petit-Goâve, Miragoâne and Anse-à-Veau. In 1801, Dessalines quickly ended an insurrection in the north led by Louverture&#x27;s nephew, General Moyse. Dessalines gained a reputation for his &quot;take no prisoners&quot; policy, and for burning homes and entire villages to the ground.

The rebellious slaves were able to restore most of Saint-Domingue to France, with Louverture in control. The French initially appointed him as governor-general of the colony. Louverture wanted Saint-Domingue to have more autonomy. He directed the creation of a new constitution to establish that, as well as rules for how the colony would operate under freedom. He also named himself governor-for-life, while still swearing his loyalty to France.

The French government had been through changes after the Revolution and was by then led by Napoleon Bonaparte. His wife, Josephine de Beauharnais, was from a slave-owning family. But many white and mulatto planters had been lobbying the government to reimpose slavery in Saint-Domingue. Napoleon was committed to restoring slavery in Saint-Domingue in an effort to restore the basis of the labor to cultivate and process the great sugar crops. Saint-Domingue generated the highest profits of any of the French colonies prior to the Revolution in 1791.

===Resisting the Leclerc campaign===

The French dispatched an expeditionary force in 1802 to restore French rule to the island, an army and ships led by General Charles Leclerc. Louverture and Dessalines fought against the invading French forces, with Dessalines fighting them at the battle for which he is most famous, Crête-à-Pierrot.

During the 11 March 1802 battle, Dessalines and his 1,300 men defended a small fort against 18,000 attackers. To inspire his troops at the start of the battle, he waved a lit torch near an open powder keg and declared that he would blow the fort up should the French break through. The defenders inflicted extensive casualties on the attacking army, but after a 20-day siege, they were forced to abandon the fort due to a shortage of food and munitions. The rebels forced their way through the enemy lines and into the Cahos Mountains, with their army still largely intact.

The French soldiers under Leclerc were accompanied by mulatto troops led by Alexandre Pétion and André Rigaud, free &quot;gens de couleur&quot; from Saint-Domingue. Pétion and Rigaud, both sons of wealthy white fathers, had opposed Louverture&#x27;s leadership. They had tried to establish separate independence in the South of Saint-Domingue, an area where wealthy &quot;gens de couleur&quot; were concentrated in plantations. Toussaint Louverture&#x27;s forces had defeated them three years earlier.

After the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot, Dessalines defected from his long-time ally Louverture and briefly sided with Leclerc, Pétion, and Rigaud. Several historians attribute Dessalines with being at least partially responsible for Louverture&#x27;s arrest, as did Louverture&#x27;s son Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines &quot;learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote Leclerc to denounce Louverture&#x27;s conduct as &#x27;extraordinary&#x27;.&quot; For this action, Dessalines and his spouse received gifts from Jean Baptiste Brunet. Louverture and a hundred members of his inner circle were arrested by Brunett on 7 June 1802, and deported to France. Louverture was imprisoned at Fort-de-Joux in Doubs, where he died on 7 April 1803, at the age of 59.

When it became apparent that the French intended to re-establish slavery on Saint-Domingue, as they had on Guadeloupe, Dessalines and Pétion switched sides again in October 1802, to oppose the French. By November 1802, Dessalines had become the leader of the alliance with the blessing of Pétion, the most prominent of the &quot;affranchis&quot;, or free men of color. Leclerc died of yellow fever, which also killed many of the French troops under his command. The brutal tactics of Leclerc&#x27;s successor, Rochambeau, helped to unify rebel forces against the French.

The rebels achieved a series of victories, culminating in the last major battle of the revolution, the Battle of Vertières. On 18 November 1803, black and mulatto forces under Dessalines and Pétion attacked the fort of Vertières, held by Rochambeau, near Cap-Français in the north. Rochambeau and his troops surrendered the next day. On 4 December 1803, the French colonial army of Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered its last remaining territory to Dessalines&#x27;s forces. This officially ended the only slave rebellion in world history which successfully established an independent nation.

In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in Haiti&#x27;s struggle against Napoleonic France. Dessalines promulgated the Declaration of Independence in 1804, and declared himself emperor.

==Emperor of independent Haiti==
 On 1 January 1804, from the city of Gonaïves, Dessalines officially declared the former colony&#x27;s independence and renamed it &quot;Ayiti&quot; after the indigenous Taíno name. He had served as Governor-General of Saint-Domingue since 30 November 1803. After the declaration of independence, Dessalines named himself Governor-General-for-life of Haiti and served in that role until 22 September 1804, when he was proclaimed Emperor of Haiti by the generals of the Haitian Revolutionary army. He was crowned Emperor Jacques I in a coronation ceremony on 6 October in the city of Le Cap (now Cap-Haïtien). On 20 May 1805, his government released the imperial constitution, naming Jean-Jacques Dessalines emperor for life with the right to name his successor.

In 1805, after crowning himself Emperor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines invaded in the eastern part of the island, reaching Santo Domingo before retreating in the face of a French naval squadron. As Emperor, Dessalines enforced plantation labor to promote the economy and began a dictatorship. He disappointed many —the newly freed 80% of the population—who felt his rule evoked the slavery they had faced before the revolution. —those freed before the revolution, often mulattoes—were angered by his plans to reallocate land to the . As well, high-ranking military officials began to object to his rule.
===Abolition of slavery===
In declaring Haiti an independent country, Dessalines also confirmed the abolition of slavery in the new country. Haiti became the first country in the Americas to permanently abolish slavery. Dessalines tried to keep the sugar industry and plantations running and producing without slavery.

After having served enslaved under colonialists masters for 30 years, as well as having seen many atrocities, Dessalines did not trust the colonialists. Many white colonialists planters and merchants, in addition to free people of color, had already fled the island as refugees, going to Cuba, the United States, and France. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines ordered a massacre of the remaining colonists in Haiti, an event that came to be called the 1804 Haiti massacre. In the Haitian Constitution of 1805, Dessalines declared Haiti to be an all-black nation and forbade white colonists from owning property or land there. Property that belonged to white colonists was declared to be &quot;by incontestable right confiscated to the benefit of the state.&quot;

===Economic policies===
Dessalines enforced a harsh regimen of plantation labor, described by the historian Michel-Rolph Trouillot as &quot;caporalisme agraire&quot; (agrarian militarism). As had Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines demanded that all blacks work either as soldiers to defend the nation or as laborers on the plantations, in order to raise commodity crops for export and to help sustain the nation. His forces were strict in enforcing this, to the extent that some blacks felt as if they were again enslaved.

Dessalines also believed in the tight regulation of foreign trade, which was essential for Haiti&#x27;s sugar and coffee-based export economy. Like Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines encouraged merchants from Britain and the United States over those from France. For his administration, Dessalines needed literate and educated officials and managers. He placed in these positions well-educated Haitians, who were disproportionately from the light-skinned elite, as &quot;gens de couleur&quot; were most likely to have been educated.

== Death ==

Disaffected members of Dessalines&#x27;s administration, including Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe, began a conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor, and Haitians began an insurrection in the south in August 1806, which culminated in Dessalines being assassinated north of the capital city, Port-au-Prince, at Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge), on 17 October 1806, on his way to fight the rebels.

The exact circumstances of Dessalines&#x27; death are uncertain. Some historians claim that he was killed at Pétion&#x27;s house at Rue l&#x27;Enterrement, after a meeting to negotiate the power and the future of the young nation. One report say that Dessalines was shot, stabbed, stripped, and had his fingers cut off, before his corpse was brought to Port-au-Prince, where it was stoned by crowds and said to resemble &quot;scraps&quot; and &quot;shapeless remains&quot;. Some reports say that he was arrested and was dealt a deadly blow to the head. Another report says he was ambushed and killed at first fire. Yet another account recalls a brutal attack on Dessalines by his own men; it says that after being shot, his head was split open by a sabre&#x27;s blow and he was finally stabbed three times with a dagger, with the crowd shouting &quot;the tyrant is killed&quot;. Most reports confirm that a mob dismembered Dessalines&#x27; body in a public square after he was killed. 

Multiple modern sources state that there was resistance to providing Dessalines with a proper burial after his assassination, but a named Dédée Bazile gathered the mutilated corpse of the Emperor and buried it in the Cimetière intérieur of Church Ste-Anne. A tomb was raised by Étienne Gérin&#x27;s wife with the inscription: &quot;Ci-git Dessalines, mort à 48 ans&quot; (&quot;Here lies Dessalines, died at 48 years old&quot;). Dessalines&#x27; body was later moved to the &quot;Autel de la Patrie&quot; (Altar of the Nation) in the Champs-de-Mars alongside Pétion&#x27;s body. A monument at the northern entrance of the Haitian capital marks the place where the Emperor was killed.

This assassination did not solve the tensions within the Haitian government. His murder left a power vacuum and civil war ensued. Pétion and Christophe temporarily partitioned Haiti between them, with Pétion controlling the South, where there were more &quot;gens de couleur libre.&quot;

== Family ==
Several of Dessalines&#x27;s relatives also had leadership roles:
*His nephew Raymond, son of his brother Louis, became Maréchal de Camp Monsieur Raymond Dessalines, created 1st Baron de Louis Dessalines on 8 April 1811. He served as an aide-de-camp to King Henry I, privy councillor, and secretary-general of the Ministry of War between 1811 and 1820. He was a member of the Royal Chamber of Public Instruction between 1818 and 1820; he received the degree of Knight of the Order of St. Henry on 1 May 1811. He was killed by revolutionaries at Cap-Henri on 10 October 1820.
*His nephew Joseph, son of his brother of the same name, became Maréchal de Camp Monsieur Dessalines, created 1st Baron de Joseph Dessalines in 1816. He served as chamberlain to Prince Jacques-Victor Henry, the Prince Royal of Haiti, and major of the Grenadiers de la Garde. He received the degree of Knight of the Order of St. Henry on 28 October 1815.
*His grandson Florvil Hyppolite was president of Haiti from 1889 to 1896.
== Legacy ==
For much of the 19th century, Dessalines was generally reviled by Haitians for his autocratic ways. But by the beginning of the 20th century, Dessalines began to be reassessed as an icon of Haitian nationalism. The national anthem of Haiti, &quot;&quot;, written in 1903, is named in his honor. 

The main street in Port-au-Prince (Grande-Rue) was renamed Boulevard Jean-Jacques-Dessalines in his honor. It is the main commercial in the downtown area going from the north part to the south part. Many streets, avenues, and boulevards in Haiti carry the name of Dessalines, Jean-Jacques, or Jacques 1st. There are statues of him in Port-au-Prince, Gonaïves, Cap-Haïtien, many other cities in Haiti, and even in former Grand-Colombia.

<text>Never on Sunday (, ) is a 1960 Greek romantic comedy film starring, written by and directed by Jules Dassin.

The film tells the story of Ilya, a contented Greek prostitute (Melina Mercouri), and Homer (Dassin), an earnest American classicist. Homer attempts to steer her toward morality while Ilya attempts to make Homer more relaxed. The original screenplay examines the impact of intellectual imperialism upon indigenous Joie de vivre. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion plus &quot;hooker with a heart of gold&quot; story.

The film&#x27;s bouzouki theme became a hit and the film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song (Manos Hadjidakis for &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;). It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Mercouri), Best Costume Design, Black-and-White, Best Director and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay as Written Directly for the Screen (both Dassin). Mercouri won the award for Best Actress at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival.

==Synopsis==
Ilya, a self-employed, free-spirited prostitute who lives in the port of Piraeus in Greece, meets Homer Thrace, an American tourist and classical scholar and passionate Philhellene. Homer feels that Ilya&#x27;s promiscuity typifies the epicurean degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality while Ilya attempts to relax him and avoid his getting into unnecessary arguments and fights.

==Plot==
Self-employed prostitute and free spirit Ilya, in the port city of Piraeus, Greece, has a dedicated following of preferred “clients” whom she entertains at weekly receptions on Sundays, a day she takes off from “business.” At the shipyard, when Ilya impulsively strips off her clothes to dive in for a dip in the ocean in her underwear, she challenges the “slaves” to join her, and many workers enthusiastically dive in. On his first day, Tonio, a half-Italian worker, becomes infatuated with the beautiful Ilya. He learns that popular Ilya “sets no prices and only goes with a client if she likes him.” When Tonio asks Ilya if he has a chance with her that evening, Ilya teases him, saying she will be busy with the baker, the fruit man, and the butcher. Tonio becomes determined to win over Ilya exclusively for himself.

Homer Thrace, an American scholar of classical Hellenic culture, believes that Ilya personifies how Greek culture decayed due to living by Stoic and Epicurean philosophies. According to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as Homer believes, the great happiness is the joy of understanding. By contrast, Ilya sees life through her own idiosyncratic perspective, filtering out the negative. When Homer accompanies Ilya to see a performance of the classical drama &quot;Medea&quot;, Ilya sees Medea as a caring mother and wife who tricks her husband to win him back from a rival. Ilya refuses to accept that Medea is a ruthless wife who kills her own children to take revenge on her husband. Homer finds Ilya’s relentlessly upbeat perspective incomprehensible. Despite Ilya’s clients urging Homer to leave Ilya as she is, Homer sees himself as Pygmalion, determined to mold Ilya into Galatea, reforming the prostitute to a happy moral life.

“Noface”, whose naked face behind large sunglasses no one ever sees, owns apartment houses where prostitutes pay him high “rents” to work. The prostitutes threaten to strike unless Noface lowers the rents. Noface considers the independent Ilya a bad example. Despo, leader of the striking prostitutes, appeals to Ilya, who has influence, to encourage all the prostitutes to stop working to join the strike. Noface offers to finance Homer’s experiment to reform Ilya, suggesting Homer “buy” Ilya’s time. Since they both have the same goal of putting Ilya out of business, though for different reasons, Homer accepts the money from Noface. To this end, Homer proposes to Ilya to conduct a two-week experiment, offering to pay her for her exclusive time to give her lessons in classical subjects and culture.

Ilya attempts to please Homer by studying the books and listening to the records he gives her but is bored. Meanwhile Ilya’s clients, including Tonio, are disgruntled when denied her services. When Ilya hears the whistle of a ship arriving, she is unhappy that she must study rather than party with the sailors.

At the end of the two-week period, when Noface pays Homer for his expenses, Despo sees the transaction and immediately informs Ilya. Ilya reacts by leading the other prostitutes in their strike against Noface, refusing to work and throwing their headboards and mattresses out the windows. The prostitutes are arrested, but Noface’s lawyer pays their fines and negotiates with Ilya to reduce the rents by 50%. Tonio and his friends arrive to get Ilya, taking her to their local bar, where typically, Homer is in trouble because the know-it-all has told the guitar player that he is not a real musician if he cannot read music.

Homer tells Ilya that she’s beautiful but dumb, and he laments that he wanted to save her. Tonio replies, &quot;Ilya is not a symbol, she’s a woman.&quot; Homer tells Ilya that indeed he wanted to make love to her but restrained himself. Tonio declares its “too late” because he is going to take Ilya back to Italy for a new life, sweeping Ilya off her feet and carrying her away. The bar owner tells Homer, “If anyone will save Ilya, it will be Tonio…because with love, it’s possible.”

Homer boards a ship back to the US, throwing away his notes.

&quot;And they all go to the seashore!&quot;

== Reception ==
When the film was first released in Italy in 1960, the Committee for the Theatrical Review of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities rated it as VM16, not suitable for children under 16. The committee also demanded dialogue modifications and the excision of explicit scenes.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the movie as a &quot;droll and robust spoof&quot; and commended Mercouri&#x27;s and Dassin&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; performances:It is the bouncing and beaming expansiveness with which Miss Mercouri endows this woman and the patience with which Mr. Dassin tries to urge her to simmer down, to assume a little moral decorum and abandon some of her non-intellectual and professional whims, that make for tremendous good humor... **** While one might take some minor exception to the occasional illogic of the script, it&#x27;s no use, since illogic is the human disposition most frankly acknowledged and happily applauded in this film.
==Home media==
MGM released &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; on VHS in 2000 as part of its Vintage Classics lineup.

==Stage adaptation==
Dassin and Mercouri adapted the film for Broadway as a musical, titled &quot;Illya Darling&quot;, starring Mercouri again in the title role. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.

<text>Clément Ader (; 2 April 1841 – 3 May 1925) was a French inventor and engineer who was born near Toulouse in Muret, Haute-Garonne, and died in Toulouse. He is remembered primarily for his pioneering work in aviation. In 1870 he was also one of the pioneers in the sport of cycling in France.

== Electrical and mechanical inventions ==
Ader was an innovator in electrical and mechanical engineering. He originally studied electrical engineering, and in 1878 improved on the telephone invented by Alexander Graham Bell. After this he established the telephone network in Paris in 1880. In 1881, he invented the théâtrophone, a system of telephonic transmission where listeners received a separate channel for each ear, enabling stereophonic perception of the actors on a set; it was this invention which gave the first stereo transmission of opera performances, over a distance of 2 miles (3 km) in 1881. In 1903, he devised a V8 engine for the Paris–Madrid race, but although three or four were produced, none was sold.

== Aircraft prototypes ==
Following his work with V8 engines, Ader turned to the problem of mechanical flight and until the end of his life gave much time and money to this. Using the studies of Louis Pierre Mouillard (1834–1897) on the flight of birds, he constructed his first flying machine in 1886, the &quot;Ader Éole&quot;. It was a bat-like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention, with 4 cylinders with a power rating of , driving a four-blade propeller. The engine weighed . The wings had a span of . All-up weight was . On 9 October 1890 Ader attempted to fly the &quot;Éole&quot;. Aviation historians give credit to this effort as a powered take-off and uncontrolled flight in ground effect of approximately at a height of approximately . Ader also claimed credit for getting off the ground in the Éole.

Ader began construction of a second aircraft he called the &quot;Avion II&quot;, also referred to as the &quot;Zephyr&quot; or &quot;Éole II&quot;. Most sources agree that work on this aircraft was never completed, and it was abandoned in favour of the &quot;Avion III&quot;. Ader&#x27;s later claim that he flew the &quot;Avion II&quot; in August 1892 for a distance of in Satory near Paris, was never widely accepted. 

Ader&#x27;s progress attracted the interest of the minister of war, Charles de Freycinet. With the backing of the French War Office, Ader developed and constructed the &quot;Avion III&quot;. It resembled an enormous bat made of linen and wood, with a wingspan, equipped with two four-bladed tractor propellers, each powered by a steam engine of . Using a circular track at Satory, Ader carried out taxiing trials on 12 October 1897 and two days later attempted a flight. After a short run the machine was caught by a gust of wind, slewed off the track, and came to a stop. After this the French army withdrew its funding, but kept the results secret. The commission released in November 1910 the official reports on Ader&#x27;s attempted flights, stating that they were unsuccessful.

== Book on aviation ==
Clément Ader remained an active proponent of the development of aviation. In 1909 he published &quot;L&#x27;Aviation Militaire&quot;, a very popular book which went through 10 editions in the five years before the First World War. It is notable for its vision of aerial warfare and for its foreseeing the form of the modern aircraft carrier, with a flat flight deck, an island superstructure, deck elevators and a hangar bay. His idea for an aircraft carrier was relayed by the US naval attaché in Paris and was followed by the first trials in the United States in November 1910.

== Influence ==

Ader is still admired for his early powered flight efforts, and his aircraft gave the French language the word &quot;&quot; for a heavier-than-air aircraft. In 1938, France issued a postage stamp honoring him. Airbus named one of its aircraft assembly sites in Toulouse after him. Clément Ader has been referred to as &quot;the father of aviation&quot;.

<text>Robert Robert Livingston (November 27, 1746 (Old Style November 16) – February 26, 1813) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat from New York, as well as a Founding Father of the United States. He was known as &quot;The Chancellor&quot; after the high New York state legal office he held for 25 years. He was a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Roger Sherman, but was recalled by the state of New York before he could sign the document. Livingston administered the oath of office to George Washington when he assumed the presidency April 30, 1789. Livingston was also elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1801.

==Early life==
Livingston was the eldest son of Judge Robert Livingston (1718–1775) and Margaret ( Beekman) Livingston, uniting two wealthy Hudson River Valley families. He had three brothers and five sisters, all of whom wed and made their homes on the Hudson River near the family seat at Clermont Manor. Among his siblings were his younger brother, Edward Livingston (1764-1836), who also served as U.S. Minister to France and Secretary of State, his sister Gertrude Livingston (1757–1833), who married Governor Morgan Lewis (1754–1844), sister Janet Livingston (d. 1824), who married Richard Montgomery (1738–1775), sister Alida Livingston (1761–1822), who married John Armstrong, Jr. (1758–1843) (who succeeded him as U.S. Minister to France), and sister Joanna Livingston (1759–1827), who married Peter R. Livingston (1766–1847).

His paternal grandparents were Robert Livingston (1688–1775) of Clermont and Margaret Howarden (1693–1758). His great-grandparents were Robert Livingston the Elder (1654–1728) and Alida (née Schuyler) Van Rensselaer Livingston, daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628–1683). His grand-uncle was Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor. Livingston, a member of a large and prominent family, was known for continually quarreling with his relatives.

Livingston graduated from King&#x27;s College in June 1765 and was admitted to the bar in 1773.

==Career==
===Recorder of New York City===
In October 1773, Livingston was appointed recorder of New York City but soon thereafter identified himself with the anti-colonial Whig Party and was replaced a few months later by John Watts, Jr.

===Chancellor of New York===
On July 30, 1777, Livingston became the first chancellor of New York, which was then the highest judicial officer in the state. Concurrently, he served from 1781 to 1783 as the first United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs under the Articles of Confederation. Livingston administered the presidential oath of office to George Washington at his first inauguration on April 30, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the nation&#x27;s capital.

In 1789, Livingston joined the Jeffersonian Republicans (later known as the Democratic-Republicans), forming an uneasy alliance with his previous rival George Clinton and Aaron Burr, then a political newcomer. Livingston opposed the Jay Treaty and other initiatives of the Federalist Party, founded and led by his former colleagues Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. He ran for governor of New York as a Democratic-Republican, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent governor John Jay in the 1798 election.

After serving as chancellor for almost 24 years, Livingston left office on June 30, 1801. During that period, he became nationally known by his title alone as &quot;The Chancellor&quot;, and even after leaving office, he was respectfully addressed as Chancellor Livingston for the remainder of his life.

=== Declaration of Independence ===
On June 11, 1776, Livingston was appointed to a committee of the Second Continental Congress, known as the Committee of Five, which was given the task of drafting the Declaration of Independence. After establishing a general outline for the document, the committee decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. The committee reviewed Jefferson&#x27;s draft, making extensive changes, before presenting Jefferson&#x27;s revised draft to Congress on June 28, 1776. Before he could sign the final version of the Declaration, Livingston was recalled by his state. However, he sent his cousin, Philip Livingston, to sign the document in his place. Another cousin, William Livingston, would go on to sign the United States Constitution.

===U.S. Minister to France===
Following Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s election as President of the United States, once Jefferson became president on March 4, 1801, he appointed Livingston U.S. minister to France. Serving from 1801 to 1804, Livingston negotiated the Louisiana Purchase. After the signing of the Louisiana Purchase agreement in 1803, Livingston made this memorable statement:

We have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives ... The United States takes rank this day among the first powers of the world.

During his time as U.S. minister to France, Livingston met Robert Fulton, with whom he developed the first viable steamboat, the &quot;North River Steamboat&quot;, whose home port was at the Livingston family home of Clermont Manor in the town of Clermont, New York. On her maiden voyage, she left New York City with him as a passenger, stopped briefly at Clermont Manor, and continued to Albany up the Hudson River, completing in just under 60 hours a journey that had previously taken nearly a week by sloop sailboat. In 1811, Fulton and Livingston became members of the Erie Canal Commission.

===Freemasonry and the Society of Cincinnati===
Livingston was a Freemason, and in 1784, he was appointed the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New York, retaining this title until 1801. The Grand Lodge&#x27;s library in Manhattan bears his name. The Bible Livingston used to administer the oath of office to President Washington is owned by St. John&#x27;s Lodge No. 1 and is still used today when the Grand Master is sworn in, and, by request, when a President of the United States is sworn in.

On July 4, 1786, he was part of the second group elected as honorary members of the New York Society of the Cincinnati, along with Chief Justice Richard Morris, Judge James Duane, Continental Congressman William Duer, and Justice John Sloss Hobart.

==Personal life==

On September 9, 1770, Livingston married Mary Stevens (1751–1814), the daughter of Continental Congressman John Stevens and sister of the inventor John Stevens III. Following their marriage, he built a home south of Clermont, called Belvedere, which was burned to the ground along with Clermont in 1777 by the British Army under General John Burgoyne. In 1794, he built a new home called New Clermont, which was subsequently renamed Arryl House, a phonetic spelling of his initials &quot;RRL&quot;, which was deemed &quot;the most commodious home in America&quot; and contained a library of four thousand volumes. Together, Robert and Mary were the parents of:
* Elizabeth Stevens Livingston (1780–1829), who married Lt. Governor Edward Philip Livingston (1779–1843), the grandson of Philip Livingston, on November 20, 1799.
* Margaret Maria Livingston (1783–1818), who married Robert L. Livingston (1775–1843), the son of Walter Livingston and Cornelia Schuyler, on July 10, 1799.

==Death==
Livingston died a natural death aged 66 on February 26, 1813, and was buried in the Clermont Livingston vault at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Tivoli, New York.

===Livingston family===
Through his eldest daughter Elizabeth he was the grandfather of four:
* Margaret Livingston (1808–1874), who married David Augustus Clarkson (1793–1850)
* Elizabeth Livingston (1813–1896), who married Edward Hunter Ludlow (1810–1884)
* Clermont Livingston (1817–1895), who married Cornelia Livingston (1824–1851)
* Robert Edward Livingston (1820–1889), who married Susan Maria Clarkson de Peyster (1823–1910)

==Legacy and honors==
* Livingston County, Kentucky, and Livingston County, New York, are named for him.
* A statue of Livingston by Erastus Dow Palmer was commissioned by the state of New York and placed in the National Statuary Hall collection of the U.S. Capitol building, according to the tradition of each state selecting two individuals from the state to be so honored.
* Livingston is included on the Jefferson Memorial pediment sculpture by Adolph Alexander Weinman, which honors the Committee of Five.
* The Robert Livingston high-rise building at 85 Livingston St. in Brooklyn is named for him.
* The Chancellor Robert R. Livingston Masonic Library of the Grand Lodge of the State of New York is named in his honor, and is house at Masonic Hall in New York City.

<text>Robert Livingston (December 16, 1708 – November 27, 1790) was the third and final Lord of Livingston Manor and a member of the assembly for the manor from 1737 to 1790.

==Early life==
Robert Livingston was born on December 16, 1708, in Albany, New York, the eldest son of Catharina (née Van Brugh) Livingston and Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the second Lord of Livingston Manor. His younger brothers were Peter Van Brugh Livingston, who married Mary Alexander (sister of Lord Stirling), Philip Livingston, who married Christina Ten Broeck, and William Livingston, who married Susannah French. All the brothers had multiple children.

He was the grandson of Robert Livingston the Elder, a New York colonial official, fur trader, and businessman who was granted a patent to 160,000 acres (650 km2/ 250 sq mi) along the Hudson River, and becoming the first lord of Livingston Manor. His paternal grandmother was Alida Schuyler, the daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler and the widow of Nicholas Van Rensselaer. His maternal grandparents were Pieter Van Brugh and Sara (née Cuyler) Van Brugh.

==Career==
From 1737 to 1758, Livingston succeeded his uncle Gilbert Livingston to represent Livingston Manor in the New York General Assembly. He was succeeded by William Livingston in 1759 who served until 1761.

===Livingston Manor===
Upon the death of his father in February 1749, Robert inherited Livingston Manor and became the third Lord of the Manor. Shortly after he acquired of the Catskill Mountains in what had formerly been the Hardenbergh Patent. 

Livingston found himself embroiled in a border dispute with Massachusetts when some New Englanders began to settle on the eastern portion of the Manor. Some of the settlers were Livingston&#x27;s own tenants, who tired of paying rent moved east and contended they were now in Massachusetts. By 1767, Livingston Manor had about 285 tenant families, together leasing 30,000 from Robert, according to C.A. Kierner. Settlement was disbursed, with areas adjoining waterways, mills, and ironworks, the more densely populated. The tenants paid their rent in wheat. In 1760 Livingston Manor produced 50,000 bushels; Robert had claim to one-tenth as income.

During the Revolution, he made available to the New York Committee of Safety and the Continental Army, the iron mines and foundry on the Manor, while his sons, Peter Robert, Walter, John and Henry, were actively involved on the American side.

==Personal life==
On May 20, 1731, he married Maria Thong (1711–1765), granddaughter of Governor Rip Van Dam (1660–1749). Robert Livingston expected his sons to take their place as his business agents and had them educated accordingly. Together, they had thirteen children:

* Catherine Livingston (b. 1732), died in infancy.
* Philip Robert Livingston (1733–1756), died of kidney trouble.
* Sarah Livingston (1735–1745), who died young.
* Peter Robert Livingston (1737–1793), a member of the Provincial Convention of 1775, who married cousin Margaret Livingston (1738–1809), a granddaughter of Robert Livingston the Younger (1663–1725).
* Maria &quot;Mary&quot; Livingston (1738–1821), who married James Duane.
* Walter Livingston (1740–1797), who was the owner of Teviotdale mansion in Columbia County. 
* Robert Livingston (1742–1794), better known as Robert Cambridge due to his attendance of Cambridge University, who married Alice Swift (1751–1816).
* Catherine Livingston (1744–1832), who married John Patterson (1740–1823), brother of Walter Patterson and father of Daniel Patterson.
* Sarah Livingston (1745/6–1749), who died young
* Alida Livingston (1747–1791), who married Valentine Gardiner.
* Margarita Livingston (1748–1749), died young
* John Livingston (1749–1822), who married first Maria Ann Leroy (1759–1797), daughter of Jacob Leroy and Cornelia Rutgers, and second Catherine (Livingston) Ridley, his first cousin, the daughter of William Livingston and the widow of Matthew Ridley.
* Hendrick &quot;Henry&quot; Livingston (1752–1823), who died unmarried.

In 1764, a portrait of Livingston was painted by Thomas McIlworth (who also painted British officer John Bradstreet in 1764) at Livingston Manor.

In 1766, he married Gertrude (née Van Rensselaer) Schuyler (1714–1790), daughter of Maria Van Cortlandt and Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, the fifth Patroon and second Lord of the Manor of Rensselaerwyck. She was a widow of Adonijah &quot;Adonis&quot; Schuyler, who died in 1763 and was a son of Arent Schuyler.

Livingston died on November 27, 1790, at the age of eighty-one. He broke the family tradition of leaving the estate to his eldest son and shared Livingston Manor among his five sons and his son-in-law James Duane.

<doc id="193879" wikidata="Q915527" url="?curid=193879" title="Sacrificial tripod">
<text>A sacrificial tripod, whose name comes from the Greek meaning &quot;three-footed&quot;, is a three-legged piece of religious furniture used in offerings and other ritual procedures. This ritual role derives from its use as a simple support for a cooking vessel placed over a fire. As a seat or stand, the tripod is the most stable furniture construction for uneven ground, hence its use is universal and ancient. 

Tripods had two types and several functions. Firstly, some oracles sat on large tripods to pronounce. Far more common were the tripods and bowls in which smaller sacrifices were burnt. These are particularly associated with Apollo and the Delphic oracle in ancient Greece. These were also given to temples as votive offerings, awarded as prizes in contests associated with religious festivals, and just given as gifts between individuals.

==Ancient Greece==
The most famous tripod of ancient Greece was the Delphic Tripod on which the Pythian priestess took her seat to deliver the oracles of the deity. The seat was formed by a circular slab on the top of the tripod, on which a branch of laurel was deposited when it was unoccupied by the priestess. In this sense, by classical times the tripod was sacred to Apollo. According to the myth, Heracles went to the oracle of Delphi in order to ask what to do in order to be expiated from the murder of Iphitos. The oracle did not want to give him an omen. The enraged hero then grabbed the tripod on which the Pythia sat in order to pronounce her oracles. Apollo tried to prevent him and this resulted in a fight between the god and the hero. Finally, Zeus had to intervene in order to end this quarrel. The mytheme of Heracles contesting with Apollo for the tripod appears in vase-paintings older than the oldest written literature. The oracle originally may have been related to the primal deity, the Earth.
In the Geometric period, the tripods were fastened to the cauldrons they supported. In the Museum of Delphi there are fragments of such tripods, most distinctive of which is the one with a ring-shaped handle. 
Another well-known tripod in Delphi was the Plataean Tripod; it was made from a tenth part of the spoils taken from the Persian army after the Battle of Plataea. This consisted of a golden basin, supported by a bronze serpent with three heads (or three serpents intertwined), with a list of the states that had taken part in the war inscribed on the coils of the serpent. The golden bowl was carried off by the Phocians during the Third Sacred War (356–346 BC); the stand was removed by the emperor Constantine to Constantinople in 324, where in modern Istanbul it still can be seen in the hippodrome, the &quot;Atmeydanı&quot;, although in damaged condition: the heads of the serpents have disappeared, however one is now on display at the nearby Istanbul Archaeology Museums. The inscription, however, has been restored almost entirely. Such tripods usually had three &quot;ears&quot; (rings which served as handles) and frequently had a central upright as support in addition to the three legs.

Tripods were frequently mentioned by Homer as prizes in athletic games and as complimentary gifts; in later times, highly decorated and bearing inscriptions, they served the same purpose. They appear also to be precious gifts for the guests, as in the case of the Phaeakes, who offered a cauldron and tripod to Odysseus. &quot;Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present.&quot; &quot;Odyssey&quot;, 13.10–15 [tr. S. Butler]
They also were used as dedicatory offerings to the deities, and in the dramatic contests at the Dionysia the victorious choregus (a wealthy citizen who bore the expense of equipping and training the chorus) received a crown and a tripod. He would either dedicate the tripod to some deity or set it upon the top of a marble structure erected in the form of a small circular temple in a street in Athens, called the &quot;street of tripods,&quot; from the large number of memorials of this kind. One of these, the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, erected by him to commemorate his victory in a dramatic contest in 335 BC, still stands. The form of the victory tripod, now missing from the top of the Lysicrates monument, has been rendered variously by scholars since the 18th century.
Martin L. West writes that the Pythia at Delphi shows many traits of shamanistic practices, likely inherited or influenced from Central Asian practices. He cites her sitting in a cauldron on a tripod, while making her prophecies, her being in an ecstatic trance state, similar to shamans, and her utterings, unintelligible.

According to Herodotus (The Histories, I.144), the victory tripods were not to be taken from the temple sanctuary precinct, but left there as dedications. Excavations at early sanctuaries, especially Olympia, yielded many hundreds of tripod-bowl vessels, mostly in bronze, deposited as votives. These had a shallow bowl with two handles raised high on three legs; in later versions the stand and bowl were different pieces. During the Orientalising period, the tripods were frequently decorated with figural protomes, in the shape of griffins, sphinxes and other fantastic creatures.

===Historical and typological evolution of the tripod===
Early sacrificial vessels were mostly in pottery, some made as tripods but others with a continuous round base below the bowl, swelling as it goes down. At the end of the Geometric period an innovation is introduced: the tripods are detached from the large bronze cauldron (lebes), which is now placed on them. In the museum there is a distinctive specimen: on a fine, bronze tripod standing on cast legs, lay a large globular cauldron. On its lip there are developed heads of griffins and lions, as well as winged female figures, possibly sirens. These creatures originate from the Middle East, whereas the technique of casting followed by hammering also alludes to oriental workshops. In reference to Ancient Greek tripod cauldrons, after the 8th century most increased in both size and amount of detail, becoming more decorative, and were used almost exclusively as dedication to the gods in sanctuaries.


== Ancient China ==
Tripod pottery has been part of the archaeological assemblage in China since the earliest Neolithic cultures of Cishan and Peiligang in the 7th and 8th millennium BC. Sacrificial tripods were also a common type of ritual bronze, also sometimes appearing in ceramic form. They are often referred to as &quot;dings&quot; and usually have three legs, but some have four legs.

The Chinese use sacrificial tripods in modern times, such as in 2005, when a &quot;National Unity Tripod&quot; made of bronze was presented by the central Chinese government to the government of northwest China&#x27;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to mark its fiftieth birthday. It was described as a traditional Chinese sacrificial vessel symbolizing unity.

<text>Robert Livingston the Younger (1663 – April 1725), sometimes known as Robert Livingston Jr., or The Nephew was a wealthy merchant and political figure in colonial Albany, New York.

==Early life==
Livingston was born in 1663 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was the son of James Livingston (1646–1673) and nephew of Robert Livingston the Elder. Once established in Albany, his uncle wrote to his father in Edinburgh, advising him to send his son Robert. Robert the Younger emigrated to North America, by way of London, in November 1687. He settled in Albany, where he managed his uncle&#x27;s Albany enterprises. 

==Career==
After arriving in North America in 1687, Livingston&#x27;s first job involved assisting his uncle as city and County Clerk. In 1699, he was appointed Deputy Secretary and Deputy Clerk, positions he held until 1707, when his cousin Philip Livingston became of age. In 1708, Livingston was elected Alderman for the First Ward. In 1709, he was appointed Recorder (or Deputy Mayor) of the City. At the same time, he was able to prosper in business, using family connections and experience to supply both settler and military customers.

In 1710, Livingston was appointed mayor of Albany, succeeding Johannes Abeel and serving in that role until 1719 when he was succeeded by Myndert Schuyler. During his tenure, Albany grew from a trading post to the area&#x27;s major supply and services center. Livingston was also appointed as one of the English colony&#x27;s Commissioners for Indian Affairs.

==Personal life==
In 1697, Livingston married Margareta (or Margarita) Schuyler (b. 1682), the daughter of Pieter Schuyler (1657–1724), the first mayor of Albany, and Engeltie Van Schaick (d. 1689). Their children &quot;married into the best provincial families and enjoyed great success in the business of New York, Montreal, and the lands in between. Together, they had six children:

* Engeltje &quot;Angelica&quot; Livingston (1698–1747), who married Johannes Van Rensselaer (1708–1793), son of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667–1740).
* Jacobus &quot;James&quot; Livingston (1701–1763), who married Maria Kierstede (1704–1762)
* Janet Livingston (1703–1724), who married Col. Henry Beekman of Rhinebeck, New York
* Pieter &quot;Peter&quot; Livingston (b. 1706), fur trader, killed by Seneca Indians near Geneva, New York
* Johannes &quot;John&quot; Livingston (1709–1791), who married Catharine Ten Broeck (1715–1802), the sister of Abraham Ten Broeck.
* Thomas Livingston, who died young. 

In April 1725, Robert Livingston the Younger died and was buried in the Dutch church at Albany. Margarita survived her husband by many years; her death date is unknown but occurred between 1756 and 1784.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter Angelica, he was the grandfather of:

* Catherine Van Rensselaer (1734–1803), who married Gen. Philip Schuyler (1733–1804) in 1755
* Jeremiah Van Rensselaer (1738–1810)
* Robert Van Rensselaer (1740–1802)
* Henry Van Rensselaer (ca 1742–1813)
* James Van Rensselaer (1747–1827), a Captain and aide de camp of Maj. Gen. Montgomery who fought in the Canadian campaign of Fort Chambly in Quebec and was Captain in the 2nd New York Regiment under Colonel James Clinton and later aide de camp of General Philip Schuyler.

Through his son James, his granddaughter was Margaret Livingston (1738–1809) who married Peter Robert Livingston (1737–1793), the son of Robert Livingston (grandson of Robert Livingston the Elder). Margaret&#x27;s brother, Robert James Livingston (1725–1771), was the father of his Robert Livingston the Younger&#x27;s great-grandson, Maturin Livingston (1769–1847).

Through his son John, he was the grandfather of:

* Margaret Livingston Chinn (1742–1820)
* James Livingston (1747–1832)
* Anne Livingston Jordan (1749–1788)
* Jennet Livingston Vanderheyden (1751–1825)
* Abraham Livingston (1753–1802)
* Catherine Livingston Willard (1755–1827)
* Maria J. Livingston (1759–1839).

Through his granddaughter, Catherine Schuyler, he is the ancestor of the entire Hamilton family, minus Alexander Hamilton, all descendants of General Philip J. Schuyler, several members of the Morgan family (through his daughter Juliet Pierpont Morgan Hamilton), the socialite Helen Morgan Hamilton, and several more relatives of heavily influential families of America.

<text>Robert Livingston the Elder (13 December 1654 – 1728) was a Scottish-born merchant and government official in the Province of New York. He was granted a patent to 160,000 acres (650 km2/ 250 sq mi) of land along the Hudson River, becoming the first lord of Livingston Manor.

==Early life==
He was born in 1654 in the village of Ancrum, near Jedburgh, in the County of Roxburgh, Scotland. Robert was one of the seven children of Rev. John Livingston. He and his father were lineal descendants of William Livingston, 4th Lord Livingston, ancestor of the earls of Linlithgow and Callendar, and a minister of the Church of Scotland.

In 1663, his father, John Livingston, was sent into exile due to his resistance to attempts to turn the Presbyterian national church into an Episcopalian institution. The exiled family settled in Rotterdam, in the Dutch Republic, where English merchants also worked. Robert became fluent in the Dutch language, which helped him greatly in his later career in New York and New Jersey, part of the former Dutch colony of New Netherland.

==Career==

Following the death of his father in 1673, Robert Livingston returned to Scotland for a time. He sailed for Boston to find his fortune in North America. Livingston&#x27;s father was well known in Puritan Boston, and a merchant advanced the young son enough stock and credit to undertake a trading venture to Albany, New York. Livingston arrived in Albany in late 1674. With his business and language skills, in August 1675 he became secretary to Nicholas Van Rensselaer, director of Rensselaerswyck, who died a few years later in 1678.

In 1686, he and his brother-in-law, Pieter Schuyler, persuaded Governor Thomas Dongan to grant Albany a municipal charter like that awarded to New York City a few months earlier. Appointed as clerk of the city and county of Albany, Livingston collected a fee for each legal document registered. With Pieter Schuyler, he led the opposition in Albany to Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion. He served as Secretary for Indian Affairs from 1695 until his death. He was elected repeatedly to the New York provincial assembly, serving from 1709 to 1711, and 1716–1725; he was elected speaker in 1718.

According to Cynthia Kierner, &quot;Robert Livingston valued public life primarily as a source of private profits. Livingston&#x27;s generation looked upon politics as a business.&quot; In 1696, Livingston backed Captain William Kidd&#x27;s privateer voyage on the &quot;Adventure Galley&quot;. Livingston was also involved in the lucrative institution of slavery. In addition to owning slaves in New York, he also became involved in the Atlantic slave trade, investing money into the slave ship &quot;Margriet&quot; in 1690.

===Livingston Manor===

Through the influence of Governor Thomas Dongan, and confirmed by royal charter of George I of Great Britain in 1715, Robert Livingston obtained a patent to 160,000 acres (650 km2/ 250 sq mi) along the Hudson River south of Albany; this would become known as Livingston Manor in Columbia and Dutchess counties. He offered land on both sides of the Hudson River to Queen Anne&#x27;s government of England to be used temporarily as work camps for German Palatine refugees, who were to harvest lumber and produce naval stores: timber for masts, turpentine, etc. for the English navy. Nearly 3,000 refugee Germans arrived in Manhattan in 1710, on ten ships from London. They worked for years in the camps to pay off their passage, before being granted land in the Mohawk and Schoharie valleys. Livingston made a substantial profit by selling supplies to the work camps and was paid by the English colonial government.

His will provided for the establishment of the Livingston Memorial Church and Burial Ground. The original church of 1721 was replaced by another built in the late 19th century. Burials at the cemetery ceased in 1890. The 19th-century church and ground was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Before entailing the bulk of the estate to his eldest son, Philip, Robert Livingston bequeathed about 13,000 acres to his third son and namesake, Robert. The younger man developed the property as an estate known as &quot;Clermont&quot;. It is now recognized as a state historic site.

==Personal life==

In 1679, Livingston married Alida Schuyler (1656–1727), the widow of Nicholas Van Rensselaer. She was the daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler, vice-director of Fort Orange, giving Livingston an important connection in the community. Robert Livingston amassed one of the largest fortunes in 17th-century New York. They had nine children together:
* Johannes Livingston (1680–1720), who married Mary Winthrop (1683–1713), daughter of Gov. Fitz-John Winthrop of the Winthrop family, in 1701. After her death, he married Elizabeth Knight (1689–1736), the daughter of Sarah Kemble Knight, in 1713.
* Margaret Livingston (1681–1758), who married Samuel Vetch (1668–1732), the Royal Governor of Nova Scotia.
* Joanna Philipina Livingston (1683–1689), who died young.
* Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the second Lord of the Manor who married Catherine Van Brugh (b. 1689), daughter of Pieter Van Brugh, the Mayor of Albany, New York.
* Robert Livingston (1688–1775), the owner of the Clermont Estate who married Margaret Howarden (1693–1758).
* Hubertus &quot;Gilbert&quot; Livingston (1690–1746), who married Cornelia Beekman, granddaughter of Wilhelmus Beekman, Mayor of New York, and niece of Gerardus Beekman.
* William Livingston (1692–1692), who died young.
* Joanna Livingston (1694–1734), who married Cornelius Gerrit Van Horne (1694–1752).
* Catherine Livingston (1698–1699), who died young.

===Descendants===
Livingston was the uncle of Robert Livingston the Younger, grandfather of Philip Livingston and William Livingston. Philip Livingston&#x27;s granddaughter, Catherine Livingston married Abraham De Peyster. He was a loyalist Officer who served with the King&#x27;s American Regiment and was at Battle of King&#x27;s Mountain.

Through his son, Gilbert Livingston, he was the grandfather of Margaret Livingston (1738–1818), who married Peter Stuyvesant, a great-grandson of the Peter Stuyvesant who commanded the New Netherland colony on Manhattan island, and Joanna Livingston (1722–1808), who married Pierre Van Cortlandt (1721–1814), the first Lieutenant Governor of the New York.

Many Americans are descended from the Livingston family, including George W. Bush, the entire Fish and Kean families, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady of New York Anna Morton, actors Montgomery Clift and Michael Douglas, actress Jane Wyatt, poet Robert Lowell, cinematographer Floyd Crosby and his son David Crosby, author Wolcott Gibbs, and almost the entire Astor family.

<text>Two Women ( , rough literal translation &quot;The Woman from Ciociaria&quot;) is a 1960 war drama film directed by Vittorio De Sica from a screenplay he co-wrote with Cesare Zavattini, based on the 1957 novel of the same name by Alberto Moravia. The film stars Sophia Loren, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Eleonora Brown and Raf Vallone. It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The story is fictional but based on actual events of 1944 in Rome and rural Lazio, during the &quot;Marocchinate&quot;.

Loren&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim, earning her an Academy Award for Best Actress, among other accolades.

== Plot ==
Cesira (Loren) is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta (Brown), in Rome during World War II. Following the bombing of Rome, mother and daughter flee to Cesira&#x27;s native Ciociaria, a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira has sex with Giovanni (Vallone), a married coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence.

After they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele (Belmondo), a young local intellectual with communist sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by German soldiers, who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain.

After the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of &quot;Moroccan Goumiers&quot; – soldiers attached to the invading Allied Armies in Italy. Rosetta is traumatized by the unwilling loss of her virginity, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child.

When the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele&#x27;s death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The film was based on a 1957 novel by Alberto Moravia, &quot;La ciociara&quot; (&quot;The Woman From Ciociaria&quot;). It was inspired by Moravia&#x27;s experiences during World War II.

Carlo Ponti bought the film rights along with Marcello Girosi for a reported US$100,000. Sophia Loren was always meant to star and there was some talk that the film might be financed by Paramount, with whom Loren had made a number of movies. Anna Magnani was going to play the lead and Loren was going to be her daughter. George Cukor was going to direct as part of a two-picture deal with Ponti, the other one being &quot;Heller in Pink Tights&quot; (1960). The film was going to be shot as part of a six-picture deal between Ponti and Paramount.

Cukor and Paramount dropped out. Vittorio De Sica became attached as director. Magnani pulled out, supposedly because she did not want to play Loren&#x27;s mother, leading to Loren taking Magnani&#x27;s role, even though the former was only 25 at the time. However, De Sica says it was his decision for Loren to play Magnani&#x27;s role and cast a younger performer as the daughter In a 2017 interview, Brown stated that Loren protected her from some of the underlying implications of the rape scene in the film, and also stated that director De Sica brought her to tears for the climactic final scene of hearing that Belmondo&#x27;s character has died, by saying that a telegram had arrived saying that Brown&#x27;s parents had died in an accident.

Magnani said she was going to do it, , said Loren. 
Loren later said her performance was inspired by her memories of her mother during the war. She also said she was greatly helped by her experience acting in &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; (1958).

Ponti raised money from France and Italy. French investment was conditional upon a French star being used, which led to the casting of Jean-Paul Belmondo, who had leapt to international fame in &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960). Belmondo&#x27;s voice was dubbed into Italian.

== Release ==
Joseph E. Levine (Embassy Pictures) agreed to buy US release rights after watching only nine minutes of the film. , Levine later said. He showed the film in every city that a member of the academy jury lived and promoted it assiduously. , said Levine.

The film was among the 30 most popular films at the French box office that year. In 1962, it grossed $3 million rentals in North America.

== Accolades ==
The film was submitted two days late to be eligible as the 1960 Italian entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

== Remakes ==
&quot;La Ciociara&quot; was remade for television in 1988. It was adapted by Diana Gould, Lidia Ravera, Dino Risi, and Bernardino Zapponi. It was directed by Risi, and starred Loren, Robert Loggia, Leonardo Ferrantini, Dario Ghirardi, and Sydney Penny. The opera &quot;La Ciociara&quot; written by Luca Rossi, with music composed by Marco Tutino, received its premiere at San Francisco Opera, and a European premiere at Teatro Lirico, Cagliari.

<text>The Boeing B-47 Stratojet (Boeing company designation Model 450) is a retired American long-range, six-engined, turbojet-powered strategic bomber designed to fly at high subsonic speed and at high altitude to avoid enemy interceptor aircraft. The primary mission of the B-47 was as a nuclear bomber capable of striking targets within the Soviet Union.

Development of the B-47 can be traced back to a requirement expressed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in 1943 for a reconnaissance bomber that harnessed newly developed jet propulsion. Another key innovation adopted during the development process was the swept wing, drawing upon captured German research. With its engines carried in nacelles underneath the wing, the B-47 represented a major innovation in post–World War II combat jet design, and contributed to the development of modern jet airliners. Suitably impressed, in April 1946, the USAAF ordered two prototypes, designated &quot;XB-47&quot;; on 17 December 1947, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Facing off competition such as the North American XB-45, Convair XB-46 and Martin XB-48, a formal contract for 10 B-47A bombers was signed on 3 September 1948. This would be soon followed by much larger contracts.

During 1951, the B-47 entered operational service with the United States Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command (SAC), becoming a mainstay of its bomber strength by the late 1950s. Over 2,000 were manufactured to meet the Air Force&#x27;s demands, driven by the tensions of the Cold War. The B-47 was in service as a strategic bomber until 1965, at which point it had largely been supplanted by more capable aircraft, such as Boeing&#x27;s own B-52 Stratofortress. The B-47 was also adapted to perform a number of other roles and functions, including photographic reconnaissance, electronic intelligence, and weather reconnaissance. While never seeing combat as a bomber, reconnaissance RB-47s would occasionally come under fire near or within Soviet air space. The type remained in service as a reconnaissance aircraft until 1969. A few served as flying testbeds up until 1977.

==Development==

===Origins===
The B-47 arose from an informal 1943 requirement for a jet-powered reconnaissance bomber, drawn up by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) to prompt manufacturers to start research into jet bombers. Boeing was among several companies to respond to the request; one of its designs, the Model 424, was basically a scaled-down version of the piston-engined B-29 Superfortress equipped with four jet engines. In 1944, this initial concept evolved into a formal request-for-proposal to design a new bomber with a maximum speed of , a cruise speed of , a range of , and a service ceiling of .

In December 1944, North American Aviation, Convair, Boeing and the Glenn L. Martin Company submitted proposals for the new long-range jet bomber. Wind tunnel testing had shown that the drag from the engine installation of the Model 424 was too high, so Boeing&#x27;s entry was a revised design, the Model 432, with the four engines buried in the forward fuselage. The USAAF awarded study contracts to all four companies, requiring that North American and Convair concentrate on four-engined designs (to become B-45 and XB-46), while Boeing and Martin were to build six-engined aircraft (the B-47 and XB-48). The powerplant was to be General Electric&#x27;s new TG-180 turbojet engine.

===Swept wings===
In May 1945, the von Kármán mission of the Army Air Forces inspected the secret German aeronautics laboratory near Braunschweig. Von Kármán&#x27;s team included the chief of the technical staff at Boeing, George S. Schairer. He had heard about the controversial swept-wing theory of R. T. Jones at Langley, but seeing German models of swept-wing aircraft and extensive supersonic wind-tunnel data, the concept was decisively confirmed. He wired his home office: &quot;Stop the bomber design&quot; and changed the wing design. Analysis by Boeing engineer Vic Ganzer suggested an optimum sweepback angle of about 35 degrees. Boeing&#x27;s aeronautical engineers modified the Model 432 with swept wings and tail to produce the &quot;Model 448&quot;, which was presented to the USAAF in September 1945. It retained the four TG-180 jet engines in its forward fuselage, with two more TG-180s in the rear fuselage. The flush-mounted air intakes for the rear engines were inadequate while the USAAF considered the engine installation within the fuselage to be a fire hazard.

The engines were moved to streamlined pylon-mounted pods under the wings, leading to the next iteration, the &quot;Model 450&quot;, which featured two TG-180s in a twin pod mounted on a pylon about a third of the way outboard on each wing, plus another engine at each wingtip. The Army Air Force liked this new configuration, so Boeing&#x27;s engineers refined it, moving the outer engines further inboard to about of the wingspan. The thin wings provided no space for tricycle main gear to retract so it would have needed a considerable bulge in the fuselage aft of the bomb bay for lateral stability. The only way to get a bomb-bay long enough for an A-bomb was to use a &quot;bicycle landing gear&quot;, the two main gear assemblies arranged in a tandem configuration and outrigger struts fitted to the inboard engine pods. As the landing gear arrangement made rotation impossible, it was designed so that the aircraft rested on the ground at the proper angle for takeoff.

Pleased with the refined Model 450 design, in April 1946, the USAAF ordered two prototypes, to be designated &quot;XB-47&quot;. Assembly began in June 1947. The first XB-47 was rolled out on 12 September 1947, a few days before the USAAF became a separate service, the United States Air Force (USAF), on 18 September 1947. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, Boeing subjected the first prototype to &quot;one of the most comprehensive ground-test programmes ever undertaken&quot;.

===Flight test phase===
The XB-47 prototype flew its first flight on 17 December 1947 (the anniversary of the Wright Brothers&#x27; first four flights on 17 December 1903), with test pilots Robert Robbins and Scott Osler at the controls. It lasted 27 minutes, flying from Boeing Field in Seattle to Moses Lake Airfield in central Washington state. While not experiencing major problems, the emergency hot wire system was needed to raise the flaps and the engine fire warning indicators falsely illuminated. Robbins stated that it had good flight characteristics.

Robbins had been skeptical about the XB-47, saying that before his first flight he had prayed, &quot;Oh God, please help me through the next two hours.&quot; Robbins soon realized that he had an extraordinary aircraft. Chuck Yeager also flew the XB-47, noting it was so aerodynamically clean that he had difficulty landing on the Edwards lakebed. In February 1949, Russ Schleeh and Joe Howell &quot;broke all coast-to-coast speed records&quot; flying from Moses Lake AFB to Andrews AFB, averaging . During an early test flight, the canopy came off at high speed, killing pilot Scott Osler; the aircraft was safely landed by the copilot. The accident resulted in a canopy redesign and the hiring of pilot Tex Johnston as chief test pilot.

The second XB-47 (46-066) prototype first flew on 21 July 1948 and, following its delivery to the USAF in December of that year, served as a flying test bed until 1954. Its final destination was Chanute AFB where it was used as a maintenance and familiarization aircraft. The second prototype was equipped with more powerful General Electric J47-GE-3 turbojets with of static thrust each. The J47 or &quot;TG-190&quot; was a redesigned version of the TG-180/J35; the first prototype was later retrofitted with these engines.

Flight testing of the prototypes was careful and methodical since the design was new in so many ways. They initially suffered from &quot;Dutch roll&quot;, an instability that caused it to weave in widening &quot;S&quot; turns, remedied by the addition of a &quot;yaw damper&quot; control system to automatically deflect the rudder to damp out the weaving motion. Wind tunnel tests had shown it would pitch up at maximum speed due to wing stall on the outboard section of the wing. This was confirmed during flight tests so small vanes called &quot;vortex generators&quot; were added to prevent airflow separation.

Both XB-47 prototypes were test flown at Edwards AFB; the first XB-47 (46-065) was disassembled and scrapped in 1954, making the second prototype (46-066) the sole surviving XB-47. Upon retirement, XB-47 (46-066) was restored and placed on display at the Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum in Rantoul, Illinois, remaining there until the museum announced its closure due to financial difficulties in April 2015. In late 2015, the Flight Test Historical Foundation began fundraising to purchase XB-47 (46-066) for relocation to the Flight Test Museum at Edwards AFB. The purchase was completed in August 2016 and on 21 September 2016 the aircraft arrived at Edwards AFB for reassembly, restoration and eventual display at the Flight Test Museum.

===X-model competitions===
By mid-1948, the USAF&#x27;s bomber competition had already been through one iteration, pitting the North American XB-45 against the Convair XB-46. The North American design won that round of the competition. As an interim measure, the USAF decided to put the North American bomber into production on a limited basis as the B-45 Tornado. The expectation was that B-45 production would be terminated if either of the remaining two designs in the competition, the Boeing XB-47 and the Martin XB-48, proved superior. It is sometimes claimed that the final production decision was made as a result of Boeing president Bill Allen inviting USAF General K.B. Wolfe, in charge of bomber production, for a ride in the XB-47. A formal contract for 10 aircraft was signed on 3 September 1948.

===Production===

The total number of B-47s built was 2,042.

==Design==

===Overview===
The XB-47, which looked nothing like contemporary bombers, was described by Boyne as a &quot;sleek, beautiful outcome that was highly advanced&quot;. The 35-degree swept wings were shoulder-mounted, the inboard turbojet engines mounted in twin pods, at about a third of the span, and the outboard engines singly near the wing tip. This arrangement reduced the bending moment at the wing roots, saving structural weight. The engines&#x27; mass acted as counter-flutter weights.

The wing airfoil was identified by Boeing as the BAC 145, also known as the NACA 64A(.225)12 mod airfoil. Wing flexibility was a concern, flexing as much as at the tip; major effort was expended to ensure that flight control could be maintained as the wing moved up and down; these worries proved to be mostly unfounded. Its maximum speed was limited to IAS to avoid control reversal, where aileron deflections would cause the wings to twist and produce a roll in the opposite direction to that desired by the pilot. The wings were fitted with a set of Fowler flaps that extended well behind the wing to enhance lift at slow speeds. The flight control surfaces were powered, augmenting the pilot&#x27;s inputs and reducing the exertion required to overcome the forces involved.

The XB-47 was designed to carry a crew of three in a pressurized forward compartment: a pilot and copilot, in tandem, in a long fighter-style bubble canopy, and a navigator/bombardier in a compartment in the nose. The copilot doubled as tail gunner (using a remotely controlled, radar-directed tail gun), and the navigator as bombardier. The bubble canopy, which provided a high level of visibility to the pilots, pitched up and slid backward; as the cockpit was high off the ground, the crew entered via a door and ladder on the underside of the nose. The extreme front of the nose was initially glazed for visual navigation and bomb sighting, but this requirement was soon deleted together with the glazing. Most production versions had a metal nose with no windows. A K-series bombsight provided integrated radar navigation and visual navigation, the optical portion extending through the nose in a small dome. For greater comfort, both heaters and refrigeration systems were present in the cockpit to manage the cockpit environment. There was little vibration compared to prior bombers powered by reciprocating engines.

===Engines and performance===

During the late 1940s, the bomber was hailed as the fastest of its class in the world. The first prototypes were fitted with General Electric J35 turbojets, the production version of the TG-180, with of thrust. Early jet engines did not develop good thrust at low speeds, so to assist take off when heavily loaded, the B-47 had provisions for fitting solid-fuel rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO) rockets, each generating roughly of static thrust. Early aircraft had mounts for nine RATO units built into each side of the rear fuselage, arranged in three rows of three bottles. Most of the space within the upper fuselage was taken up by self-sealing fuel tanks, the wing having been deemed unsuitable for storing fuel.

The performance of the Model 450 was projected to be so good that the bomber would be as fast as fighters then on the drawing board; thus the only defensive armament was to be a tail turret with two .50 in (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns, which would in principle be directed by an automatic fire-control system. The two XB-47s were neither fitted with combat equipment nor tail turrets as they were engineering and flight test aircraft only. The total bombload capacity was to be . Production aircraft were to be equipped with modern electronics for navigation, bombing, countermeasures and turret fire control. Navigation was more difficult than on earlier aircraft due to the higher speed involved.

One problem with the aircraft was that at higher altitudes, where the pure turbojet engines could produce good fuel economy, the wing was very compromised. At the top of the B-47&#x27;s envelope, about , it was in &quot;coffin corner&quot;. That means that at this level, which produced the most range at most weights due to fuel consumption, there was an envelope of between maximum mach and stall speed. For the B-47 to cross the Atlantic Ocean, it had to be flown this high. Due to its rudimentary autopilot, the pilot had to leave it turned off and spend up to eight hours diligently monitoring the airspeed and adjusting the throttles to avoid going into a stall. For perspective, a modern Boeing 757 has over of difference at even a very heavy weight at . Fuel capacity was enormous, at , more than triple the on the B-29 Superfortress, and meant that maintaining fuel trim to ensure a stable center of gravity was a critical copilot duty.

=== Drogue chutes===
The aircraft was so aerodynamically clean that rapid descent (&quot;penetration&quot;) from high cruise altitude to the landing pattern required dragging the deployed rear landing gear. The relatively high wing loading (weight/wing area) required a high landing speed of . To shorten the landing roll, USAF test pilot Major Guy Townsend promoted the addition of a German-invented &quot;ribbon&quot; drag chute (thrust reversers had not then been developed). For the same reason, the B-47 was the first mass-produced aircraft to be equipped with an anti-skid braking system.

A related problem was that the aircraft&#x27;s engines would have to be throttled down on landing approach. Since it could take as long as 20 seconds to throttle them back up to full power, the bomber could not easily do a &quot;touch and go&quot; momentary landing. A 16-foot &quot;approach chute&quot; (drogue parachute) provided aerodynamic drag so that the aircraft could be flown at approach speeds with the engines throttled at ready-to-spool-up medium power. On the ground, the pilots used the 32-foot &quot;brake chute&quot;. The brake chute could be deployed to stop the aircraft from &quot;porpoising&quot;, or bouncing, after a hard landing on the front nose gear. Training typically included an hour of dragging the approach chute around the landing pattern for multiple practice landings.

==Operational history==

===Early years===
The USAF Strategic Air Command operated multiple B-47 models (B-47s, EB-47s, RB-47s and YRB-47s) from 1951 through 1965. Upon entry to service, its performance was closer to that of contemporary fighters than SAC&#x27;s extant B-36 Peacemaker bomber, setting multiple records with ease. It handled well in flight, the controls having a fighter-like light touch. The large bubble canopy enhanced the flying crew&#x27;s vision and gave a fighter-like feel, but also caused internal temperature variations for the crew. The three-man crew consisted of the commander, copilot and a navigator/bombardier or a crew chief.

In 1953 the B-47 became operational. It was sluggish on takeoff and too fast on landings, an unpleasant combination. If landed at the wrong angle, the B-47 would &quot;porpoise&quot;, bouncing fore-and-aft. If the pilot did not lift off for another go-around, instability would quickly cause it to skid onto one wing and cartwheel. Because the wings and surfaces flexed in flight, low-altitude speed restrictions were necessary to ensure effective flight control. The B-47 was regarded as a maintenance &quot;hog&quot;. General reliability was good, the only major issuing relating to the avionics, typical of the vacuum tube technology used and the placement of equipment outside the pressurized crew compartment. Much work was done to improve avionics reliability, but avionics remained troublesome throughout the B-47&#x27;s operational life.

Starting in 1950, several models of the B-47 included a fuel tank inerting system, in which dry ice was sublimed into carbon dioxide vapor while the fuel pumps operated or while the in-flight refueling system was in use. The carbon dioxide was pumped into both the fuel tanks and the fuel system to ensure low oxygen levels throughout. It was implemented largely to reduce the probability of an explosion from static electricity discharges.

Initial mission profiles included the loft bombing of nuclear weapons. As the training for this imposes repeated high stress on the aircraft, the airframe lifetime would have been severely limited by metal fatigue, and this maneuver was eliminated. Improved training led to a good safety record, and few crews felt the aircraft was unsafe or too demanding, but apparently there were some aircrews who had little affection for the B-47. Crew workload was high, having only three crew members to operate it. Boeing&#x27;s B-52 Stratofortress, in contrast, generally had six crewmen, five officers and one enlisted, with more internal cabin space.

===Prime years===
An XB-47 was flown in the 1951 Operation Greenhouse nuclear weapons test. This was followed by a B-47B being flown in the 1952 test, Operation Ivy and the 1954 test, Operation Castle. A B-47E was then flown in the 1956 test, Operation Redwing. &quot;Reflex&quot; missions proved the long-endurance (eighteen hours) and long range capability of the B-47 and aircrews. These were &quot;simulated strike missions against the then Soviet enemy&quot;.

Three B-47s flew cross country from March Air Force Base to the Philadelphia International Airport as participants in the 1955 Labor Day race. In the 1956 event, three B-47s participated in the G.E. Trophy race for Jet Bombers, flying from Kindley Field, Bermuda, to Oklahoma City. One of these set a course speed record of .

By 1956, the USAF had 28 wings of B-47 bombers and five wings of RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft. The B-47 was the first line of America&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent, often operating from forward bases in the UK, Morocco, Spain, Alaska, Greenland and Guam. B-47s were often set up on &quot;one-third&quot; alert, with a third of operational aircraft available sitting on hardstands or an alert ramp adjacent to the runway, loaded with fuel and nuclear weapons, crews on standby, ready to attack the USSR at short notice. Crews were trained to perform &quot;Minimum Interval Take Offs (MITO)&quot;, one bomber following another into the air at intervals of as little as 15 seconds to launch as fast as possible. MITO could be hazardous, as the bombers left wingtip vortices and general turbulence behind them; the first generation turbojet engines, fitted with water-injection systems, also created dense black smoke.

The B-47 was the backbone of SAC into 1959, when the B-52 began to assume nuclear alert duties and the number of B-47 bomber wings started to be reduced. B-47 production ceased in 1957, though modifications and rebuilds continued. Operational practice for B-47 bomber operations during this time went from high-altitude bombing to low-altitude strike, which was judged more likely to penetrate Soviet defenses. Crews were trained in &quot;pop-up&quot; attacks, coming in at low level at and then climbing abruptly near the target before releasing a nuclear weapon.

===Later years===
Stress and fatigue incurred in low-altitude operations led to a number of wing failures and crashes, and an extensive refit program was begun in 1958 to strengthen the wing mountings. The program was known as &quot;Milk Bottle&quot;, named after the big connecting pins that were replaced in the wing roots.

One of the more notable mishaps involving a B-47 occurred on 5 February 1958 near Savannah, Georgia, in the so-called 1958 Tybee Island B-47 crash. A B-47 based at Homestead AFB, Florida, was engaged in a simulated combat exercise against an F-86 fighter. As was the practice at the time, the B-47 was carrying a single Mark 15 nuclear bomb, without its core. During this exercise, the two aircraft collided. The F-86 crashed after the pilot ejected, while the B-47 suffered substantial damage, including loss of power in one outboard engine. After three unsuccessful landing attempts at Hunter Air Force Base, the bomber pilot had to &quot;safe&quot; soft drop the Mark 15 weapon off the coast of Savannah, Georgia near Tybee Island, after which the B-47 landed safely. Despite an extensive nine-month search, the unarmed bomb was never found.

In 1963, the Kennedy administration offered 24 B-47E bombers as an interim Canberra Mk 20 replacement for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), pending delivery of the much delayed F-111C aircraft. Three B-47E aircraft flew to Australia for demonstration purposes, but RAAF declined the B-47E as technically outdated and too resource-intensive.

During 1963, final phaseout of B-47 bomber wings began; the last were out of SAC service by 1966. The last USAF operational aircraft, WB-47Es assigned to the Air Weather Service, were withdrawn from use in September 1969. Shortly before, a B-47E, USAF Serial Number 53-2280, was used as a testbed for a newly developed fly-by-wire system. The U.S. Navy kept specialized EB-47E test aircraft from USAF inventory in occasional use to support the &quot;Fleet Electronic Warfare Systems Group (FEWSG)&quot; until December 1977, being replaced by government owned/contractor operated (GOCO) NKC-135 modified Stratotankers also loaned from the USAF.
The final recorded flight of a B-47 was on 17 June 1986, when a B-47E was restored to flightworthy condition for a one-time ferry flight. This aircraft was flown from Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, to Castle Air Force Base, California, for static display at the Castle Air Museum, where it presently resides.

===Reconnaissance===

The only B-47s to see anything close to combat were the aerial reconnaissance variants. The first overflight of Soviet territory with a B-47B, fitted with special radar and cameras in the bomb bay, occurred on 15 October 1952, overflying Soviet airfields in Northeastern Siberia. RB-47s operated from almost every airfield that gave them access to the USSR and routinely probed Soviet airspace. Occasionally, they would avoid confrontations with speed and evasion. At least five aircraft were fired upon and three were shot down. The RB-47s returned fire with their tail turrets, although it is uncertain if they scored any kills; these were the only shots fired in anger by any B-47.

On 8 May 1954, after a top secret reconnaissance mission near the Kola Peninsula, a 4th Air Division / 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing RB-47E, flown by then-Capt (later Col) Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Austin, overflew the Soviet Union at high altitude, out of reach of MiG-15s. Unknown to USAF intelligence,  capable of intercepting it had been stationed nearby. The RB-47E was chased by several MiG-17s, firing upon it with their guns over Soviet and Finnish airspace. While taking damage, the RB-47E escaped over Sweden to its home base at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire. Its top speed and combat radius superiority to the fighter jets were decisive factors. The mission marked the first time a jet aircraft equipped with modern aerial photography equipment, K-17 and K-38 cameras, was used for USAF reconnaissance over the Soviet Union. The incident was kept secret by all parties.

Other interceptions resulted in losses. An RB-47 flying from Alaska was scouting the Kamchatka Peninsula on 17 April 1955, when it was intercepted by Soviet MiG-15s in international airspace before disappearing. Between 21 March and 10 May 1956, 16 RB-47Es and five RB-47Hs operating from Thule performed overflights the length of Siberia 156 times under Project HOMERUN. The Soviets filed a complaint with the US government, which attributed the overflights to &quot;navigational difficulties&quot;. MiGs intercepted RB-47s on three separate occasions in late 1958: over the Black Sea on 31 October, over the Baltic on 7 November, and over the Sea of Japan on 17 November.

On 1 July 1960, a PVO Strany MiG-19 shot down an RB-47H (AF Serial No. 53-4281) in international airspace over the Barents Sea, killing four of the crew while two were captured by the Soviets and released in 1961. The co-pilot reported that the MiG-19 jammed his MD-4 FCS (that aimed the tail guns), rendering it defenseless. The last known confrontation between MiGs and RB-47s occurred on 28 April 1965, when an ERB-47H was intercepted by two North Korean MiG-17s over the Sea of Japan. While hit by the MiGs, it returned to Yokota Air Base in Japan with three engines out. A few operated during the Vietnam War on missions such as relaying ELINT data, but were replaced by more efficient and capable Boeing RC-135s. The last RB-47H was retired on 29 December 1967.

The final 15 RB-47s, built from December 1955, were fitted with additional equipment, including the AN/APD &quot;side looking airborne radar&quot; (SLAR) system, and gear to sample the air for fallout from nuclear tests. These were given the designation RB-47K and generally used for weather reconnaissance missions, carrying a load of eight &quot;dropsonde&quot; weather sensors that were released at various checkpoints along the flight path. Data radioed back from the dropsondes was logged by the navigator. The RB-47Ks were in service until 1963. The type was succeeded by dedicated reconnaissance aircraft such as the Lockheed U-2.

==Variants==
:&quot;Section source: Baugher.&quot;
; XB-47
:Two prototype aircraft, Model 450-1-1 and 450-2-2 respectively,(46-065 and 46-066); powered by six Allison J-35-GE-7 turbojet engines on early flights. The second XB-47 was powered by General Electric J-47-GE-3 engines, the first was retrofitted as such.

;B-47A
:The first 10 aircraft were designated B-47A and were evaluation aircraft, the first delivered in December 1950. While the XB-47s had been built at Boeing&#x27;s Seattle plant, all B-47s were built at a government-owned factory in Wichita, Kansas that had previously built B-29s. Their configuration was akin to the XB-47. All were powered by J47-GE-11 turbojets, offering the same thrust as the earlier J47-GE-3, and had built-in rocket-assisted-take-off (RATO) bottles. Four were fitted with the K-2 bombing and navigation system (BNS), HD-21D autopilot, an analog computer, APS-23 radar, and a Y-4 or Y-4A bombsight. Two were fitted with the tail turret mounting two 20mm cannons; one of them used an Emerson A-2 fire control system (FCS), another a General Electric A-5 FCS. The eight other B-47As lacked defensive armament.

:The B-47As were fitted with ejection seats. The pilot and copilot ejected upward, while the navigator had a downward ejection seat built by Stanley Aviation. Minimum safe ejection altitude was about 500 ft (150 m). In the 1950s, there were no suitable &quot;dummies&quot; to test ejection seats, thus live people were used. Several volunteers were injured testing the downward ejection seat. The first person to successfully use it was USAF Colonel Arthur M. Henderson who ejected over Choctawhatchee Bay, near Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on 7 October 1953. Most B-47As were retired by 1952, though one performed flight tests for NACA for a few more years.

;B-47B

:In November 1949, prior to the B-47A&#x27;s first flight, the USAF ordered 87 B-47Bs, the first operational model. The first flew on 26 April 1951. A total of 399 were built, including eight assembled by Lockheed and 10 assembled by Douglas using Boeing-built parts. To quickly receive B-47s in quantity, the USAF contracted both Lockheed and Douglas for additional production; Lockheed-built aircraft were designated by a &quot;-LM (Lockheed Marietta)&quot; suffix and Douglas-built aircraft given a &quot;-DT (Douglas Tulsa)&quot; suffix. Boeing production was designated by a &quot;-BW (Boeing Wichita)&quot; suffix, except for the Seattle-built XB-47s and B-47As, which had a &quot;-BO&quot; suffix.

:The initial 87 B-47Bs used the same J47-GE-11 engines as the B-47A, subsequent deliveries had uprated J47-GE-23 units with thrust; early aircraft were later retrofitted. It had a built-in RATO system, as used on the B-47A, along with full combat systems. Early aircraft retained the K-2 BNS installed on some B-47As, but most featured the K-4A BNS, incorporating an AN/APS-54 warning radar and an AN/APT-5 electronic countermeasures (ECM) system. The K-4A used a nose-mounted periscopic bombsight. Ejection seats were deleted as a weight reduction measure; a windbreak panel on the main door made for a difficult escape.

:The bomb bay was shorter than the B-47A&#x27;s as nuclear weapons had shrunk in the interim; the B-47B could carry a larger bombload of up to . All B-47Bs had a tail turret with twin 20 mm (0.79 in) guns and the B-4 radar-guided FCS. Due to issues, this FCS was often replaced with an N-6 optical sight; the copilot could swivel his seat to face backward and sight the guns directly. A nose-mounted in-flight refueling (IFR) receptacle enabled flying boom refueling from KB-50 and KC-97 tankers, requiring the plexiglas nose cone&#x27;s replacement by a metal nose cone with four small windows, two on either side of the nose. The B-47B was also fitted with a pair of jettisonable external tanks, carried between the inboard and outboard engine assemblies, with a capacity of . Another visible change was the vertical tailplane&#x27;s squared-off top instead of a rounded top.

:Between 1955 and 1956, Boeing modified surviving B-47Bs from line numbers 235 to 399 to the B-47E standard under program &quot;High Noon&quot;; this included fitting ejection seats. It was followed by the &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; program covering early line numbers from 1 to 234; this included 66 aircraft from the 135 to 234 batch to the same standard as the &quot;High Noon&quot; aircraft. Another 30 in the same range had additional modification as drone directors DB-47Bs, and the 1 to 134 range which had the same &quot;High Noon&quot; modification, but lacked some non-combat changes. Following these programs, they were sometimes referred to as B-47B-II.

;;YRB-47B
:The USAF considered building a specialized RB-47B reconnaissance variant, but schedule slips ensured that the RB-47E was the first such variant. As an interim measure, 91 B-47B bombers were fitted with a heated pod stowed in the forward bomb bay that housed eight cameras. These were designated YRB-47Bs and were capable of daylight reconnaissance only. Once the RB-47E arrived, they returned to the bomber role.

;;TB-47B
:A total of 66 of the 87 non-combat B-47Bs were re-designated TB-47B in 1953 to alleviate logistics problems due to different engines and systems. Most were used as trainers; some were modified for Air Training Command by Douglas at Tulsa under the &quot;Field Goal&quot; program, adding a fourth seat for an instructor and removing the tail turret. They were upgraded to B-47E standard in 1956 under the &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; program, joined by 41 more early build aircraft, also designated TB-47B. Used for training through the 1950s.

;;MB-47B
:With the introduction of the hydrogen bomb, the USAF studied converting a few B-47Bs into MB-47B drones, essentially huge cruise missiles, under the Brass Ring program; this was more formally known as MX-1457. Due to impracticality, it was canceled on 1 April 1953.

;;YDB-47B / DB-47B
:There were flight tests through the 1950s for using the B-47B as a launcher for the 31 ft (9.5 m) GAM-63 RASCAL missile, and one B-47B was modified into a YDB-47B Rascal launcher. The Rascal never became operational; a total of 74 B-47Bs were modified into DB-47Bs before cancellation.

;;WB-47B
:In 1956, a B-47B was converted into a WB-47B weather reconnaissance model and operated by the Military Air Transportation Service (MATS), one of a few B-47s not operated by SAC. It was used by the Air Weather Service until the mid-1960s.

;;KB-47B
:In 1953, two B-47Bs were modified to test the probe-and-drogue refueling system. The tanker, fitted with British-built tanker kit, was given the designation KB-47G and was known as &quot;Maw&quot; by flightcrews. The receiver aircraft was designated YB-47F and was known as &quot;Paw&quot;, though other aircraft (including the YB-52 prototype) were also used as refueling targets. The program was cancelled in 1954 as the KB-47G could not carry a practical fuel load. The idea of fielding B-47 tanker conversions was re-examined, but unfavorable economics meant that it was again discarded in 1957. In parallel to the KB-47, Boeing tested its aerial refueling system aboard its Dash 80, later evolving into the KC-135 Stratotanker, which had greater fuel capacity.

;;Canadair CL-52
:An unusual conversion was the Canadair CL-52: a B-47B (USAF S/N 51-2059 RCAF S/N 059X) loaned in 1956 to the Royal Canadian Air Force to test the new, powerful Orenda Iroquois turbojet (rated at dry, afterburning) for the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow interceptor. Canadair attached the Iroquois engine to the right side of the rear fuselage; due to the large exterior diameter of the engine, no other location was feasible. Flying the CL-52 was reportedly a nightmare. After the Arrow was canceled in early 1959, the B-47B/CL-52, which saw 35 hours of engine flight tests, was returned. Some sources claimed it was bent out of shape; it was scrapped. The CL-52 was the only B-47 to be used by any foreign service.

;YB-47C / RB-47C / B-47Z / B-56

:A four-engined variant of the B-47, the YB-47C was proposed by Boeing in 1950 to be powered by four Allison J35-A-23 turbojet engines, providing thrust each, in place of the six GE J47s. The J35 was being developed at the time, and was provisionally rated at (with afterburner) or thrust without AB. Thus 4 * 8500 = using that engine, as compared to 6 * = in the production B-47, making it lighter, simpler and more powerful. J71-A-5 A contract was signed in January 1950 for the rework of one B-47B. The first flight was projected for April 1951.

:Due to the J35&#x27;s less-than-expected performance and delays, other engines were considered, such as the proposed Allison J71, however engine problems meant that it was not feasible for the by-then redesignated B-56A. The Pratt &amp; Whitney J57, eventually rated at thrust, was also considered, but was still in development. The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, which was being concurrently developed, had priority for this engine. Thus, the B-56 was cancelled in December 1952 before the prototype&#x27;s conversion had started. The donor fuselage intended for the XB-56 was reused as a ground instructional airframe.
;XB-47D
:Starting in 1951, two XB-47Ds were modified from B-47Bs as experimental platforms, replacing each inboard two-jet pod with a Wright YT49-W-1 turboprop engine spinning a huge four-bladed prop. Engine development issues delayed the XB-47D&#x27;s first flight until 26 August 1955. Performance was comparable to a conventional B-47, and its reversible propellers shortened the landing roll, but the idea was not pursued.

;B-47E

:The designations B-47C and B-47D applied to variants that were never produced, thus the next production model was the definitive B-47E, first flying on 30 January 1953. Four &quot;blocks&quot; or &quot;phases&quot; were built, each incorporating refinements on the previous block; changes sometimes occurred mid-block. The B-47 incorporated the radar-controlled rear tail turret. A total of 1,341 B-47Es were produced; 691 built by Boeing, 386 built by Lockheed, and 264 built by Douglas. Most B-47Bs were rebuilt to B-47E standards and given the designation of B-47B-II, though they were often called B-47Es.

:Early B-47E-Is had J47-GE-25 turbojets with thrust, these were changed to J47-GE-25A engines with water-methanol injection, which increased mass flow to temporarily raise thrust to and produce much black smoke when engaged. Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) was installed on early B-47E-Is, integrating 18 JATO bottles, but was removed due to its proximity to fuel tanks. A later JATO system used an external jettisonable &quot;split V&quot; or &quot;horse collar&quot; rack fitted under the rear fuselage, carrying 33 JATO bottles in three rows of 11 bottles; the expendable racks were dropped over specific range areas after takeoff. Early B-47Es had a lower internal fuel capacity of to save weight, which was considered acceptable due to large external tanks and mid-air refueling becoming common practice. A welcome change was the return of ejection seats. The twin .50 in guns (12.7 mm) in the tail turret were replaced with twin 20 mm (0.79 in) cannon for more firepower, backed up by an A-5 FCS in early production and an MD-4 FCS in later production.

:The B-47E-II had only minor changes from later-built B-47E-Is. The B-47E-III featured an ECM suite, consisting of a radar jammer in a bulge under the fuselage plus a chaff dispenser, as well as improved electrical alternators. The B-47E-IV was a major update, featuring stronger landing gear, airframe reinforcement, greater fuel capacity, and an uprated bombload of while the bomb bay was again shortened as nuclear weapons became more compact. Another addition was the MA-7A BNS, which included the AN/APS-64 radar, having a range of up to and could be used as a long range &quot;identification friend or foe (IFF) transponder&quot; interrogator to locate other B-47s or tankers, or as a high-resolution ground-targeting radar. The B-47E-IV retained the rarely-used optical bombsight. Most nose windows were deleted; only one remained on each side.

;;TEE TOWN B-47E
:In 1955, 100 B-47E-Is were modified to carry two removable external pods, one mounted on either side of the bomb bay, with each pod containing four AN/ALT-6B jammers. The pods were known as &quot;Tee Town pods&quot; (for Topeka, Kansas, location of Forbes AFB) and so these aircraft were known as &quot;Tee Town B-47s&quot;. All retained their bombing capability.

;;EB-47E
:The Tee Town B-47Es led to a specialized ECM conversion, the EB-47E. &quot;Phase IV&quot; or &quot;Blue Cradle&quot; aircraft used a removable cradle housing 16 jammers in the bomb bay, plus radar warning receivers and chaff dispensers. The advanced &quot;Phase V&quot; EB-47E had a pressurized module holding 13 jammers stowed in the bomb bay controlled by two Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs), also known as &quot;Crows&quot; or &quot;Ravens&quot;. While the Phase IV jammer was &quot;broadband&quot;, covering a wide frequency range to jam radars operating within that range, the Phase V jammer could be selectively tuned to specific radar frequencies, enabling higher jammer power on the most effective frequencies. About 40 B-47Es were converted to EB-47Es; they could not carry bombs but retained tail turrets.

:B-47E &quot;52-0410&quot; and &quot;52-0412&quot; were converted to EB-47Es in the mid-1960s for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group (FEWSG). Considered to be on indefinite loan, they differed from USAF EB-47Es in that some podded ECM gear was mounted on the external fuel tank pylons. Used as &quot;electronic aggressors&quot; to test ECM systems, they were the last B-47s in service, &quot;52-0410&quot; performed its last flight on 20 December 1977.

;;EB-47E(TT)
:Three B-47Es were converted to the specialized EB-47E(TT) &quot;Tell Two&quot; configuration to be used for &quot;telemetry intelligence&quot;, picking up radio signals from Soviet missile tests and space launches, being a precursor to the RC-135S Rivet Ball and Cobra Ball. It featured two ECM operators, a &quot;Crow capsule&quot; in the bomb bay loaded with gear, and distinctive antennas below each side of the cockpit. All three aircraft were operated out of Turkey until 1967. Crews often made up stories about their purpose, such as a &quot;return to fighter&quot; defensive system that made air-to-air missiles loop back and attack their own launch fighters.

;;ETB-47E
:As with the B-47B, a few B-47Es were converted to trainers, with a fourth seat for an instructor, and designated ETB-47E. They replaced older TB-47Bs, serving into the early 1960s.

;;DB-47E / YDB-47E
:Two B-47Es were converted to YDB-47Es to support the GAM-63 RASCAL stand-off missile program; two more B-47Es were converted to DB-47Es in preparation for the missile&#x27;s introduction before it was axed and were reused as drone controller aircraft.

;;JB-47E
:Several B-47Es were assigned to other specialized test duties and given the blanket designation of JB-47E. One was used in the late 1960s to test &quot;fly by wire&quot; control system concepts.

;;JTB-47E
:Two B-47Es were also used for secret flight experiments in the early 1960s and given the designation JTB-47E, and a third modified B-47E was given the designation JRB-47E. They appear to have been test platforms for ECM systems.

;;NB-47E
:A B-47E was loaned to the US Navy to test the GE TF34-2 turbofan for the Lockheed S-3 Viking. It was given the designation NB-47E and performed test flights from 1969 through 1975.

;;QB-47E
:A total of 14 RB-47Es were converted to QB-47E target drones in 1959 and 1960. These aircraft were radio-controlled and included self-destruct charges, arresting gear to assist landings, and carried pods on the external tank pylons to help in scoring weapons tests. Apparently most missiles fired on them were directed for a near-miss, but the QB-47Es were nonetheless eventually whittled down to two survivors that were retired in the early 1970s.

;;RB-47E
:The B-47E was the basis for several reconnaissance models, the only B-47s to see anything resembling combat. They operated from most airfields that gave access to the USSR and often probed Soviet airspace. Boeing built 240 RB-47Es, similar to the B-47E but with a nose stretched by , giving an arguably more elegant appearance. The long nose accommodated up to 11 cameras, possibly including an O-15 radar camera for low-altitude work, a forward oblique camera for low-altitude work, a K-17 trimetrogon (three-angle) camera for panoramic shots and K-36 telescopic cameras. Cameras were controlled by the &quot;navigator-photographer&quot;. Photoflash flares were carried for night photography. While it could be refueled in flight, fuel capacity was increased to a total of .

;;WB-47E

:Following the single WB-47B conversion, in the early 1960s, 34 B-47Es were converted by Lockheed into WB-47Es for weather reconnaissance to replace 44 WB-50D Superfortresses that had suffered several fatal crashes between 1956 and 1960. Stripped of combat gear, they were fitted with nose cameras to photograph cloud formations and a meteorological instrument pod in the bomb bay. Initially assigned to the Air Weather Service of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), they became part of the Military Airlift Command (MAC) upon its establishment. The WB-47Es, the last B-47s in USAF service, were retired in October 1969.

:The 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, of the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Wing, operated WB-47Es from Hunter Air Force Base and Ramey Air Force Base. These assets were transferred to the 57th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron for Operation Arc Light, operating from Clark Air Base.

;RB-47H/ERB-47H

:A total of 32 RB-47H models were built for electronic intelligence (ELINT) missions, as well as three more specialized &quot;ERB-47Hs&quot;. Featuring a distinctive blunt, rounded nose and sported blisters and pods for intelligence-gathering antennas and gear, they were designed to probe defenses and collect data on radar and communications signals. The bomb bay was replaced by a pressurized compartment, which accommodated &quot;Crows&quot;, or Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs). There were three Crows on board the RB-47H and two on the ERB-47H. A distinctive bulged radome fairing replaced the bomb bay doors. They retained the tail turret and were fitted with jammers and chaff dispensers. A recognizable difference between the RB-47H and ERB-47H was the latter&#x27;s distinctive antenna fairing under the rounded nose.

:The first RB-47H was delivered in August 1955 to Forbes AFB, Kansas. They received a &quot;Mod 44&quot; or &quot;Silver King&quot; program in 1961 to update electronics systems and was recognizable by a large teardrop pod for ELINT antennas upon a pylon under the belly and offset to one side, as well as a pylon-style antenna under each wing beyond the outboard engine. The EWO compartment was cramped with sitting room only and had both poor noise insulation and climate control, making 12-hour missions uncomfortable and tiring. Successful ejection downward through the belly radome was impossible near the ground. Crews sat bobsled-like on the pilot compartment&#x27;s floor for takeoff and landing. They then crawled encumbered with Arctic clothing and parachute to and from their compartment along an unpressurized maintenance shelf during a temporary level-off at .

:Operations were generally flown at night and classified Top Secret. The final RB-47H to be retired from service, &quot;53-4296&quot;, was reactivated and fitted with an F-111-style nose to test avionics for the General Dynamics FB-111 in the early 1970s. It was not given any special designation. It is now on display at the Air Force Armament Museum at Eglin Air Force Base, fitted with a bomber nose.

;YB-47J
:A single B-47E was modified to test the MA-2 BNS for the B-52, and given the designation YB-47J.

;RB-47K
:The RB-47K was a photo and weather reconnaissance variant based on the RB-47E generally used for weather reconnaissance missions, carrying eight dropsonde weather sensors that were released at various checkpoints along its flight path. Data radioed from the dropsondes was logged by the navigator. Fifteen RB-47Ks were built, the variant was in service until 1963.

;EB-47L
:Between 1961 and 1963, 36 B-47Es were modified to carry a communications relay system and were designated EB-47L. Used to support US flying command post aircraft in case of a nuclear attack on the US, the EB-47Ls were only briefly in service as improved communications technologies made them redundant by 1965.

==Operators==
* United States Air Force
* United States Navy
* Royal Canadian Air Force – 1 B-47B loaned to Canada and converted by Canadair with the designation CL-52 to test the CF-105 Avro Arrow&#x27;s Orenda engines in 1956; returned to the U.S. Air Force and scrapped (1957)

==Accidents and incidents==

Over its operating life, 203 B-47s were lost in crashes, with 464 deaths. This represents approximately 10% of the total number produced.

On 8 February 1954, a B-47 of the 22nd Bomber Wing, March AFB, California, crashed in Stoke Wood, a mile and a half short of the runway at RAF Upper Heyford, England, while on a training run. All three crew were killed.

On 28 February 1955, a crippled B-47 crashed into a trailer park in Lake Charles, Louisiana, killing the three crewmen and two people on the ground.

On 10 March 1956, four B-47s left MacDill Air Force Base in Florida for a non-stop flight to Ben Guerir Air Base in Morocco. After descending through clouds to begin their second round of aerial refueling over the Mediterranean Sea at 14,000 feet, one of the four aircraft, serial number 52-0534, failed to make contact with the tanker; neither the aircraft, its two nuclear weapon cores, nor its personnel were ever found.

On 28 March 1956, a B-47 exploded near Wichita, Kansas, with an instructor and two student pilots on board. It crashed four miles northeast of the city, killing its crew of three. The office of information services at McConnell Air Force Base said the explosion occurred after takeoff, probably at about 2,000 feet altitude. Wreckage was strewn along the countryside for several miles as the wings sheared off and the fuselage tumbled to earth.

On 27 July 1956, a B-47 of the 307th Bombardment Wing crashed at RAF Lakenheath killing its crew and causing a near radioactive incident when it hit a storage igloo containing three MK-6 nuclear weapons. Although the bombs involved lacked their fissile cores, each carried about of high explosives for their trigger mechanism. The crash and ensuing fire did not ignite the high explosives and no detonation occurred.

In November 1956, B-47E serial number 51-2421 of the 96th Bombardment Wing, flying from Altus AFB, crashed on a farm near Hobart, Oklahoma, following engine problems. Four crewmen were killed in the incident.

On 9 October 1957, B-47 serial number 51-2177A, of the 447th Bomb Squadron, 321st Bomb Wing at Pinecastle Air Force Base suffered wing failure and crashed northwest of Orlando, Florida, and west of Winter Park, Florida, while conducting a practice demonstration for the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Navigation and Reconnaissance Competition at Pinecastle AFB. The wing commander, Colonel Michael Norman Wright McCoy, was killed in the crash; Pinecastle AFB was later renamed McCoy AFB in his honor.

On 4 December 1957, a MacDill Air Force Base B-47 exploded in mid-air over Choctawhatchee Bay, Okaloosa County, Florida. Parts were scattered over a wide underwater area that varied in depth from 20 to 30 feet. Assistance from US Navy divers from the Mine Detection Laboratory, Panama City, Florida, the Underwater Demolition Team No. 21 from Little Creek, Va., the 3201st Boat Squadron, APGC, recovered most of the plane. The three crew were killed.

On 5 February 1958, a B-47 was involved in a mid-air collision with an F-86 fighter over Georgia, known as 1958 Tybee Island mid-air collision.

On 26 February 1958, RB-47E serial number 52-0720 crashed six miles south of Lancaster, OH on approach to Lockbourne AFB, OH, hitting the ground at an angle of 50 degrees. It was determined that the aircraft attained an unusual attitude and/or high speed through disorientation, from which there was no recovery. In actuality, a wheel door had broken away and prevented the control surfaces being fully active.

On 13 March 1958, two B-47s crashed on the same date in separate incidents when the lower wing skin failed at the same structural location. One exploded over southeast Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing one crewman and raining debris over at least 8 square miles, witnessed by thousands of people on the ground. Two of the three men on a training mission from McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas, parachuted to safety. The third was trapped in the nose of the plane and died.

On 10 April 1958, a B-47 from Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, exploded mid-flight behind the KC-97G tanker that was to refuel it. The KC-97 was unharmed, but the wreckage fell within a half-mile of a highway and none of the crew survived.

On 15 April 1958, a B-47 from Walker Air Force Base in New Mexico, serial number 52–0562, crashed on takeoff at Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire; all four crewmen were killed.

On 22 November 1958, a B-47B crashed while taking off from Loring Air Force Base in Maine, killing all four crew members on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was described as having veered sharply to the right while two-thirds of the way down the runway, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before.

On 4 April 1959, B-47 serial number 52-0320 crashed in the Santa Rita mountains, south of Tucson, Arizona, while attempting to land at Davis-Monthan AFB. All three crew were killed. Investigators noted that a faulty altimeter was a contributing factor.

On 24 April 1959, Captain John S. Lappo, operating from Lockbourne AFB flew a B-47 with two crewmen on board under the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan. Following a general court-martial, he was grounded for life.

On 30 December 1959, a B-47B crashed at Torrejón Air Base, Spain one minute after takeoff. All four crew members were killed.

On 31 March 1960, B-47E serial number 52-1414, of the 384th Bomb Wing (SAC), 545th Bombardment Squadron, Little Rock AFB, exploded inflight over Little Rock, Arkansas. Three of the four crew and two civilians on the ground were killed.

On 4 January 1961, B-47 serial number 53-4244, based at Pease Air Force Base, crashed on takeoff; all four crewmen were killed.

On 24 February 1961, a B-47 crashed 10 miles southwest of Hurley, Wisconsin, while on a practice bombing mission from the 40th Bomb Wing at Forbes Air Force Base, Topeka, Kansas. Its four crew were killed. An engine was found 600 yards from the point of impact, indicating it detached prior to the crash.

On 2 May 1961, a B-47 crashed eight miles southwest of Hurley, Wisconsin, only a few miles from the scene of a prior B-47 crash on 24 February 1961. Two of four crew survived. Evidence showed that it was steeply diving when the crash occurred.

In January 1962, a B-47 based at Plattsburgh Air Force Base on a training mission crashed into the side of Wright Peak in the High Peaks in the Adirondacks of New York. All four crew were killed. It had veered about 30 miles east due to inclement weather. Wreckage can still be found at the summit, including a landing gear strut and a partial engine.

On 23 July 1962, a B-47 based at Dyess Air Force Base near Abilene, Texas, departed on a training mission through Montana. After crossing into Paradise Valley, it crashed into Emigrant Peak and exploded while turning toward the northwest. All four crew were killed.

On 3 August 1962, B-47 serial number 52-0526, based at Pease Air Force Base, crashed on takeoff; all three crew were killed.

On 22 August 1962, B-47 serial number 52-0553, based at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona, crashed on a training mission shortly before midnight in the Idaho mountains south of Smiths Ferry; controlled flight into terrain started a forest fire, and all three crew were killed.

On 20 February 1963, a B-47 of the 98th Bomb Wing based at Lincoln AFB, Nebraska, crashed in Bashaw Township, approximately three miles north of the town of Comfrey, Minnesota. All four crew were killed. It had just completed a low-altitude simulated bombing run near Heron Lake when the sixth engine failed, causing it to crash in a field, resulting in a 25-foot deep by 50-foot wide crater.

On 3 May 1963, B-47E serial number 52-0051, based at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, crashed in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming following a collision with a KC-135 during midair refueling. The co-pilot ejected safely, but the other three crewmen were killed; the tanker landed safely with no casualties.

On 19 August 1963, two B-47E aircraft, serial numbers 53-2365 and 53-6206, both based at Schilling AFB near Salina, Kansas, collided over western Iowa and crashed several miles apart near Irwin. All six crewman ejected, but three were killed.

On 20 August 1963, a QB-47 veered off course on its landing approach at Eglin AFB and crash landed on a road parallel to the runway. It was used for Bomarc Missile Program tests, normally operated from Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field Number Three (Duke Field), approximately north of the main base. Two cars were crushed, killing two occupants and injuring a third.

On 6 February 1964, B-47E serial number 52-0366, based at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, crashed in fog on takeoff; all four crewmen were killed.

On 27 March 1964, B-47E serial number 52-0321, based at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all four crewmen and two boys on the ground.

On 27 July 1964, B-47E serial number 53-2366, based at Lincoln AFB, Nebraska, crashed shortly after takeoff; all four crewmen were killed.

On 8 December 1964, B-47E serial number 52-0339, based at Pease AFB, crashed in Newington, New Hampshire, shortly after takeoff; all four crewmen were killed.

On 26 February 1965, B-47E serial number 52-0171, based at Pease AFB, collided during mid-air refueling with a KC-135 over the Atlantic Ocean, east of Maine. Both aircraft, with four crew members each, crashed into the water with no survivors. The bomber was one of three returning to Pease after a training mission in Spain.

<text>Margherita of Savoy (&quot;Margherita Maria Teresa Giovanna&quot;; 20 November 1851 – 4 January 1926) was Queen of Italy by marriage to her first cousin King Umberto I of Italy. She was the daughter of Prince Ferdinand of Savoy, Duke of Genoa and Princess Elisabeth of Saxony, and the mother of the King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

==Life==

===Early life===

Margherita was born to Prince Ferdinand of Savoy, Duke of Genoa, and Princess Elisabeth of Saxony. Her father died in 1855, and her mother remarried morganatically to Major Nicholas Bernoud, Marchese di Rapallo. She was educated by countess Clelia Monticelli di Casalrosso and her Austrian governess Rosa Arbesser. Reportedly, she was given a more advanced education than most princesses at the time, and displayed a great deal of intellectual curiosity. As a person, she was described as sensitive, proud and with a strong force of will without being hard, as well as having the ability to be charming when she chose to. As to her appearance, she was described as a tall, stately blonde, but she was not regarded as a beauty. Initially, she was suggested to marry Prince Charles of Romania. In 1867, the royal council president Luigi Federico Menabrea, pressed the king to arrange a marriage between Margherita and her cousin, the heir to the Italian throne.

===Crown princess (1868 - 1878)===

Margherita signed the wedding contract with her first cousin, Umberto, Prince of Piedmont, on 21 April 1868 in the ballroom of the royal palace in Turin, followed the next day by one civilian and one religious wedding ceremony. After the wedding, the crown prince couple settled in Naples. On 11 November 1869, Margherita gave birth to Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples, later Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, in Capodimonte in Naples. The relationship between Margherita and Umberto was not a success in regards to personal feelings; before their wedding, Umberto was already involved in an affair with his long-term lover, Eugenia Attendolo Bolognini, and two years after their wedding, the couple reportedly discontinued their marital relations. Their son was therefore to remain their only child; however, they never made their personal separation known to the public, and their relationship was in other aspects quite amiable: Margherita and Umberto worked together harmoniously as colleagues, Umberto even relying on her politically.

Margherita was raised with the idea of paternalistic monarchy and the ideal of enlightened despotism. Because of the lack of a queen, Margherita became the first lady of Italy immediately following her marriage, and she was given many representational duties intended to make the new royal house of united Italy popular throughout the peninsula. She became a great asset in this role, with her ability to say and do the right things to effectively arouse public enthusiasm and feeling in her public appearances. During her representational tours through Italy, made to arouse popularity for the royal house and thereby the united nation of Italy, she was careful to wear local folk costumes and demonstrate enthusiasm for local customs, traditions and culture, a method which made her so popular that she eclipsed the popularity of her husband.

In January 1871, after the final unification of Italy and the proclamation of Rome as the capital of Italy, the crown prince and crown princess settled in Rome. There, Margherita successfully continued her task by making her receptions at the royal court the center of Roman high society in her effort to subdue the opposition toward unification within the Roman aristocracy. She eventually succeeded in making her salon one of the most exclusive and famous in contemporary Europe.

=== Queen (1878–1900) ===
Margherita became Queen of Italy upon the succession of Umberto to the throne on 9 January 1878. In the critical situation that year, with the king and the pope, as well as an assassination attempt against the new king, Umberto reportedly asked Margherita for political advice. The attempted assassination of the king by Giovanni Passannante in November 1878 reportedly made her work even more forcefully to strengthen the prestige of the crown and build loyalty to the institution by gathering followers and making connections. As when she was a crown princess, she was actively assisted in this networking and image building by her favorite courtiers, marchioness Paola Pes di Villamarina and marquis Emanuele Pes di Villamarina, who were appointed her &quot;dama d’onore&quot; (senior lady in waiting) and &quot;cavaliere d’onore&quot; (senior lord in waiting), respectively.

As queen, Margherita worked to protect the monarchy against republicans and socialists, and she gathered a circle of conservative intellectuals and artists known as the &quot;Circolo della regina&quot; (Circle of the Queen) in her famous literary salon known as &quot;giovedì della regina&quot; (Queen&#x27;s Thursdays), where she benefited artists and writers. Among her circle of artists were the notoriously democratic and republican poet Giosuè Carducci, who famously wrote an ode to her when she became queen, and Marco Minghetti, who functioned somewhat as her guide in cultural circles, as well as her confidant. She founded cultural institutions, notably the Società del Quartetto (Quartet Society) and the Casa di Dante (House of Dante). Queen Margherita also fostered loyalty toward the monarchy by social and charitable work. She frequently visited and acted as the benefactor of hospitals, schools and institutions for children and the blind, founding the first library for the blind in Florence (1892). Her work was effective and already during the 1880s, she had become the centre of a personal cult as a popular symbol of the Italian monarchy and celebrated by poets and authors, as well as by the press, as a symbol of moral reform.

King Umberto by contrast had love affairs with the &quot;contessa fatale&quot; (Vincenza Publicola-Santacroce, contessa di Santa Fiora), besides duchess Litta, whom he reportedly also asked for political advice, which exposed the court to scandal; however, the queen was close to her son and strengthened her relations to him even further after his wedding. Queen Margherita was also involved in state affairs: viewing democracy as a potential threat to the monarchy, she supported Francesco Crispi against parliament. As a nationalist, she did not hesitate to support the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1896, in contrast to Umberto, who was hesitant. As a central figure of the conservative forces, she supported the repressive actions toward the rioters in Milan in 1898, which lead to the Bava Beccaris massacre.

On 18 August 1893, in the company of various guides, porters, Alpini, politicians and aristocrats, Margherita climbed the Punta Gnifetti (or Signalkuppe), a peak of the Monte Rosa massif on the Swiss–Italian border, for the inauguration of the mountain hut named after her. At 4,554 metres, the &quot;Capanna Regina Margherita&quot; (Margherita Hut) remains the highest hut in Europe. Margherita later accepted the position of Honorary President of the Ladies&#x27; Alpine Club.

=== Queen mother (1900–1926) ===
Umberto I, who had already survived in the past two attempted murders by the anarchists Giovanni Passannante and Pietro Acciarito, was killed on 29 July 1900 by another anarchist, Gaetano Bresci. As the widow of a murdered monarch, Margherita found an enormous amount of sympathy, which created a veritable myth around her as the mourning widow. She was aware of this mythology and acted accordingly in this part to benefit the prestige of the monarchy.

As queen dowager, Margherita took a step back and allowed her daughter-in-law to take precedence, as this was a part of the monarchical system which was her ideal; however, this did not mean that she retired from public life, and she remained a dominant public figure, performing what she regarded as her dynastic duties by making official visits to hospitals and churches until her death. She disliked the tolerance of democracy displayed by her son, the king, which she viewed as a form of socialist monarchy, and worked to ensure the monarchic traditions as much as she could against democratic tendencies. Her son did not wish to allow her any influence in state affairs, but she remained involved in politics through her connections and remained a political figure. In contrast to most nationalists, Margherita opposed World War I. During the war, she made one of her residences into a hospital and engaged actively within the Red Cross.

After the end of World War I, Margherita feared a socialist revolution and the end of the monarchy. This, combined with her nationalism and social conservatism, led her to support Italian fascism under Benito Mussolini, for which she felt a personal regard, although she never explicitly expressed her support. In October 1922, the quadrumvirs (Emilio De Bono, Italo Balbo, Michele Bianchi, and Cesare Maria De Vecchi) visited her at Bordighera to pay their respects prior to the March on Rome. Dowager Queen Margherita died in her villa in Bordighera on 4 January 1926, aged 74, after having a long attack of pleurisy. On 10 January 1926, her body was taken to Rome, where she was buried the following day in the royal tombs of the Pantheon, where it still stands. The funeral convoy stopped briefly time at each station to allow people to say a final farewell. In Pisa passed at night, and the band of railway workers of the city went to play as a sign of respect. In this occasion showed all the affection popular at the passage of the railway train, when an emotional crowd hindered and slowed down the progress of the same, in order to be able to approach and throw flowers.

==Legacy==
In 1879, the town of Margherita di Savoia, in Apulia, near Barletta, was named after her. In 1881, the mining town of Margherita in Assam, India, was named after her. Also in 1881, a large glass-window was made of her by Studio Moretti Caselli in Perugia, which was then shown around Italy and Europe before returning. The Pizza Margherita, whose red tomatoes, green basil, and white mozzarella cheese represent the Italian flag, was named after her in 1889. A pre-dreadnought battleship was named after her in her honour. It was laid down in 1898 and launched in 1901. In 1906, the Queen mother&#x27;s nephew, Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, made the first ascent of the highest summit of Mount Stanley (the third highest mountain in Africa) and named it Margherita Peak in her honour. In 2011, some of the Queen&#x27;s jewellery was auctioned at Christie&#x27;s.

<doc id="193889" wikidata="Q711243" url="?curid=193889" title="Frank James">
<text>Alexander Franklin James (January 10, 1843 – February 18, 1915) was a Confederate soldier and guerrilla; in the post-Civil War period, he was an outlaw. The older brother of outlaw Jesse James, Frank was also part of the James–Younger Gang.

==Childhood==
James was born in Kearney, Missouri, to Baptist minister Reverend Robert Sallee James and his wife Zerelda (Cole) James. The couple came from Kentucky. He was of English, Welsh and Scottish descent. Frank was the oldest of three children. His father died in 1850 and his mother remarried Benjamin Simms in 1852. After his death, she married a third time to Dr. Reuben Samuel in 1855, when Frank was 13 years old. As a child, James showed interest in his late father&#x27;s sizable library, especially the works of William Shakespeare. Census records show that James attended school regularly, and he reportedly wanted to become a teacher.

==Civil War==

The American Civil War began in 1861, when James was eighteen years old. The secessionists in Missouri, including Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson, attempted to drive the Union army out of the state, but were eventually defeated. The James family was from the heavily Confederate western portion of the state. On September 13, 1861, the Missouri State Guard, including private Frank James, besieged Lexington, Missouri. James fell ill and was left behind when the Confederate forces retreated. He surrendered to the Union troops, was paroled, and was allowed to return home. On his arrival, however, he was arrested by the local pro-Union militia and was forced to sign an oath of allegiance to the Union.

After the withdrawal of regular Confederate troops in the fall of 1861, a bitter guerrilla conflict soon began between bands of pro-Confederate irregulars (commonly known as bushwhackers) and the Union homeguards. By early 1863, Frank, ignoring his parole and oath of allegiance, had joined the guerrilla band of Fernando Scott, a former saddler. He soon switched to the more active command led by William Clarke Quantrill.

Union militiamen searching for Fernando Scott raided the Samuel farm and hanged Dr. Reuben Samuel (though not fatally), Frank&#x27;s stepfather, torturing him to reveal the location of the guerrillas. Shortly afterward, Frank took part with Quantrill&#x27;s company in the August 21, 1863, Lawrence Massacre where approximately 200 mostly unarmed civilians were killed.

 in Nelson County, Kentucky. There is a report that after his parole, Frank was involved in a gunfight in Brandenburg, Kentucky with four soldiers that resulted in two soldiers killed, one wounded, and Frank wounded in the hip. However, there is an alternative account that claims in the of 1865, Frank, who was in Kentucky going to Missouri, was suspected of stealing horses in Ohio and that Frank shot two members of a posse and escaped.

==Outlaw/criminal years and retirement==
During his years as a bandit, James was involved in at least four robberies between 1868 and 1876 that resulted in the deaths of bank employees or citizens. The most famous incident was the disastrous Northfield, Minnesota, raid on September 7, 1876, that ended with the death or capture of most of the gang.

Five months after the killing of his brother Jesse in 1882, Frank James boarded a train to Jefferson City, Missouri, where he had an appointment with the governor in the state capitol. Placing his holster in Governor Crittenden&#x27;s hands, he explained,

Accounts say that James surrendered with the understanding that he would not be extradited to Northfield, Minnesota.

He was tried for only two of the robberies/murders: one in Gallatin, Missouri, for the July 15, 1881, robbery of the Rock Island Line train at Winston, Missouri, in which the train engineer and a passenger were killed, and the other in Huntsville, Alabama, for the March 11, 1881, robbery of a United States Army Corps of Engineers payroll at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Among others, former Confederate General Joseph Orville Shelby testified on James&#x27;s behalf in the Missouri trial. He was acquitted in both Missouri and Alabama. Missouri accepted legal jurisdiction over him for other charges, but they never came to trial. He was never extradited to Minnesota for his connection with the Northfield Raid.

His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary summarized his arrest and acquittal:

In the last thirty years of his life, James worked a variety of jobs, including shoe salesman in Nevada, Missouri and then burlesque theater ticket taker in St. Louis. One of the theater&#x27;s spins to attract patrons was their use of the phrase &quot;Come get your ticket punched by the legendary Frank James.&quot; He also served as an AT&amp;T telegraph operator in St. Joseph, Missouri. James took up the lecture circuit, while residing in Sherman, Texas. In 1902, former Missourian Sam Hildreth, a leading thoroughbred horse trainer and owner, hired James as the betting commissioner at the Fair Grounds Race Track, in New Orleans. He returned to the North Texas area where he was a shoe salesman at Sanger Brothers in Dallas. The &quot;Tacoma Times&quot; reported in July, 1914, that he was picking berries at a local ranch in Washington state, and planned to buy a farm nearby. He was also part of a Chicago investment group which purchased the Fletcher Terrell&#x27;s Buckskin Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, third in size after the Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill shows.

In his final years, James returned to the James Farm, giving tours for the sum of 25 cents. He died there at age 72 on February 18, 1915. He left behind his wife Annie Ralston James and one son.

<text>ISO/IEC 646 is a set of ISO/IEC standards, described as &quot;Information technology — ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange&quot;, and developed in cooperation with ASCII at least since 1964. Since its first edition in 1967 it has specified a 7-bit character code from which several national standards are derived.

ISO/IEC 646 was also ratified by ECMA as ECMA-6. The first version of ECMA-6 had been published in 1965, based on work the ECMA&#x27;s Technical Committee TC1 had carried out since December 1960.

Characters in the ISO/IEC 646 Basic Character Set are &quot;invariant characters&quot;. Since that portion of ISO/IEC 646, that is the &quot;invariant character set&quot; shared by all countries, specified only those letters used in the ISO basic Latin alphabet, countries using additional letters needed to create national variants of ISO/IEC 646 to be able to use their native scripts. Since transmission and storage of 8-bit codes was not standard at the time, the national characters had to be made to fit within the constraints of 7 bits, meaning that some characters that appear in ASCII do not appear in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646.

== History ==

ISO/IEC 646 and its predecessor ASCII (ASA X3.4) largely endorsed existing practice regarding character encodings in the telecommunications industry.
As ASCII did not provide a number of characters needed for languages other than English, a number of national variants were made that substituted some less-used characters with needed ones. Due to the incompatibility of the various national variants, an International Reference Version (IRV) of ISO/IEC 646 was introduced, in an attempt to at least restrict the replaced set to the same characters in all variants. The original version (ISO 646 IRV) differed from ASCII only in that code point 0x24, ASCII&#x27;s dollar sign ($) was replaced by the international currency symbol (¤). The final 1991 version of the code ISO/IEC 646:1991 is also known as ITU T.50, International Reference Alphabet or IRA, formerly International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5). This standard allows users to exercise the 12 variable characters (i.e., two alternative graphic characters and 10 national defined characters). Among these exercises, ISO 646:1991 IRV (International Reference Version) is explicitly defined and identical to ASCII.

The ISO/IEC 8859 series of standards governing 8-bit character encodings supersede the ISO/IEC 646 international standard and its national variants, by providing 96 additional characters with the additional bit and thus avoiding any substitution of ASCII codes. The ISO/IEC 10646 standard, directly related to Unicode, supersedes all of the ISO646 and ISO/IEC 8859 sets with one unified set of character encodings using a larger 21-bit value.
A legacy of ISO/IEC 646 is visible on Windows, where in many East Asian locales the backslash character used in filenames is rendered as ¥ or other characters such as ₩. Despite the fact that a different code for ¥ was available even on the original IBM PC&#x27;s code page 437, and a separate double-byte code for ¥ is available in Shift JIS (although this often uses alternative mapping), so much text was created with the backslash code used for ¥ (due to Shift_JIS being officially based on ISO 646:JP, although Microsoft maps it as ASCII) that even modern Windows fonts have found it necessary to render the code that way. A similar situation exists with ₩ and EUC-KR. Another legacy is the existence of trigraphs in the C programming language.

== Code page layout ==
The following table shows the ISO/IEC 646 Invariant character set. Each character is shown with its Unicode equivalent. National code points are gray with the ASCII character that is replaced. Yellow indicates a character that, in some regions, could be combined with a previous character as a diacritic using the backspace character, which may affect glyph choice.

In addition to the invariant set restrictions, 0x23 is restricted to be either # or £ and 0x24 is restricted to be either $ or ¤ in ECMA-6:1991, equivalent to ISO/IEC 646:1991. However, these restrictions are not followed by all national variants.

== Variant codes and descriptions ==

=== ISO/IEC 646 national variants ===
Some national variants of ISO/IEC 646 are as follows:

=== National derivatives ===
Some national character sets also exist which are based on ISO/IEC 646 but do not strictly follow its invariant set (see also § Derivatives for other alphabets):

=== Control characters ===
All the variants listed above are solely graphical character sets, and are to be used with a C0 control character set such as listed in the following table:

=== Associated supplementary character sets ===
The following table lists supplementary graphical character sets defined by the same standard as specific ISO/IEC 646 variants. These would be selected by using a mechanism such as shift out or the NATS super shift (single shift), or by setting the eighth bit in environments where one was available:

== Variant comparison chart ==

The specifics of the changes for some of these variants are given in the following table. Character assignments unchanged across all listed variants (i.e. which remain the same as ASCII) are not shown.

For ease of comparison, variants detailed include national variants of ISO/IEC 646, DEC&#x27;s closely related National Replacement Character Set (NRCS) series used on VT200 terminals, the related European World System Teletext encoding series defined in ETS 300 706, and a few other closely related encodings based on ISO/IEC 646. Individual code charts are linked from the second column. The cells with non-white background emphasize the differences from US-ASCII (also the Basic Latin subset of ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode).

Several characters could be used as combining characters, when preceded or followed with a backspace C0 control. This is attested in the code charts for IRV, GB, FR1, CA, and CA2, which note that codice_1 would behave as the diaeresis, acute accent, cedilla, and circumflex (rather than quotation marks, a comma, and an upward arrowhead) when preceded or followed by a backspace. The tilde character (~) was similarly introduced as a diacritic (˜). This encoding method originated in the typewriter/teletype era when use of backspace would overstamp a glyph, and may be considered deprecated.

Later, when wider character sets gained more acceptance, ISO/IEC 8859, vendor-specific character sets and eventually Unicode became the preferred methods of coding most of these variants.

== Related encoding families ==
=== National Replacement Character Set ===

The National Replacement Character Set (NRCS) is a family of 7-bit encodings introduced in 1983 by DEC with the VT200 series of computer terminals. It is closely related to ISO/IEC 646, being based on a similar invariant subset of ASCII, differing in retaining codice_6 as invariant but not codice_7 (although most NRCS variants retain the codice_7, and hence comply with the ISO/IEC 646 invariant set). Most NRCS variants are closely related to corresponding national ISO/IEC 646 variants where they exist, with the exception of the Dutch variant.

=== World System Teletext ===

The European telecommunications standard ETS 300 706, &quot;Enhanced Teletext specification&quot;, defines Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Hebrew code sets with several national variants for both Latin and Cyrillic. Like NRCS and ISO/IEC 646, within the Latin variants, the family of encodings known as the G0 set are based on a similar invariant subset of ASCII, but do not retain either codice_6 nor codice_7 as invariant. Unlike NRCS, variants often differ considerably from corresponding national ISO/IEC 646 variants.

=== HP ===
HP has code page 1054, which adds the medium shade (▒, U+2592) at 0x7F. Code page 1052 replaces a few ASCII characters from code page 1054.


== Derivatives for other alphabets ==
Some 7-bit character sets for non-Latin alphabets are derived from the ISO/IEC 646 standard: these do not themselves constitute ISO/IEC 646 due to not following its invariant code points (often replacing the letters of at least one case), due to supporting differing alphabets which the set of national code points provide insufficient encoding space for. Examples include:
* 7-bit Turkmen (ISO-IR-230).
* 7-bit Greek.
** In ELOT 927 (ISO-IR-088), the Greek alphabet is mapped in alphabetical order (except for the final-sigma) to positions 0x61–0x71 and 0x73–0x79, on top of the Latin lowercase letters.
** ISO-IR-018 maps the Greek alphabet over both letter cases using a different scheme (not in alphabetical order, but trying where possible to match Greek letters over Roman letters which correspond in some sense), and ISO-IR-019 maps the Greek uppercase alphabet over the Latin lowercase letters using the same scheme as ISO-IR-018.
** The lower half of the Symbol font character encoding uses its own scheme for mapping Greek letters of both cases over the ASCII Roman letters, also trying to map Greek letters over Roman letters which correspond in some sense, but making different decisions in this regard (see chart below). It also replaces invariant code points 0x22 and 0x27 and five national code points with mathematical symbols. Although not intended for use in typesetting Greek prose, it is sometimes used for that purpose.
** ISO-IR-027 (detailed in the chart above rather than below) includes the Latin alphabet unchanged, but adds some Greek capital letters which cannot be represented with Latin-script homoglyphs; while it is explicitly based on ISO/IEC 646, some of these are mapped to code points which are invariant in ISO/IEC 646 (0x21, 0x3A, and 0x3F), and it is therefore not a true ISO/IEC 646 variant.
** The World System Teletext encoding for Greek uses yet another scheme of mapping Greek letters in alphabetical order over the ASCII letters of both cases, notably including several letters with diacritics.
* 7-bit Cyrillic
** KOI-7 or Short KOI, used for Russian. The Cyrillic characters are mapped to positions 0x60–0x7E, on top of the Latin lowercase letters, matching homologous letters where possible (where в is mapped to w, not v). Superseded by the KOI-8 variants.
** SRPSCII and MAKSCII, Cyrillic variants of YUSCII (the Latin variant is YU/ISO-IR-141 in the chart above), used for Serbian and Macedonian respectively. Largely homologous to the Latin variant of YUSCII (following Serbian digraphia rules), except for Љ (lj), Њ (nj), Џ (dž), and ѕ (dz), which correspond to digraphs in Latin-script orthography, and are mapped over letters which are not used in Serbian or Macedonian (q, w, x, y).
** The G0 sets for the World System Teletext encodings for Russian/Bulgarian and Ukrainian use G0 sets similar to KOI-7 with some modifications. The corresponding G0 set for Serbian Cyrillic uses a scheme based on the Teletext encoding for Latin-script Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, as opposed to the significantly different YUSCII.
* 7-bit Hebrew, SI 960. The Hebrew alphabet is mapped to positions 0x60–0x7A, on top of the lowercase Latin letters (and grave accent for aleph). 7-bit Hebrew was always stored in visual order. This mapping with the high bit set, i.e. with the Hebrew letters in 0xE0–0xFA, is ISO/IEC 8859-8. The World System Teletext encoding for Hebrew uses the same letter mappings, but uses BS_Viewdata as its base encoding (whereas SI 960 uses US-ASCII) and includes a shekel sign at 0x7B.
* 7-bit Arabic, ASMO 449 (ISO-IR-089). The Arabic alphabet is mapped to positions 0x41–0x5A and 0x60–0x6A, on top of both uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.

A comparison of some of these encodings is below. Only one case is shown, except in instances where the cases are mapped to different letters. In such instances, the mapping with the smallest code is shown first. Possible transcriptions are given for some letters; where this is omitted, the letter can be considered to correspond to the Roman one which it is mapped over.

<text>The wheatears are passerine birds of the genus Oenanthe. They were formerly considered to be members of the thrush family, Turdidae, but are now more commonly placed in the flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. This is an Old World group, but the northern wheatear has established a foothold in eastern Canada and Greenland and in western Canada and Alaska.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with &quot;Oenanthe leucura&quot;, the black wheatear, as the type species. The genus formerly included fewer species but molecular phylogenetic studies of birds in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae found that the genus &quot;Cercomela&quot; was polyphyletic with five species, including the type species &quot;C. melanura&quot;, phylogenetically nested within the genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot;. This implied that &quot;Cercomela&quot; and &quot;Oenanthe&quot; were synonyms. The genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; (Vieillot, 1816) has taxonomic priority over &quot;Cercomela&quot; (Bonaparte, 1856) making &quot;Cercomela&quot; a junior synonym. The genus name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; was used by Aristotle for an unidentified bird. The word is derived from the Greek &quot;oenoē&quot; meaning &quot;vine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; meaning &quot;bloom&quot;. The bird was associated with the grape harvest season.

The name &quot;wheatear&quot; is not derived from &quot;wheat&quot; or any sense of &quot;ear&quot;, but is a folk etymology of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;, referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.

==Description==
Most species have characteristic black and white or red and white markings on their rumps or their long tails. Most species are strongly sexually dimorphic; only the male has the striking plumage patterns characteristic of the genus, though the females share the white or red rump patches.

==Species list==

The genus contains 33 species:

==Behaviour==
Wheatears are terrestrial insectivorous birds of open, often dry, country. They often nest in rock crevices or disused burrows. Northern species are long-distance migrants, wintering in Africa.

==Fossil record==
*&quot;Oenanthe kormosi&quot; (Late Miocene of Polgardi, Hungary) 
*&quot;Oenanthe pongraczi&quot; (Pliocene of Csarnota, Hungary)

<text>The whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) is a small migratory passerine bird breeding in Europe and western Asia and wintering in central Africa. At one time considered to be in the thrush family, Turdidae, it is now placed in the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Both sexes have a strong supercilium, brownish upper parts mottled darker, a pale throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish belly, and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers, but in the breeding season, the male has an orange-buff throat and breast.

The whinchat is a solitary species, favouring open grassy country with rough vegetation and scattered small shrubs. It perches in elevated locations ready to pounce on the insects and other small invertebrates that form its diet. The nest is built by the female on the ground in coarse vegetation, with a clutch of four to seven eggs being laid. The hen incubates the eggs for about thirteen days and then both parents feed the nestlings. Fledging takes place about eighteen days after hatching and the parents continue to feed the young for another fortnight. Moulting takes place in late summer before the migration southwards, and again on the wintering grounds in Africa before the migration northwards in spring. The whinchat is a common species with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified it as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The whinchat was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla rubetra&quot;. The whinchat is now on of 15 chats placed in the genus &quot;Saxicola &quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802. The English name is derived from &quot;whin&quot;, the common gorse and &quot;chat&quot; referring to the nature of its calls. Its scientific name means &quot;small rock-dweller&quot;, in reference to its habitat. &quot;Saxicola&quot; derives from Latin &quot;saxum&quot; (&quot;rock&quot;) + &quot;incola&quot; (&quot;dwelling&quot;); &quot;rubetra&quot; is a Latin term for a small bird. No subspecies are recognised.

This species represents a fairly basal divergence of the genus &quot;Saxicola&quot;. It retains the supercilium found in many Muscicapidae but lost in the more derived &quot;Saxicola&quot; species such as the European stonechat or African stonechat (&quot;S. torquatus&quot;). As with other species of &quot;Saxicola&quot;, it was formerly considered a member of the thrush family (Turdidae), but is now placed in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It, and similar thrush-like Muscicapidae species, are often called chats.

Very rarely, hybridisation occurs between the whinchat and the Siberian stonechat (&quot;Saxicola maurus&quot;), with a case being reported in Finland in 1997. It has also been reported to hybridise with the European stonechat in western and southern Europe.

==Description==
The whinchat is a short-tailed bird, moving on the ground with small, rapid hops and frequently bobbing and flicking its wings and tail. It is similar in size to its relative the European robin (&quot;Erithacus rubecula&quot;), being long and weighing . Both sexes have brownish upperparts mottled darker, a buff throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish belly, and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers.

The male in breeding plumage has a blackish face mask almost encircled by a strong white supercilium and malar stripe, a bright orange-buff throat and breast, and small white wing patches on the greater coverts and inner median coverts. The female is duller overall, in particular having browner face mask, pale buffy-brown breast, and a buff supercilium and malar stripe, and smaller or no white wing patches. Males in immature and winter plumage are similar to females, except that adult males retain the white wing patches all year round.

Though fairly similar to females and immatures of the European stonechat (&quot;S. rubicola&quot;), the whinchat can readily be distinguished by its conspicuous supercilium and whiter belly, and also in western Europe, by being paler overall than the western European stonechat subspecies &quot;S. rubicola hibernans&quot;. It also differs structurally in being slightly slimmer and less &#x27;dumpy&#x27;, and having longer wingtips (an adaptation to its long-distance migration). It is more easily confused with female or immature Siberian stonechat (&quot;S. maura&quot;), which (also being a long-distance migrant) shares the longer wingtips; however, Siberian stonechat can be distinguished by its conspicuous unmarked pale orange-buff rump (in whinchat, the rump is the same mottled brown colour as the back).

Its main call is described as a &quot;hue-tac-tac&quot;, the &#x27;tac&#x27; softer and less grating than that of the European stonechat; the call is used both for contact between birds and predator alarms. The male has a whistling, crackly but soft song used during the breeding season, consisting of a mixture of soft whistles, tacs and more grating sounds; it is often mimetic, including phrases from the songs of at least 12 other assorted bird species. It sings from a fence, bush, tree or wire, or occasionally from the ground or in flight, between about April and July. On the wintering grounds, it often gives alarm calls but only occasionally sings, being most likely to do so at the end of winter, when starting spring migration.

==Distribution and habitat==

The whinchat is a migratory species breeding in Europe and western Asia from Ireland and northern Portugal east to the Ob River basin near Novosibirsk, and from northern Norway south to central Spain, central Italy, northern Greece, and the Caucasus Mountains.

Birds arrive on the breeding grounds between the end of April and mid-May, and depart between mid-August and mid-September (odd birds lingering to October). They winter primarily in tropical sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Kenya and south to Zambia, arriving in western Africa at the start of the dry season in late September to November, and leaving between February and March. Small numbers also winter in northwestern Africa in Morocco, northern Algeria and Tunisia. Available stopover sites are important for the successful migration of whinchat between Africa and Europe, where they face the barriers of the Sahara and Mediterranean Sea. Vagrants have reached northwest of the breeding range to Iceland, west on migration to the Canary Islands and Cape Verde, and south of the wintering range to northern South Africa.

During the breeding season in the UK, at the landscape-scale, whinchats favour habitats with high plant species richness and steeper slopes. However, at the territory scale, low-elevation areas with a heterogeneous vegetation structure and high density of perches and tussocks are preferred.

Whinchats wintering in Nigeria have a large breeding range that spreads across continental Europe indicating low connectivity, arising from wide migratory dispersal, with high mixing of breeding populations during the non-breeding season. A lone vagrant was sighted for the first time in India by birder R. Mohammed Saleem during their Great Indian Bird Expedition SEEK2019 at Chambal National Park.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The whinchat is a largely solitary bird though it may form small family groups in autumn. It favours rough low vegetation habitats such as open rough pasture or similar minimally cultivated grassland with scattered small shrubs such as hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;), and bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;) or heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;) stands on rock-strewn ground. It also commonly inhabits new and clear-felled conifer plantations until the new tree crop is about five to six years old and a metre or two tall. It always needs at least a few perching points (shrubs, tall weeds, or fence posts) to scan from for food and for use as song posts.

Breeding takes place in late April and May. The nest is built solely by the female, and is made of dried grasses and moss, and lined with hairs and fine bents. It is built on the ground, hidden in dense low vegetation, often at the foot of a bush. The female lays and incubates a clutch of four to seven eggs which hatch after eleven to fourteen days. Both parents bring food to the young which leave the nest ten to fourteen days later, while still too young to fly. The chicks fledge at seventeen to nineteen days after hatching and remain largely dependent on the parents for a further two weeks. Whinchats are short-lived, typically only surviving two years, to a maximum recorded of just over five years in the wild; breeding starts when birds are a year old. Predators include weasels, stoats, and small raptors such as the merlin and nest predators such as crows and magpies. Nests are also lost due to agricultural operations such as silage cutting (the main factor in the species&#x27; decline in western Europe) or trampling by livestock, and are sometimes parasitised by the common cuckoo.

Whinchats are insectivorous, feeding largely (about 80–90%) on insects, but also consume a wide range of other invertebrates including spiders, small snails and worms. They also eat small amounts of fruit such as blackberries, primarily in autumn. The birds like to perch on elevated spots such as shrubs, from where they make sallies to catch insects, mostly taken off the ground, but also flying insects. While so perched, males in particular frequently flick their tail and sometimes their wings to show the white tail and wing flashes, for display or territorial communication signals to other whinchats.

Adult whinchats have a single complex complete moult in late summer (late July onward) after breeding and mainly completed before southbound migration. Juveniles have a partial moult at the same time, growing new body feathering but retaining the flight feathers. All ages also have a partial moult in early spring on the wintering grounds before northbound migration.

==Status and conservation==
Fairly common across its wide range, the whinchat is classified as a species of &quot;least concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Some populations are however in serious decline, particularly in the west of its range in Britain, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, primarily due to agricultural intensification. In Britain it is amber-listed with an unfavourable conservation status; it had all but disappeared from former lowland breeding areas in the south and east between surveys in 1968–72 and 1988–91, remaining common only in upland areas of the north and west where low-intensity livestock rearing is the main land use. There has been a similar decline in Ireland, where it is now classified as &quot;rare&quot;.
