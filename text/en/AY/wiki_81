<text>Upper Silesia ( ; ; ; ; Silesian German: ; ) is the southeastern part of the historical and geographical region of Silesia, located today mostly in Poland, with small parts in the Czech Republic. The area is predominantly known for its heavy industry (mining and metallurgy).

==Geography==
Upper Silesia is situated on the upper Oder River, north of the Eastern Sudetes mountain range and the Moravian Gate, which form the southern border with the historic Moravia region. Within the adjacent Silesian Beskids to the east, the Vistula River rises and turns eastwards, the Biała and Przemsza tributaries mark the eastern border with Lesser Poland. In the north, Upper Silesia borders on Greater Poland, and in the west on the Lower Silesian lands (the adjacent region around Wrocław also referred to as Middle Silesia).

It is currently split into a larger Polish and the smaller Czech Silesian part, which is located within the Czech regions of Moravia-Silesia and Olomouc. The Polish Upper Silesian territory covers most of the Opole Voivodeship, except for the Lower Silesian counties of Brzeg and Namysłów, and the western half of the Silesian Voivodeship (except for the Lesser Polish counties of Będzin, Bielsko-Biała, Częstochowa with the city of Częstochowa, Kłobuck, Myszków, Zawiercie and Żywiec, as well as the cities of Dąbrowa Górnicza, Jaworzno and Sosnowiec).

Divided Cieszyn Silesia as well as former Austrian Silesia are historical parts of Upper Silesia.

== History ==

According to the 9th century Bavarian Geographer, the West Slavic Opolanie tribe had settled on the upper Oder River since the days of the Migration Period, centered on the gord of Opole. It is possible that during the times of Prince Svatopluk I (871–894), Silesia was a part of his Great Moravian realm. Upon its dissolution after 906, the region fell under the influence of the Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia, Duke Spytihněv I (894–915) and his brother Vratislaus I (915–921), possibly the founder and name giver of the Silesian capital Wrocław ().

===Polish rule===
By 990 the newly installed Piast duke Mieszko I of the Polans had conquered large parts of Silesia. From the Middle Silesia fortress of Niemcza, his son and successor Bolesław I the Brave (992–1025), having established the Diocese of Wrocław, subdued the Upper Silesian lands of the pagan Opolanie, which for several hundred years were part of Poland, though contested by Bohemian dukes like Bretislaus I, who from 1025 invaded Silesia several times. Finally, in 1137, the Polish prince Bolesław III Wrymouth (1107–1138) came to terms with Duke Soběslav I of Bohemia, when a peace was made confirming the border along the Sudetes.

However, this arrangement fell apart when upon the death of Bolesław III and his testament the fragmentation of Poland began, which decisively enfeebled its central authority. The newly established Duchy of Silesia became the ancestral homeland of the Silesian Piasts, descendants of Bolesław&#x27;s eldest son Władysław II the Exile, who nevertheless saw themselves barred from the succession to the Polish throne and only were able to regain their Silesian home territory with the aid of the Holy Roman Emperor. 
The failure of the Agnatic seniority principle of inheritance also led to the split-up of the Silesian province itself: in 1172 Władysław&#x27;s second son Mieszko IV Tanglefoot claimed his rights and received the Upper Silesian Duchy of Racibórz as an allodium from the hands of his elder brother Duke Bolesław I the Tall of Silesia. In the struggle around the Polish throne, Mieszko additionally received the former Lesser Polish lands of Bytom, Oświęcim, Zator, Siewierz and Pszczyna from the new Polish High Duke Casimir II the Just in 1177. When in 1202 Mieszko Tanglefoot had annexed the Duchy of Opole of his deceased nephew Jarosław, he ruled over all Upper Silesia as Duke of Opole and Racibórz.

In the early 13th century the ties of the Silesian Piasts with the neighbouring Holy Roman Empire grew stronger as several dukes married scions of German nobility. Promoted by the Lower Silesian Duke Henry I the Bearded, from 1230 also regent over Upper Silesia for the minor sons of his late cousin Duke Casimir I of Opole, large parts of the Silesian lands were settled with German immigrants in the course of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;, establishing numerous cities according to German town law. The plans to re-unify Silesia shattered upon the first Mongol invasion of Poland and the death of Duke Henry II the Pious at the 1241 Battle of Legnica. Upper Silesia further fragmented upon the death of Duke Władysław Opolski in 1281 into the duchies of Bytom, Opole, Racibórz and Cieszyn. About 1269 the Duchy of Opava was established on adjacent Moravian territory, ruled by the Přemyslid duke Nicholas I, whose descendants inherited the Duchy of Racibórz in 1336. As they ruled both duchies in personal union, Opava grew into the Upper Silesian territory.

===Bohemia, Hungary, Austria and Prussia===
In 1327 the Upper Silesian dukes, like most of their Lower Silesian cousins, had sworn allegiance to King John of Bohemia, thereby becoming vassals of the Bohemian kingdom. During the re-establishment of Poland under King Casimir III the Great, all Silesia was specifically excluded as non-Polish land by the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin becoming a land of the Bohemian Crown and — indirectly — of the Holy Roman Empire. By the mid-14th century, the influx of German settlers into Upper Silesia was stopped by the Black Death pandemic. Unlike in Lower Silesia, the Germanization process was halted; still a majority of the population spoke Polish and Silesian as their native language, often together with German (Silesian German) as a second language. In the southernmost areas, also Lach dialects were spoken. While Latin, Czech and German language were used as official languages in towns and cities, only in the 1550s (during the Protestant Reformation) did records with Polish names start to appear.

Upper Silesia was hit by the Hussite Wars and in 1469 was conquered by King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, while the Duchies of Oświęcim and Zator fell back to the Polish Crown as a part of Lesser Poland. Upon the death of the Jagiellonian king Louis II in 1526, the Bohemian crown lands were inherited by the Austrian House of Habsburg. In the 16th century, large parts of Silesia had turned Protestant, promoted by reformers like Caspar Schwenckfeld. After the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the Catholic Emperors of the Habsburg dynasty forcibly re-introduced Catholicism, led by the Jesuits.

Lower Silesia and most of Upper Silesia were occupied by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 during the First Silesian War and annexed by the terms of the Treaty of Breslau. A small part south of the Opava River remained within the Habsburg-ruled Bohemian Crown as the &quot;Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia&quot;, colloquially called Austrian Silesia. Incorporated into the Prussian Silesia Province from 1815, Upper Silesia became an industrial area taking advantage of its plentiful coal and iron ore. Prussian Upper Silesia became a part of the German Empire in 1871.

=== Ethnolinguistic structure before the plebiscite ===

The earliest exact census figures on ethnolinguistic or national structure (Nationalverschiedenheit) of the Prussian part of Upper Silesia, come from year 1819. The last pre-WW1 general census figures available, are from 1910 (if not including the 1911 census of school children - Sprachzählung unter den Schulkindern - which revealed a higher percent of Polish-speakers among school children than the 1910 census among the general populace). Figures (Table 1.) show that large demographic changes took place between 1819 and 1910, with the region&#x27;s total population quadrupling, the percent of German-speakers increasing significantly, and that of Polish-speakers declining considerably. Also, the total land area in which Polish language was spoken, as well as the land area in which it was spoken by the majority, declined between 1790 and 1890. Polish authors before 1918 estimated the number of Poles in Prussian Upper Silesia as slightly higher than according to official German censuses.

United States Immigration Commission in 1911 classified Polish-speaking Silesians as Poles.

===Interbellum, World War II, and post-war period===

In 1919, after World War I, Polish miners organized large protests in Mysłowice. On August 15, 1919, the German &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; opened fire on protesting Polish miners and their families, killing seven miners, two women and a 13-year-old boy. The event, known as the &quot;Mysłowice massacre&quot;, sparked the First Silesian Uprising against Germany.
Soon afterwards, the eastern part of Upper Silesia (with a majority of ethnic Poles) came under Polish rule as the Silesian Voivodeship, while the mostly German-speaking western part remained part of the Weimar Republic as the newly established Upper Silesia Province. In early 1919, the Polish–Czechoslovak War broke out around Cieszyn Silesia, whereafter Czechoslovakia gained the Trans-Olza strip in addition to the Hlučín Region.

From 1919 to 1921 three Silesian Uprisings occurred among the Polish-speaking populace of Upper Silesia; the Battle of Annaberg was fought in the region in 1921. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of March 1921, a majority of 59.4% voted against merging with Poland and a minority of 40.6% voted for, with clear lines dividing Polish and German communities. The plan to divide the region was suggested by the Inter-Allied Commission on Upper Silesia, headed by the French general Henri Le Rond. The plan was decided by an ambassadors conference in Paris on 20 October 1921. The exact border, the maintenance of cross-border railway traffic and other necessary co-operations, as well as equal rights for all inhabitants in both parts of Upper Silesia, were all fixed by the German-Polish Accord on East Silesia, signed in Geneva on 15 May 1922. On 20 June 1922 the Weimar Republic ceded the East Upper Silesia region to Poland. The area became part of Silesian Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic.

The new border only partly followed the results of the referendum. The reason was that closely following the local majority vote would have resulted in a plurality of enclaves and would thus not have been a viable border. Particularly in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region, the border line was often bizarre, cutting right through settlements or through industrial facilities.


During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, German troops committed numerous massacres of Polish civilians in the region, including at Gostyń, Łaziska Górne, Jankowice, Zgoń, Lędziny, Świętochłowice, Katowice, Pasternik, Pszczyna, Siemianowice Śląskie and Wyry. Afterwards, Polish Silesia was annexed to the Nazi German Reich as part of the &quot;Gau&quot; of Silesia. The Polish population was subjected to further persecution and crimes. A network of &quot;Polenlager&quot; forced labour camps was established in the region, and multiple subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Germans operated the Stalag VIII-B, Stalag VIII-D and Stalag VIII-F prisoner-of-war camps for Polish, French, Belgian, British, Serbian and other Allied POWs, with numerous forced labour subcamps, in the region. In 1941 Upper and Lower Silesia were split into separate &quot;Gaue&quot;.

After 1945, almost all of Upper Silesia that was not ceded to Poland in 1922 was placed under the administration of the Republic of Poland. German civilians, as well as Nazi criminals, were interned in labor camps such as the Zgoda labour camp. The majority of the German-speaking population that had not fled was expelled, an activity that was euphemized as &quot;transfers [to] be effected in an orderly and humane manner&quot; in accordance with the decision of the victorious Allied powers at their 1945 meeting at Potsdam. The German expellees were transported to the present-day Germany (including the former East Germany), and Polish migrants, a sizeable part of whom were themselves expelleés from former Polish provinces taken over by the USSR in the east, settled in Upper Silesia. A good many German-speaking Upper Silesians were relocated in Bavaria. A small part of Upper Silesia stayed as part of Czechoslovakia as Czech Silesia.

The expulsions of German-speakers did not totally eliminate the presence of a population that considered itself German. In contrast to the situation in Lower Silesia, where almost the totality of the pre-war population that was expelled was exclusively German-speaking (only about 50-60% of the population of Upper Silesia was displaced to Germany, while over 95-97% of population of Lower Silesia was displaced), the pre-war population of Upper Silesia was in considerable number Roman Catholic mixed bilingual that spoke both German and Polish dialects, and their Polish linguistic skills were considered solid enough for them to be kept in the area (Aleksandra Kunce, &quot;Being at Home in a Place: The Philosophy of Localness&quot;, pp. 41–112 ). Firstly, after the war, Poles displaced from Polish territories incorporated into the USSR settled in Upper Silesia, but also Polish settlers from other overpopulated parts of Poland. And later, in the years 1945-1989, a large number of Poles from various parts of Poland settled in Upper Silesia, who received work, e.g. in the mines.

The area formally became part of the Republic of Poland by virtue of the German-Polish border treaty of 14 November 1990. With the fall of communism and Poland&#x27;s joining the European Union, there were enough of these remaining in Upper Silesia to allow for the recognition of the German minority in Poland by the Polish government.

== Culture ==
=== Silesian cuisine ===
Upper Silesian cuisine belongs to Central European cuisines and is therefore characterized by high calorific value of dishes. For centuries, Polish, Czech and German cuisine was mixed here. Typical Upper Silesian dishes are consumed here, as well as dishes that are also present in Lesser Poland and Greater Poland at the same time. In the second half of the twentieth century, dishes from the Polish borderland cuisine (potato pancakes, dumplings with cheese, red borscht, bigos) gained popularity in Upper Silesia.

=== Clothes ===

Silesian women&#x27;s clothes vary depending on the region and even the individual towns and villages they come from. The ways of dressing intertwined with the movement of people in the 19th and 20th century. The inhabitants of Silesia also started to adapt their outfits to the urban fashion, which changed the appearance of the outfit even more.

The men&#x27;s outfit consists of a shacket, a shirt (vest), a white shirt, a silk shirt (silk scarf) or a dressing gown (ribbons), galot (trousers) or bizoków (trousers ironed to the edge) and szczewików (shoes). The man&#x27;s costume is now called an &quot;ancug&quot;, this name is mainly associated with a suit.

=== Crafts ===
In Upper Silesia, metallurgy, mining and other heavy industry branches are developed.

Agriculture plays a secondary role, developed mainly in Opole Silesia.

=== Media ===
On the territory of Upper Silesia, TVP Info broadcasts the regional channels TVP Opole and TVP Katowice of the public Polish Television. In addition, the private television station TVS is aimed at viewers in the Silesian Voivodeship. Another channel is TVT.

Regionally oriented radio stations are Polskie Radio Opole and Polskie Radio Katowice of the state radio station. A private Upper Silesian station is Radio Piekary.

Radio Mittendrin is a German-Polish Internet radio station of the German minority.

==Sports==

Football, ice hockey and volleyball teams from Upper Silesia enjoyed great success either historically or recently.

Football enjoys a strong following in the region with Górnik Zabrze and Ruch Chorzów among the most accomplished teams in Poland, and other notable teams including GKS Katowice, Odra Opole, Piast Gliwice, Polonia Bytom.

Top volleyball teams, multiple times Polish champions, are Jastrzębski Węgiel and ZAKSA Kędzierzyn-Koźle, with the latter also winning three consecutive CEV Champions League titles in 2021–2023.

Top ice hockey teams, multiple times Polish champions, are GKS Katowice, GKS Tychy, Polonia Bytom.

==Local politics==
The autonomy movement is relatively young and was only founded in 1990 by Rudolf Kolodziejczyk in Rybnik. It is supposed to continue the traditions of the German period, but also of Silesia under the Second Polish Republic. The current head of the movement is Jerzy Gorzelik. Its main aim is to improve the self-government of the Upper Silesian provinces of Opolskie and Slaskie.

In 2010, RAS (Ruch Autonomii Śląska) had 8.49% of the votes in the Silesian Regional Assembly, i.e. 122,781 votes and three mandates. In 2018 they failed to get any mandates with 3.10%.

<doc id="196193" wikidata="Q7325150" url="?curid=196193" title="Richard Deane (regicide)">
<text>Richard Deane (bapt. 8 July 1610– 1 June 1653) was an English military officer who supported the Parliamentarian cause in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. He was a General at Sea, major-general and one of the regicides of Charles I.

==Biography==
Deane was a younger son of Edward Deane of Temple Guiting or Guyting in Gloucestershire, where he was born, his baptism taking place on 8 July 1610. His family seems to have been strongly Puritan and was related to many of those Buckinghamshire families who were prominent among Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s supporters during the English Civil War. His uncle or great-uncle was Sir Richard Deane, Lord Mayor of London in 1628–1629.

Few records of Deane&#x27;s early life survive, but he seems to have had some sea training, possibly on a ship-of-war. At the outbreak of the Civil War he joined the parliamentary army as a volunteer in the artillery, a branch of the service with which he was constantly and honourably associated.

In 1644 he held a command in the artillery under Essex in Cornwall and took part in the surrender after the second Battle of Lostwithiel (2 September 1644). Essex (&quot;Letter to Sir Philip Stapleton, Rushworth Collection&quot;) calls him &quot;an honest, judicious and stout man&quot;, an estimate of Deane borne out by Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;bold and excellent officer&quot; (&quot;book xiv. cap. 27&quot;), and he was one of the few officers concerned in the surrender who were retained at the remodelling of the army.

Appointed comptroller of the ordnance, Deane commanded the artillery at Naseby (14 June 1645) and during Fairfax&#x27;s campaign in the west of England in 1645. In 1647 he was promoted colonel and given a regiment. In May of that year the Parliament of England appointed Oliver Cromwell as lord-general of the forces in Ireland, and Deane, as a supporter of Cromwell who had to be reckoned with, was appointed his lieutenant of artillery. Cromwell refused to be thus put out of the way, and Deane followed his example. When the war broke out afresh in 1648 Deane went with Cromwell to Wales. As brigadier-general his leading of the right wing at Preston contributed greatly to that victory.

On the entry of the army into London in 1648, Deane superintended the seizure of treasure at the Guildhall and the Weavers&#x27; Hall the day after Thomas Pride &quot;purged&quot; the House of Commons and accompanied Cromwell to the consultations as to the &quot;settlement of the Kingdom&quot; with William Lenthall and Sir Thomas Widdrington, the keeper of the great seal. He is rightly called by Sir J. K. Laugkiton (in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;) Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;trusted partisan&quot;, a character which he maintained in the active and responsible part taken by him in the events which led up to the trial and execution on 30 January 1649 of King Charles. He was one of the commissioners for the trial, and a member of the committee which examined the witnesses. He also signed the execution warrant, becoming the 21st of the 59 signatories to the document. 

Deane&#x27;s capacities and activities were now required for the navy. In 1649 the office of Lord High Admiral was put into commission. The first commissioners were Edward Popham, Robert Blake and Deane, with the title of generals-at-sea. His command at sea was interrupted in 1651, when as major-general he was brought back to the army and took part in the battle of Worcester. Later he was made president of the commission for the settlement of Scotland, following the Tender of Union, with supreme command of the military and naval forces.

At the end of 1652 Deane returned to his command as general-at-sea, where George Monck had succeeded Popham, who had died in 1651. In 1653 Deane was with Blake in command at the Battle of Portland and later took the most prominent and active part in the refitting of the fleet on the reorganisation of the naval service.

At the outset of the Battle of the Gabbard on 1 June 1653, Deane was killed. His body lay in state at Greenwich and after a public funeral was buried in Henry VII&#x27;s chapel at Westminster Abbey, to be disinterred at the Restoration.

==Family==
His daughter, Hannah, was the fourth wife of Godwin Swift (1628–1695), Attorney-General at Tipperary to the Court Palatine of the 1st Duke of Ormonde. This appointment was through his first wife, Elizabeth Wheeler, who was a niece of Sir Patrick Wemyss, the first cousin of Elizabeth Preston, Duchess of Ormonde. Godwin Swift was the uncle and guardian of Jonathan Swift and a second cousin of Erasmus Dryden, the father of John Dryden.

<doc id="196196" wikidata="Q190302" url="?curid=196196" title="Claude Adrien Helvétius">
<text>Claude Adrien Helvétius (; ; 26 January 1715 – 26 December 1771) was a French philosopher, freemason and &quot;littérateur&quot;.

==Life==
Claude Adrien Helvétius was born in Paris, France, and was descended from a family of physicians, originally surnamed &quot;Schweitzer&quot; (meaning &quot;Swiss&quot; in German; Latinized as &quot;Helvétius&quot;). His great-grandfather Johann Friedrich Schweitzer known as &quot;Helvetius&quot;, was a Dutch physician and alchemist, of German extraction. His grandfather Adriaan Helvetius introduced the use of ipecacuanha; his father Jean Claude Adrien Helvétius was first physician to Marie Leszczyńska, queen of France. Claude Adrien was trained for a financial career, apprenticed to his maternal uncle in Caen, but he occupied his spare time with poetry. Aged twenty-three, at the queen&#x27;s request, he was appointed as a , a tax-collecting post worth 100,000 crowns a year. Thus provided for, he proceeded to enjoy life to the utmost, with the help of his wealth and liberality, his literary and artistic tastes - he attended, for example, the progressive Club de l&#x27;Entresol. As he grew older, he began to seek more lasting distinctions, stimulated by the success of Pierre Louis Maupertuis as a mathematician, of Voltaire as a poet, and of Montesquieu as a philosopher. His wife, Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius, maintained a salon attended by the leading figures of the Enlightenment for over five decades.

In 1758 Helvétius published his philosophical magnum opus, a work called &quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot; (On Mind), which claimed that all human faculties are attributes of mere physical sensation, and that the only real motive is self-interest, therefore there is no good and evil, only competitive pleasures. Its atheistic, utilitarian and egalitarian doctrines raised a public outcry, and the Sorbonne publicly burned it in 1759, forcing Helvétius to issue several retractions.

In 1764 Helvétius visited England, and the next year, at the invitation of Frederick II, went to Berlin, where the king paid him much attention.

After 10 years, when he thought his fortune sufficient, he gave up the post of farmer-general, and retired to a country estate in France, where he employed his fortune in the relief of the poor, the encouragement of agriculture and the development of industries. For this he won the admiration of many of the philosophers.

Helvétius&#x27; family lived alternately on &quot;Château de Voré&quot; (Collines des Perches, Loir-et-Cher) and their Parisian townhouse at the &quot;rue Sainte-Anne&quot;.

Religiously, Helvétius was a Deist, albeit a &quot;most indifferent&quot; one.

He died in Paris on December 26, 1771.

A work found in his papers called &quot;De l&#x27;homme, de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son éducation&quot; (On Man), was published in 1773.

==Philosophy==

===&quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot; and its reception===
Helvétius&#x27; philosophical studies ended in the production of his famous book &quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot; (On Mind). It was first published in 1758 and was intended to be the rival of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, with Helvétius arguing strongly against Montesquieu&#x27;s theory that climate influenced the character of nations.

The work attracted immediate attention and aroused the most formidable opposition, especially from the dauphin Louis, son of King Louis XV. The Advocate General Joly de Fleury condemned it in the Parlement of Paris in January 1759. The Sorbonne condemned the book, while the priests persuaded the court that it was full of the most dangerous doctrines. The book was declared to be hereticalso atheistic that it was condemned by Church and State and was burned. Helvétius, terrified at the storm he had raised, wrote three separate and humiliating retractions. In spite of his protestations of orthodoxy, the book was publicly burned by the Paris hangman.

It had far-reaching negative effects on the rest of the &quot;philosophes&quot;, in particular, Denis Diderot, and the work he was doing on the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The religious authorities, particularly the Jesuits and the new Pope, began to fear the spread of atheism and wanted to clamp down on the &#x27;modern thought&#x27; hard and quickly. &quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot; became almost a scapegoat for this.
This great publicity resulted in the book being translated into almost all the languages of Europe. Voltaire said that it lacked originality. Rousseau declared that the very benevolence of the author gave the lie to his principles. Grimm thought that all the ideas in the book were borrowed from Diderot. Madame du Deffand felt that Helvétius had raised such a storm by saying openly what everyone thought in secret. Madame de Graffigny claimed that all the good things in the book had been picked up in her own salon.

===Psychological egoism===
Helvétius&#x27; philosophy belongs to the Egoist school:

#All man&#x27;s faculties may be reduced to physical sensation, even memory, comparison, judgment. Our only difference from the lower animals lies in our external organization.
#Self-interest, founded on the love of pleasure and the fear of pain, is the sole spring of judgment, action, and affection. Human beings are motivated solely by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. &quot;These two,&quot; he says, &quot;are, and always will be, the only principles of action in man.&quot; Self-sacrifice is prompted by the fact that the sensation of pleasure outweighs the accompanying pain and is thus the result of deliberate calculation.
#We have no freedom of choice between good and evil. There is no such thing as absolute rightideas of justice and injustice change according to customs.

This view of man was largely Hobbesianman is a system deterministically controllable by a suitable combination of reward and punishment, and the ends of government are to ensure the maximization of pleasure.

===Natural equality of intelligences===
&quot;All men,&quot; Helvétius maintained, &quot;have an equal disposition for understanding.&quot; As one of the French Enlightenment&#x27;s many Lockean disciples, he regarded the human mind as a blank slate, but free not only from innate ideas but also from innate natural dispositions and propensities. Physiological constitution was at most a peripheral factor in men&#x27;s characters or capabilities. Any apparent inequalities were independent of natural organization, and had their cause in the unequal desire for instruction. This desire springs from passions, of which all men commonly well organized are susceptible to the same degree. We thus owe everything to education. Social engineering is therefore an enterprise unconstrained by the natural abilities of men.

This natural equality applied to all men in all nations, and thus the differences in national characteristics were not the result of innate differences between the people therein, but rather a byproduct of the system of education and government. &quot;No nation,&quot; wrote Helvétius, &quot;has reason to regard itself superior to others by virtue of its innate endowment.&quot;

This radically egalitarian aspect of Helvétius&#x27; philosophy caused Diderot to remark that if it were true, &quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot; might just as well have been written by Helvétius&#x27; dog keeper.

===Omnipotence of education===
Since all men have the same natural potential, Helvétius argued, they all have the same ability to learn. Thus, education is the method by which to reform society, and there are few limits to the drastic social improvements that could be brought about by the appropriate distribution of education. Although people seem to possess certain qualities in greater abundance than their neighbours, the explanation for this comes &#x27;from above&#x27; – it is caused by education, law and government. &quot;If we commonly meet in London, with knowing men, who are with much more difficulty found in France,&quot; this is because it is a country where &quot;every citizen has a share in the management of affairs in general.&quot; &quot;The art of forming men,&quot; he concludes, &quot;is in all countries [...] strictly connected to the form of the government&quot;, and thus education via governmental intervention is the method of reform.

The crux of his thought was that public ethics has a utilitarian basis, and he insisted strongly on the importance of culture and education in national development. His thinking can be described as unsystematic.

===Influence===
The original ideas in his system are those of the &quot;natural equality of intelligences&quot; and the &quot;omnipotence of education&quot;, neither of which gained general acceptance, though both were prominent in the system of John Stuart Mill. Cesare Beccaria states that he was largely inspired by Helvétius in his attempt to modify penal laws. Helvétius also exerted some influence on the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham.

The materialistic aspects of Helvétius, along with Baron d&#x27;Holbach, had an influence on Karl Marx, the theorist of historical materialism and communism, who studied the ideas of Helvétius in Paris and later called the materialism of Helvétius and d&#x27;Holbach &quot;the social basis of communism&quot;.

===Criticism===
German philosopher Johann Georg Hamann vigorously opposed Helvétius&#x27;s rationalistic doctrines.

British philosopher Isaiah Berlin listed Helvétius, along with Hegel, Fichte, Rousseau, Saint-Simon and Maistre as one of the six &quot;enemies of freedom&quot; who constituted the ideological basis for modern authoritarianism, in his book &quot;Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty&quot;.

==Poetry==
His poetic ambitions resulted in the poem called &quot;Le Bonheur&quot; (published posthumously, with an account of Helvétius&#x27;s life and works, by Jean François de Saint-Lambert, 1773), in which he develops the idea that true happiness is only to be found in making the interest of one person that of all.

==Bibliography==
A work called &quot;De l&#x27;homme, de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son éducation&quot;, found among his manuscripts, was published after his death. There is a complete edition of the works of Helvétius, published at Paris, 1818.

<text>Cesare Bonesana di Beccaria, Marquis of Gualdrasco and Villareggio (; 15 March 1738 – 28 November 1794) was an Italian criminologist, jurist, philosopher, economist, and politician who is widely considered one of the greatest thinkers of the Age of Enlightenment. He is well remembered for his treatise &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; (1764), which condemned torture and the death penalty, and was a founding work in the field of penology and the classical school of criminology. Beccaria is considered the father of modern criminal law and the father of criminal justice.

According to John Bessler, Beccaria&#x27;s works had a profound influence on the Founding Fathers of the United States.

==Birth and education==
Beccaria was born in Milan on 15 March 1738 to the Marchese Gian Beccaria Bonesana, an aristocrat of moderate standing from the Austrian Habsburg Empire. Beccaria received his early education in the Jesuit college at Parma. Subsequently, he graduated in law from the University of Pavia in 1758. At first he showed a great aptitude for mathematics, but studying Montesquieu (1689–1755) redirected his attention towards economics. In 1762 his first publication, a tract on the disorder of the currency in the Milanese states, included a proposal for its remedy.

In his mid-twenties, Beccaria became close friends with Pietro and Alessandro Verri, two brothers who with a number of other young men from the Milan aristocracy, formed a literary society named &quot;L&#x27;Accademia dei pugni&quot; (the Academy of Fists), a playful name which made fun of the stuffy academies that proliferated in Italy and also hinted that relaxed conversations which took place in there sometimes ended in affrays. Much of its discussion focused on reforming the criminal justice system. Through this group Beccaria became acquainted with French and British political philosophers, such as Diderot, Helvétius, Montesquieu, and Hume. He was particularly influenced by Helvétius.

==&quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot;==
Cesare Beccaria was best known for his book on crimes and punishments. In 1764, with the encouragement of Pietro Verri, Beccaria published a brief but celebrated treatise &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot;. Some background information was provided by Pietro, who was writing a text on the history of torture, and Alessandro Verri, a Milan prison official who had firsthand experience of the prison&#x27;s appalling conditions. In this essay, Beccaria reflected the convictions of his friends in the &quot;Il Caffè&quot; (Coffee House) group, who sought reform through Enlightenment discourse.

Beccaria&#x27;s treatise marked the high point of the Milan Enlightenment. In it, Beccaria put forth some of the first modern arguments against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. It is a less theoretical work than the writings of Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf and other comparable thinkers, and as much a work of advocacy as of theory.

The brief work relentlessly protests against torture to obtain confessions, secret accusations, the arbitrary discretionary power of judges, the inconsistency and inequality of sentencing, using personal connections to get a lighter sentence, and the use of capital punishment for serious and even minor offences.

Almost immediately, the work was translated into French and English and went through several editions. Editions of Beccaria&#x27;s text follow two distinct arrangements of the material: that by Beccaria himself, and that by French translator André Morellet (1765) who imposed a more systematic order. Morellet felt the Italian text required clarification, and therefore omitted parts, made some additions, and above all restructured the essay by moving, merging or splitting chapters. Because Beccaria indicated in a letter to Morellet that he fully agreed with him, scholars assumed that these adaptations also had Beccaria&#x27;s consent in substance. The differences are so great, however, that Morellet’s version became quite another book than the book that Beccaria wrote.

Beccaria opens his work describing the great need for reform in the criminal justice system, and he observes how few studies there are on the subject of such reform. Throughout his work, Beccaria develops his position by appealing to two key philosophical theories: social contract and utility. Concerning the social contract, Beccaria argues that punishment is justified only to defend the social contract and to ensure that everyone will be motivated to abide by it. Concerning utility (perhaps influenced by Helvetius), Beccaria argues that the method of punishment selected should be that which serves the greatest public good.

Contemporary political philosophers distinguish between two principal theories of justifying punishment. First, the retributive approach maintains that punishment should be equal to the harm done, either literally an eye for an eye, or more figuratively which allows for alternative forms of compensation. The retributive approach tends to be retaliatory and vengeance-oriented. The second approach is utilitarian which maintains that punishment should increase the total amount of happiness in the world. This often involves punishment as a means of reforming the criminal, incapacitating him from repeating his crime, and deterring others. Beccaria clearly takes a utilitarian stance. For Beccaria, the purpose of punishment is to create a better society, not revenge. Punishment serves to deter others from committing crimes, and to prevent the criminal from repeating his crime.

Beccaria argues that punishment should be close in time to the criminal action to maximize the punishment&#x27;s deterrence value. He defends his view about the temporal proximity of punishment by appealing to the associative theory of understanding in which our notions of causes and the subsequently perceived effects are a product of our perceived emotions that form from our observations of a causes and effect occurring in close correspondence (for more on this topic, see David Hume&#x27;s work on the problem of induction, as well as the works of David Hartley). Thus, by avoiding punishments that are remote in time from the criminal action, we are able to strengthen the association between the criminal behavior and the resulting punishment which, in turn, discourages the criminal activity.

For Beccaria when a punishment quickly follows a crime, then the two ideas of &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; will be more closely associated in a person&#x27;s mind. Also, the link between a crime and a punishment is stronger if the punishment is somehow related to the crime. Given the fact that the swiftness of punishment has the greatest impact on deterring others, Beccaria argues that there is no justification for severe punishments. In time we will naturally grow accustomed to increases in severity of punishment, and, thus, the initial increase in severity will lose its effect. There are limits both to how much torment we can endure, and also how much we can inflict.
Beccaria touches on an array of criminal justice practices, recommending reform. For example, he argues that dueling can be eliminated if laws protected a person from insults to his honor. Laws against suicide are ineffective, and thus should be eliminated, leaving punishment of suicide to God. Bounty hunting should not be permitted since it incites people to be immoral and shows a weakness in the government. He argues that laws should be clear in defining crimes so that judges do not interpret the law, but only decide whether a law has been broken.

Punishments should be in degree to the severity of the crime. Treason is the worst crime since it harms the social contract. This is followed by violence against a person or his property, and, finally, by public disruption. Crimes against property should be punished by fines. The best ways to prevent crimes are to enact clear and simple laws, reward virtue, and improve education.

Three tenets served as the basis of Beccaria&#x27;s theories on criminal justice: free will, rational manner, and manipulability. According to Beccaria—and most classical theorists—free will enables people to make choices. Beccaria believed that people have a rational manner and apply it toward making choices that will help them achieve their own personal gratification.

In Beccaria&#x27;s interpretation, law exists to preserve the social contract and benefit society as a whole. But, because people act out of self-interest and their interest sometimes conflicts with societal laws, they commit crimes. The principle of manipulability refers to the predictable ways in which people act out of rational self-interest and might therefore be dissuaded from committing crimes if the punishment outweighs the benefits of the crime, rendering the crime an illogical choice.

The principles to which Beccaria appealed were Reason, an understanding of the state as a form of contract, and, above all, the principle of utility, or of the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Beccaria had elaborated this original principle in conjunction with Pietro Verri, and greatly influenced Jeremy Bentham to develop it into the full-scale doctrine of Utilitarianism.

He openly condemned the death penalty on two grounds:
# because the state does not possess the right to take lives; and
# because capital punishment is neither a useful nor a necessary form of punishment.

Beccaria developed in his treatise a number of innovative and influential principles:
* Punishment has a preventive (deterrent), not a retributive, function.
* Punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed.
* A high probability of punishment, not its severity, would achieve a preventive effect.
* Procedures of criminal convictions should be public.
* Finally, in order to be effective, punishment should be prompt.

He also argued against gun control laws, and was among the first to advocate the beneficial influence of education in lessening crime. Referring to gun control laws as laws based on &quot;false ideas of utility&quot;, Beccaria wrote, &quot;The laws of this nature are those which forbid to wear arms, disarming those only who are not disposed to commit the crime which the laws mean to prevent.&quot; He further wrote, &quot;[These laws] certainly makes the situation of the assaulted worse, and of the assailants better, and rather encourages than prevents murder, as it requires less courage to attack unarmed than armed persons&quot;. Thomas Jefferson noted this passage in his &quot;Legal Commonplace Book&quot;.

As Beccaria&#x27;s ideas were critical of the legal system in place at the time, and were therefore likely to stir controversy, he chose to publish the essay anonymously, for fear of government backlash. Among his contemporary critics, was Antonio Silla, writing from Naples.

In the event, the treatise was extremely well received. Catherine the Great publicly endorsed it, while thousands of miles away in the United States, founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and John Adams quoted it. Once it was clear that the government approved of his essay, Beccaria republished it, this time crediting himself as the author.

==Later life and influence==
With much hesitation, Beccaria accepted an invitation to Paris to meet the great thinkers of the day. He travelled with the Verri brothers and was given a warm reception by the &quot;philosophes&quot;. However, the chronically-shy Beccaria made a poor impression and left after three weeks, returning to Milan and to his young wife Teresa and never venturing abroad again. The break with the Verri brothers proved lasting; they were never able to understand why Beccaria had left his position at the peak of success.

Beccaria nevertheless continued to command official recognition, and he was appointed to several nominal political positions in Italy. Separated from the invaluable input of his friends, he failed to produce another text of equal importance. Outside Italy, an unfounded myth grew that Beccaria&#x27;s literary silence resulted from Austrian restrictions on free expression in Italy. In fact, prone to periodic bouts of depression and misanthropy, he had grown silent on his own.

Legal scholars of the time hailed Beccaria&#x27;s treatise, and several European emperors were willing to follow it. Many reforms in the penal codes of the principal European nations can be traced to the treatise, but few contemporaries were convinced by Beccaria&#x27;s argument against the death penalty. Even when the Grand Duchy of Tuscany abolished the death penalty, the first nation in the world to do so, it followed Beccaria&#x27;s argument about the lack of utility of capital punishment, not about the state&#x27;s lacking the right to execute citizens. In the anglophone world, Beccaria&#x27;s ideas fed into the writings on punishment of Sir William Blackstone (selectively), and more wholeheartedly those of William Eden and Jeremy Bentham.

In November 1768, he was appointed to the chair of law and economy founded expressly for him at the Palatine College of Milan. His lectures on political economy, which are based on strict utilitarian principles, are in marked accordance with the theories of the English school of economists. They are published in the collection of Italian writers on political economy (&quot;Scrittori Classici Italiani di Economia politica&quot;, vols. xi. and xii.). Beccaria never succeeded in producing another work to match &quot;Dei Delitti e Delle Pene&quot;, but he made various incomplete attempts in the course of his life. A short treatise on literary style was all he saw to press.

In 1771, Beccaria was made a member of the supreme economic council, and in 1791 he was appointed to the board for the reform of the judicial code, where he made a valuable contribution. During this period he spearheaded a number of important reforms, such as the standardisation of weights and measurements. He died in Milan.

A pioneer in criminology, his influence during his lifetime extended to shaping the rights listed in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; served as a useful guide to the founding fathers.

Beccaria&#x27;s theories, as expressed in &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot;, have continued to play a great role in recent times. Some of the current policies impacted by his theories are truth in sentencing, swift punishment and the abolition of the death penalty in dozens of countries. While many of his theories are popular, some are still a source of heated controversy, even more than two centuries after the famed criminologist&#x27;s death.

==Family==
Beccaria&#x27;s grandson was Alessandro Manzoni, the noted Italian novelist and poet who wrote, among other things, &quot;The Betrothed&quot;, one of the first Italian historical novels, and &quot;Il cinque maggio&quot;, a poem on Napoleon&#x27;s death.

==Commemorations==
* Beccaria Township in central Pennsylvania, United States, is named for him.
* Piazza Beccaria, a large square in Florence, Italy, is also named for him.

<text>Andrzej Zbigniew Lepper (; 13 June 1954 – 5 August 2011) was a Polish politician, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture, and the leader of Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland. Known for his radical rhetoric and aggressive protests, Lepper was considered a far-left populist, compared to left-wing figures such as José Bové, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, and Juan Perón. He left a long-lasting impact on Polish politics, emerging as the &quot;defender of the oppressed and (...) all working people, the weak, and the needy.&quot; He was particularly known for his &quot;Balcerowicz must go&quot; () slogan, which he coined to protest the neoliberal Balcerowicz Plan that had deregulated and privatized the Polish economy. Lepper considered the capitalist transition &quot;economic genocide&quot;.

He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in the cabinet of Jarosław Kaczyński once from 5 May 2006 and 22 September 2006, and again from 16 October 2006 to 9 July 2007. Prior to entering politics, he was a professional farmer in the village of Zielnowo, Pomerania. Lepper entered Polish politics in 1991 as the leader of farmer protests, and founded Self-Defence as a political party and trade union in 1992. His first political office was as councillor of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship Sejmik, which he was elected to in the 1998 Polish local elections as part of the Social Alliance coalition. He was a candidate in the Polish presidential election in 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. He was also a candidate in the Polish parliamentary elections between 1991 Polish parliamentary election and 2007, becoming elected in 2001 and then in 2005.

==Early life==
Lepper was born in Stowięcino, a tiny hamlet of roughly 200 people. Formerly a thriving community, it became a place of socio-cultural impoverishment and economic struggle since Poland&#x27;s transformation into a market-based economy. During this transition period his farm, like most small businesses in Poland, found itself on the verge of bankruptcy, but survived.

A farmer by trade, Lepper completed all coursework required at the State Agricultural Technical School in Sypniewo, yet did not undertake the final qualifying exam. He also had no formal higher education, but was presented with several doctor honoris causa awards, including by the University of Kyiv (Ukraine) in recognition of his work, commitment and outreach.

Lepper was married and together with his wife Irena had three children.

==Political career==
For two years (1978–1980) he was a member of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR), Poland&#x27;s equivalent of a formal communist party during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (PRL; 1947–1989). In 1992 Lepper formed his own political party, an organisation of economically struggling farmers like himself, naming it Samoobrona (; SO).

The first time Lepper rose to a position of political leadership was in the summer 1991, when he organized and led a farmer protest movement against the disastrous economic conditions in Polish agriculture and lack of state assistance to those impoverished by the ongoing capitalist transition. Already back then, Lepper was considering proposing an alternative economic system to the capitalist one. The voivodeships of Zamość and Koszalin became important centres of mobilizations around the issue of rural poverty and over-indebtedness. In Zamość, a protest committee was founded on 10 July, while on 27 July, the first iteration of Samoobrona, the Communal Agricultural Self-Defense Committee () was founded in Lepper&#x27;s home village of Darłowo.

Rural protests quickly spread and attracted the attention and support of major rural trade unions, such as the Rural Solidarity. The regional president of Rural Solidarity in West Pomerania, Zbigniew Obrocki, coordinated protests together with the newly created movements and invited several representatives of the local protest committees in Zamość and Darłowo to join the Rural Solidarity&#x27;s strike based on occupying the Sejm building on 5 October 1991. The representatives invited by Obrocki included Lepper, as a representative of the striking farmers of Darłowo. This action was considered very successful because of how much media coverage and support it gained, and soon divisions emerged between the representatives based on the protest methods. Rural Solidarity wanted to preserve their official and civil image by keeping to peaceful protests, while the group organized against Lepper insisted on more confrontational measures. As Gazeta Wyborcza reported on 11 October:

This difference of opinion led to the formation of the National Committee for the Self-Defence of Agriculture (, KKSR), which was an informal formation with no official leadership, but came to be dominated by Lepper. Open clashes with police that took place during the protests of KKSR gained much attention and made the group considered one of the main representatives of protesting farmers. Because of this, Lepper was invited to a meeting with Leszek Balcerowicz on 24 October. Balcerowicz was the Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, whose name became synonymous with the neoliberal, monetarist and anti-social policies carried out in post-communist Poland. After a two-hours-long conversation, Lepper became convinced that the neoliberal reform pursued by Balcerowicz needed to be stopped at all costs.

As Lepper reported many years later, the idea to create a trade union and then a political movement was born after a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz. Lepper said about the meeting: &quot;Everything that happened afterwards - with me and Samoobrona - I therefore owe, to some extent, to that conversation of 10 years ago&quot;. Lepper&#x27;s disdain towards Balcerowicz became a key element of his political rhetoric - in 2002, he described Balcerowicz as &quot;the greatest pest, destroyer, traitor&quot;.

Lepper&#x27;s Farmers&#x27; Self-Defence Committee first attempted to participate in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election on 27 October. The electoral law for the Sejm and Senate in force at the time allowed committees to register in only one electoral district. His run in the elections was unsuccessful, due - as Lepper claimed - also to his lack of direct participation in the campaign. The list of the Provincial Farmers&#x27; Self-Defence Committee opened by the group&#x27;s leader received only 3247 votes in constituency number 21, covering the then Koszalin and Słupsk voivodeships.

While Lepper failed to win a seat, the fact he received over 3000 votes for his name was seen as a demonstration that he could mobilize local networks of farmers in his favor. Because of this, the Provincial Farmers&#x27; Self-Defence Committee under which Lepper organized an electoral list together with other farmers was not scrapped, but instead transformed into a trade union and then a political party. According to Lepper, as late as in the summer 1991, the farmer protest committees in Darłowo and Zamość that would form Samoobrona were not planning to become a trade union. However, the autumn hunger strike in Warsaw as well as Lepper&#x27;s electoral bid in the 1991 elections, made protesting farmers supportive of the idea.

On 6 November 1991, Lepper&#x27;s group organized a hunger strike, which came to be considered &quot;spectacular&quot;. According to Sciences Po, the Lepper&#x27;s hunger strike &quot;established a link between the visible suffering of the strikers and the cause they endorsed&quot;. In January 1992, the Trade Union of Agriculture &#x27;Samoobrona&#x27; was registered. The political party, which initially appeared under the name Self-Defence Alliance, was instead registered on 12 June 1992. Its membership - apart from representatives of ZZR &quot;Samoobrona&quot; - also included activists from the Metalworkers&#x27; Trade Union and a Green faction headed by Jan Bryczkowski.

On 14 November 1991, an agreement was concluded between the protesters and the government, which provided for a halt to the bailiff executions threatening farmers and the establishment of a special Fund and the Restructuring and Debt Relief of Agriculture. In November of the same year, an application was made to the court to register the Trade Union of Agriculture ‘Self-Defence’. The ZZR ‘Samoobrona’ - which brings together farmers and people connected with agriculture - was registered on 10 January 1992. Subsequently, on 27 and 28 March 1992, the First National Congress of the union was held in Warsaw, with representatives of the PSL, the National Union of Farmers and the then Deputy Minister of Agriculture, P. Dąbrowski, among others, attending it as invited guests. Lepper was elected president of the trade union, and a decision was taken to tighten up the forms of protest, setting up, among other things, so-called ‘anti-enforcement brigades’, which were to deal with thwarting bailiff seizures on indebted farms. Leszek Józef Walkiewicz reported that the ‘anti-enforcement brigades’ of Samoobrona saved more than 1,000 farmers from eviction.

Led by Lepper, the trade unionists consistently demanded the implementation of agreements concerning indebted farmers. They also decided to assert their interests through legal means, applying to the Constitutional Court to examine the compliance of the current banking law allowing variable interest rates on loans. In the absence of appropriate government action, a 100-strong group of trade unionists occupied the Ministry of Agriculture building on 9 April. After a few days, the protesters went on hunger strike, demanding talks with government representatives and at the same time adding to their previous demands for the resignation of Minister G. Janowski. Around one hundred and fifty ZZR Samoobrona activists broke into the Ministry of Agriculture building in Warsaw and set up camp in one of the reception rooms on the first floor. The demonstrators&#x27; demands were: implementation of the November agreements, in particular with regard to halting the seizure of the assets of over-indebted farmers, the introduction of agricultural loans at preferential rates, 12% maximum, and a meeting with the Prime Minister.

Lepper organised anti-government demonstrations and other actions, most significantly against the politics of the Suchocka and Buzek governments, both characterised by growing social and socio-economic injustice, especially experienced in the Polish countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB/JLT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepper quickly attracted the interests of the media and politicians, as well as the courts. His party gained notoriety through road blockades, protests and spilling imported grain from trains to protest against the declining prices of agricultural products. While this forced Lepper to endure several arrests and lawsuits, it also allowed him to build a reputation of a defender of the common people.

As a party leader, he challenged Aleksander Kwaśniewski in the 1995 presidential election, receiving 1.3% of the vote. In 2000, Samoobrona organised campaigns blocking major roads to bring public and mass media attention to the growing impoverishment of Polish agriculture. Lepper won 3.05% of the vote in the 2000 presidential election. In the 2001 parliamentary election, Lepper&#x27;s party entered the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament (Sejm). Lepper was elected from the Koszalin constituency.

Lepper&#x27;s party received 11.4% of the vote and 56 seats in the September 2005 parliamentary election, making it the third biggest party in the Sejm. Andrzej Lepper stood in the October 2005 presidential election as the party&#x27;s candidate and received 15% of the vote, the third-highest result.

After the SLD-PSL government collapsed, Lepper and the Samoobrona were growing increasingly supportive of the emerging Law and Justice party. The electoral collapse of the SLD, which as a fellow left-wing party was now the main competitor of Samoobrona, caused Lepper&#x27;s party to become the most popular party in Poland, according to the 2004 polls. However, the polls gradually stabilized, and by the time of the 2004 European Parliament election in Poland, Samoobrona only won the amount of support it had in 2001. 

In the 2005 Polish presidential election, Lepper finished third and won 15.1% of the popular vote in the first round, a result that impressed the media. It showed the ability of Samoobrona to win the support of a significant margin of the unemployed, farmers and low-income workers; his campaign was noted for left-wing themes that appealed to nostalgia for communist times, as Lepper&#x27;s supported often pointed to his socialist statements and biography, such as Lepper being the member of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, praising the communist secretary Edward Gierek, and recalling his 1990s protests against the government to guarantee state purchase of farm products at a high price. Lepper&#x27;s margin was attributed to a &quot;wake up call&quot; effect, as he performed the best in places with lowest turnout, mobilizing non-voters to participate in the election.

The second round was between Donald Tusk, the leader of centre-right neoliberal Civic Platform and Lech Kaczyński of Law and Justice. Lepper was initially opposed to both candidates, denouncing the election of &quot;sham democracy&quot; of oligarchic character in which &quot;Poles voted for different parties and still Balcerowicz jumped out of the ballot box&quot;. By Balcerowicz, Lepper meant that capitalist reforms would continue. However, Law and Justice framed the contest as a choice between &quot;solidaristic Poland&quot; and &quot;liberal Poland&quot;; to this end, Law and Justice started promoting state intervention in the economy and redistributive policies that were appealing to both the left-wing electorate as well as Lepper. This convinced Lepper to endorse Kaczyński, stating that it is necessary to defeat &quot;the greater evil of a liberal presidency&quot;. This belief in the necessity to prevent neoliberal parties from governing again also led Samoobrona to form the coalition with Law and Justice in 2006, which it considered economically left-leaning. In his endorsement of Kaczyński, Lepper argued that left-wing voters must vote against neoliberalism and justified his decision on the basis of Kaczyński&#x27;s declarations in support of funding social welfare, fighting unemployment and taking a tougher stance towards the European Union.

Lepper led the Samoobrona party to form a majority coalition with the Law and Justice (PiS) party in May 2006, assuming the office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture. His tenure was abruptly terminated in September 2006, but he was invited to rejoin Jarosław Kaczyński&#x27;s cabinet on 16 October 2006.

Commenting on Lepper&#x27;s political career, Polish historians Jerzy Łukowski and Hubert Zawadzki note that Lepper won the support of those who had lost out from the post-communist changes since 1989 and became known as the protector of the poor against the &quot;thieving elites&quot; of Poland. On the other hand, Lepper alienated many by his blatant disregard for parliamentary procedures, its abusive behaviour in the Sejm, and its aggressive demonstrations and blockades across the country.

==Political style and views==
Samoobrona (SRP) and Lepper successfully tapped into the disillusion felt by millions of poor citizens who had not benefited from Poland&#x27;s transition to capitalism and entry into the European Union. Lepper presented himself and his party as “the only one in Poland, which speaks in the name of all people”, and made it his goal to “defend pure and unemployed people, honest and enterprising, but disadvantaged by the economic system”. Lepper embodied the public discontent and social costs of the Balcerowicz Plan, an economic plan drafted by Jeffrey Sachs that dissolved the socialist planned economy in Poland in favor of a neoliberal market economy. This was achieved at the price of massive unemployment, layoffs and a 40% decline in real wages, as well as a large expansion of income inequality and slashed welfare. Polish political scientist Jarosław Tomasiewicz notes that Lepper showed that while internationally the Polish capitalist transformation was celebrated as successful, in reality it &quot;took place against a backdrop of repression of the workers, kidnappings and arrests of trade unionists, violent clashes with protesters or a mass exodus of desperate workers&quot;. Lepper&#x27;s popularity only grew even as the plan brought economic growth by 2000, as this growth did not trickle down to the impoverished masses.

Lepper was classified as a far-left populist, and was dubbed &quot;Polish Chávez&quot; by the international media. He has also been compared to figures such as José Bové, Evo Morales, and Juan Perón in that regard. He was known for his anti-capitalist rhetoric, and the pamphlets distributed by this party included declarations such as: &quot;Capitalism is by no means an immutable constant. It must eventually make way for new forms of human relations and a new environmental morality. The new post-capitalist era is already emerging.&quot; Lepper also called for the return of socialism in Poland, arguing that it had &quot;not yet reached full maturity&quot;. Lepper promoted socialism on the basis of Catholic social teaching and the tradition of the Polish peasant movement, and his views were described as a mix of &quot;folkish Catholicism and Polish socialism&quot; by the media.

The political rhetoric of Lepper was also full of nostalgic references to the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic, especially in regard to the rule of reformist Edward Gierek. Lepper&#x27;s main electorate became former communists as well as former employees of socialist rural cooperatives known as State Agricultural Farms. He divided the Polish society into the ‘children of Balcerowicz’ which he described as businessmen who built &#x27;capital empires&#x27; on privatization, as well as the ‘victims of Balcerowicz’ who &quot;were robbed by Balcerowicz&#x27;s financial politics&quot; and were plunged into poverty by the neoliberal shock therapy reforms. 

Lepper&#x27;s communist background was also visible in his stances regarding foreign policy - he was critical of the European Union and favoured a pro-Eastern alignment of Poland. He accused pro-European parties of trying &quot;to transform Poland into an outlet for the West&#x27;s surplus production.&quot; He was a staunch opponent of the sentiment that Polish issues could be solved by integration with the West and the European Union, which he dubbed &quot;a fashion for foreignness&quot;. Lepper argued that any arrangements with the West would be inequal for Poland and make Poland exploited as an economically inferior country; he warned that Poland would be &quot;economically erased from the map of the world.&quot; In reference to neoliberal policies such as privatization and austerity, Lepper considered them &quot;economic genocide&quot;.

Referring to his membership in the PZPR (Polish communist party), Lepper said: &quot;I have no regrets and absolutely no reason to be ashamed of being in the party&quot;. He defended Communist Poland as overall positive, noting that despite problems such as the overgrowth of the bureaucracy and anti-Catholic policies, it was a &quot;semi-sovereign state&quot; that had more achievements than faults, such as the post-war reconstruction, development of industry, infrastructure and housing, the development of education and health care, social security, as well as &quot;the social advancement of millions of formerly disinherited citizens&quot;. Lepper praised socialism as a &quot;a system which put man first&quot; and which was &quot;in line with the commandments of the Church&quot;. He also believed that the downfall of Communist Poland was caused by the anti-worker elites of the PZPR, while praising the rank-and-file members who stayed true to &quot;genuinely socialist ideals and values&quot;. Lepper and his party were considered Catholic socialist, as well as agrarian socialist.

According to Polish political scientist Andrzej Piasecki, Lepper&#x27;s anti-EU stance was not based on nationalist, anti-Western or religious beliefs, but rather on Lepper&#x27;s analysis of social class - he argued that the neoliberal and laissez-faire policies of the EU exploit the poor, and sought to defend disadvantaged social classes such as &quot;farmers, the unemployed, pensioners and all those dissatisfied with the changes in Poland after 1989 from the [European] Union&quot;. Lepper was unsatisfied with the settlement Poland reached with the EU, stating in his address to the Sejm: &quot;You have negotiated conditions that have led to the fact that today 5 million people in Poland are out of work, that 90 per cent of them are not entitled to benefits, that agricultural production has fallen by 40 per cent, and that pensioners have no money for medicine.&quot; Samoobrona also argued that the terms negotiated with the EU resulted in Poland being dominated by larger and richer countries, particularly Germany and France.

A few weeks before the referendum, Lepper declared it necessary &quot;to renegotiate the arrangements concluded in Copenhagen.&quot; Lepper and his party insisted they are not anti-European, but rather argued that the negotiated terms were unfavourable for the state and that Poland should enter the EU together with Ukraine, which for Lepper would have improved the negotiating position with Poland, and ensured that Poland would be &quot;a partner rather than a supplicant&quot; to the EU. Lepper argued that within the EU, Poland fulfills ‘the role of a third category country in the European Union. A country that is, in a semi-colonial way, a provider of young workforce and a market&quot;.

However, Lepper and his party took a neutral stance towards the 2003 Polish European Union membership referendum, adopting a slogan: &quot;European Union? The choice is yours!&quot; Samoobrona stressed that joining the EU also entails dangers and drawbacks which are either downplayed or ignored. Lepper stressed that he personally &quot;is in favour of the EU, but not under these conditions&quot;. The party treated the results of the referendum with skepticism - Lepper argued that with a much higher turnout, the No vote would have won. According to Piasecki, Lepper&#x27;s analysis was likely correct, as the domination of pro-EU views in the media and endorsement of the EU by Pope John Paul II resulted in most EU opponents not voting in the referendum.

Lepper remained a Eurosceptic, but later toned down his position. During his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Lepper worked to support Polish agriculture within European structures and on his departure was described by EU officials as pragmatic and professional. Janusz Wojciechowski, a long-standing Polish Member of the European Parliament, argued that contrary to his reputation as a vulgar populist, Lepper &quot;was a really good minister of agriculture&quot; whose conduct was professional yet tough. Wojciechowski credits Lepper with negotiating numerous concessions for Polish farmers and fruit producers from the European Union and sees this as proof that Lepper&#x27;s &quot;concern for the poor and excluded was not for show, but genuine&quot;.

Lepper was one of the few high-profile politicians who consistently opposed Poland&#x27;s involvement in American global military operations. He was involved in promoting close relations with the country&#x27;s eastern neighbours: Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.

The core of Lepper&#x27;s views was opposition to globalization, capitalism and neoliberalism, which Lepper considered epitomised by Leszek Balcerowicz. Lepper&#x27;s party stressed the primacy of man before capital, and used slogans such as &quot;Man, Family, Work - a life of dignity&quot;. It called for a kind of socialism characterized by &quot;respect for life in all its forms, recognition of the role of family, nation, moral tradition, social benevolence and solidarity&quot;. The party explicitly tied itself to the Catholic social teaching, declaring: &quot;The Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland is guided by the social teaching of the Church and fully shares the indications contained in the encyclicals of the greatest moral authority of our time, as we recognise Pope John Paul II.&quot; However, Lepper himself criticized the Catholic hierarchy for what he considered siding with the rich and passively approving of capitalism. At the same time, Lepper considered the Church a moral authority and adopted the Church&#x27;s stance on social issues such as abortion, euthanasia or death penalty. 

Some of his many infamous quotes include &quot;Capitalism is shaped to serve a small group of states&quot;, &quot;We are a radical party, open to all disadvantaged people who are starving at home&quot;, and &quot;If the law works against people and generally accepted notions of legality then it isn&#x27;t law. The only thing to do is to break it for the sake of the majority&quot;. Lepper himself appeared to be a restless man, not easily placated and not inclined to settle down as an officeholder, as his participation in Kaczyński&#x27;s government showed. With the votes of the left-wing majority in the Sejm, in 2001 he was elected as Vice-Speaker of the Sejm (&quot;Wicemarszałek Sejmu&quot;), but after violating time constraints in debates he was dismissed. Among Lepper and SO&#x27;s undertakings in parliament were such incidents as the use of their own loudspeakers in the Sejm and claims that Robert Smoktunowicz of the liberal Civic Platform (&quot;Platforma Obywatelska&quot;) engaged in the gemstone trade with the Taliban.

The Interregional Academy of Personnel Management in Kyiv, a private institution that actively promotes antisemitism awarded Lepper with two honorary doctorates and an honorary professorship. The Anti-Defamation League strongly condemned Lepper for accepting these titles.

==Criminal charges==
Lepper was charged with criminal offenses, including assault, blocking roads and dumping grain on railroad tracks in the course of anti-government demonstrations (&quot;The New York Times&quot;, 2006).

In May 2001 Lepper was sentenced to sixteen months in prison. In May 2006 Polish students protested against the coalition government and also mocked Lepper&#x27;s recent criminal conviction for slander, chanting &quot;Lepper to prison&quot;.

As of 2007 Lepper faced criminal charges for slander and levelling corruption accusations against ministers and members of parliament (Financial Times, 2002).

In December 2006, a female party member claimed that Lepper and party deputy Stanisław Łyżwiński had demanded sexual favours in exchange for a job in a regional Samoobrona party office. After the publication of these claims in the &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, several other women came forward with similar accusations. Poland&#x27;s chief prosecutor Janusz Kaczmarek later launched an investigation into the abuse allegations against both men. In February 2010 Andrzej Lepper was sentenced to two years and three months in jail after being found guilty of demanding and accepting sexual favours from female members of his Samoobrona party. The district court in central Poland also sentenced former Samoobrona party deputy Stanisław Łyżwiński to five years for rape and taking sexual advantage of female members of his party. Lepper said that the entire case against him was &quot;imagined&quot;, and that he would appeal the decision. In 2011, the court overturned the verdict against Lepper, citing procedural errors such as failure to take into account Lepper&#x27;s alibi. At the same time, Stanisław Łyżwiński&#x27;s sentence was reduced from five years to three years and six months.

==Fall and death==
On 9 July 2007, Prime Minister Kaczyński dismissed Lepper from the government, which Kaczyński said was due to suspicions that Lepper was involved in corruption. On 10 July, Lepper said that Samoobrona would withdraw from the ruling coalition, but later on the same day said that the party would remain in the coalition conditionally. Lepper claimed to have been the victim of a politically motivated sting operation, initiated by Kaczynski and PiS, and he demanded that a parliamentary inquiry be conducted to investigate the legality and motivation of the Central Anticorruption Bureau operation mounted against him. This was one of the conditions put to PiS in return for Samoobrona remaining within the coalition.

On 16 July 2007, Lepper, together with Roman Giertych, chairman of another junior coalition partner League of Polish Families, announced a merger of their parties, to be called League and Self-Defense (LiS). On August 5, the party quit the ruling coalition, leaving it without a majority.

Early parliamentary elections for both houses of parliament (Sejm and Senat) were held on 21 October 2007, after the Sejm voted for its own dissolution on 7 September. The party suffered huge voter backlash, and failed to cross the 5% electoral threshold for Sejm representation. Consequently, it lost all its seats. Lepper was a candidate in the 2010 Polish presidential election, but received just 1.28% of the votes and so did not proceed to the second round.

Lepper was found dead in his Warsaw office on 5 August 2011. Police said that he likely committed suicide. The public prosecutor&#x27;s office conducted a year-long investigation to determine possible motives for his suicide. Lepper hanged himself from a ceiling hook for a punching bag. After his autopsy, foul play was ruled out, and the investigation ended in late 2012. It was determined that Lepper suffered from crushing depression due to his enormous debts on all fronts including at his farm, his political defeat and sex scandals.

<text>André Morellet (7 March 172712 January 1819) was a French economist, author of various writings, contributor to the and one of the last Enlightenment Age .

== Biography ==
Born at Lyon, and educated by the Jesuits there, Morellet completed his theology degree in 1752 at the Sorbonne and quickly became recognized thereafter in Parisian literary circles for his views on religious tolerance, inoculation, penal reform, liberty of the press and freedom of commerce. Morellet&#x27;s early instruction by the Jesuits and his eventual clerical designation as abbé undoubtedly influenced his earliest writings in which the then 28-year-old licentiate in theology completed at least six articles, noted for their scope and length, to Volumes 6 and 7 of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. A fiercely independent thinker once led Voltaire to refer to Morellet as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Father Bite-them&quot;) because of his sharp wit. He was a noted friend of Benjamin Franklin.

By 1754, Morellet had gradually terminated his official association with the and instead redirected his attention to the French political economy. He sought to greater effect societal reforms through new writings, particularly on freedom of commerce, in which one paper stressed the importance of the textile industry (). He never abandoned the spirit of the though; in the spring of 1760, Morellet wrote in defense of the who were attacked by the Le Franc de Pompignan and Charles Palissot, publishing , , and the (the last procured Morellet a short stay in the Bastille for an alleged libel on the patroness of Palissot&#x27;s.

Not all of Morellet&#x27;s writings were well received. In 1765, he produced a French translation of &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot;. His translation was widely criticized for the liberties he took with the text. Morellet had the opinion that the Italian text of Beccaria did require some clarification. He therefore left some parts out, and sometimes added others. But he mainly changed the structure of the essay by moving, merging or splitting chapters. These interventions were known to experts, but because Beccaria himself had indicated in a letter to Morellet that he fully agreed with him, it was assumed that these adaptations also had Beccaria&#x27;s consent in substance. The differences are so great, however, that the book from the hands of Morellet became quite another book than the book that Beccaria wrote.

In his later active years, Morellet was involved in quasi-diplomatic communications with English statesmen, and was elected a member of the Académie française in 1785. In 1786, he completed the translation of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s only published book, &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (published in 1787 as &quot;Observations sur la Virginie&quot;). His firm conviction for the improvement of society never wavered; he continued to write even as outspoken critics of the French Revolution were executed publicly by the guillotine. The success of Morellet&#x27;s pamphlet titled (1794), which called for the restoration of the property to families of the executed, revived his philosophical optimism and led to his next work on behalf of the dispossessed parents and grandparents of political émigrés (, 1795).

In his last year, he brought out four volumes of , composed chiefly of selections from his former publications, and after his death appeared his (2 vols., 1821). At the time of his death, the ninety-one year-old had amassed a personal library of 4,736 titles, which sold at auction for 22,169 francs.

<text>Longevity may refer to especially long-lived members of a population, whereas &quot;life expectancy&quot; is defined statistically as the average number of years remaining at a given age. For example, a population&#x27;s life expectancy at birth is the same as the average age at death for all people born in the same year (in the case of cohorts).

Longevity studies may involve putative methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels. The legendary fountain of youth appeared in the work of the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus.

There are difficulties in authenticating the longest human life span, owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics. Fiction, legend, and folklore have proposed or claimed life spans in the past or future vastly longer than those verified by modern standards, and longevity narratives and unverified longevity claims frequently speak of their existence in the present.

A life annuity is a form of longevity insurance.

== Life expectancy, as of 2010 ==

Various factors contribute to an individual&#x27;s longevity. Significant factors in life expectancy include gender, genetics, access to health care, hygiene, diet and nutrition, exercise, lifestyle, and crime rates. Below is a list of life expectancies in different types of countries:
*Developed countries: 77–90 years (e.g. Canada: 81.29 years, 2010 est.)
*Developing countries: 32–80 years (e.g. Mozambique: 41.37 years, 2010 est.)

Population longevities are increasing as life expectancies around the world grow:
*Australia: 80 years in 2002, 81.72 years in 2010
*France: 79.05 years in 2002, 81.09 years in 2010
*Germany: 77.78 years in 2002, 79.41 years in 2010
*Italy: 79.25 years in 2002, 80.33 years in 2010
*Japan: 81.56 years in 2002, 82.84 years in 2010
*Monaco: 79.12 years in 2002, 79.73 years in 2011
*Spain: 79.06 years in 2002, 81.07 years in 2010
*United Kingdom: 80 years in 2002, 81.73 years in 2010
*United States: 77.4 years in 2002, 78.24 years in 2010

==Long-lived individuals==

The Gerontology Research Group validates current longevity records by modern standards, and maintains a list of supercentenarians; many other unvalidated longevity claims exist. Record-holding individuals include:

* Eilif Philipsen (21 July 1682 – 20 June 1785, 102 years, 333 days): first person to reach the age of 100 (on 21 July 1782) and whose age could be validated.
*Geert Adriaans Boomgaard (1788–1899, 110 years, 135 days): first person to reach the age of 110 (on September 21, 1898) and whose age could be validated.
*Margaret Ann Neve, (18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903, 110 years, 346 days) the first validated female supercentenarian (on 18 May 1902).
*Jeanne Calment (1875–1997, 122 years, 164 days): the oldest person in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation. This defines the modern human life span, which is set by the oldest documented individual who ever lived.
*Sarah Knauss (1880–1999, 119 years, 97 days): the third oldest documented person in modern times and the oldest American.
*Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013, 116 years, 54 days): the oldest man in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation.
*Kane Tanaka (1903–2022, 119 years, 107 days): the second oldest documented person in modern times and the oldest Japanese.

==Major factors==
Evidence-based studies indicate that longevity is based on two major factors: genetics and lifestyle.

===Genetics===

Twin studies have estimated that approximately 20-30% of the variation in human lifespan can be related to genetics, with the rest due to individual behaviors and environmental factors which can be modified. Although over 200 gene variants have been associated with longevity according to a US-Belgian-UK research database of human genetic variants these explain only a small fraction of the heritability.

Lymphoblastoid cell lines established from blood samples of centenarians have significantly higher activity of the DNA repair protein PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase) than cell lines from younger (20 to 70 year old) individuals. The lymphocytic cells of centenarians have characteristics typical of cells from young people, both in their capability of priming the mechanism of repair after sublethal oxidative DNA damage and in their PARP gene expression. These findings suggest that elevated PARP gene expression contributes to the longevity of centenarians, consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.
In July 2020, scientists used public biological data on 1.75 m people with known lifespans overall and identified 10 genomic loci which appear to intrinsically influence healthspan, lifespan, and longevity – of which half have not been reported previously at genome-wide significance and most being associated with cardiovascular disease – and identified haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. Their study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.

=== Lifestyle ===
Longevity is a highly plastic trait, and traits that influence its components respond to physical (static) environments and to wide-ranging life-style changes: physical exercise, dietary habits, living conditions, and pharmaceutical as well as nutritional interventions. A 2012 study found that even modest amounts of leisure time physical exercise can extend life expectancy by as much as 4.5 years. 

==== Diet ====
As of 2021, there is no clinical evidence that any dietary practice contributes to human longevity. Although health can be influenced by diet, including the type of foods consumed, the amount of calories ingested, and the duration and frequency of fasting periods, there is no good clinical evidence that fasting promotes longevity in humans, .

Calorie restriction is a widely researched intervention to assess effects on aging, defined as a sustained reduction in dietary energy intake compared to the energy required for weight maintenance. To ensure metabolic homeostasis, the diet during calorie restriction must provide sufficient energy, micronutrients, and fiber. Some studies on rhesus monkeys showed that restricting calorie intake resulted in lifespan extension, while other animals studies did not detect a significant change. According to preliminary research in humans, there is little evidence that calorie restriction affects lifespan. There is a link between diet and obesity and consequent obesity-associated morbidity.

=== Biological pathways ===
Four well-studied biological pathways that are known to regulate aging, and whose modulation has been shown to influence longevity are Insulin/IGF-1, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activating protein kinase (AMPK), and Sirtuin pathways.

==Change over time==
In preindustrial times, deaths at young and middle age were more common than they are today. This is not due to genetics, but because of environmental factors such as disease, accidents, and malnutrition, especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th-century medicine. Deaths from childbirth were common for women, and many children did not live past infancy. In addition, most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. Despite this, there are several examples of pre-20th-century individuals attaining lifespans of 85 years or greater, including John Adams, Cato the Elder, Thomas Hobbes, Christopher Polhem, and Michelangelo. This was also true for poorer people like peasants or laborers. Genealogists will almost certainly find ancestors living to their 70s, 80s and even 90s several hundred years ago.

For example, an 1871 census in the UK (the first of its kind, but personal data from other censuses dates back to 1841 and numerical data back to 1801) found the average male life expectancy as being 44, but if infant mortality is subtracted, males who lived to adulthood averaged 75 years. The present life expectancy in the UK is 77 years for males and 81 for females, while the United States averages 74 for males and 80 for females.

Studies have shown that black American males have the shortest lifespans of any group of people in the US, averaging only 69 years (Asian-American females average the longest). This reflects overall poorer health and greater prevalence of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer among black American men.

Women normally outlive men. Theories for this include smaller bodies that place lesser strain on the heart (women have lower rates of cardiovascular disease) and a reduced tendency to engage in physically dangerous activities. Conversely, women are more likely to participate in health-promoting activities. The X chromosome also contains more genes related to the immune system, and women tend to mount a stronger immune response to pathogens than men. However, the idea that men have weaker immune systems due to the supposed immuno-suppressive actions of testosterone is unfounded.

There is debate as to whether the pursuit of longevity is a worthwhile health care goal. Bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is also one of the architects of ObamaCare, has argued that the pursuit of longevity via the compression of morbidity explanation is a &quot;fantasy&quot; and that longevity past age 75 should not be considered an end in itself. This has been challenged by neurosurgeon Miguel Faria, who states that life can be worthwhile in healthy old age, that the compression of morbidity is a real phenomenon, and that longevity should be pursued in association with quality of life. Faria has discussed how longevity in association with leading healthy lifestyles can lead to the postponement of senescence as well as happiness and wisdom in old age.

== Naturally limited longevity==
Most biological organisms have a naturally limited longevity due to aging, unlike a rare few that are considered biologically immortal.

Given that different species of animals and plants have different potentials for longevity, the disrepair accumulation theory of aging tries to explain how the potential for longevity of an organism is sometimes positively correlated to its structural complexity. It suggests that while biological complexity increases individual lifespan, it is counteracted in nature since the survivability of the overall species may be hindered when it results in a prolonged development process, which is an evolutionarily vulnerable state.

According to the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, one of the reasons biological immortality is so rare is that certain categories of gene expression that are beneficial in youth become deleterious at an older age.

==Myths and claims==

Longevity myths are traditions about long-lived people (generally supercentenarians), either as individuals or groups of people, and practices that have been believed to confer longevity, but for which scientific evidence does not support the ages claimed or the reasons for the claims. A comparison and contrast of &quot;longevity in antiquity&quot; (such as the Sumerian King List, the genealogies of Genesis, and the Persian Shahnameh) with &quot;longevity in historical times&quot; (common-era cases through twentieth-century news reports) is elaborated in detail in Lucian Boia&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Forever Young: A Cultural History of Longevity from Antiquity to the Present&quot; and other sources.

After the death of Juan Ponce de León, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés wrote in &quot;Historia General y Natural de las Indias&quot; (1535) that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to cure his aging. Traditions that have been believed to confer greater human longevity also include alchemy, such as that attributed to Nicolas Flamel. In the modern era, the Okinawa diet has some reputation of linkage to exceptionally high ages.

Longevity claims may be subcategorized into four groups: &quot;In late life, very old people often tend to advance their ages at the rate of about 17 years per decade ... Several celebrated super-centenarians (over 110 years) are believed to have been double lives (father and son, relations with the same names or successive bearers of a title) ... A number of instances have been commercially sponsored, while a fourth category of recent claims are those made for political ends ...&quot; The estimate of 17 years per decade was corroborated by the 1901 and 1911 British censuses. &quot;Time&quot; magazine considered that, by the Soviet Union, longevity had been elevated to a state-supported &quot;Methuselah cult&quot;.

Robert Ripley regularly reported supercentenarian claims in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, usually citing his own reputation as a fact-checker to claim reliability.

==Non-human biological longevity==
Longevity in other animals can shed light on the determinants of life expectancy in humans, especially when found in related mammals. However, important contributions to longevity research have been made by research in other species, ranging from yeast to flies to worms. In fact, some closely related species of vertebrates can have dramatically different life expectancies, demonstrating that relatively small genetic changes can have a dramatic impact on aging. For instance, Pacific Ocean rockfishes have widely varying lifespans. The species &quot;Sebastes minor&quot; lives a mere 11 years while its cousin &quot;Sebastes aleutianus&quot; can live for more than 2 centuries. Similarly, a chameleon, &quot;Furcifer labordi&quot;, is the current record holder for &quot;shortest&quot; lifespan among tetrapods, with only 4–5 months to live. By contrast, some of its relatives, such as &quot;Furcifer pardalis&quot;, have been found to live up to 6 years.

There are studies about aging-related characteristics of and aging in long-lived animals like various turtles and plants like &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; trees. They have identified potentially causal protective traits and suggest many of the species have &quot;slow or [times of] negligible senescence&quot; (or aging).&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1126/science.abm0151&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1126/science.abl7811&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The jellyfish &quot;T. dohrnii&quot; is biologically immortal and has been studied by comparative genomics.

Honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) are eusocial insects that display dramatic caste-specific differences in longevity. Queen bees live for an average of 1-2 years, compared to workers who live on average 15-38 days in summer and 150-200 days in winter. Worker honey bees with high amounts of flight experience exhibit increased DNA damage in flight muscle, as measured by elevated 8-Oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine, compared to bees with less flight experience. This increased DNA damage is likely due to an imbalance of pro- and anti-oxidants during flight-associated oxidative stress. Flight induced oxidative DNA damage appears to hasten senescence and reduce longevity in &quot;A. mellifera&quot;. 

=== Examples of long-lived plants and animals ===
==== Currently living====
*Methuselah: over 4,850-year-old bristlecone pine in the White Mountains of California, the oldest currently living non-clonal tree.

==== Dead ====
* WPN-114, &quot;Prometheus&quot;: approximately 4,900 year-old (at time of tree-death) &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;, located in Wheeler Peak, Nevada.
* The quahog clam (&quot;Arctica islandica&quot;) is exceptionally long-lived, with a maximum recorded age of 507 years, the longest of any animal. Other clams of the species have been recorded as living up to 374 years.
*&quot;Lamellibrachia luymesi&quot;, a deep-sea cold-seep tubeworm, is estimated to reach ages of over 250 years based on a model of its growth rates.
*A bowhead whale killed in a hunt was found to be approximately 211 years old (possibly up to 245 years old), the longest-lived mammal known.
* Possibly 250-million year-old bacteria, &quot;Bacillus permians&quot;, were revived from stasis after being found in sodium chloride crystals in a cavern in New Mexico.

=== Artificial animal longevity extension ===
Gene editing via CRISPR-Cas9 and other methods have significantly altered lifespans in animals.

<text>Leipzig is one of the three former Direktionsbezirke of Saxony, Germany, located in the north-west of the state. It coincided with the &quot;Planungsregion&quot; Westsachsen. It was disbanded in March 2012.

==History==
The Direktionsbezirk Leipzig came into existence on 1 August 2008 and succeeded the Regierungsbezirk Leipzig. The territory of &quot;Regierungsbezirk Leipzig&quot; was slightly larger, and included the former district of Döbeln. With the exception of the districts Altenburg and Schmölln, the territory of the Regierungsbezirk corresponded to that of the former Bezirk Leipzig which existed from 1952 to 1990.

A &quot;Regierungsbezirk Leipzig&quot; existed already from 1939 to 1943, when the former &quot;Kreishauptmannschaften&quot; in Saxony were renamed following the custom in Prussia.

<doc id="196209" wikidata="Q691615" url="?curid=196209" title="Governor of the Virgin Islands">
<text>The governor of the Virgin Islands is the representative of the British monarch in the United Kingdom&#x27;s overseas territory of the British Virgin Islands. The governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British government. The role of the governor is to act as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state, and is responsible for appointing the premier and the executive council.

The current governor is Daniel Pruce.

The governor has a viceregal flag, the Union Flag defaced with the territory&#x27;s coat of arms. The official residence of the governor is Government House located in Road Town, Tortola.

==History==

The first colonial administration on the islands was the Dutch. England annexed the Islands in 1672. An administrator was appointed to the islands from 1887, and replaced by a governor in 1971 when the islands were created a distinct territory.

Prior to this date, the local council would elect one of their members to be president (see List of presidents of the British Virgin Islands).

Up until 1971, the administrators were answerable to the governors of the Leeward Islands, of which the British Virgin Islands formed a part.

==Powers==

The governor is responsible for the conduct of any business of the Government of the Virgin Islands, including the administration of any department of government, with respect to the following matters:
# External affairs;
# Defence, including the armed forces;
# Internal security, including the Police Force;
# The terms and conditions of service of persons holding or acting in public offices, without prejudice to section 92; and
# The administration of the courts.

The governor also has various powers to make and remove appointments, and a power of pardon.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Governor is required to consult with the Cabinet in the exercise of all functions conferred by the Constitution of the British Virgin Islands or any other law for the time being in force in the British Virgin Islands.

Born in Chieti, he was carefully educated by his uncle, Monsignor Celestino Galiani, in Naples and Rome with a view to entering the church. Galiani showed early promise as an economist, and even more as a wit. By the age of twenty-two, after he took orders, he had produced two works by which his name became widely known far beyond the bounds of Naples. The first, &quot;Della Moneta&quot;, a disquisition on coinage in which he shows himself a strong supporter of mercantilism, deals with many aspects of the question of exchange, but always with a special reference to the state of confusion then presented by the monetary system of the Neapolitan government.

The other, &quot;Raccolta in Morte del Boia&quot;, established his fame as a humorist, and was highly popular in Italian literary circles at the end of the 18th century. In this volume Galiani parodied, in a series of discourses on the death of the public hangman, the styles of Neapolitan writers of the day. Galiani&#x27;s political knowledge and social qualities brought him to the attention of King Charles of Naples and Sicily (afterwards Charles III of Spain) and his liberal minister Bernardo Tanucci, and in 1759 Galiani was appointed secretary to the Neapolitan embassy in Paris. He held this post for ten years, when he returned to Naples and was made a councillor of the tribunal of commerce, and in 1777 administrator of the royal domains.

Galiani&#x27;s published works focus on the area of humanities as well as social sciences. He left a large number of letters which are not only of biographical interest but are also important for the light they cast on the social, economic, and political characteristics of eighteenth-century Europe. His economic reputation was mainly due to his book written in French and published 1769 in Paris, namely, his &quot;Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds&quot;, &quot;Dialogues on the commerce in wheat&quot;. This work, by its light and pleasing style, and its vivacious wit, delighted Voltaire, who described it as a cross between Plato and Molière. The author, says Giuseppe Pecchio, treated his arid subject as Fontenelle did the vortices of Descartes, or Algarotti the Newtonian system of the world. The question at issue was that of the freedom of the corn trade, then much agitated, and, in particular, the policy of the royal edict of 1764, which permitted the exportation of grain so long as the price had not reached a certain level. The general principle he maintains is that the best system in regard to this trade is to have no system — countries in different circumstances requiring, according to him, different modes of treatment. Similarly to Voltaire and even Pietro Verri, he held that one country cannot gain without another losing, and in his earlier treatise defended the action of governments in debasing the currency. Until his death in Naples, Galiani kept up a correspondence with his old Parisian friends, notably Louise d&#x27;Épinay; this was published in 1818.

See &quot;L&#x27;abate Galiani&quot;, by Alberto Marghieri (1878), and his correspondence with Tanucci in Giampietro Vieusseux&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Archivio storico&quot; (Florence, 1878).

==Published works==
===&quot;Della moneta&quot;===

In 1751, while still a student, Galiani wrote a book entitled &quot;Della moneta&quot; which intervened in the Neapolitan debate on economic reform. In this book, he discussed financial politics and gave opinions on how to develop the Neapolitan economy. At the same time, he proposed a theory of value based on utility and scarcity; this depth of thinking on economic value would not be seen again until discussions of marginal utility developed in the 1870s. In addition, Galiani&#x27;s tract exhibited conventional Mercantilist ideas and some of his recommendations were adopted by the Neapolitan government.

Chapter 1 of Book I introduces the history of money as well as the rise and fall of states in antiquity and modern times. By using historical examples, Galiani illustrated his idea that commerce was neglected by political rulers throughout the whole history of humankind. States could become rich and grew through the conquest; however, they could not enhance their power, territory and wealth without commerce.

In the core chapter of the book, Galiani explained that the value of money at any point in time derived from principles that were part of human nature itself; money was definitely not a human invention by which people deliberately changed the societies they lived in. Money generated naturally from the gradual modification of people&#x27;s loves into social ideas of value that inspired commercial interaction. Money exists without relying on promises, trust, or another moral capacity of self-restraint and money is not created by an agreement. If this situation was changed, commerce could not be the centre of modern societies.

In &quot;Della moneta&quot;, Galiani constantly described the effects of human actions in terms of providential rewards and punishments. He used the term &quot;providence&quot; to reconcile the historical dynamic of commercial progress with a set of fixed moral rules that lay at the core of successful human interaction. Galiani presented any moralistic dismissals of natural price formation and self-interested profit-seeking as reproaches to the way God intended human societies to function. Providential mechanisms were also involved in the history of money, the rise and fall of states in both antiquity and modernity and regulated the development of cultural characteristics of the dominant societies in the course of time. Throughout history man constantly reshaped the fictional moral beliefs, thereby creating the mental preconditions for commercial society.

===&quot;Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds&quot;===
During the period of being a diplomat in Paris, Galiani wrote &quot;Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds&quot;, which emphasized the importance for the regulation of commerce — an argument that opposed the physiocrats, who advocated complete freedom. This book was published in 1770 and Galiani indicated in this book that there are increasing returns to manufacturing, and diminishing returns to agriculture and the wealth of a nation depends on manufacturing and trade. Although approving of the edict of 1764 liberalizing the grain trade, Galiani rejected much of the physiocratic analysis, notably its &quot;land theory of value&quot;. His 1770 piece also provided a quite modern analysis of the balance of payments.

In the Dialogues, Galiani described that wheat can be seen in two different aspects. The distinctions between two different aspects are important: as a product of the earth, wheat can be considered both commerce and economic legislation. As a product of first necessity, wheat is a symbol of social order and belongs to administration. As Galiani put it in an illuminating way, ‘As soon as supplying [wheat] is the concern of administration, it is no longer an object of commerce’. Correspondingly, ‘It is certain that what is sensible and useful from one standpoint, becomes absurd and harmful from another’.

Galiani believed that there are many shocks to the economy, which can cause disequilibrium and it takes long time for the restoration of equilibrium. He thought that something instead of the natural law needed to face the challenge and shocks. Administration dealt with the ‘sudden movements’ of the economy, such as shortages in the wheat supply. In other words, the legislator could not but consider the down-to-earth constraints of subsistence. In this respect, the physiocratic enlightened despot consistently and independently ruling economic matters according to natural laws was not enough to maintain social order.

==Attitude to physiocrats==
Galiani not only had theoretical brilliance with his idea of &quot;natural&quot; laws in economics, but also was a practical man, skeptical about the reach of abstract theory, particularly when action was necessary and urgent. He was repelled by the wide-eyed policies called for by the physiocrats, which he believed were unrealistic, impractical and, in times of crisis, downright dangerous.

Galiani disagreed with the physiocratic argument which said that in order to provide a sufficient supply of grain, it suffices to establish a completely free trade. In fact, the foreign trade agreed with the physiocrats that internal free trade can benefit the economy. However, Galiani used the case of exportation to challenge the physiocrats. At one point in the Dialogues, he even stated: ‘Here I am not talking about the internal liberty of trade… Let us talk foreign trade’ (Galiani 1770, 224-5). Whereas the physiocrats advocated total liberty both domestically and internationally, Galiani believed internal liberty was the first priority. Even though he was not totally opposed to grain exportation, Galiani often condemned the physiocratic liberty to export grain. Precisely, he argued that the foreign trade can threaten domestic liberty, for the frontier provinces of the kingdom may find foreign markets more attractive than domestic ones. Therefore, as long as there is no certainty as to the existence of a permanent surplus, Galiani claimed, the nation must concentrate its efforts on the internal circulation of grain.

For him, the physiocrats were a dangerous group of impractical men with wrong ideas. In 1768, as France collapsed in a near-famine, the physiocrats still called for &quot;non-action&quot;, muttering on their ordre naturel and the glorious wisdom of Quesnay, which galvanized of making their own remarkable contributions in opposition.

<text>Vayalar Ramavarma (25 March 1928 – 27 October 1975), also known as Vayalar, was an Indian poet and lyricist of Malayalam language. He was known for his poems which include &quot;Sargasangeetham&quot;, &quot;Mulankaadu&quot;, &quot;Padamudrakal&quot;, &quot;Aayisha&quot; and &quot;Oru Judas janikkunnu&quot; and for around 1,300 songs he penned for 256 Malayalam films. He received the National Film Award for Best Lyrics in 1972 and was the winner of the Kerala State Film Award for Best Lyricist in its year of inception which he received three more times. He was also a recipient of the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Poetry in 1962. His collaborations with G. Devarajan produced the golden era of Malayalam film music and many songs written and composed by these duo remain the ever green classics in Malayalam. Ramavarma is regarded as one of the most successful and critically acclaimed lyricist in the history of Malayalam cinema.

==Biography==

Ramavarma was born on 25 March 1928, at Vayalar, a small village in Alappuzha district of the south Indian state of Kerala to Vellarappilli Kerala Varma and Raghavaparambil Ambalika Thamburatti. He lost his father at an early age and his education in the traditional gurukula way, was supervised by his uncle, which was followed by formal education at the Sanskrit School as well as Cherthala English School. He started writing poetry while in school, publishing the first poem in &quot;Swarat&quot; magazine, which he continued after discontinuing education after 9th standard and published poems in periodicals such as &quot;Arunodayam&quot; and &quot;Chakravalam&quot;. He started a weekly in 1951, under the name, &quot;Janadhipathyam&quot;, but the weekly, which published articles promoting communist ideals, did not last long. Subsequently, he served as the editor of a publication from Madras.

Ramavarma married Puthekovilakathu Chandramathi Thamburatti in 1951 but the couple were issueless. Subsequently, he married Bharathi Thamburatti, the younger sister of Chandramathi Thamburatti, and the couple had a son, Vayalar Sarath Chandra Varma, a noted poet and lyricist, and three daughters, Indulekha, Yamuna and Sindhu. His death came on 27 October 1975, at the age of 47, following a surgery at the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram where he had been admitted for the treatment of Cirrhosis. Later revelations by poet, Ezhacherry Ramachandran, that the actual cause of death was medical negligence, created a controversy, but Ramachandran later refused to stand by his earlier statement. The memoirs of his wife, Bharathi Thamburatti, titled &quot;Indradanussinte Theerathu&quot;, also became controversial due to certain remarks made in the book about K. J. Yesudas.

== Legacy ==
=== As a poet ===
Ramavarma&#x27;s first poetry anthology was &quot;Padamudrakal&quot;, in 1948 which reflected his affinity towards Gandhian ideals in those days. Later he changed his thought towards communism and keep close contact with the communist party of India. There are notable literature works against cast and communal systems in Kerala even though he is from an upper caste family. But he had a good affinity towards Indian culture which is reflected in the poem Sargga Sangeetham. Between 1950 and 1961, he published a number of anthologies including &quot;Konthayum Poonoolum&quot; (1950), &quot;Naadinte Nadam&quot;, &quot;Enikku Maramamilla&quot;, &quot;Mulankadu&quot; (1955), &quot;Oru Judas Janikkunnu&quot; (1955), &quot;Ente Mattolikavithakal&quot; (1957), and &quot;Sargasangeetham&quot; (1961), a khandakavyam titled &quot;Ayisha&quot;, two short story anthologies, &quot;Raktham Kalarnna Mannu&quot; and &quot;Vettum Thiruthum&quot; as well as a travelogue by name, &quot;Purushantharangaliloode&quot;, which detailed his experiences during his first trip to Delhi in 1956 to participate in the Asian Writers&#x27; Conference. With the popularity of his poems, he was known to have brought poetry to the common man&#x27;s domain.

=== As a lyricist ===

Ramavarma shifted his base to Madras to take up the editorship of a magazine and this move to the city helped him to get associated with Malayalam film industry which was based there during those days. In 1956, he got the opportunity to write the lyrics for Koodappirappu, a J. D. Thottan film, for which 10 songs composed by K. Raghavan were written by him. Overall, he wrote over 1300 songs for 245 Malayalam movies, 135 songs for 29 music albums and for several plays, of which 755 songs were composed by G. Devarajan. One among the three major lyricists of his times, P. Bhaskaran and O. N. V. Kurup completing the trio, Rama Varma&#x27;s lyrics were known to have brought the Malayalam film songs closer to poetry.

== Awards and honours ==
Ramavarma received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Poetry in 1962 for his poetry anthology, &quot;Sargasangeetham&quot;. Kerala State Chalachitra Academy selected his songs for the films, Nadhi and Kadalpalam for the inaugural Kerala State Film Award for Best Lyricist in 1969; he would receive the award three more times, in 1972 for Chemparathy, in 1974 for Nellu and Athidhi and in 1975 for Chuvanna Sandhyakal and Swami Ayyappan. In between, he received the National Film Award for Best Lyrics for the song, &quot;Manushyan mathangale srushtichu&quot; in the film, Achanum Bappayum in 1972.

An annual literary award, Vayalar Award, has been instituted in his memory by Vayalar Rama Varma Memorial Trust. The award is given on 27 October, the poet&#x27;s death anniversary and the recipients include Lalithambika Antharjanam, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Sugathakumari, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, Ayyappa Paniker and K. Satchidanandan. The trust has constructed a memorial for Ramavarma at his residence in Vayalar, which houses a literary museum, library, office, auditorium, martyr square and conference room. Vayalar Ramavarma Samskarika Vedi, another Thiruvananthapuram-based eponymous organization, has instituted an annual award, &quot;Vayalar Ramavarma award&quot;, to recognize excellence in television programmes. The organization has instituted two more awards, &quot;Vayalar Ramavarma Sangeetha Puraskaram&quot; and &quot;Vayalar Ramavarma Natya Ratna Puraskaram&quot;, music and dance awards respectively, in honour of the poet. The Government of Kerala installed a bust of Rama Varma at Manaveeyam Veedhi, the road between Althara junction to the Museum-Vellayambalam road in Thiruvananthapuram, on 24 November 2005.

<text>Jean François de Saint-Lambert (; 26 December 1716 – 9 February 1803) was a French poet, philosopher and military officer.

==Biography==
Saint-Lambert was born at Nancy and raised on his parents&#x27; estate at Affracourt, a village in Lorraine near Haroué, a seat of the Beauvau family, with whom he had close ties. He studied at the university at Pont-à-Mousson, but then spent several years at home recovering from an unidentified illness. He often complained of poor health, but participated in military campaigns, led a strenuous social life, and lived to be 86 years old.

Saint-Lambert began writing poetry in his adolescence and belonged to Françoise de Graffigny&#x27;s social circle in Lunéville. By October 1733 he had already begun work on &quot;The Seasons&quot;, his major poetical work, which did not appear in print until 1769 (see 1769 in poetry). All his life, he read his works in salons and to his friends, but did not rush to publish them.

In 1739, Saint-Lambert joined the Heudicourt regiment in the Lorraine Guards, in which his boyhood friend, Charles-Just, prince de Beauvau-Craon, was already a colonel, despite being only 19 years old. For much of the 1740s the two men fought side by side in the Italian campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession.

Saint-Lambert spent the winter quarter in Lunéville in 1745–46, and according to François-Antoine Devaux, he became at that time the lover of the Marquise de Boufflers. She was a sister of the prince de Beauvau, and the mistress of Stanislaus Leszczynski, who had been established in 1737 as duke of Lorraine.

Over the winter of 1747–48, Voltaire and his entourage took up residence in Lunéville. Saint-Lambert soon began a liaison with the great writer&#x27;s mistress, Émilie du Châtelet. She was in her forties, and had had many lovers, but succumbed to a mad passion for Saint-Lambert and became pregnant with his child. The baby, a girl named Stanislas-Adélaïde Du Châtelet, was born on 4 September 1749 in what at first seemed an easy delivery; but Émilie contracted a fever and died on 10 September. The infant died in Lunéville on 6 May 1751.

Émilie was a brilliant and learned woman, known all over Europe for her translation of Newton. Her love affair and pregnancy created scandal and inspired satirical mirth; her death was a shock to everyone. Voltaire was shattered, and according to his friend Devaux, so was Saint-Lambert, who nonetheless moved to Paris around 1750 and to all appearances soon recovered from his grief.

It was at this time that he gave himself the title Marquis de Saint-Lambert, to which he had no right; it was once claimed that he was not even of noble birth, but the evidence refuting that charge was published long ago.

In 1752 he began the second of his two famous love affairs, with Sophie d&#x27;Houdetot. This relationship became noteworthy because in 1757, while Saint-Lambert was away on military duty in the Seven Years&#x27; War, Jean-Jacques Rousseau suddenly conceived a mad passion for Sophie, which he wrote about in his &quot;Confessions&quot;. In Rousseau&#x27;s mind, she became identified with a character in the great novel he was then writing, &quot;Julie, ou la Nouvelle Héloïse&quot;. In the end, Sophie turned Rousseau away, saying that she loved Saint-Lambert. She and Saint-Lambert remained together as a couple until his death in 1803, spending their last years in a cordial &quot;ménage à trois&quot; with her husband.

Saint-Lambert resigned from the army in 1758 and devoted the rest of his life to literature. He wrote several articles for Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, published an essay on &quot;Luxury&quot; in 1764, brought out an edition of &quot;The Seasons&quot; with a selection of his other poetry and some short stories in 1769, and completed a multi-volume philosophical work in 1797–98, called &quot;Principe des mœurs chez toutes les nations ou Catéchisme universel&quot; (Principle of morals among all nations, or universal catechism). He wrote the section on &quot;Siam&quot;, and most likely also other parts of the first edition of Guillaume Thomas François Raynals &quot;L&#x27;Histoire philosophique et politique des établissements et du commerce des Européens dans les deux Indes&quot;. He was elected to the Académie française in 1770.

He and Sophie outlived most of their contemporaries, however, and around 1800 members of a new generation wrote about them as relics of a legendary past. Count Louis-Mathieu Molé described the fabled lover as &quot;a little old man dressed in a hideous cotton dressing gown with a pattern of blue stripes and red bouquets, a wispy cotton bonnet on his head, using a cane walking stick with a gold knob as tall as he was to support his wobbly steps.&quot; Chateaubriand used the couple as symbols of a discredited era, when he wrote that they &quot;both represented the opinions and the freedoms of a by-gone age, carefully stuffed and preserved: it was the eighteenth century expired and married in its manner. It was sufficient to remain steadfast in one&#x27;s life for illegitimacies to become legitimacies.&quot;

<text>Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (; ; 1698 – 27 July 1759) was a French mathematician, philosopher and man of letters. He became the director of the Académie des Sciences and the first president of the Prussian Academy of Science, at the invitation of Frederick the Great.

Maupertuis made an expedition to Lapland to determine the shape of the Earth. He is often credited with having discovered the principle of least action – a version of which is known as Maupertuis&#x27;s principle – which he expressed as an integral equation that describes the path followed by a physical system. His work in natural history is interesting in relation to modern science since he touched on aspects of heredity and the struggle for life.

== Biography ==
Maupertuis was born at Saint-Malo, France, to a moderately wealthy family of merchant-corsairs. His father, Renė, had been involved in a number of enterprises that were central to the monarchy so that he thrived socially and politically. The son was educated in mathematics by a private tutor, Nicolas Guisnée, and upon completing his formal education his father secured him a largely honorific cavalry commission. After three years in the cavalry, during which time he became acquainted with fashionable social and mathematical circles, he moved to Paris and began building his reputation as a mathematician and literary wit. In 1723 he was admitted to the Académie des Sciences.
His early mathematical work revolved around the vis viva controversy, for which Maupertuis developed and extended the work of Isaac Newton (whose theories were not yet widely accepted outside England) and argued against the waning Cartesian mechanics. In the 1730s, the shape of the Earth became a flashpoint in the battle among rival systems of mechanics. Maupertuis, based on his exposition of Newton (with the help of his mentor Johan Bernoulli) predicted that the Earth should be oblate, while his rival Jacques Cassini measured it astronomically to be prolate. In 1736 Maupertuis acted as chief of the French Geodesic Mission sent by King Louis XV to Lapland to measure the length of a degree of arc of the meridian. His results, which he published in a book detailing his procedures, essentially settled the controversy in his favour. The book included an adventure narrative of the expedition, and an account of the Käymäjärvi Inscriptions in Sweden. On his return home he became a member of almost all the scientific societies of Europe.
After the Lapland expedition, Maupertuis set about generalising his earlier mathematical work, proposing the principle of least action as a metaphysical principle that underlies all the laws of mechanics. He also expanded into the biological realm, anonymously publishing a book that was part popular science, part philosophy, and part erotica: &quot;Vénus physique&quot;. In that work, Maupertuis proposed a theory of generation (i.e., reproduction) in which organic matter possessed a self-organizing “intelligence” that was analogous to the contemporary chemical concept of affinities, which was widely read and commented upon favourably by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. He later developed his views on living things further in a more formal pseudonymous work that explored heredity, collecting evidence that confirmed the contributions of both sexes and treated variations as statistical phenomena.

In 1740 Maupertuis went to Berlin at the invitation of Frederick II of Prussia, and took part in the Battle of Mollwitz on a donkey, where he was taken prisoner by the Austrians. On his release he returned to Berlin, and thence to Paris, where he was elected director of the Academy of Sciences in 1742, and in the following year was admitted into the Académie française. Returning to Berlin in 1744, again at the desire of Frederick II, he was chosen president of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1746, which he controlled with the help of Leonhard Euler until his death. His position became extremely awkward with the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War between his home country and his patron&#x27;s, and his reputation suffered in both Paris and Berlin. Finding his health declining, he retired in 1757 to the south of France with a young girl, leaving his wife and children behind and went in 1758 to Basel, where he died a year later. Maupertuis&#x27;s difficult disposition involved him in constant quarrels, of which his controversies with Samuel König and Voltaire during the latter part of his life are examples.
:&quot;The brilliance of much of what he did was undermined by his tendency to leave work unfinished, his failure to realise his own potential. It was the insight of genius that led him to least-action principle, but a lack of intellectual energy or rigour that prevented his giving it the mathematical foundation that Lagrange would provide... He reveals remarkable powers of perception in heredity, in understanding the mechanism by which species developed, even in immunology, but no fully elaborated theory. His philosophical work is his most enthralling: bold, exciting, well argued.&quot;

==Evolution==
Some historians of science point to his work in biology as a significant precursor to the development of evolutionary theory, specifically the theory of natural selection. Other writers contend that his remarks are cursory, vague, or incidental to that particular argument. Mayr&#x27;s verdict was &quot;He was neither an evolutionist, nor one of the founders of the theory of natural selection [but] he was one of the pioneers of genetics&quot;. Maupertuis espoused a theory of pangenesis, postulating particles from both mother and father as responsible for the characters of the child. Bowler credits him with studies on heredity, with the natural origin of human races, and with the idea that forms of life may have changed with time.

Maupertuis was a strong critic of the natural theologians, pointing to phenomena incompatible with a concept of a good and wise Creator. He was also one of the first to consider animals in terms of variable populations, in opposition to the natural history tradition that emphasised description of individual specimens.

The difficulty of interpreting Maupertuis can be gauged by reading the original works. Below is a translation from the &quot;Essai de cosmologie&quot;, followed by the original French passage:

&quot;Mais ne pourroit-on pas dire, que dans la combinaison fortuite des productions de la Nature, comme il n&#x27;y avoit que celles où se trouvoient certains rapports de convenance, qui pussent subsister, il n&#x27;est pas merveilleux que cette convenance se trouve dans toutes les especes qui actuellement existent? Le hasard, diroit-on, avoit produit une multitude innombrable d&#x27;Individus; un petit nombre se trouvoit construit de maniere que les parties de l&#x27;Animal pouvoient satisfaire à ses besoins; dans un autre infiniment plus grand, il n&#x27;y avoit ni convenance, ni ordre: tous ces derniers ont péri; des Animaux sans bouche ne pouvoient pas vivre, d&#x27;autres qui manquoient d&#x27;organes pour la génération ne pouvoient pas se perpétuer; les feuls qui soient restés, sont ceux où se trouvoient l&#x27;ordre &amp; la convenance: &amp; ces especes que nous voyons aujourd&#x27;hui, ne sont que la plus petite partie de ce qu&#x27;un destin aveugle avoit produit.&quot;

The same text was published earlier (1748) as &quot;&quot; (translation: &quot;&quot;). King-Hele (1963) points to similar, though not identical, ideas of thirty years later by David Hume in his &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot; (1777).

The chief debate that Maupertuis was engaged in was one that treated the competing theories of generation (i.e. preformationism and epigenesis). His account of life involved spontaneous generation of new kinds of animals and plants, together with massive elimination of deficient forms. These ideas avoid the need for a Creator, but are not part of modern thinking on evolution. The date of these speculations, 1745, is concurrent with Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s own work, and so predates any firm notion of species. Also, the work on genealogy, coupled with the tracing of phenotypic characters through lineages, foreshadows later work done in genetics.

==Least action principle==
The principle of least action states that in all natural phenomena a quantity called &#x27;action&#x27; tends to be minimised. Maupertuis developed such a principle over two decades. For him, action could be expressed mathematically as the product of the mass of the body involved, the distance it had travelled and the velocity at which it was travelling.

In 1741, he gave a paper to the Paris Academy of Sciences, &quot;Loi du repos des corps&quot;, (&quot;Law of bodies at rest&quot;). In it he showed that a system of bodies at rest tends to reach a position in which any change would create the smallest possible change in a quantity that he argued could be assimilated to action.

In 1744, in another paper to the Paris Academy, he gave his &quot;Accord de plusieurs lois naturelles qui avaient paru jusqu&#x27;ici incompatibles&quot; (&quot;Agreement of several natural laws that had hitherto seemed to be incompatible&quot;) to show that the behaviour of light during refraction – when it bends on entering a new medium – was such that the total path it followed, from a point in the first medium to a point in the second, minimised a quantity which he again assimilated to action.

Finally, in 1746 he gave a further paper, the &quot;Loix du mouvement et du repos&quot; (&quot;Laws of movement and rest&quot;), this time to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, which showed that point masses also minimise action. Point masses are bodies that can be treated for the purposes of analysis as being a certain amount of matter (a mass) concentrated at a single point. A major debate in the early part of the eighteenth century concerned the behaviour of such bodies in collisions.

Cartesian and Newtonian physicists argued that in their collisions, point masses conserved both momentum and relative velocity. Leibnizians, on the other hand, argued that they also conserved what was called &quot;live force&quot; or &quot;vis viva&quot;. This was unacceptable for their opponents for two reasons: the first that live force conservation did not apply to so-called ‘hard’ bodies, bodies that were totally incompressible, whereas the other two conservation principles did; the second was that live force was defined by the product of mass and square of velocity. Why did the velocity appear twice in this quantity, as squaring it suggests? The Leibnizians argued this was simple enough: there was a natural tendency in all matter towards motion, so even at rest, there is an inherent velocity in bodies; when they begin to move, there is a second velocity term corresponding to their actual motion.

This was anathema to Cartesians and Newtonians. An inherent tendency towards motion was an ‘occult quality’ of the kind of favoured by mediaeval scholastics and to be resisted at all costs.

Today the concept of a ‘hard’ body is rejected; and mass times the square of velocity is just twice kinetic energy so modern mechanics reserves a major role for the inheritor quantity of ‘live force’.

For Maupertuis, however, it was important to retain the concept of the hard body. And the beauty of his principle of least action was that it applied just as well to hard and elastic bodies. Since he had shown that the principle also applied to systems of bodies at rest and to light, it seemed that it was truly universal.

The final stage of his argument came when Maupertuis set out to interpret his principle in cosmological terms. ‘Least action’ sounds like an economy principle, roughly equivalent to the idea of economy of effort in daily life. A universal principle of economy of effort would seem to display the working of wisdom in the very construction of the universe. This seems, in Maupertuis&#x27;s view, a more powerful argument for the existence of an infinitely wise creator than any other that can be advanced.

He published his thinking on these matters in his &quot;Essai de cosmologie&quot; (&quot;Essay on cosmology&quot;) of 1750. He shows that the major arguments advanced to prove God, from the wonders of nature or the apparent regularity of the universe, are all open to objection (what wonder is there in the existence of certain particularly repulsive insects, what regularity is there in the observation that all the planets turn in nearly the same plane – exactly the same plane might have been striking but &#x27;nearly the same plane&#x27; is far less convincing). But a universal principle of wisdom provides an undeniable proof of the shaping of the universe by a wise creator.

Hence the principle of least action is not just the culmination of Maupertuis&#x27;s work in several areas of physics, he sees it as his most important achievement in philosophy too, giving an incontrovertible proof of God.

The flaws in his reasoning are principally that there is no obvious reason why the product of mass, velocity and distance should be particularly viewed as corresponding to action, and even less reason why its minimisation should be an &#x27;economy&#x27; principle like a minimisation of effort. Indeed, the product of mass, velocity and distance is mathematically the equivalent of the product of the live force and time; thus the integral over distance of the product of mass and velocity is equivalent of the integral over time of the live force. Leibniz had already shown that this quantity is likely to be either minimised &quot;or maximised&quot; in natural phenomena. Minimising this quantity could conceivably demonstrate economy, but how could maximising it? (See also the corresponding principles of &quot;stationary&quot; actions by Lagrange and Hamilton).

=== Relation to Kant ===
In &quot;Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens&quot;, Immanuel Kant quotes Maupertuis&#x27; 1745 discussion of nebula-like objects, which Maupertuis notes are actually collections of stars, including Andromeda.

Arthur Schopenhauer suggested that Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;most important and brilliant doctrine&quot;—contained in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781)—was asserted by Maupertuis:

<text>Crass Records was an independent record label that was set up by the anarchist punk band Crass.

==Overview and history==
Prior to the formation of Crass, Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher had published their creative works via their own Dial House based Exitstencil Press. However the band set up the record label after encountering problems over the release of their first 12&quot; EP, &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot;, on the Small Wonder label in 1978. Workers at the Irish pressing plant contracted to manufacture the disc refused to handle it due to the allegedly blasphemous content of one song, &quot;Asylum&quot;. The record was eventually released with this track removed and replaced by two minutes of silence, wryly retitled &quot;The Sound Of Free Speech&quot;. However, this incident prompted Crass to set up their own record label to control all aspects of their future productions. Using money from a small inheritance that had been left to one of the band, the piece was shortly afterwards re-recorded and released as a 7&quot; single using its full title, &quot;Reality Asylum&quot;. A later repress of &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot; on Crass Records restored the missing track.

As well as releasing their own material, Crass were able to use Crass Records to make available recordings by other performers, the first of which was the 1980 single &quot;You Can Be You&quot; by Honey Bane, a teenage girl who at the time was staying at Dial House whilst on the run from a children&#x27;s home (however, Bane&#x27;s backing band on this release are in fact Crass, using the name Donna and the Kebabs). Others who recorded for the label included Zounds, Flux of Pink Indians, Captain Sensible, the Cravats, Conflict, Icelandic band Kukl (who included singer Björk), classical singer Jane Gregory and the Poison Girls, a like-minded band who worked closely with Crass for several years. Many of these groups, in turn, went on to set up their own independent record labels loosely following the Crass Records model.

Singles released on the Crass Records label had a distinctive &#x27;corporate identity&#x27;. As well as lyrically addressing political themes from a broadly anarchist perspective, they were always low priced and usually produced by Crass drummer Penny Rimbaud and engineered by John Loder at Southern Studios in north London. They also featured sleeves designed by Gee Vaucher, often in conjunction with other artists, wherein the record&#x27;s title and band name were set in &#x27;stencil&#x27; style text in a black ring reminiscent of Robert Indiana and Jasper Johns&#x27; works. These sleeves usually folded out into large posters containing additional artwork and text.

The label also put out three editions of &quot;Bullshit Detector&quot;, compilations of demos and rough recordings that had been sent to the band which they felt represented the DIY punk ethic.

The catalogue numbers of Crass Records releases were intended to represent a countdown to the year 1984 (e.g., 521984 meaning &quot;five years until 1984&quot;), both the year that Crass stated that they would split up, and a date charged with significance in the anti-authoritarian calendar due to George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

Although these vinyl records are now no longer pressed and their art out of print, many of the tracks have been collected and re-released on the &quot;A-Sides&quot; parts one and two compilation CDs. Crass&#x27; back catalogue, however, remains in print, both in vinyl and CD format.

Ex-Crass members Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher continue to put out their creative works (for example, material by Last Amendment, and Vaucher&#x27;s book &quot;Animal Rites&quot;) through Exitstencil, often in collaboration with other publishers such as the jazz label Babel Label and AK Press.

==Corpus Christi==
Corpus Christi Records was a &#x27;spin-off&#x27; from Crass Records, that enabled artists and performers to put out material supported by Crass through John Loder&#x27;s Southern Studios, whilst not necessarily being tied to the latter label&#x27;s &#x27;corporate image&#x27; or anarchist ideology.

<text>In cryptography, a rotor machine is an electro-mechanical stream cipher device used for encrypting and decrypting messages. Rotor machines were the cryptographic state-of-the-art for much of the 20th century; they were in widespread use from the 1920s to the 1970s. The most famous example is the German Enigma machine, the output of which was deciphered by the Allies during World War II, producing intelligence code-named &quot;Ultra&quot;.

==Description==
The primary component of a rotor machine is a set of &quot;rotors&quot;, also termed &quot;wheels&quot; or &quot;drums&quot;, which are rotating disks with an array of electrical contacts on either side. The wiring between the contacts implements a fixed substitution of letters, replacing them in some complex fashion. On its own, this would offer little security; however, before or after encrypting each letter, the rotors advance positions, changing the substitution. By this means, a rotor machine produces a complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which changes with every key press.

==Background==
In classical cryptography, one of the earliest encryption methods was the simple substitution cipher, where letters in a message were systematically replaced using some secret scheme. &quot;Monoalphabetic&quot; substitution ciphers used only a single replacement scheme — sometimes termed an &quot;alphabet&quot;; this could be easily broken, for example, by using frequency analysis. Somewhat more secure were schemes involving multiple alphabets, polyalphabetic ciphers. Because such schemes were implemented by hand, only a handful of different alphabets could be used; anything more complex would be impractical. However, using only a few alphabets left the ciphers vulnerable to attack. The invention of rotor machines mechanised polyalphabetic encryption, providing a practical way to use a much larger number of alphabets.

The earliest cryptanalytic technique was frequency analysis, in which letter patterns unique to every language could be used to discover information about the substitution alphabet(s) in use in a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. For instance, in English, the plaintext letters E, T, A, O, I, N and S, are usually easy to identify in ciphertext on the basis that since they are very frequent, their corresponding ciphertext letters will also be as frequent. In addition, bigram combinations like NG, ST and others are also very frequent, while others are rare indeed (Q followed by anything other than U for instance). The simplest frequency analysis relies on one ciphertext letter always being substituted for a plaintext letter in the cipher: if this is not the case, deciphering the message is more difficult. For many years, cryptographers attempted to hide the telltale frequencies by using several different substitutions for common letters, but this technique was unable to fully hide patterns in the substitutions for plaintext letters. Such schemes were being widely broken by the 16th century.

In the mid-15th century, a new technique was invented by Alberti, now known generally as polyalphabetic ciphers, which recognised the virtue of using more than a single substitution alphabet; he also invented a simple technique for &quot;creating&quot; a multitude of substitution patterns for use in a message. Two parties exchanged a small amount of information (referred to as the &quot;key&quot;) and used it to create many substitution alphabets, and so many different substitutions for each plaintext letter over the course of a single plaintext. The idea is simple and effective, but proved more difficult to use than might have been expected. Many ciphers were only partial implementations of Alberti&#x27;s, and so were easier to break than they might have been (e.g. the Vigenère cipher).

Not until the 1840s (Babbage) was any technique known which could reliably break any of the polyalphabetic ciphers. His technique also looked for repeating patterns in the ciphertext, which provide clues about the length of the key. Once this is known, the message essentially becomes a series of messages, each as long as the length of the key, to which normal frequency analysis can be applied. Charles Babbage, Friedrich Kasiski, and William F. Friedman are among those who did most to develop these techniques.

Cipher designers tried to get users to use a different substitution for every letter, but this usually meant a very long key, which was a problem in several ways. A long key takes longer to convey (securely) to the parties who need it, and so mistakes are more likely in key distribution. Also, many users do not have the patience to carry out lengthy, letter-perfect evolutions, and certainly not under time pressure or battlefield stress. The &#x27;ultimate&#x27; cipher of this type would be one in which such a &#x27;long&#x27; key could be generated from a simple pattern (ideally automatically), producing a cipher in which there are so many substitution alphabets that frequency counting and statistical attacks would be effectively impossible. Enigma, and the rotor machines generally, were just what was needed since they were seriously polyalphabetic, using a different substitution alphabet for each letter of plaintext, and automatic, requiring no extraordinary abilities from their users. Their messages were, generally, much harder to break than any previous ciphers.

==Mechanization==
It is straightforward to create a machine for performing simple substitution. In an electrical system with 26 switches attached to 26 light bulbs, any one of the switches will illuminate one of the bulbs.
If each switch is operated by a key on a typewriter, and the bulbs are labelled with letters, then such a system can be used for encryption by choosing the wiring between the keys and the bulb: for example, typing the letter would make the bulb labelled light up. However, the wiring is fixed, providing little security.

Rotor machines change the interconnecting wiring with each key stroke. The wiring is placed inside a rotor, and then rotated with a gear every time a letter is pressed. 
So while pressing the first time might generate a , the next time it might generate a . Every letter pressed on the keyboard increments the rotor position and get a new substitution, implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.

Depending on the size of the rotor, this may, or may not, be more secure than hand ciphers. If the rotor has only 26 positions on it, one for each letter, then all messages will have a (repeating) key 26 letters long. Although the key itself (mostly hidden in the wiring of the rotor) might not be known, the methods for attacking these types of ciphers don&#x27;t need that information. So while such a &quot;single rotor&quot; machine is certainly easy to use, it is no more secure than any other partial polyalphabetic cipher system.

But this is easy to correct. Simply stack more rotors next to each other, and gear them together. After the first rotor spins &quot;all the way&quot;, make the rotor beside it spin one position. Now you would have to type 26 × 26 = 676 letters (for the Latin alphabet) before the key repeats, and yet it still only requires you to communicate a key of two letters/numbers to set things up. If a key of 676 length is not long enough, another rotor can be added, resulting in a period 17,576 letters long.

In order to be as easy to decipher as encipher, some rotor machines, most notably the Enigma machine, embodied a symmetric-key algorithm, i.e., encrypting twice with the same settings recovers the original message (see involution).

==History==

===Invention===

The concept of a rotor machine occurred to a number of inventors independently at a similar time.

In 2003, it emerged that the first inventors were two Dutch naval officers, Theo A. van Hengel (1875–1939) and R. P. C. Spengler (1875–1955) in 1915 (De Leeuw, 2003). Previously, the invention had been ascribed to four inventors working independently and at much the same time: Edward Hebern, Arvid Damm, Hugo Koch and Arthur Scherbius.

In the United States Edward Hugh Hebern built a rotor machine using a single rotor in 1917. He became convinced he would get rich selling such a system to the military, the Hebern Rotor Machine, and produced a series of different machines with one to five rotors. His success was limited, however, and he went bankrupt in the 1920s. He sold a small number of machines to the US Navy in 1931.

In Hebern&#x27;s machines the rotors could be opened up and the wiring changed in a few minutes, so a single mass-produced system could be sold to a number of users who would then produce their own rotor keying. Decryption consisted of taking out the rotor(s) and turning them around to reverse the circuitry. Unknown to Hebern, William F. Friedman of the US Army&#x27;s SIS promptly demonstrated a flaw in the system that allowed the ciphers from it, and from any machine with similar design features, to be cracked with enough work.

Another early rotor machine inventor was Dutchman Hugo Koch, who filed a patent on a rotor machine in 1919. At about the same time in Sweden, Arvid Gerhard Damm invented and patented another rotor design. However, the rotor machine was ultimately made famous by Arthur Scherbius, who filed a rotor machine patent in 1918. Scherbius later went on to design and market the Enigma machine.

The most widely known rotor cipher device is the German Enigma machine used during World War II, of which there were a number of variants.

The standard Enigma model, Enigma I, used three rotors. At the end of the stack of rotors was an additional, non-rotating disk, the &quot;reflector,&quot; wired such that the input was connected electrically back out to another contact on the same side and thus was &quot;reflected&quot; back through the three-rotor stack to produce the ciphertext.

When current was sent into most other rotor cipher machines, it would travel through the rotors and out the other side to the lamps. In the Enigma, however, it was &quot;reflected&quot; back through the disks before going to the lamps. The advantage of this was that there was nothing that had to be done to the setup in order to decipher a message; the machine was &quot;symmetrical&quot;.

The Enigma&#x27;s reflector guaranteed that no letter could be enciphered as itself, so an &quot;A&quot; could never turn back into an &quot;A&quot;. This helped Polish and, later, British efforts to break the cipher. (&quot;See&quot; Cryptanalysis of the Enigma.)

Scherbius joined forces with a mechanical engineer named Ritter and formed Chiffriermaschinen AG in Berlin before demonstrating Enigma to the public in Bern in 1923, and then in 1924 at the World Postal Congress in Stockholm. In 1927 Scherbius bought Koch&#x27;s patents, and in 1928 they added a &quot;plugboard&quot;, essentially a non-rotating manually rewireable fourth rotor, on the front of the machine. After the death of Scherbius in 1929, Willi Korn was in charge of further technical development of Enigma.

As with other early rotor machine efforts, Scherbius had limited commercial success. However, the German armed forces, responding in part to revelations that their codes had been broken during World War I, adopted the Enigma to secure their communications. The &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; adopted Enigma in 1926, and the German Army began to use a different variant around 1928.

The Enigma (in several variants) was the rotor machine that Scherbius&#x27;s company and its successor, Heimsoth &amp; Reinke, supplied to the German military and to such agencies as the Nazi party security organization, the &quot;SD&quot;.

The Poles broke the German Army Enigma beginning in December 1932, not long after it had been put into service. On July 25, 1939, just five weeks before Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland, the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau shared its Enigma-decryption methods and equipment with the French and British as the Poles&#x27; contribution to the common defense against Nazi Germany. Dilly Knox had already broken Spanish Nationalist messages on a commercial Enigma machine in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.

A few months later, using the Polish techniques, the British began reading Enigma ciphers in collaboration with Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologists who had escaped Poland, overrun by the Germans, to reach Paris. The Poles continued breaking German Army Enigma—along with Luftwaffe Enigma traffic—until work at Station &quot;PC Bruno&quot; in France was shut down by the German invasion of May–June 1940.

The British continued breaking Enigma and, assisted eventually by the United States, extended the work to German Naval Enigma traffic (which the Poles had been reading before the war), most especially to and from U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic.

===Various machines===

During World War II (WWII), both the Germans and Allies developed additional rotor machines. The Germans used the Lorenz SZ 40/42 and Siemens and Halske T52 machines to encipher teleprinter traffic which used the Baudot code; this traffic was known as Fish to the Allies. The Allies developed the Typex (British) and the SIGABA (American). During the War the Swiss began development on an Enigma improvement which became the NEMA machine which was put into service after World War II. There was even a Japanese developed variant of the Enigma in which the rotors sat horizontally; it was apparently never put into service. The Japanese PURPLE machine was not a rotor machine, being built around electrical stepping switches, but was conceptually similar.

Rotor machines continued to be used even in the computer age. The KL-7 (ADONIS), an encryption machine with 8 rotors, was widely used by the U.S. and its allies from the 1950s until the 1980s. The last Canadian message encrypted with a KL-7 was sent on June 30, 1983. The Soviet Union and its allies used a 10-rotor machine called Fialka well into the 1970s.

A unique rotor machine called the Cryptograph was constructed in 2002 by Netherlands-based Tatjana van Vark. This unusual device is inspired by Enigma, but makes use of 40-point rotors, allowing letters, numbers and some punctuation; each rotor contains 509 parts.

A software implementation of a rotor machine was used in the crypt command that was part of early UNIX operating systems. It was among the first software programs to run afoul of U.S. export regulations which classified cryptographic implementations as munitions.

<text>Karl Rudolph Koenig (26 November 18322 October 1901) was a German businessman, instrument maker, and physicist, chiefly concerned with acoustic phenomena. He was best known for designing and building acoustical instruments such as the tuning fork and sound analyser.

== Family and personal life ==
Karl Rudolph Koenig was born in Königsberg of Prussia on 26 November 1832, a descendant of a prominent Königsberg family. Koenig was raised along with his three sisters by his mother: Mathilde (Preuss) Koenig, who came from a craftsman and musical family background, and his father Johann Friedrich Koenig, a professor of mathematics and physics who had studied under the famous Friedrich Bessel. In 1851, Koenig moved to Paris, living in an apartment along the Île Saint-Louis. He lived alone and was never married.

==Education==

Rudolph had little education past high school. He attended primary school and had the usual high school at gymnasium. The extent of his formal education was completed in his hometown where his father was among the faculty. Early on it was clear that Rudolph had a keen ear for music and a good sense toward art and literature. Past secondary school, Rudolph began to study physics and mathematics on his own. His self studies were focused early on tone and psychoacoustics. Eventually, he turned to focus more on mechanics and physics. In 1968, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Koenigsberg.

==Career ==

Karl Rudolph Koenig was known to be a great craftsman, but a lesser known interest of his was physics. Sounds in particular were a fascination of his, to the point that he spent a large amount of time and money doing research on acoustics. Early on in life, he took a position as an apprentice in the workshop of violin maker Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. Koenig spent seven years working under Vuillaume until 1858 when he started his own business. In 1859, he released his first work on acoustic apparatus. Koenig&#x27;s instruments, not just his tuning forks, are still used in the present day.

The business started in his apartment which consisted of a living room, bedroom, and a workshop along with the laboratory. It was a small and quiet place where Koenig worked with his passion of acoustics and music. He would spend most of his free time and money on this same passion. In 1861, Koenig grasped an opportunity to expand and moved his business to Lycée Louis-le-Grand/

The business employed about three workers, however Koenig made almost all of his own instruments. Koenig was a meticulous worker and personally checked and tuned every instrument that was produced. He was well known in his time to make near perfect instrumentation of high quality.

Although Koenig&#x27;s lab and workshop were in a quiet place, this did not stop scientists and many other people such as Dayton C. Miller from coming to visit.

== Harmonic Motion ==
Koenig did not stop at just making instruments however. He would go on to study the graphic method for harmonic motion to which he devoted much time. He even further expanded to compound harmonic motion for both parallel and rectangular vibrations. These studies helped him to present his apparatus in London in 1862 at an international exhibition. This marked the beginning of using the graphic method for other purposes besides just in laboratories.

== Products ==
Karl Rudolph Koenig produced a variety of devices and acoustic instruments. These devices and instruments include a sound analyzer, tuning forks, double risen, wave machines, resonators, devices for sound visualization, and obtaining ultrasonic frequencies etc. 


One of Koenig&#x27;s more interesting devices was a watch with the escapement consisting of a tuning fork that could calibrate the main frequencies of any sound. This apparatus helped Koenig establish the frequencies of musical tones and allowed him to build a musical scale.

Another apparatus was a phonograph which could collect sounds by means of a pavilion. It could automatically record them in a rotating cylinder by means of a point. Some years later, Thomas Edison developed this device to build the Phonograph known today.

Among many other products, Koenig also built measuring instruments which were composed of resonators. He also authored various works on limits of hearing, the physical characterization of vowels and the combination of tones.

In the late 1800s Koenig found out that people were making cheap copies of his acoustical apparatus. He complained about these knock off instruments, stating that some even had his name on them despite the fact that he had nothing to do with their creation.

== Timeline ==
In 1859, Koenig both published his first catalog, and inverted the phonograph which would play a crucial role for the graphical analysis of sound. By inverting the phonograph, Rudolph made it easier to record and store sounds made by the vibrations of air particles. Around 1860, along with Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolph Koenig worked to devise an electronically controlled sound. After working alongside him, Koenig became the main maker and seller of Helmholtz&#x27;s instruments. Two years following this in 1862, he began to exhibit the nano-metric flame apparatus (see attached image and description for more information) at the London Exhibition. This was the first time his nano-metric flame apparatus was displayed to the public.

In 1865,  Koenig published his second catalog, and was awarded a gold medal from the Societe d&#x27;Encouragement pOllr l&#x27;lndustrie ntuionale for the use of his instruments in working with the study of acoustics. In 1867, his apparatus collection was exhibited in Paris. After few exhibitions, many of Koenig&#x27;s products began to be sold internationally. A few years following in 1868 he presented all this catalog at the Paris universal exhibition where about 70% of his production was sold.

His wave-sirens as well as most of his other products were shown at Philadelphia exhibition in 1876 at the London Exhibition. The expansion into the United States was met with difficulties. Koenig&#x27;s expectations for the expansion of his business were not working as he had hoped. He did have some help from his customers, but was not pleased with the results. This led to Koenig having to travel to America in order to retrieve his leftover products and bring them back. It was decided to no longer take part in the exhibition. Following all of this he decided to start doing more of his own research, and also began to write many scientific articles while improving upon his instruments. In 1882 Koenig published &quot;Quelques expériences d&#x27;acoustique&quot; which was the book over his research research of scientific works.

After his death in 1901, some of Koenig&#x27;s equipment was sent and is now maintained in Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, Paris. The Smithsonian Institution has since began a collection of Koenig&#x27;s apparatus including some of his tuning forks. These were donated to the museum by the U.S. Military Academy. Another large collection of Koenig&#x27;s apparatuses is owned by the University of Toronto&#x27;s physics department.

<text>The T-64 is a Soviet tank manufactured in Kharkiv, and designed by Alexander Morozov. The tank was introduced in the early 1960s. It was a more advanced counterpart to the T-62: the T-64 served in tank divisions, while the T-62 supported infantry in motor rifle divisions. It introduced advanced features including composite armour, a compact engine and transmission, and a smoothbore 125-mm gun equipped with an autoloader to allow the crew to be reduced to three so the tank could be smaller and lighter. In spite of being armed and armoured like a heavy tank, the T-64 weighed only . 

These features made the T-64 expensive to build, significantly more so than previous generations of Soviet tanks. This was especially true of the power plant, which was time-consuming to build and cost twice as much as more conventional designs. Several proposals were made to improve the T-64 with new engines, but chief designer Alexander Alexandrovich Morozov&#x27;s political power in Moscow kept the design in production in spite of any concerns about price.

The T-64 formed the design basis of the Soviet T-80, which entered service in 1976. The tank is in use in a few nations or regions as of 2023. The T-64 is undergoing significant factory overhauls and modernization in Ukraine.

== Overview ==
The T-64 was conceived at the Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau, as the next-generation main battle tank by Alexander A. Morozov, the designer of the T-54 (which, in the meantime, would be incrementally improved by Leonid N. Kartsev&#x27;s Nizhny Tagil bureau, by the models T-54A, T-54B, T-55, and T-55A).

The T-64 was the first Soviet tank to use an autoloader for its 125-mm gun, allowing one crew member&#x27;s position to be omitted and helping to keep the size and weight of the tank down. Tank crewmen would joke that the designers had finally caught up with their unofficial hymn, &quot;Three Tankers&quot;, a song written to commemorate the crewmen fighting in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, in 3-man BT-5 tanks in 1939.

The T-64 also pioneered other Soviet tank technology: the T-64A model of 1967 introduced the 125-mm smoothbore gun, and the T-64B of 1976 would be able to fire an anti-tank guided missile through its gun barrel. Soviet military planners considered the T-64 the first of the third-generation tanks and the first main battle tank. 

The T-64 design was used as basis by LKZ for the gas turbine-powered T-80 main battle tank. The T-64A turret was adopted for early T-80 tank models, with its main gun and automatic loading mechanism, and upgraded armour.

The T-64 was only supplied to the Soviet Army and its successors. It was never exported before 1991, unlike the T-54/55. The tank equipped elite and regular formations in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, the T-64A model being first deployed with East Germany&#x27;s Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) in 1976, and some time later in Hungary&#x27;s Southern Group of Forces (SFG). By 1981, the improved T-64B began to be deployed in East Germany and later in Hungary. While it was believed that the T-64 was reserved for elite units, it was also used by much lower level &quot;non-ready formations&quot;, for example, the Odessa Military District&#x27;s 14th Army.

With the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, T-64 tanks remained in the arsenals of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Uzbekistan. In mid-2014, nearly 2,000 of the former Soviet inventory of T-64 tanks were in service with the military of Ukraine and about 4,000 were out of service and awaiting destruction in Russia.

== Development history ==
=== Object 430 ===

Studies for the design of a new battle tank started in 1951. The KB-60M team was formed at the Kharkiv design bureau of the Kharkiv transport machine-building factory No. 75 named for Malyshev () by engineers coming back from Nizhniy Tagil, with Morozov at its head.

A project named obyekt 430 led to three prototypes which were tested in Kubinka in 1958. Those vehicles had characteristics that were going to influence and radically alter the design of tanks on this side of the Iron Curtain. For the first time, a compact opposed-piston engine was used: the 4TD, designed by the plant&#x27;s engine design team. The transmission system comprised two lateral gears on each side of the engine. Those two innovations yielded a very short engine compartment with the opening located beneath the turret. The engine compartment volume was almost half that of the T-54. An improved cooling system and a new lightweight suspension was fitted, featuring hollow metallic wheels of a small diameter and caterpillar tracks with rubber joints.

The tank would be armed with the D-54TS and would have frontal armour of 120 mm. As it did not present a clear superiority in combat characteristics when compared to the T-55, which was entering active service, Morozov decided that production was not yet ready given the project&#x27;s drawbacks. However, studies conducted on the Object 430U, featuring a 122 mm gun and 160 mm of armour, demonstrated that the tank had the potential to carry the firepower and armour of a heavy tank on to a medium tank chassis. A new project was consequently started, the Object 432.

=== Object 432 ===
The gun fitted on this new tank was a 115 mm D-68 (2A21). This was a potentially risky decision to replace the human loader by an electro-hydraulic automatic system, since the technology was new to Russian designers. The crew was reduced to three, which allowed a considerable reduction in internal volume and external visible silhouette, and consequently in weight, from 36 tonnes (obyekt 430) to 30.5 tonnes. The height dropped by 76 mm.

The arrival of the British 105 mm L7 gun and the US M68 variant of it, fitted to the Centurion and M60 tanks, forced the team to adopt composite armour. The recently created process was called &quot;K combination&quot; by Western armies: this protection consisted of an aluminium alloy layer between two high strength steel layers. As a consequence, the weight of the prototype rose eventually to 34 tonnes. But, as the engine was now a 700 hp (515 kW) 5TDF (also locally designed), its mobility remained superior to that of the T-62. The obyekt 432 was ready in September 1962 and production started in October 1963 in the Kharkiv plant. On 30 December 1966, it entered service as the T-64.

=== T-64A ===


Even as the first T-64s were rolling off the assembly lines, the design team was working on a new version, named Object 434, which would allow it to maintain firepower superiority. The new 125 mm D-81T gun, from the Perm weapons factory, was fitted to the tank. This gun was a scaled-up version of the 115 mm smoothbore cannon from the T-62. The larger size of the 125 mm ammunition meant that less could be carried inside the T-64, and with a fourth crewman loader taking up space as well, the tank would only have a 25-round capacity. This was unacceptably low for the Soviet designers, but strict dimensional parameters forbade them from enlarging the tank to increase interior space. The solution was to replace the human loader with a mechanical autoloader, cutting the crew to three and marking the first use of autoloaders in a Soviet MBT. The 6ETs10 autoloader has 28 rounds and can fire 8 shots per minute; the stabiliser, a 2E23, was coupled to the new TPD-2-1 (1G15-1) sight. Night driving was also supported with the new TPN-1-43A periscope, which would benefit from the illumination of an infrared L2G projector, fitted on the left side of the gun. The shielding was improved, with fibreglass replacing the aluminium alloy in the armour, and small spring-mounted plates fitted along the mudguards (known as the gill skirt), to cover the top of the suspension and the side tanks. They were extremely fragile and were often removed. Some small storage spaces were created along the turret, with a compartment on the right and three boxes on the front left. Snorkels were mounted on the rear of the turret. An NBC protection system was fitted and the hatches were widened.

Prototypes were tested in 1966 and 1967 and, as production began after the six hundredth T-64, it entered service in the Soviet Army under the designation T-64A. Chief engineer Morozov was awarded the Lenin Prize for this model&#x27;s success.

Designed for elite troops, the T-64A was constantly updated as available equipment was improved. After three years in service, a first modernisation occurred, comprising:
* fire control, by replacing the sights with the TPD-2-49 day sight with an optical coincidence rangefinder and a TPN-1-49-23 night sight, and stabilisation by mounting a 2E26 system.
* the radio by mounting a R-123M
* night vision with a TBN-4PA for the driver and a TNP-165A for the tank leader. His post was transformed by mounting a small stabilised turret with an anti-aircraft NSVT 12.7 mm × 108 machine gun, electrically guided through an optical PZU-5 sight, and fed with 300 rounds. It could be used from within the tank so that the tank leader could avoid being exposed (as on previous tanks). The possibility of mounting a KMT-6 anti-mine system was also added.

A derived version appeared at the same time, designed for the commanding officer and named T-64AK. It comprised a R-130M radio with a 10 m telescopic antenna, which could be used only in a static position as it required shrouds, an artillery aiming circle PAB-2AM and TNA-3 navigation station; all of these could be powered by an auxiliary petrol generator.

In 1976, the weapons system was improved by mounting a D-81TM (2A46-1), stabilised by a 2E28M2, supplied by an automatic 6ETs10M. The night sight was replaced by a TNPA-65 and the engine could accept different fuels, including diesel fuel, kerosene or petrol. The production, first carried on the B variant, stopped in 1980.

The majority of T-64As were further modernised after 1981, by mounting a six smoke grenade-launcher 81 mm 902A on each side of the gun, and by replacing the gill plates by a rubber skirt for a longer life. Some of them seem to have been fitted with reactive bricks (as the T-64AV) after 1985, or even with laser TPD-K1 telemeters instead of the optical TPD-2-49 optical coincidence rangefinder (1981). Almost all T-64s were modernised into T-64R, between 1977 and 1981, by reorganising external storage and snorkels, similar to the T-64A.

=== T-64B ===
The design team was carrying on its work on new versions. Problems with the setup of the 5TDF engine occurred as the local production capacity was proven to be insufficient against a production done in three factories (Malyshev in Kharkiv, Kirov in Leningrad and Uralvagonzavod).

From 1961, an alternative to the Object 432 was studied, with a 12 V-cylinder V-45 engine: the Object 436. Three prototypes were tested in 1966 in the Chelyabinsk factory. The order was to develop a model derived from the 434 with the same engine given to the Object 438, later renamed as the Object 439. Four tanks of this type were built and tested in 1969, which showed the same mobility as the production version, but mass production was not started. They served as a basis for the design of the T-72 engine compartment.

At the beginning of the 1970s, the design team was trying to improve the tank further. The T-64A-2M study in 1973, with its more powerful engine and its reinforced turret, served as a basis for two projects:
* Object 476 with a 6TD 1000 hp (735 kW) engine which served as a model for the T-80 combat compartment.
* Object 447 which featured a new fire control with a laser telemeter, and which was able to fire gun launched anti-tank guided missiles.

For the latter, the order was given to start its production under the name T-64B, as well as a derived version (which shared 95% of its components), the Object 437, without the missile guidance system for cost reasons. The latter was almost twice as much produced under the designation T-64B1. On 3 September 1976, the T-64B and the T-64B1 were accepted for service, featuring the improved D-81Tm gun (2A46-2) with a 2E26M stabiliser, a 6ETs40 loader and a 1A33 fire control, including:
* a 1V517 ballistic calculator
* a 1G21 sight with laser telemetry
* a 1B11 cross-wind sensor.
Its ford capacity reaches 1.8 m without equipment. The T-64B had the ability to fire the new 9M112 &quot;Kobra&quot; radio-guided missile (NATO code &quot;AT-8 Songster&quot;). The vehicle then carries 8 missiles and 28 shells. The missile control system is mounted in front of the commander&#x27;s small turret and has many changes. The T-64B1 carries only 37 shells and has 2,000 7.62 mm rounds, against 1,250 for the T-64B.

They were modernised in 1981 by the replacement of the gun by a 2A46M1, the stabiliser by a 2E42, and the mounting of a 902A &quot;Tucha-1&quot; smoke grenade launcher in two groups of four, on each side of the gun. Two command versions exist, similar to the T-64AK: the T-64BK and the T-64B1K.

The decision in October 1979 to start production of the 6TD engine, and its great similarity to the 5TDF engine, allowed it to be fitted in versions B and B1, but also A and AK, yielding the new models T-64AM, T-64AKM, T-64BM and T-64BAM, entering service in 1983.

Production of all versions ended in 1987. Total production reached almost 13,000.

=== Modernisation in Ukraine ===

After the dissolution of the Soviet regime, Ukraine carried on the development of T-64 modernisation, as the original and main factory was in this country. As a result, modernised variants of the T-64 had become the most common tank in the Ukrainian inventory by 2022. Two different upgrade packages were developed in 1999:
* with a 57DFM 850-hp (625 kW) engine, a new 1A43U fire control, a new 6ETs43 loader and the ability to fire the 9M119 missile (NATO code &quot;AT-11 Sniper&quot;).
* which integrated on top the 1A45 fire control (from the T-80U and T-84), PNK-4SU and TKN-4S optics for the tank commander and PZU-7 for the AA machine gun. The commander is then able to drive the tank and to use the gun directly if needed.

The two variants are also protected by Kontakt-5 modular reactive armour, able to resist kinetic energy projectiles, as opposed to the first models which were efficient only against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge ammunition. Those two variants could also be fitted with the 6TDF 1,000 hp (735 kW) engine.
* Ukrainian army on use modernization, incorporating &quot;Nizh&quot; (Knife) reactive armour that offers better performance dealing with tandem warheads than the Soviet Kontakt-5, new Ukrainian-made 125 mm KBA3 gun, TO1-KO1ER night sight and capability of firing the Ukrainian tandem-warhead anti-tank guided missile.

In 2010, the Kharkiv Malyshev Factory upgraded ten T-64B tanks (originally produced in Kharkiv in 1980) to T-64BM Bulat standard, and a further nineteen were delivered in 2011. These twenty-nine tanks were upgraded under a ₴200 million ($25.1M) contract signed in April 2009. As of October 2011, the Ukrainian Army has 76 T-64BM Bulat in service. According to Malyshev Factory chief engineer Konstantin Isyak, the T-64BM Bulat is armoured to the level of modern tanks. It has Nizh (Knife) reactive armour, and Varta active protection system. The Bulat weighs , and with its 5TDFM multi-fuel diesel engine can travel at , with a range of . It retains the 125 mm smoothbore gun with an autoloader for 28 rounds, some of which can be guided missiles. It has a 12.7 mm AA machinegun, and a 7.62 mm coaxial machinegun. 
* 
A 2019 modernization program with TPN-1TPV thermal sight, 1A43U fire-control system, 1H46M sight for the Kombat ATGM, Lybid-2 radios, Basalt battlefield information system, raised turret ring, improved KhSChVK Nizh reactive armour, armour shield above the commander&#x27;s cupola, 12 mm armour for external fuel tanks, anti-RPG screens beside the engine compartment, and new 1000-hp 6TD-1 engine and transmission (new 5TD engines were no longer manufactured). This was conducted at the Kharkiv Armoured-Vehicle Plant (KhBTZ), with the engine compartment enlarged for the new engine by the Malyshev Factory (ZIM). Upgraded tanks were field tested in April 2021, and several were paraded in the August Independence Day parade.
* T-64BV model 2017
In 2019, Ukroboronprom reported that the Kharkiv Armoured Plant (KhBTZ) had delivered over 100 updated tanks to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The upgraded tanks included new thermal imaging for all crew, remove Luna infrared searchlight, include TPN-1-TPV Ukrainian night sight in place of TPN1-49-23, Nizh reactive armour modules designed for bolt-on replacement on T-64BV turrets, SN-4215 networked satellite navigation unit, and Lybid K-2RB digital radio (under license from Motorola) providing secure communications with a 70 km range. In August 2019, Ukroboronprom announced the Lviv Armoured Plant (LBTZ) had also started modernizing T-64s to the 2017 standard.

* T-64BV model 2022
In early 2022 Ukroboronprom was reported to be testing another modernization of the T-64BV, ordered by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. The tank has &quot;new third-generation surveillance and sighting units&quot; and is equipped with a new 12.7mm Snipex Laska K-2 heavy machine gun. It features &quot;new up-to-date radio stations&quot; and additional &quot;navigation, internal and external communication systems which fully meets NATO standards.&quot; The exterior fuel tanks are now also protected by 12mm steel plates.

== Production history ==
Sources differ on the initial production date of the tank that is set between 1963 and 1967, but it is established that the T-64 formally entered service with the Soviet army in 1967 and was publicly revealed in 1970. The T-64 was KMDB&#x27;s high-technology offering, intended to replace the IS-3 and T-10 heavy tanks in independent tank battalions. Meanwhile, the T-72 was intended to supersede the T-55 and T-62 in equipping the bulk of the Soviet tank and mechanised forces, as well as for export partners and east-block satellite states.

The T-64 introduced a new autoloader, which is still used on all T-64s currently in service, as well as all variants of the T-80 except the Ukrainian T-84-120. T-64 prototypes and the first several hundred examples produced had the same 115 mm smoothbore gun as the T-62; the T-64A and subsequent full-scale production variants had the 125 mm gun.

While the T-64 was the superior tank, it was more expensive and physically complex, and was produced in smaller numbers. The T-72 is mechanically simpler and easier to service in the field, and its manufacturing process is correspondingly simpler. In light of Soviet doctrine, the superior T-64s were kept ready and reserved for the most important mission: a potential outbreak of a war in Europe.

In Soviet times, T-64 was mostly in service with units stationed in East Germany opposing the Chieftain-equipped units of the BAOR. No T-64s were exported. Many T-64s ended up in Russian and Ukrainian service after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

* 2020 T-64MV – T-64 modernization for the Armed Forces of the Republic of Uzbekistan, consists of an installation of a more modern engine, ERA, slat armour and a digital radio system.

==== Variants ====

* – Heavy infantry fighting vehicle, based on the chassis of the T-64 but with a completely redesigned hull with a single entry hatch in the rear. Armament consists of a remote-controlled 30mm autocannon and 7.62 mm machine gun. Combat weight is 34.5 tons. The first prototype was ready in 2005.
* – Similar APC version.
* – Modified version that will serve as the basis for several (planned) specialized vehicles, including a fire support vehicle, an ambulance and an air-defence vehicle.
* – This variant is not tracked but has a new suspension with 4 axles, similar to the Soviet BTR series. The vehicle is powered by a 5TDF-A/700 engine and has a combat weight of 17.7 tons. It is fitted with a RCWS and can transport 3+8 men. Prototype only.
* BMPT-64 Strahz (cyrrillic: Страж, translates to guardian) – Fire support vehicle armed with 2 30mm autocannons, 2 PK machine guns, 4 ATGM-launchers and one AG-17 grenade launcher, developed by Zhytomyr Armoured Plant.

* BAT-2 – Fast combat engineering vehicle with the engine, lower hull and &quot;small roadwheels&quot; suspension of the T-64. The 40-ton tractor sports a very large, all axis adjustable V-shaped hydraulic dozer blade at the front, a single soil ripper spike at the rear and a 2-ton crane on the top. The crew compartment holds 8 persons (driver, commander and radio operator, plus a five-man sapper squad for dismounted tasks). The BAT-2 was designed to replace the old T-54/AT-T based BAT-M, but Warsaw Pact allies received only small numbers due to its high price and the old and new vehicles served together during the late Cold War.
* – Ukrainian development using surplus T-64s to create a Heavy APC/IFV design, which in turn is intended as the basis of a new family of combat and support vehicles. The basic conversion includes moving the engine compartment forward, and at the same time removing the turret and normal crew compartment. This allows the installation of any one of 15 different &#x27;functional modules&#x27;, weighing up to 22 tons. One resulting option is the Heavy IFV, designated &quot;BMP-64E&quot;, which combines accommodation for up to 10 troops (not including the driver) with a remote weapons system. The Heavy APC version is designated the &quot;BTR-64E&quot;, and can not only carry more troops (at the cost of the RWS) but comes with large armoured double hatches at the rear for rapid loading and disembarkation. Other options include a universal supplies carrier (&quot;UMBP-64&quot;), a &#x27;highly secure command and staff car with a weight up to 41 tons&#x27;, and a 120 mm mortar carrier. The Kharkiv Armour Repair Plant (&quot;Zavod 311&quot;) is behind the project. Current status of the program is unclear as of early 2014.

== Service history ==
=== Soviet Union ===
The T-64 entered service in 1967 with the 41st Guards Tank Division in the Kiev Military District, the suggestion being that this was prudent due to the proximity of the division to the factory, and significant teething problems during induction into service that required constant presence of factory support personnel with the division during acceptance and initial crew and service personnel training on the new type. It appears that the tank remained secret to the West for some years between its entry into production in the early 1960s and the official acceptance in the Soviet Army in 1967. 

The T-64A began deployment to the Soviet Union&#x27;s western military districts during the 1970s, and was gradually deployed to first line units in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany in East Germany and Soviet troops in neighboring Warsaw Pact states. The first GSFG unit to receive the T-64A was the 14th Guards Motor Rifle Division at Jüterbog, which became the 32nd Guards Tank Division in 1982. When NATO detected the new tank after it was first deployed to East Germany, it was initially misidentified as the T-72. The T-64 mainly served with Soviet tank units in northern East Germany that were part of the 2nd Guards Tank Army, the 3rd Army, and the 20th Guards Army, although it began to be phased out and replaced by the newer T-80BV/T-80U before Soviet troops were withdrawn from Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, when the Soviet troops withdrew from Germany, two divisions and the 6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade still operated the T-64.

In September 1990, the Soviet Union had 3,982 T-64s in service west of the Urals, with 2,091 of these in Ukraine. 1,386 of these were T-64As, 220 T-64AKs, 1,192 T-64Bs, 159 T-64BVs, 420 T-64B1s, 27 T-64B1K/BV1K, and 578 T-64Rs. During the Soviet period, the T-64 was never exported.

It is normally reported that the T-64 was not used in the Soviet–Afghan War since the 40th Soviet Army that was deployed there used T-54/55 and T-62 tanks, possibly due to the limited usefulness of tanks in mountain warfare. A few T-64 tanks were tested in Afghanistan during January 1980, but were quickly withdrawn without seeing combat because their engines did not perform well in the high altitude necessary for Afghan operations.

=== Post-Soviet period ===

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the new Russian Ground Forces decided to standardise the tank fleet with the T-72 and the T-80, and the T-64s were gradually put in reserve storage or scrapped.

In June 1992, 18 former Soviet T-64BV tanks from the Odesa Military District&#x27;s 59th Guards Motor Rifle Division were taken over by the Transnistrian Army, fighting in the Transnistria War. Two T-64s were disabled by Moldovan Ground Forces troops near Bender during Transnistrian counterattacks, one of which was knocked out by an MT-12 100mm anti-tank gun. These actions were the first combat use of the tank.

==== Ukraine ====
Ukraine deployed its T-64s during the initial outbreak of the war in Donbas. About 300 Ukrainian T-64s were reported lost to enemy action in 2014. At least 20 were abandoned during disorderly withdrawals and subsequently captured by pro-Russian separatists of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic. In June 2014, Russia began reactivating T-64s from its reserve stocks and donating them to the separatists as well. Donating surplus T-64s to the separatists was seen as cost-effective and deniable because the Russian military no longer had any use for the tanks and they could be passed off as individual examples captured from the Ukrainian Army. US intelligence officials noted that &quot;Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces...[but] we are confident that these tanks came from Russia.&quot; Separatist T-64s donated by Russia could be distinguished by their lack of Ukrainian markings and upgrades. By early 2022, the separatist armies collectively operated a little over 100 T-64s of various marks and configurations.
There were around 40 T-64BVs stationed in Crimea in February 2014. Russia initially seized these tanks following its annexation of the peninsula, although they were returned to the Ukrainian government in June. 

T-64s are used by both Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Amidst the early phases of the invasion, Russian forces captured some Ukrainian T-64s, which they passed on to the separatists. By the end of 2022, the Ukrainian Army had lost 276 T-64s either captured or destroyed. Pro-Russian forces had also lost 50 T-64s in 2022. As of January 5th 2025, Ukraine has lost 516 T-64s of various variants, with Pro-Russian losses standing at 98.

The crews of T-64s have been called upon to act as artillery leading to shortages in 125 mm ammunition. Crews of the T-64 tanks rely on attack helicopters and drones; after firing at a target they move positions and fire again. If the Russian forces send infantry directly onto the battle field then the T-64 crews are required to directly support the infantry. On 21 December 2022 the Biden administration announced an aid package with an extra 100,000 rounds of 125 mm tank ammunition for the first time.

==== Other foreign service ====
Five T-64s were delivered to UNITA forces during the Angolan Civil War. The origin of these tanks is not clear, but some of them were also captured by MPLA forces. According to video evidence, at least one was destroyed in combat.

The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo received 25 T-64B1M from late 2016. They were seen in mid-2017 patrolling in Kasaï during the Kamwina Nsapu rebellion.

== Capabilities and limitations ==
A rather unconventional design, the T-64 had several features which set it apart not only from previous tanks, but from the visually similar T-72, many related to its higher mechanical complexity:

=== Firepower ===
* The T-64&#x27;s hydraulic &quot;Basket&quot; autoloader places the projectiles horizontally at the bottom of the turret facing towards the centre, and the propellant charges vertically along the outer rim of the turret race, front-down. By contrast, the T-72&#x27;s &quot;Cazette&quot; mechanism places the propellant charge on top of the corresponding projectile, also horizontally.
** Being hydraulic, the Basket-type created a risk of hydraulic fluid fire if damaged in combat. The Cazette, by contrast, is electric.
** Basket-type folds the projectile cradle upwards off the floor and vertically against the projectile cradle to which it is hinged, moving both pieces into the upper turret. Approaching the gun, the projectile cradle is moved forwards, unfolding both cradles and ammunition pieces to a straight line, ready for insertion. The Cazette&#x27;s cradles are fixed, stacked propellant on top of projectile, and the two-cradle assembly must raise the propellant part above the gun to load the projectile first, then drawing back the mechanical pusher, lowering the propellant part, and inserting it with a second use of the pusher. This increases the time of loading of the T-72 by approximately one second. Total loading time is thus ~6-13s for T-64/80 against ~7–15 of T-72.
** Because of greater diameter, Basket-type holds projectile and propellant parts for 6 additional shots over the Cazette of T-72 (28 vs 22).
** Because of greater diameter of projectile cradle ring of the Basket-type, T-64 and later T-80 have a higher limit to the maximum length of armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) projectiles, providing superior anti-armour performance relative to shorter projectiles used by T-72.
** The automatic loader of T-64 is more reliable, and less sensitive to jolting when running off-road. It also has a &quot;sequence&quot; fire mode that feeds the gun with shells of the same type in less than five seconds. In the modern versions it is also able to turn backwards to keep a good speed at the end of the loading sequence
** Early versions of the basket autoloader lacked safety features and were dangerous to the tank crews (especially the gunner, who sits nearby): Limbs could be easily caught in the machinery rotating around the crew, leading to injuries and deaths. A sleeve unknowingly snagged on one of the autoloader&#x27;s moving parts could also drag a crewman into the apparatus upon firing.
* The tank commander&#x27;s cupola provides good vision, the antiaircraft machine gun can be operated from inside the turret; the commander can also control the main gun sight if necessary
* The turret was poorly configured to allow the crew to manually load the gun should the autoloader break. In such situations, rate of fire usually slowed to one round per minute as the gunner works around the broken machine to load the gun.
* Although two-piece ammunition allows for fast reloading of the gun in combat, replenishing the autoloader is slow.

=== Movement ===
* Because of a lower weight than T-72 (by ~3 tonnes), T-64 has slightly superior strategic and operational mobility (less wear and tear on tank transportation equipment, and lower fuel consumption per distance traveled.
* Driving seems much less exhausting for the crew, thanks to assisted controls and a more flexible suspension.
*The suspension system featured an entirely new and advanced design, and suffered various failures of unusually high frequency. Due to these problems, teams of civilian mechanics from the T-64 factories were &quot;semi-permanent residents&quot; of Soviet tank units early in the T-64&#x27;s initial adoption phase.
* The 5TDF opposed-piston engine, while powerful and compact, was very finicky and prone to malfunctions and fires. Russian expert Viktor Murakhovsky, then a battalion commander in Group of Soviet Forces in Germany reflected that in his unit the rate of the engines requiring a major overhaul was close to one per tank in a year. He also noted the difficulty of starting this engine, especially in the damp German winters, and that starting aids used by soldiers, like the high-pressure air and/or oil injection, often caused engine fires.

=== Protection ===
* Basket-type autoloader stores, as stated previously, propellant charges vertically, the rear ends almost the same height as the roof of the hull. Combined with greater diameter of the complete autoloader assembly, the overall greater size of this type compared to the cazette significantly increases chance of ammunition being ignited by direct hit of any weapon penetrating into the crew compartment. The problem is largely irrelevant if a full ammunition load outside autoloader is carried, but T-72 carrying only autoloader ammunition is far more survivable than a T-64 in a similar situation thanks to the compact dimensions of Cazette-type ammunition storage.
*Small and lightly constructed roadwheels of T-64 have been found to be less resistant to antitank mines than the larger roadwheels of T-72 and previous Soviet medium tanks.
*Because of the small-diameter roadwheels and vertical placement of propellant charges in the autoloader, charges are dangerously exposed against hits penetrating the 85mm hull side armour, and are located at such height that they are too high to be protected by the roadwheels, yet too low to be fully protected by the sideskirt armour panels.
*While many previous tanks used 4 or 5-man crews, T-64 and T-72 have crews of three men. This allows the fourth man to remain in relative safety away from combat and perform other duties until the tank returns for maintenance and resupply. Potentially, he and other would-be loaders can be reassigned to vehicle maintenance and resupply duty to assist the crews of other returning tanks, improving the quality of maintenance as the crew inside the tanks will likely be exhausted after several hours of operation. 
*Because of smaller physical characteristics thanks to the 3-men +autoloader design, T-64 and T-72 have a lower theoretical logistical footprint than tanks of equal number using a human loader. This decreases the chance of the logistics chain being detected and attacked, and decreases potential losses.
*Counter to the benefit of leaving the fourth crew man in favour of using an automatic loader, this also creates difficulties in immediately replacing an injured crewman while in combat. In comparison with 4-man tanks, there exists a possibility of an injured crewman being dragged from his seat and into the loader&#x27;s space for immediate treatment of injury while the tank retreats. In more cramped 3-man designs such empty space is not immediately available and moving between the turret and hull may be more difficult in the first place. There is also an argument that a fourth crewman can replace any other of the three in case of injury, however, this possibility can also exist in 3-man designs if redundancy of weapon controls allows for temporary 1-man operation of turret.
*Because of weight limitations of the powertrain, T-64 had lower overall capacity for improvements which add weight to the tank. Because improvements of armour tend to have a greater cost in weight than, say, replacement of gun optics and turret/gun laying drives with more precise versions, this means T-64 suffers greater limitations in terms of protection improvement than the heavier T-72, which was designed with a more durable powertrain from the start.

=== Concerns of 3-man and 4-man crew maintenance ===
While having smaller tank crews (three vs. the usual four) is advantageous since more tanks can theoretically be fielded using the same number of soldiers, there are also serious downsides. Tanks require frequent maintenance and refueling, and much of this is physically demanding work that several people must work together to accomplish. Most of the time, these duties are also performed at the end of a long day of operations, when everyone in the tank is exhausted. Having one less crewman for these tasks increases the strain on the remaining three men and increases the frequency of botched or skipped maintenance. This problem worsens if the tank&#x27;s commander is also an officer who must often perform other duties such as higher-level meetings, leaving only two men to attend to the tank. All of this means that tanks with three-man crews are more likely to suffer from performance-degrading human exhaustion, and mechanical failures that take longer to fix and that keep the tank from reaching the battlefield. These problems are exacerbated during prolonged time periods of operations.

<doc id="196233" wikidata="Q130219264" url="?curid=196233" title="Bullshit Detector">
<text>Bullshit Detector was the name of a series of compilation LPs put together by the anarcho-punk band (and art collective) Crass and released on their Crass Records label. Three editions were released between 1980 and 1984, consisting of demo tapes, rough recordings and artwork that had been sent to the band. The sound quality of the &quot;Bullshit Detector&quot; series was mixed, and was often very basic or poor as Crass would master the tapes directly to record without any additional production or enhancement. For Crass, the expectation of a polished performance was missing the point of the DIY punk ethic:

: &quot;Don&#x27;t expect music when the melody is anger, when the message sings defiance, three chords are frustration when the words are from the heart&quot;

– Sleeve notes from &quot;Bullshit Detector Volume 3&quot;

The title &quot;Bullshit Detector&quot; was derived as a reference to the Clash song &quot;Garageland&quot; from their first LP &quot;The Clash&quot;, a song covered by Chumbawamba guitarist Boffo on the second volume.

The series is notable for marking the first appearance on vinyl of both Chumbawamba (on the second volume) and Napalm Death (on the third).
The POWER sleeve with marker pen art was designed by Haggis, AKA David Hargreaves lead singer of Youthanasia PX.

A fourth, unofficial &quot;Bullshit Detector&quot;, this time an international compilation, was released by the Swiss independent anarcho-punk record label Resistance Productions in 1994.
There have also been records released in a similar style and with similar sentiment such as the &#x27;Bullsheep Detector&#x27; compilation of Welsh punk bands released in 2012.

<text>USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; (BB-55) is the lead ship of the of fast battleships, the first vessel of the type built for the United States Navy. Built under the Washington Treaty system, &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s design was limited in displacement and armament, though the United States used a clause in the Second London Naval Treaty to increase the main battery from the original armament of twelve guns in quadruple turrets to nine guns in triple turrets. The ship was laid down in 1937 and completed in April 1941, while the United States was still neutral during World War II.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, &quot;North Carolina&quot; mobilized for war and was initially sent to counter a possible sortie by the German battleship , though this did not materialize and &quot;North Carolina&quot; was promptly transferred to the Pacific to strengthen Allied forces during the Guadalcanal campaign. There, she screened aircraft carriers engaged in the campaign and took part in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24–25 August 1942, where she shot down several Japanese aircraft. The next month, she was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine but was not seriously damaged. After repairs, she returned to the campaign and continued to screen carriers during the campaigns across the central Pacific in 1943 and 1944, including the Gilberts and Marshall Islands and the Mariana and Palau Islands, where she saw action during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

The ship was undergoing a refit during the invasion of the Philippines but took part in the later stages of the Philippines campaign and was present when the fleet was damaged by Typhoon Cobra. She took part in offensive operations in support of the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945, including numerous attacks on Japan. Following the surrender of Japan in August, she carried American personnel home during Operation Magic Carpet. &quot;North Carolina&quot; operated briefly off the east coast of the United States in 1946 before being decommissioned the next year and placed in reserve. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1960, the ship was saved from the breaker&#x27;s yard by a campaign to preserve the vessel as a museum ship in her namesake state. In 1962, the &quot;North Carolina&quot; museum was opened in Wilmington, North Carolina.

==Design==


The &quot;North Carolina&quot; class was the first new battleship design built under the Washington Naval Treaty system; her design was bound by the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which added a restriction on her main battery of guns that they be no larger than . The General Board evaluated a number of designs ranging from traditional battleships akin to the &quot;standard&quot; series or fast battleships, and ultimately a fast battleship armed with twelve 14-inch guns was selected. After the ships were authorized, however, the United States invoked the escalator clause in the treaty that permitted an increase to guns in the event that any member nation refused to sign the treaty, which Japan refused to do.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; is long overall and has a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried three Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her peace time crew numbered 1,800 officers and enlisted men, but during the war the crew swelled to 99 officers and 2,035 enlisted.

The ship is armed with a main battery of nine 16 in /45 caliber Mark 6 guns in a trio of three-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The secondary battery consisted of twenty /38 caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on either side. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of sixteen guns and eighteen .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, but her anti-aircraft battery was expanded greatly during her career.

The main armored belt is thick, while the main armored deck is up to thick. The main battery gun turrets have thick faces, and they were mounted atop barbettes that were protected with the same thickness of steel. The conning tower had thick sides. The ship&#x27;s armor layout was designed with opponents equipped with 14-inch guns in mind, but since the treaty system broke down just before construction began, her design could not be revised to improve the scale of protection to defend against heavier guns. Despite this shortcoming, the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class proved to be more successful battleships than the better-armored but very cramped .

===Modifications===
&quot;North Carolina&quot; received a number of upgrades over the course of her career, primarily consisting of radar and improved anti-aircraft batteries. By November 1942, the ship had received three Mark 3 fire-control radar sets for the main battery, four Mark 4 radars for the secondary guns, a CXAM air-search radar, and an SG surface-search radar. During her early 1944 refit, she received an SK air-search radar in place of the CXAM and a second SG radar; her Mark 3 radars were replaced with more advanced Mark 8 sets, though she retained one of the Mark 3s as a backup. In September, the SK radar was replaced with an SK-2 set, and her Mark 4 radars were replaced with a combination of Mark 12 and Mark 22 sets. After the war, she received a secondary SR air search radar and an SCR-720 search radar.

During her refit in late 1942, &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s anti-aircraft battery was replaced with forty Bofors guns in ten quadruple mounts, forty-six Oerlikon autocannon in single mounts. By June 1943, her anti-aircraft armament had been increased with four more 40 mm quadruple mounts, and in November, a fifteenth mount was added atop the rear main battery turret. Two more 20 mm cannon were added by late 1944, and another eight were installed in April 1945. By the end of the war in August, her 20 mm battery had been reduced to eight twin mounts and twenty single mounts.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;North Carolina&quot; was laid down at the New York Naval Shipyard on 27 October 1937. Her completed hull was launched on 13 June 1940 and the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 9 April 1941 in a ceremony attended by Governor of North Carolina J. Melville Broughton. The ship&#x27;s first commanding officer was Captain Olaf M. Hustvedt. &quot;North Carolina&quot; embarked on her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea and spent the rest of the year working up while the United States remained neutral during World War II. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December, &quot;North Carolina&quot; began extensive battle training to prepare for combat in the Pacific War.

Her first operation came in April 1942, when she was deployed to Naval Station Argentia on 23 April as part of a force intended to block a potential sortie by the German battleship if she attempted to break out into the convoy lanes of the North Atlantic. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; remained in Norway, however, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; was quickly replaced by the battleship , allowing &quot;North Carolina&quot; to get underway for the Pacific in mid-1942. She passed through the Panama Canal on 10 June in company with the aircraft carriers and and nine destroyers. On 15 June, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was assigned to Task Force (TF) 18, centered on &quot;Wasp&quot;, along with four cruisers and nine destroyers, under the command of Rear Admiral Leigh Noyes.

===Guadalcanal campaign===
&quot;North Carolina&quot; was sent to join the Guadalcanal campaign as part of TF 16, which also included the aircraft carrier , the heavy cruiser , the light cruiser , and six destroyers. The unit was part of TF 61, commanded by Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher, and sent to cover the landing of the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal to seize the airfield being constructed there by the Japanese. TF 61 also included the carriers and &quot;Wasp&quot;. &quot;North Carolina&quot; covered &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the first day of the invasion of Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August, and thereafter remained in company with &quot;Enterprise&quot; to protect the carrier from Japanese air attacks. Fear of Japanese land-based torpedo bombers prompted Fletcher to withdraw the carrier groups the next day. The initial landing met little resistance, but a Japanese cruiser squadron attacked the invasion fleet on the night of 9 August, inflicting a major defeat on Allied naval forces in the Battle of Savo Island. The Navy briefly considered forming a surface combat force to counter the Japanese cruisers that would have been centered on &quot;North Carolina&quot;, with five heavy and one light cruiser and four destroyers, but it was determined that the need to protect the carrier task forces was too great to strip away their heavy units.

In this role, she participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24–25 August. American forces had detected a group of Japanese carriers on the 24th and immediately launched attacks from &quot;Saratoga&quot; that sank the light carrier . A Japanese counterattack struck the American fleet, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; was the first to detect it, shortly after 16:00, using her air-search radar. The Japanese initially concentrated on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; contributed her anti-aircraft fire to her defense. &quot;Enterprise&quot; increased speed to , causing &quot;North Carolina&quot; to drop back, ultimately falling to around astern. A group of seven Aichi D3A dive bombers attacked &quot;North Carolina&quot; at 16:43 but they all missed. &quot;North Carolina&quot; emerged from the battle unscathed, though one man was killed by a strafing aircraft. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was hit by three bombs but aircraft from &quot;Saratoga&quot; severely damaged the seaplane tender in return.

&quot;North Carolina&quot;″s anti-aircraft claimed to have shot down between 7 and 14 aircraft, though evaluation of the gunners&#x27; effectiveness is mixed. The historian Richard B. Frank noted that the Japanese lost a total of eighteen D3As and credited &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters with half of them, with the rest shot down by the ships, &quot;with the lion&#x27;s share to gunners aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The naval analyst Norman Friedman highlighted the effectiveness of the 5-inch guns aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot;, but noted that the ship had difficulty tracking targets with her fire control radar, owing to a combination of rapid maneuvering to avoid attacks, excessive vibration from steaming at high speed, and the number of friendly and hostile aircraft aloft. Contemporary observers took an optimistic view of the ship&#x27;s performance; her captain credited her with shooting down five to seven aircraft, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, noted that her 5-inch fire was particularly effective in dissuading Japanese attacks.

While &quot;Enterprise&quot; withdrew for repairs, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was transferred to TF 17 to cover &quot;Saratoga&quot;, along with &quot;Atlanta&quot; and a pair of destroyers. The ships operated off Guadalcanal for the next several weeks, during which time Japanese submarines attempted to torpedo &quot;North Carolina&quot; twice. The first, on 6 September, passed some off her port side, but the second, from the submarine on 15 September, damaged the ship. &quot;I-19&quot; had fired a spread of six torpedoes at &quot;Wasp&quot; in TF 18, two or three of which hit. Two of the Type 95 torpedoes continued on to the ships of TF 17, some away. One hit the destroyer , and a fourth hit &quot;North Carolina&quot;. The hit on &quot;North Carolina&quot; struck the ship below the waterline on her port side and tore a hole in the plating. Five men were killed in the attack, but the torpedo inflicted little serious damage, apart from the shock of the blast that disabled the forward turret. Flooding occurred and &quot;North Carolina&quot; took on a list of 5.5 degrees to port, but this was quickly corrected with counter-flooding and she was able to remain on station with &quot;Saratoga&quot;, cruising at a speed of . The other two ships were not so lucky, with &quot;Wasp&quot; being scuttled that evening and &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; eventually foundering a month later when her hull finally buckled from the damage. After withdrawing from the area, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was detached to Pearl Harbor to make repairs, which lasted from 30 September to 17 November.

After returning to the South Pacific, &quot;North Carolina&quot; resumed screening &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which had also completed repairs by this time. The American fleet had been strengthened by &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s sister ship , which served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Willis Lee. The two battleships were grouped together as TF 64 under Lee&#x27;s command. The ships covered convoys carrying soldiers and supplies to the Solomon Islands for the rest of 1942 and into 1943 as the Guadalcanal campaign ground on. These operations included covering a group of seven transports carrying elements of the 25th Infantry Division to Guadalcanal from 1 to 4 January 1943. During another of these convoy operations later that month, the battleships, which by this time had been reinforced by the battleship , were too far south to be able to reach the American cruiser force during the Battle of Rennell Island at the end of the month.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in March for a refit that lasted for more than a month and included the installation of radars and improved fire control equipment. On returning to the South Pacific, she joined the battleship group of TF 36, now commanded by Rear Admiral Glenn B. Davis and consisting of &quot;Indiana&quot; and . The battleship and carrier groups covered amphibious assault forces during Operation Cartwheel, the campaign to isolate the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, in late June and early July. They did not see action during the campaign, as fighting was limited to both sides&#x27; light forces. In September, she made another trip to Pearl Harbor to make preparations for the attack on the Gilbert Islands.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign===

For the assault on the Gilberts, the fleet was organized into TF 50, which was divided into several task groups (TG). The ship sortied on 10 November, once again in company with &quot;Enterprise&quot; as part of TG 50.2 to support the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, which began with assaults on Makin, Tarawa, and Abemama. The group also included &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Indiana&quot; and a pair of light carriers and six destroyers. &quot;North Carolina&quot; covered the carriers while they raided the islands beginning on 19 November. On 8 December, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was detached to form TG 50.8 with the other battleships of the fleet—&quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and &quot;Washington&quot;—again under Lee&#x27;s command. The ships bombarded the island of Nauru while the fleet prepared for the next operation in the campaign in the Marshalls. &quot;North Carolina&quot; then escorted the carrier during a series of strikes on Kavieng on the island of New Ireland in late December.

On 6 January 1944, TF 58, the fast carrier task force, was created under the command of Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher; &quot;North Carolina&quot; continued in her role as an escort for the fleet&#x27;s carriers with the unit as part of TG 58.2. During the Battle of Kwajalein, &quot;North Carolina&quot; initially remained with the carriers during the pre-invasion bombardment, but was then detached to close with the island and join the bombardment group targeting Roi-Namur, which also included &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;. During the attack, she sank a cargo ship in the harbor. After the islands were conquered in four days of heavy fighting, TF 58 departed to raid Truk, which had been Japan&#x27;s primary staging area in the central Pacific. By this time, &quot;North Carolina&quot; had been transferred to TG 58.3. The attack, codenamed Operation Hailstone, inflicted serious damage, sinking or destroying 39 ships, destroying 211 aircraft and damaging another 104 planes.

With the Marshalls and Gilberts secured, the fast carrier task force embarked on a series of raids in the central Pacific to prepare for the upcoming attack on the Mariana Islands. The fleet sortied from Majuro, its new base in the Marshalls, in late March to begin the first attack on Palau and Woleai, conducted from 31 March to 1 April. During these operations, &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down a Japanese aircraft. The fleet then sailed south to support the US Army&#x27;s landing at Hollandia during the New Guinea campaign from 13 to 24 April. Another attack on Truk followed on 29–30 April; &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down another Japanese aircraft during the attack. Two of her Kingfisher floatplanes were sent to rescue a downed pilot who had crashed off the reef; one of them capsized on landing and the second was unable to take off with the additional weight from the first plane&#x27;s crew and the pilot they had gone to pick up, so the submarine picked up the men instead. On 1 May, &quot;North Carolina&quot; and six other battleships organized as TG 58.7 bombarded Pohnpei, destroying Japanese artillery batteries, anti-aircraft guns, and damaging the airfield on the island. TF 58 then returned to its bases in Majuro and Eniwetok on 4 May; from there, &quot;North Carolina&quot; departed to Pearl Harbor for repairs to her rudder.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===

After completing repairs, &quot;North Carolina&quot; rejoined the fleet at Majuro while it was preparing for the attack on the Marianas. On arriving, she returned to TG 58.7, which was distributed between the four carrier task groups. She and the rest of TF 58 sortied on 6 June to launch the first assault in the campaign, targeting the island of Saipan. In addition to screening the carriers, &quot;North Carolina&quot; also bombarded the island to cover the minesweepers as they cleared paths to the invasion beach. She shelled Tanapag Harbor, sank several small vessels, and destroyed several supply dumps. On 15 June, the marines went ashore and a Japanese counterattack struck the fleet, though all but two of the aircraft were shot down by the carriers&#x27; combat air patrol; of those two, &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot one down. The landing was a breach of Japan&#x27;s inner defensive perimeter that triggered the Japanese fleet to launch a major counter-thrust with the 1st Mobile Fleet, the main carrier strike force.

As the Japanese fleet approached, &quot;North Carolina&quot; and the rest of TF 58 steamed to meet it on 18 June, leading to the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June. &quot;North Carolina&quot; and the other battleships, with four cruisers and thirteen destroyers, were deployed some west of the carrier groups to screen the likely path of approach. The Japanese launched their aircraft first, and as they probed the American fleet&#x27;s defenses, &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; were the first battleships to open fire on the attacking Japanese aircraft. During the action, which was fought primarily by the carriers, the US fleet inflicted serious losses on the Japanese, destroying hundreds of their aircraft and sinking three carriers. In the course of the battle, &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down two Japanese aircraft. &quot;North Carolina&quot; remained on station off the Marianas for the next two weeks before being detached for an overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.

===Later operations===

Repairs lasted through October, keeping &quot;North Carolina&quot; from participating in much of the Philippines campaign, and she rejoined the fleet at its new forward base at Ulithi on 7 November. There, she joined TG 38.3, the fast carrier task force having passed from Fifth Fleet to Third Fleet command and accordingly being renumbered from 50-series to 30-series designations. The carriers then embarked on a series of strikes on Japanese positions on Leyte, Luzon, and the Visayas to support Army operations ashore. During these operations, &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down a kamikaze suicide aircraft. The attacks continued into mid-December and intensified during the invasion of Mindoro on 15 December. Three days later, the fleet was cruising off the Philippines when it was hit by Typhoon Cobra. &quot;North Carolina&quot; was not seriously damaged, but three destroyers were sunk in the storm.

After returning to Ulithi, the fast carrier task force began a series of strikes on targets on Formosa, the coast of French Indochina, occupied China, and the Ryukyu Islands in January 1945. &quot;North Carolina&quot; remained in TG 38.3 for the operation, and her carrier group struck northern Formosa on 3–4 January, but poor weather hampered flight operations. Further attacks struck targets on Luzon on 6 and 7 January to destroy reserves of kamikazes there. On 10 January, the carrier groups entered the South China Sea to strike targets in French Indochina on the assumption that significant Japanese naval forces were present, but only merchant ships and a number of minor warships were caught and sunk there. During these raids, other elements of the Allied fleet invaded Lingayen Gulf on Luzon.

In February, she escorted carriers during attacks on the Japanese island of Honshu to disrupt Japanese air forces that might interfere with the planned invasion of Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands. Fifth Fleet had re-assumed command of the fast carrier task force by this point, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; was now part of TG 58.4. The fleet sortied from Ulithi on 10 February, and after conducting training exercises off Tinian on the 12th, refueled at sea on 14 February and continued on north to launch strikes on the Tokyo area two days later. The raids continued through 17 February and the next day, the fleet withdrew to refuel and TG 58.4 was sent to hit other islands in the Bonin chain to further isolate Iwo Jima. During the preparatory bombardment for that attack, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, and the heavy cruiser were detached from the task group to reinforce TF 54, the assault force for the invasion; she remained on station during the marine assault and provided fire support as they fought their way across the island through 22 February. The next day, the carrier groups reassembled and refueled on 24 February for further operations against the Japanese mainland.

After leaving Iwo Jima, the fleet resumed air attacks on the Home Islands to prepare for the next amphibious assault on Okinawa in the Ryukyus. The first of these, on 25 and 26 February, hit targets in the Tokyo area, followed by another attack on Iwo Jima the next day. The fleet refueled on 28 February and on 1 March raided Okinawa, thereafter returning to Ulithi on 4 March. While in Ulithi, the fleet was reorganized and &quot;North Carolina&quot; was transferred to TG 58.3. The fleet sortied on 14 March for additional attacks on Japan; the ships refueled on 16 March on the way and they launched their aircraft two days later to hit targets on Kyushu. The attacks continued into the next day, causing significant damage to Japanese facilities on the island and sinking or damaging numerous warships. The task groups withdrew to refuel and reorganize on 22 March, as several carriers had been damaged by kamikaze and air attacks. The carriers and were badly damaged by bombs, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; was assigned to the group of ships tasked with escorting them back to Ulithi for repairs.

Carrier raids on the Home Islands and the Ryukyus continued after the landing on Okinawa on 1 April. When &quot;North Carolina&quot; returned to the fleet, she was assigned to TG 58.2. Five days later, &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down three kamikazes. In the furious anti-aircraft barrage, another ship accidentally hit &quot;North Carolina&quot; with a 5-inch shell, killing three and wounding forty-four. On 7 April, the Japanese launched a major air–naval counterattack on the landing centered on the battleship , which was largely defeated by the carriers, though &quot;North Carolina&quot; shot down one Japanese bomber. Another major kamikaze attack struck the fleet on 11 April. She shot down two more on 17 April, and two days later she was sent to support infantry attacks on Okinawa before departing for another overhaul at Pearl Harbor.

&quot;North Carolina&quot; returned to the fleet in Leyte Gulf in late June before it embarked on another series of attacks on Japan on 1 July. By this time, the fast carrier task force had been transferred to Third Fleet, so the battleship joined TG 38.3. The air attacks began on 10 July, with over a thousand aircraft hitting airfields around Tokyo. The strikes continued for more than a week, until a typhoon approached and forced the fleet to withdraw to avoid it on 19 July. During these operations, one of her Kingfishers picked up a downed pilot in Tokyo Bay under heavy fire. Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August, &quot;North Carolina&quot; contributed men for the initial occupation force and entered Sagami Bay on 27 August with the rest of the fleet. She thereafter patrolled the coast until 5 September, when she steamed into Tokyo Bay to reembark the men. The next day, she was assigned to TF 11 along with the three s, a pair of light carriers, and a squadron of destroyers to return to the United States. From there, she sailed south to Okinawa to take on men bound for home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The ship suffered a total of 10 crew dead and 67 wounded during her wartime service. The ship received fifteen battle stars during her wartime service. The most of any battleship in the US Fleet.

She transited the Panama Canal on 8 October and arrived in Boston on 17 October. There she underwent an overhaul in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and thereafter conducted training operations off the east coast, including a training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in the Caribbean in mid-1946. &quot;North Carolina&quot; was the only American treaty battleship to see any significant service after the end of the war.

===Decommissioning ===

The ship was decommissioned on 27 June 1947 in New York and placed in reserve. While she was out of service, the Navy considered several plans to modernize or convert the ship for other purposes. The first series of studies in 1954 revolved around improving the ship&#x27;s speed to , which would require a significant reduction in displacement and a much more powerful propulsion system. The displacement issue could be solved by the removal of the rear turret, but there was not enough room in the hull to place a power plant necessary to reach the desired speed. The Navy also evaluated a proposal to convert &quot;North Carolina&quot; into a helicopter carrier; the plan would have involved removing all of her main and secondary guns (though the forward turret would be retained to keep the ship balanced properly) in exchange for a flight deck and facilities for twenty-eight helicopters and a battery of sixteen guns. The Navy ultimately decided that a new, purpose-built helicopter carrier would be cheaper and so the project was abandoned.

She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960, slated to be broken up for scrap. A North Carolina man, James Craig, founded a campaign to save the vessel modeled on the Battleship &quot;Texas&quot; Commission that had successfully acquired the old battleship for preservation as a museum ship. He convinced Governor Luther H. Hodges to ask the Navy to delay the scrapping of the ship, and then led a campaign to raise the $250,000 necessary to prepare a site to host the vessel, to tow her there, and work to prepare her for visitors. With the help of the WRAL TV station—which broadcast a &quot;Save Our Ship&quot; advertisement campaign—and numerous state newspapers, Craig was able to secure more than $330,000 for the project. Next were considerations of the site to be used; three cities were considered: Southport, Morehead City, and Wilmington. The latter was selected, since it was further inland and thus more protected from hurricanes.

==Memorial and museum ==

On 6 September 1961, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was transferred to the state. The ship was towed out of Bayonne, New Jersey, bound for Wilmington, by a group of nine tugboats on 25 September. At one point during the trip, on 2 October, the tugs lost control of the ship in the Cape Fear River and she collided with a floating seafood restaurant, though surprisingly causing only minor damage. After her berth – located across the Cape Fear River from downtown Wilmington, about from the river&#x27;s confluence with the Atlantic Ocean — was completed and repairs to the ship effected, she was formally opened on 29 April 1962 as a memorial to more than 11,000 North Carolinians who died while serving in the United States armed forces during World War II.

In 1964, a Kingfisher that had crashed in British Columbia, Canada, during the war and then subsequently been salvaged was donated to the museum.

In the early 1980s, when the Navy reactivated the four s, parts were cannibalized from &quot;North Carolina&quot; and the other preserved battleships, including &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, to restore the &quot;Iowa&quot;s to service. Engine room components that were no longer available in the Navy&#x27;s inventory accounted for most of the material removed from the ships. The battleship was declared a National Historic Landmark on 10 November 1982; the application noted that the ship was in almost excellent condition and remained in its wartime configuration.

Work to maintain the ship and improve the facility is an on-going effort. In 1998, the museum&#x27;s operators ran Operation Ship Shape, a donation drive to secure funds to make repairs to the vessel, including the ship&#x27;s teak deck, which was replaced with teak from Myanmar. Funds from the campaign were also allocated to repair the ship&#x27;s hull, which by the early 2000s had deteriorated significantly; in some places, corrosion had reduced the thickness of the hull plating from its original thickness to as thin as . After considering moving the ship to a drydock for the work, which would have been prohibitively expensive, the ship&#x27;s caretakers decided to use the same method used to refurbish the battleship : erect a cofferdam around the hull and pump it dry. In addition to replacing damaged hull plates, the hull also received a new coat of paint to better protect it from the elements. In 2018, a walkway was erected around the ship to allow visitors to view the ship from all sides, with funding provided by the SECU Foundation. The walkway sits atop the cofferdam necessary for the ship&#x27;s repairs. Repairs to the ship&#x27;s hull were completed in 2021.

As of the beginning of 2024, the memorial and museum is one of North Carolina&#x27;s most-visited tourist sites. In 2022, the museum had nearly 250,000 visitors and enjoyed the most financially successful year in its history.

During the early 21st century, flooding due to a climate change-related rise in sea level became an increasing problem at the museum site. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tidal gauge 0.5-mile (0.8 km) from the museum recorded a rise in sea level between its installation in 1935 and 2023, and the museum&#x27;s leaders documented a 7,000 percent increase in flooding incidents between 1961 and 2023, with 20 flooding incidents at the site during 2011. After 2013, flooding problems accelerated dramatically: In 2020, the site experienced flooding during about half of the year, and flooding continued to accelerate after that, with 200 days of flooding during 2022. By the beginning of 2024, waters from the Cape Fear River routinely overtopped seawalls, flooding hundreds of spaces in the museum&#x27;s parking lot as well as sidewalks and grassy areas, killing oak trees on the property, and occasionally forcing the museum to close when its only access road became submerged.

To increase drainage, improve both water quality, and enhance safety of visitors, the museum&#x27;s leaders decided to embark on a US$4.1 million construction project – expected to last from January to September 2024 – which would allow the museum to accommodate the changing landscape rather than attempt to prevent the intrusion of water. Plans called for the removal of about of concrete and rock barriers and their replacement with a &quot;living shoreline&quot; of earthen berms and native vegetation that would reduce erosion and attract a variety of animals including shrimp and blue crabs; the removal of several acres of the parking lot prone to flooding and restoring the tidal creek and wetland that existed there before 1961, to hold back water and redirect it into the river; raising the remaining portion of the parking lot above the high tide level; and planting 100 trees and shrubs in the parking lot and 130,000 native marsh plants to filter storm water runoff and create a habitat for migratory and nesting birds. The project will be funded with nearly US$2 million from United States Government and North Carolina state grants, more than US$1 million from the North Carolina state budget, and funding from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

With sea level rise at the site expected to increase by about between 2024 and 2050, the 2024 construction project is expected to address drainage problems until sometime between 2039 and 2044, when additional measures may become necessary to address flooding. The 2024 project is designed to accommodate additional changes that probably will be required in the mid-21st century.

<text>Konstantin Hermann Karl Freiherr von Neurath (2 February 1873 – 14 August 1956) was a German diplomat and Nazi war criminal who served as Foreign Minister of Germany between 1932 and 1938.

Born to a Swabian noble family, Neurath began his diplomatic career in 1901. He fought in World War I and was awarded the Iron Cross for his service. After the war, Neurath served as minister to Denmark, ambassador to Italy and ambassador to Britain. In 1932, he was appointed Foreign Minister by Chancellor Franz von Papen, and he continued to hold the post under Adolf Hitler.

In the early years of the Nazi regime, Neurath was regarded as playing a key role in Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy pursuits in undermining the Treaty of Versailles and in territorial expansion in the prelude to World War II. However, he was often averse to Hitler&#x27;s aims for tactical, not necessarily ideological, reasons. That aversion eventually induced Hitler to replace Neurath in 1938 with the more compliant Joachim von Ribbentrop, a fervent Nazi. Neurath served as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia between 1939 and 1943, but his authority was only nominal after September 1941.

Neurath was tried as a war criminal at the Nuremberg trials and was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his compliance and actions in Nazi Germany. He received an early release in 1954 and then retired to his family estate, where he died two years later.

== Early life ==

Neurath was born at the manor of Kleinglattbach (since 1972 part of Vaihingen an der Enz) in Württemberg, the scion of a Swabian &quot;Freiherren&quot; noble family and political dynasty of the Kingdom of Württemberg. His grandfather, Constantin Franz von Neurath, had served as Foreign Minister under King Charles I of Württemberg (reigned 1864–1891), and his father, Konstantin Sebastian von Neurath (died 1912), had been a Free Conservative member of the German &quot;Reichstag&quot; and Chamberlain of King William II of Württemberg.

Neurath studied law in Tübingen and in Berlin. After graduating in 1897, he initially joined a local law firm in his home town. In 1901, he entered into civil service and worked for the Foreign Office in Berlin. In 1903, he was assigned to the German embassy in London, at first as Vice-Consul and from 1909 as &quot;Legationsrat&quot; (legation counsel). After the visit of the Prince of Wales to the Kingdom of Württemberg in 1904, as Lord Chamberlain to King William II, Neurath was created an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. Neurath&#x27;s career was decisively advanced by Secretary of State Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter. In 1914, he was sent to the embassy in Constantinople.

During World War I, he served as an officer with an infantry regiment until 1916, when he was badly wounded. In December 1914, he was awarded the Iron Cross. He returned to the German diplomatic service in the Ottoman Empire (1914–1916), where he wrote a memorandum on the German embassy&#x27;s official position regarding the Armenian genocide to German consulates in the Ottoman Empire. The memorandum justified the actions of the Ottoman government during the Armenian Genocide while also attempting to present the German government as protesting against the &quot;excesses&quot; of the genocide. In 1917, he temporarily quit the diplomatic service to succeed his uncle Julius von Soden as head of the royal Württemberg government.

On 30 May 1901, Neurath married Marie Auguste Moser von Filseck (1875–1960) in Stuttgart. His son, Konstantin, was born in 1902, followed by his daughter, Winifred, in 1904.

== Political career ==
In 1919, Neurath, with the approval by President Friedrich Ebert, returned to diplomacy and joined the embassy in Copenhagen as Minister to Denmark. From 1921 to 1930, he was the ambassador to Rome and was not overly impressed with Italian fascism. After the death of Chancellor Gustav Stresemann in 1929, Neurath was already considered for the post of Foreign Minister in the cabinet of Chancellor Hermann Müller by President Paul von Hindenburg, but his appointment failed because of the objections raised by the governing parties. In 1930, Neurath returned to head the embassy in London.

Neurath was recalled to Germany in 1932 and became &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of Foreign Affairs as an independent politician in the &quot;Cabinet of Barons&quot; under Chancellor Franz von Papen in June. He continued to hold that position under Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher in December and then under Adolf Hitler from the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; on 30 January 1933. During the early days of Hitler&#x27;s rule, Neurath lent an aura of respectability to Hitler&#x27;s expansionist foreign policy.

In May 1933, the American &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; reported, &quot;Baron von Neurath has shown such a remarkable capacity for submitting to what in normal times could only be considered as affronts and indignities on the part of the Nazis, that it is still quite a possibility that the latter should be content to have him remain as a figurehead for some time yet&quot;. He was involved in the German withdrawal from the League of Nations in 1933, the negotiations of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935) and the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. Neurath was also made a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. To mark the fourth anniversary of the regime on 30 January 1937, Hitler determined to enroll all the remaining non-Nazi ministers in the Nazi Party and to confer upon them personally the Golden Party Badge. By his acceptance, Neurath officially joined the Nazi Party (membership number 3,805,229). Additionally, in September 1937, he was given the honorary rank of a &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; in the SS, equivalent in the Wehrmacht rank to a &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;.

On 5 November 1937, the conference was held between the Reich&#x27;s top military-foreign policy leadership and Hitler, which was recorded in the so-called Hossbach Memorandum. At the conference, Hitler stated that it was the time for war or, more accurately, wars, as what Hitler envisioned were a series of localised wars in Central and Eastern Europe in the near future. Hitler argued that because the wars were necessary to provide Germany with &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, autarky and the arms race with France and Britain made it imperative to act before the Western powers developed an insurmountable lead in the arms race. He further declared that Germany must be ready for war as early as 1938 and at the latest by 1943.

Of those invited to the conference, objections arose from Neurath, War Minister &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Werner von Blomberg and Army Commander-in-Chief, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Werner von Fritsch. They all believed that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war with France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. They further believed that if a Franco-German war broke out, it would quickly escalate to a European war since Britain would almost certainly intervene, rather than risk the prospect of France&#x27;s defeat. Moreover, they contended that Hitler&#x27;s assumption was flawed that Britain and France would ignore the projected wars because they had started their rearmament later than Germany. The opposition expressed by Fritsch, Blomberg and Neurath was concerned entirely with the assessment that Germany could not start a war in the heart of Europe without Anglo-French involvement, and more time was needed to rearm. However, they did not express any moral opposition to aggression or disagreement with Hitler&#x27;s basic idea of annexing Austria or Czechoslovakia. That said, offering moral or humanitarian arguments to Hitler — just three years after the Night of the Long Knives — would have been futile if not dangerous.

In response to the reservations expressed at the conference, Hitler tightened his control of the military-foreign policy making apparatus by removing those who expressed reservations at the November conference: Blomberg, Fritsch and Neurath. On 4 February 1938, Neurath was sacked as Foreign Minister with Blomberg and Fritsch also losing their posts (the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair). Neurath felt his office was marginalized and opposed Hitler&#x27;s aggressive war plans because he felt that Germany needed more time to rearm, which were detailed in the Hossbach Memorandum of 5 November 1937. Neurath was succeeded by Joachim von Ribbentrop but remained in government as a minister without portfolio to allay the concerns that his removal would have caused internationally. Neurath was also named as president of the Secret Cabinet Council, a purported super-cabinet to advise Hitler on foreign affairs. On paper, it appeared that Neurath had been promoted. However, this body only existed on paper; Hermann Göring subsequently testified that it never met, &quot;not for a minute&quot;.

In March 1939, Neurath was appointed &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; of occupied Bohemia and Moravia, serving as Hitler&#x27;s personal representative in the protectorate. Hitler chose Neurath in part to pacify the international outrage over the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Soon after his arrival at Prague Castle, Neurath instituted harsh press censorship and banned political parties and trade unions. He ordered a harsh crackdown on protesting students in October and November 1939 (1,200 student protesters went to concentration camps and nine were executed). He also supervised the persecution of Czech Jews according to the Nuremberg Laws. Draconian as those measures were, Neurath&#x27;s rule overall was fairly mild by Nazi standards. Notably, he tried to restrain the excesses of his police chief, Karl Hermann Frank.

However, in September 1941, Hitler decided that Neurath&#x27;s rule was too lenient and so stripped him of his day-to-day powers. Reinhard Heydrich was named as his deputy but in truth held the real power. Heydrich was assassinated in 1942 and succeeded by Kurt Daluege. Neurath officially remained as &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot;. He tried to resign in 1941, but his resignation was not accepted until August 1943, when he was succeeded by the former Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick. On 21 June 1943, Neurath had been raised to the honorary rank of an &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot;, the equivalent to a three-star general.

Late in the war, Neurath had contacts with the German resistance.
==Trial and imprisonment==
The Allies prosecuted Neurath at the Nuremberg trials in 1946. Otto von Lüdinghausen appeared for his defence. The prosecution accused him of &quot;conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity&quot;. Neurath&#x27;s defence strategy was predicated on the fact that his successor and fellow defendant, Ribbentrop, was more culpable for the atrocities committed in the Nazi state than Neurath was.

The International Military Tribunal acknowledged that most of Neurath&#x27;s crimes against humanity were conducted during his short tenure as nominal Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, especially in quelling the Czech resistance, and in the summary execution of several university students. The tribunal came to the consensus that Neurath had been a willing and active participant in war crimes but held no such prominent position during the height of the Third Reich&#x27;s tyranny and so had been only a minor adherent to the atrocities committed. He was found guilty by the Allies on all four counts and was sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment.

Neurath was held as a war criminal in Spandau Prison until November 1954, when he was released in the wake of the Paris Conference, officially because of his ill health, as he had suffered a heart attack.

==Later life==
He retired to his family&#x27;s estates in Enzweihingen, where he died two years later, aged 83.

<doc id="196241" wikidata="Q1330194" url="?curid=196241" title="Tornado (sailboat)">
<text>The Tornado is a double handed multihull class recognised as an International Class by the International Sailing Federation. It was used for the Catamaran discipline at the Olympic Games from 1976 to 2008.

==Design==

The boat was designed in 1967 by Rodney March from the Isle of Sheppey, England. At the IYRU Olympic Catamaran Trials for international status, where it defeated other catamarans.

To increase its performance even further, the Tornado was modified in 2001, with a new sail plan which included a spinnaker and spinnaker boom, as well as an increased sail area of the existing sails. An additional trapeze was also added, and the jib was made self tacking.

The Tornado is among the fastest double handed catamarans, with an ISAF Small Catamaran Handicap Rating System rating of 0.934 and a D-PN of 59.0. It is the fastest catamaran in the RYA Portsmouth Yardstick scheme, with a 2015 Portsmouth Number of 634.

<doc id="196242" wikidata="Q790625" url="?curid=196242" title="Averroism">
<text>Averroism refers to a school of medieval philosophy based on the application of the works of 12th-century Andalusian philosopher Averroes, (known in his time in Arabic as ابن رشد, ibn Rushd, 1126–1198) a commentator on Aristotle, in 13th-century Latin Christian scholasticism.

Latin translations of Averroes&#x27; work became widely available at the universities which were springing up in Western Europe in the 13th century, and were received by scholasticists such as Siger of Brabant and Boetius of Dacia, who examined Christian doctrines through reasoning and intellectual analysis.

The term &quot;Averroist&quot; was coined by Thomas Aquinas in the restricted sense of the Averroists&#x27; &quot;unity of the intellect&quot; doctrine in his book &quot;De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas&quot;. Based on this, &quot;Averroism&quot; came to be near-synonymous with atheism in late medieval usage.

As a historiographical category, &quot;Averroism&quot; was first defined by Ernest Renan in &quot;Averroès et l&#x27;averroïsme&quot; (1852) in the sense of radical or heterodox Aristotelianism.

The reception of Averroes in Jewish thought has been termed &quot;Jewish Averroism&quot;. Jewish Averroist thought flourished in the later 14th century, and gradually declined in the course of the 15th century. The last representative of Jewish Averroism was Elia del Medigo, writing in 1485.

==Averroism and scholasticism==
The teachings of Averroism resulted in the Condemnations of 1210–1277 by Bishop Etienne Tempier of the Catholic Church. Tempier specified 219 unacceptable theses, some of which were clearly directed against the supposed &quot;Averroists&quot; at the University of Paris. It has been pointed out that Tempier&#x27;s main accusations are almost identical to those brought by al-Ghazali against philosophers in general in his &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, which Averroës had tried to demonstrate to be unjustified in &quot;The Incoherence of the Incoherence&quot;.

In his preamble to the 1277 condemnations, Tempier accuses the philosophers of maintaining philosophical stances irreconcilable with Catholic dogmas while at the same time upholding their Catholic faith. Modern historians called this the &quot;double truth&quot; theory, the idea of the existence of two simultaneous yet contradictory truths: a factual or &quot;hard&quot; truth that is reached through science and philosophy, and a &quot;religious&quot; truth that is reached through religion. This idea differed from that of Averroes: he taught that there is only one truth, but reached in two different ways, not two truths. He did however believe that Scripture sometimes uses metaphorical language, but that those without the philosophical training to appreciate the true meaning of the passages in question were obliged to believe the literal meaning.

Modern scholarship showed, however, that no Latin Christian medieval thinker ever upheld the &quot;double truth&quot; theory. Whether bishop Etienne Tempier accused them of doing so because of malice or ignorance remains unclear.
The later philosophical concept of Averroism was the idea that the philosophical and religious worlds are separate entities. However, upon scrutinizing the 219 theses condemned by Tempier, it was obvious that not many of them originated in Averroes. &quot;Radical Aristotelianism&quot; and &quot;heterodox Aristotelianism&quot; were the terms commonly used for a while to refer to the actual philosophical movement started by Siger of Brabant and Boetius of Dacia and differentiate it from Averroism; nowadays most scholars just call it Averroism as well.

Thomas Aquinas specifically attacked the &quot;unity of the intellect&quot; doctrine held by the Averroists in his book &quot;De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas&quot;.

Although condemned in 1277, many Averroistic theses survived to the sixteenth century, particularly in the University of Padua, and can be found in the philosophies of Giordano Bruno, Pico della Mirandola, and Cesare Cremonini. These theses talk about the superiority of philosophers to the common people and the relation between the intellect and human dignity.

==Jewish Averroism==
In the centuries following Averroes&#x27; death there were many Jewish Averroist philosophers, notably Elijah Delmedigo; Gersonides wrote a supercommentary on Averroes&#x27; Aristotelian commentaries. Some Averroist influence has been traced in Leone Ebreo&#x27;s &quot;Dialoghi d&#x27;Amore&quot;, and Baruch Spinoza was likely influenced by Averroes&#x27; commentaries on Aristotle.

==Reception of Averroes in Islam==
There was no formal school or movement of &quot;Rushdiyya&quot; (&quot;Averroism&quot;) in the Islamic tradition. The decline of Kalam or &quot;Islamic scholastic theology&quot; and Muʿtazila or &quot;Islamic rationalism&quot; has precluded a reception of Averroes in Islamic thought that would parallel that in Christian or Jewish philosophy. Nevertheless, a revival of rationalist traditions in medieval Islamic philosophy has been called for in modern Arab nationalism. Averroes became something of a symbolic figure in the debate over the decline and proposed revitalization of Islamic thought and Islamic society in the later 20th century. A notable proponent of such a revival of Averroist thought in Islamic society was Mohammed Abed al-Jabri with his &quot;Critique of Arab Reason&quot; (1982).

<doc id="196243" wikidata="Q297785" url="?curid=196243" title="Madame du Deffand">
<text>Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand (25 September 1696 – 23 September 1780) was a French hostess and patron of the arts.

==Life==
Madame du Deffand was born at the Château de Chamrond, in Ligny-en-Brionnais, a village near Charolles (&quot;département&quot; of Saône-et-Loire) of a noble family. Educated at a Benedictine convent in Paris, she showed great intelligence and a skeptical, cynical turn of mind. The abbess of the convent, alarmed at the freedom of her views, arranged for Jean Baptiste Massillon to visit and reason with her, but he accomplished nothing. At twenty-one years of age and without consulting her, her parents married her to her kinsman, Jean Baptiste de la Lande, marquis du Deffand. The marriage was an unhappy one and the couple separated in 1722.

Madame du Deffand is said by Horace Walpole (in a letter to Thomas Gray) to have been for a short time the mistress of the regent, the duke of Orléans. She appeared in her earlier days to be incapable of any strong attachment, but her intelligence, her cynicism, and her esprit made her the centre of attraction of a brilliant circle. In 1721 she began a friendship with Voltaire, but their regular correspondence dates only from 1736. She spent much time at Sceaux, at the court of the duchesse du Maine, where she contracted a close friendship with the president, Hénault. In Paris she attended the Club de l&#x27;Entresol and was the rival of Mme Geoffrin, but the members of her salon were drawn from aristocratic society more than from literary circles. There were exceptions: Voltaire, Montesquieu, Fontenelle, and Madame de Staal-Delaunay were among the habitués. When Hénault introduced D&#x27;Alembert, Madame du Deffand was captivated by him. She tolerated the encyclopaedists only for his sake.

In 1752 she retired from Paris, intending to remain in the country, but she was persuaded by her friends to return. She had taken up residence in 1747 in apartments in the Convent of Saint-Joseph in the rue Saint-Dominique, which had a separate entrance from the street. When she lost her sight in 1754, she engaged Mademoiselle de Lespinasse to help her in entertaining. This lady&#x27;s wit made some of the guests, including D&#x27;Alembert, prefer her society to that of Madame du Deffand, and Mademoiselle de Lespinasse received visitors for an hour before her patron appeared. When this was discovered, Mademoiselle de Lespinasse was dismissed (1764), and the salon broke up, for she took with her D&#x27;Alembert, Turgot, and the literary clique. From this time Madame du Deffand very rarely received any literary visitors. The principal friendships of her later years were with the duchesse de Choiseul and with Horace Walpole, the latter becoming the strongest and longest-lasting of all her attachments. In this period, she developed qualities of style and eloquence of which her earlier writings had given little promise. In the opinion of Sainte-Beuve the prose of her letters ranks with that of Voltaire as the best of that classical epoch, without excepting any even of the great writers.

Walpole refused at first to acknowledge the closeness of their intimacy from an exaggerated fear of the ridicule attaching to her age, but he paid several visits to Paris expressly for the purpose of enjoying her society, and maintained a close and most interesting correspondence with her for fifteen years. On her death, she left her dog, Tonton, to the care of Walpole, who also was entrusted with her papers. Of her innumerable witty sayings the best known is her remark on the cardinal de Polignac&#x27;s account of St Denis&#x27;s miraculous walk of two miles with his head in his hands--&quot;Il n&#x27;y a que le premier pas qui coûte&quot; &quot;(The distance doesn&#x27;t matter; it is only the first step that is the most difficult.)&quot;.

==Correspondence==
The &quot;&quot; of Madame du Deffand with D&#x27;Alembert, Hénault, Montesquieu, and others was published in Paris (2 vols.) in 1809. Letters of the marquise du Deffand to the Hon. Horace Walpole, afterwards earl of Orford, from the year 1766 to the year 1780 (4vols.), edited, with a biographical sketch, by Miss Mary Berry, were published in London from the originals at Strawberry Hill in 1810.

The standard edition of her letters is in the &quot;Yale Edition of Horace Walpole&#x27;s Correspondence&quot;, vols. 9–10, edited by Wilmarth S. Lewis. Other papers of Mme du Deffand obtained at the breaking up of Walpole&#x27;s collection are in private hands. Mme du Deffand returned many of Walpole&#x27;s letters at his request, and subsequently destroyed those she received from him. Those in his possession appear to have been destroyed after his death by Miss Berry, who printed fragments from them as footnotes to the edition of 1810. The correspondence between Walpole and Madame du Deffand thus remains one-sided, but seven of Walpole&#x27;s letters to her were printed for the first time in the edition (1903) of his correspondence by Mrs Paget Toynbee, who discovered a quantity of her unedited letters. See Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, vols. i. and xiv.; and the notice by Lescure in his edition of the correspondence.

<text>Siger of Brabant (&quot;Sigerus&quot;, &quot;Sighier&quot;, &quot;Sigieri&quot; or &quot;Sygerius de Brabantia&quot;; c. 1240 – before 10 November 1284) was a 13th-century philosopher from the southern Low Countries who was an important proponent of Averroism. 

== Life ==
===Early life===
Little is known about many of the details of his life. In 1266, he was attached to the Faculty of Arts in the University of Paris at the time when a riot erupted between the French and Picard &quot;nations&quot; of students—a series of loosely organized fraternities. The papal legate threatened Siger with execution as the ringleader of the Picard attack on the French, but no further action was taken.

=== Works ===
In the ten years following the riot, he wrote the six works which are ascribed to him and were published under his name by Pierre Mandonnet in 1899. The titles of these treatises are:

*&quot;De anima intellectiva&quot; (1270)
*&quot;Quaestiones logicales&quot;
*&quot;Quaestiones naturales&quot;
*&quot;De aeternitate mundi&quot;
*&quot;Quaestio utrum haec sit vera: Homo est animal nullo homine existente&quot;
*&quot;Impossibilia&quot;

=== Rectorship ===
In 1271, he was once more involved in a party struggle. The minority among the &quot;nations&quot; chose him as rector in opposition to the elected candidate, Aubri de Rheims. For three years the strife continued, and was probably based on the opposition between the Averroists, Siger and Pierre Dubois, and the more orthodox schoolmen. The matter was settled by the Papal Legate, Simon de Brion, afterwards Pope Martin IV. Siger retired from Paris to Liège.

=== Time in Liège ===
Siger was accused of teaching &quot;double truth&quot;—that is, saying one thing could be true through reason, and that the opposite could be true through faith. Because Siger was a scholastic, he probably did not teach double truths but tried to find reconciliations between faith and reason.

In 1277, a general condemnation of Aristotelianism included a special clause directed against Boetius of Dacia and Siger of Brabant. Again Siger and Bernier de Nivelles were summoned to appear on a charge of heresy, especially in connection with the &quot;Impossibilia&quot;, where the existence of God is discussed. It appears, however, that Siger and Boetius fled to Italy and, according to John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, then perished miserably.

== Death ==
The manner of Siger&#x27;s death, which occurred at Orvieto, is not known. A Brabantine chronicle says that he was stabbed by a seemingly-insane secretary (&quot;a clerico suo quasi dementi&quot;). The secretary is said to have used a pen as the murder weapon and his critics claimed since he had done so much damage with his pen, he deserved what was coming. Dante, in the &quot;Paradiso&quot; (x.134–6), says that he found &quot;death slow in coming,&quot; and some have concluded that this indicates death by suicide. A 13th-century sonnet by one Durante (xcii.9–14) says that he was executed at Orvieto: &quot;a ghiado il fe&#x27; morire a gran dolore, Nella corte di Roma ad Orbivieto.&quot; The date of this may have been 1283–1284 when Pope Martin IV was in residence at Orvieto. His fellow radicals were lying low in the face of the Condemnations of 1277 and there was no investigation into his murder.

In politics he held that good laws were better than good rulers, and criticised papal infallibility in temporal affairs. The importance of Siger in philosophy lies in his acceptance of Averroism in its entirety, which drew upon him the opposition of Albertus Magnus and Aquinas.

In December 1270, Averroism was condemned by ecclesiastical authority, and during his whole life Siger was exposed to persecution both from the Church and from purely philosophic opponents.

==Cultural references==
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, Siger of Brabant is found in the Fourth Sphere of Paradise for being a positive example of Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude.

<doc id="196251" wikidata="Q7872328" url="?curid=196251" title="USS North Carolina (1820)">
<text>USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; was a 74-gun ship of the line in the United States Navy. One of the &quot;nine ships to rate not less than 74 guns each&quot; authorized by Congress on 29 April 1816, she was laid down in 1818 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard, launched on 7 September 1820, and fitted out in the Norfolk Navy Yard. Master Commandant Charles W. Morgan was assigned to &quot;North Carolina&quot; as her first commanding officer on 24 June 1824.

While nominally a 74-gun ship, a popular size at the time, &quot;North Carolina&quot; was actually pierced (had gunports) for 102 guns, and probably originally mounted ninety-four 42-pounder (19 kg) and 32-pounder (15 kg) cannons. In 1845, she had fifty-six 42-pounders (19 kg), twenty-six 32-pounders (15 kg), and eight cannons, a total of ninety.

The &quot;North Carolina&quot; served in the Mediterranean as flagship for Commodore John Rodgers from 29 April 1825 to 18 May 1827. In the early days of the Republic, as today, a display of naval might brought a nation prestige and enhanced its commerce. This proved to be the case when Rodgers&#x27;s squadron laid the groundwork for the 1830 commercial treaty with Turkey, opening ports of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea to American traders.

After a period in ordinary at Norfolk, &quot;North Carolina&quot; decommissioned on 30 October 1836 to fit out for the Pacific Squadron, the one other area where ships of her vast size could be employed. Only the Mediterranean and the western coast of South America at that time offered ports which could accommodate ships of great draft. Again flagship of her station, flying the pennant of Commodore Henry E. Ballard, &quot;North Carolina&quot; reached Callao, Peru, on 26 May 1837. With the War of the Confederation raging between Chile and Peru, and relations between the United States and Mexico strained, &quot;North Carolina&quot; protected the important American commerce of the eastern Pacific until March 1839. Since her great size made her less flexible than smaller ships, she returned to the New York Navy Yard in June, and served as a receiving ship. During the American Civil War, African Nova Scotian sailor Benjamin Jackson was assigned to this ship before being transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The &quot;North Carolina&quot; was placed in ordinary in 1866. She was sold while at New York on 1 October 1867.

<doc id="196252" wikidata="Q981544" url="?curid=196252" title="Giovanni Battista Beccaria">
<text>Giovanni Battista Beccaria (; 3 October 1716 – 27 May 1781) was an Italian physicist. A fellow of the Royal Society, he published several papers on electrical subjects in the &quot;Phil. Trans.&quot; Beccaria was one of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s more conspicuous correspondents. His students included Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Giovanni Francesco Cigna, Giuseppe Angelo Saluzzo, and the successor to the Chair of physics, Antonio Vassalli Eandi; moreover, his researches inspired the physicists of Pavia, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani.

Beccaria did much, in the way both of experiment and exposition, to spread knowledge of the electrical researches of Benjamin Franklin and others. In 1753, he published an important treatise on electricity, &quot;Elettricismo artificiale e naturale libri due&quot;, which was translated into English thanks to Franklin&#x27;s interest. His contributions include a classification of luminous discharges, the collection of data on atmospheric electricity, and the design of the electrical thermometer, whose invention is usually wrongly ascribed to Franklin&#x27;s colleague, Ebenezer Kinnersley. Franklin noted in a letter to Cadwallader Colden that &quot;he (Beccaria) seems a Master of Method, and has reduc&#x27;d to systematic Order the scatter&#x27;d Experiments and Positions deliver&#x27;d in my Papers.&quot; Joseph Priestley (in his &quot;History and Present State of Electricity&quot;) declared Beccaria the &quot;great Italian genius&quot; who had &quot;far surpassed everything done by French and English electricians.&quot;

== Life and works ==
Giovanni Battista Beccaria was born at Mondovì in 1716. In 1732, at the age of sixteen, he entered the religious Order of the Pious Schools or Piarists, where he studied, and afterwards taught, grammar and rhetoric. At the same time, he applied himself with success to mathematics. He became professor of experimental physics, first at Palermo and then at Rome. His ability as an instructor being soon recognized, he was appointed by royal authority as professor of physics at the University of Turin (1748). He was afterwards made tutor to the young princes de Chablais and de Carignan, and continued to reside principally at Turin during the remainder of his life. Here he ardently devoted himself to research on atmospheric electricity, in which he made liberal use of kites, rockets, and iron wire for the purpose of exploring the electrical conditions of the atmosphere. Henley&#x27;s pith-ball electroscope was his recording instrument. In broken or stormy weather, positive and negative electrification were detected; whereas in calm, serene weather &quot;the excessive or positive was always found&quot;. The sinuous or forked character of lightning was attributed to the resistance of the air; and the rupture of the shoes of a man struck by a flash, to the &quot;moisture of the feet flying into vapour&quot;. Beccaria confirmed the observation of Andrew Gordon that water evaporates more rapidly when electrified. He was also among the first to recognize and clearly state that the electrical charge on a conductor is confined to the surface. An experimental demonstration of this law of electrostatics was devised by Cavendish in 1775 and independently by Coulomb in 1788 and popularized in 1816 by Biot, whose name it usually bears. Beccaria adopted the two-fluid theory of Franklin as well as the views of the American philosopher on the preventive and protective functions of lightning conductors.

In May 1755 Beccaria was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and in 1766 he contributed a paper to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, in which he describes (in Latin) five of the more important of his experimental researches. In 1770 he contributed a second paper (also in Latin) in which he expounds five theorems followed by fifteen corollaries in electrostatics. In 1759, King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia employed him to measure the degree of meridian arc in Piedmont.

His principal work is his treatise &quot;Dell&#x27;elettricismo artificiale e naturale&quot; (1753), which was translated into English in 1778. Franklin considered &quot;Dell&#x27;elettricismo&quot; «one of the best pieces on the subject . . . in any language.»

Other works are &quot;Lettere sull&#x27;elettricismo&quot; (1758); &quot;Experimenta atque observationes quibus electricitas vindex late constituitur&quot; (1769); and &quot;Dell&#x27;elettricità terrestre atmosferica a cielo sereno&quot; (1775), the first extended treatise on the subject of atmospheric electricity.

<doc id="196257" wikidata="Q4022718" url="?curid=196257" title="Yes Sir, I Will">
<text>Yes Sir, I Will was the fifth and penultimate album released in March 1983 by anarcho-punk band Crass. The album is a virulent attack on then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher and her government in the aftermath of the Falklands War and was set nearly wholly over a raging and an almost free-form improvised backing provided by the group&#x27;s musicians.

==Content==
Many of the lyrics from this album are extracted from Penny Rimbaud&#x27;s extended poem &quot;Rocky Eyed&quot;. The original vinyl release presented the contents as one long piece split over both sides with no banding between songs, making it the longest punk rock song ever recorded.

Rimbaud summarised the album in an interview with Radio Free France:
Sleeve notes for the album include parts of Rimbaud&#x27;s article &quot;The Pig&#x27;s Head Controversy&quot; that originally appeared in the Crass-produced magazine &quot;International Anthem&quot;.

The title, taken from a news report of a conversation between Charles, Prince of Wales and Falklands War veteran Simon Weston, is an ironic criticism. Charles, visiting the extensively, permanently burned Weston in the hospital, dryly told him to &quot;Get well soon&quot; and Weston&#x27;s sincere reply is the album&#x27;s cynical title. Rimbaud, commenting on this, has said, &quot;That was the hook. That was such an audacious thing to do at the time. Especially given that one had to feel compassion for Simon Weston.&quot;

The album has an extreme disparity between the aggression of the music and the peacefulness of the message. In an interview about the nature of the anger that often crossed between passion and aggression on the album, Gee Vaucher said:
==Rereleases==
A film made by Crass member Gee Vaucher to accompany &quot;Yes Sir, I Will&quot; was shown at the UK National Film Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Stuff the Jubilee&quot; festival of punk films in 2002, and the track was remixed in 2002 by Rimbaud to incorporate additional jazz instrumentation provided by Ingrid Laubrock (saxophone) and Julian Siegel (double bass) to augment the original performance.

The &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; version of this release, including new artwork by Vaucher, remastered sound and liner notes by Steve Ignorant and Rimbaud, was released on May 17, 2011. The reissue also contains a second disc (entitled &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Fuck Off?&quot;), which has Rimbaud&#x27;s 2002 remix of the album, featuring Laubrock and Seigal. No track titles appeared on the original versions of the album; however, the &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; edition gave the tracks titles. The first disc of the &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; edition is indexed incorrectly, with some tracks being shown longer or shorter than they were on the original release on the CD player&#x27;s display, however the second disc is indexed correctly.

* &quot;The listener experiences and shares the performer&#x27;s exhaustion as voices crack, the beat wanders, energy flags and returns&quot; - George McKay describing the album in &quot;Senseless Acts of Beauty&quot; (Verso, 1996)

<text>The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard was the first United States Navy shipyard and was historically important for nearly two centuries.

Construction of the original Philadelphia Naval Shipyard began during the American Revolution in 1776 at Front and Federal Streets in what is now the Pennsport section of Philadelphia. In 1871, it was replaced by a new, much larger yard developed around facilities on League Island, at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. The Navy Yard expansion stimulated the development over time of residences and businesses in South Philadelphia, where many shipyard workers lived. During World War II, some 40,000 workers operated on shifts around the clock to produce and repair ships at the yard for the war effort.

The U.S. Navy ended most of its activities at the shipyard in the 1990s, closing the base after recommendations by the Base Realignment and Closure commission. In 2000, the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, on behalf of the City of Philadelphia, acquired it and began to redevelop the land. First called Philadelphia Naval Business Center, it is now known as The Navy Yard. It is a large mixed-use campus where nearly 15,000 people are employed by more than 120 companies representing a mix of industries, including cell therapy production facilities, global fashion companies, and a commercial shipyard. The U.S. Navy still operates a Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility and a few engineering activities at the site.

==History==
===18th and 19th centuries===


The yard has its origins in a commercial shipyard founded in 1776 on Philadelphia&#x27;s Front Street on the Delaware River; it was designated an official United States Navy site in 1801.

From 1812 until 1865, it was a large ship production center. The first ship launched to the water was the USS &quot;Franklin&quot;. This event was watched by more than 50,000 spectators. The rapid development of other shipbuilding companies pledged Philadelphia to improve production processes. This was the first shipyard in the world to use floating dry docks in the building process to improve an operating time of the ships.

After the advent of ironclad warships made the site obsolete, new facilities were built in 1871 on League Island at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers.

Beginning in the early 19th century, many Philadelphia workers agitated for a reduction in the arduous twelve-hour workday. Prior to 1835, the workday in the Philadelphia Navy Yard was sunrise to sunset, with time off for breakfast. In the summer of 1835 Philadelphia Navy Yard shipwrights, joiners and other workers led the effort to reduce the workday by combining the direct action of a strike, with political pressure to the executive branch. After first seeking workday reduction by a request to the Secretary of the Navy via shipyard Commandant Commodore James Barron, on 29 August 1835 they appealed directly to President Andrew Jackson. Commodore Barron endorsed his workers&#x27; request with the following acknowledgment &quot;I would respectfully observe – Seems to be inevitable, sooner or later, for as the working man are seconded by all the Master workmen, city councils etc. there is no probability they will secede from their demands.&quot;

Their petition was granted and on 31 August 1835 the president ordered the Secretary of the Navy to grant the ten-hour work day, effective 3 September 1835. However, the change was applicable only to the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 29 August 1836, a committee of Philadelphia Navy Yard mechanics appealed to President Andrew Jackson to extend the law, 
&quot;The Committee are sure that if the example is set in Philadelphia it will be [illegible] required in other places and they will not attempt to disguise the pleasure it would give them as Citizens and as Workingmen to see a reformation taking place under the auspices of the Government.&quot; 
It was five years before the ten-hour day was extended to all government employees engaged in manual labor; this was accomplished via an executive order by President Martin Van Buren on 31 March 1840.

===20th century===

The Naval Aircraft Factory was established at the League Island site in 1917. Just after of the end World War I, a 350-ton capacity hammerhead crane was ordered for the yard. Manufactured in 1919 by the McMyler-Interstate Company in Bedford, Ohio, the crane was called the League Island Crane by its builder. Weighing 3,500 tons, the crane was shipped to the yard in sections. At the time, it was the world&#x27;s largest crane. For many years, the &quot;League Island Crane&quot; was the Navy&#x27;s largest crane.

Mustin Field opened at the Naval Aircraft Factory in 1926 and operated until 1963.

The shipyard&#x27;s greatest period came in World War II, when the yard employed 40,000 people who built 53 ships and repaired 574. During this period, the yard built the famed battleship &quot;New Jersey&quot; and its 45,000-ton sister ship, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;. In the Naval Laboratory, Philip Abelson developed the liquid thermal diffusion technique for separating uranium-235 for the Manhattan Project.

The memorial chapel to the Four Chaplains is located on the grounds.

After World War II, the workforce dropped to 12,000, as the Navy stabilized its fleet. In the 1960s, the Navy began to contract with private companies to construct new ships. The yard built its last new ship, the command ship &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, in 1970.

Because of foreign competition and reduced needs due to the end of the Cold War, the defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closure of the yard in 1991. The city and state struggled to keep the facility operational, and the planned closing was unsuccessfully litigated to the US Supreme Court in &quot;Dalton v. Specter&quot;. When the yard finally closed in 1995, it cost the region 7,000 jobs. This followed years in which the region had lost industrial jobs to restructuring and movement of manufacturing overseas. US Senator Arlen Specter charged that the Department of Defense did not disclose the official report on the closing. This resulted in a controversy that led to further legal disputes, but no actions.

Since its transfer from the government to the City of Philadelphia, the west end of property has been leased to Aker Kværner, a tanker and commercial shipbuilding firm.

==Notable ships==
* &quot;Franklin&quot;, a 74-gun ship of the line launched in 1815, the first vessel laid down at the shipyard. It was started as part of the United States&#x27; massive construction program of ships for the War of 1812, including twelve ships completed at Sackets Harbor, New York for use on the Great Lakes.
* &quot;New Jersey&quot;, an used in World War II and later
* &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, the last keel laid for a completed battleship of the United States Navy, 25 January 1941
* &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, an amphibious command ship. This was the last vessel built at the shipyard. It now flies the First Navy Jack as the oldest actively deployed vessel in the Navy.

==Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Philadelphia ==
Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Philadelphia opened at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in 1946 to store the many surplus ships after World War II. As part of the United States Navy reserve fleets, the fleet &quot;mothballed&quot; ships and submarines. Many of the ships in the fleet were reactivated for the Korean War and some for the Vietnam War. The control of the reserve fleet was later transferred to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF). The was used as a barracks ship for the crew at the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Philadelphia.

==League Island after the naval shipyard==
The City of Philadelphia became the landlord and owner of the League Island site in March 2000, when the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development (PAID) took title to roughly 1,000 acres from the Navy. Today, the site is operated as a mixed-use industrial park under the name &quot;The Navy Yard&quot;. The Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) manages the planning, operation, and development of The Navy Yard on behalf of PAID and the City of Philadelphia; its offices are now located at The Navy Yard.

A comprehensive master plan was completed in 2004 to redeveloped the former industrial yard to a mixed-use campus. It proposed adaptive reuse of some Navy buildings as office space; maintenance of buildings and campus elements with strong historic interest, such as the Navy Yard Marine Parade Grounds; and construction of new buildings for offices and other purposes as needed for new tenants. This construction has been in the section called the Corporate Center.

As of 2010, US Navy activities include Naval Support Activity Philadelphia, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Ship Systems Engineering Station, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic Public Works Department Pennsylvania (NAVFAC MIDLANT PWD PA), and the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility (NISMF). This last stores decommissioned and mothballed warships and auxiliary naval vessels.
The Navy Yard is now the site of 120 companies with 10,000 employees. New businesses continue to be attracted to the campus, and existing ones expand. Clothing retailer and manufacturer Urban Outfitters consolidated its Philadelphia headquarters on the site. Tasty Baking Company, makers of Tastykakes, has moved their bakery to the 26th Street side of The Yard. Other occupants include Rittenhouse Ventures, Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Rhoads Industries Inc. in Navy Building 57, Energy Efficient Buildings Hub (EEB Hub), RevZilla.com, and Mark Group, Inc.

In January 2013, PIDC announced its intention to increase the number of apartments on site for employees (near 1,000) and additional infrastructure development. This is made possible by the public financing of shipyards and investments of private companies. According to the plan for 2013, the number of employees at the shipyard amount to around 30,000 people.

In March 2013, the Canadian Pacific – Bulkmatic Transport transload site on Langley Ave was closed.

The Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia hosts the annual Philadelphia Base Ball Fair &amp; Exhibition at the Navy Yard Marine Parade Grounds.

<text>Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande (; 11 July 1732 – 4April 1807) was a French astronomer, freemason and writer. He is known for having estimated a precise value of the astronomical unit (the distance from the Earth to the Sun) using measurements of the transit of Venus in 1769.

==Biography==

Lalande was born at Bourg-en-Bresse (département of Ain) to Pierre Lefrançois and Marie‐Anne‐Gabrielle Monchinet. His parents sent him to Paris to study law, but as a result of lodging in the Hôtel Cluny, where Joseph-Nicolas Delisle had his observatory, he was drawn to astronomy, and became the zealous and favoured pupil of both Delisle and Pierre Charles Le Monnier. Having completed his legal studies, he was about to return to Bourg to practise as an advocate, when Le Monnier obtained permission to send him to Berlin, to make observations on the lunar parallax in concert with those of Nicolas Louis de Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope.
The successful execution of this task obtained for him, before he was twenty-one, admission to the Academy of Berlin, as well as his election as an adjunct astronomer to the French Academy of Sciences. He now devoted himself to the improvement of the planetary theory, publishing in 1759 corrected edition of Edmond Halley&#x27;s tables, with a history of Halley&#x27;s Comet whose return in that year he had helped Alexis Clairaut and Nicole-Reine Lepaute to calculate. In 1762 Delisle resigned the chair of astronomy in the Collège de France in Lalande&#x27;s favour. The duties were discharged by Lalande for forty-six years. His house became an astronomical seminary, and amongst his pupils were Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, Giuseppe Piazzi, Pierre Méchain, and his own nephew Michel Lefrançois de Lalande. By his publications in connection with the transit of Venus of 1769 he won great fame. However, his difficult personality lost him some popularity.

In 1766, Lalande, with Claude Adrien Helvétius, founded the &quot;Les Sciences&quot; lodge in Paris, and received its recognition from Grand Orient de France in 1772. In 1776, he changed its name to Les Neuf Soeurs, and arranged for Benjamin Franklin to be chosen as the first worshipful master.

Although his investigations were conducted with diligence rather than genius, Lalande&#x27;s career was an eminent one. As a lecturer and writer he helped popularise astronomy. His planetary tables, into which he introduced corrections for mutual perturbations, were the best available up to the end of the 18th century. In 1801, he endowed the Lalande Prize, administered by the French Academy of Sciences, for advances in astronomy.
Pierre-Antoine Véron, the young astronomer who for the first time in history determined the size of the Pacific Ocean from east to west, was Lalande&#x27;s disciple.

Lalande was an atheist, and wrote a dictionary of atheists with supplements that appeared in print posthumously.

He never married. He was believed to have an illegitimate daughter Marie-Jeanne de Lalande whom he trained in mathematics so that she could help him with his work; according to more recent research she was not his daughter.

==Near discovery of Neptune==

In February 1847 Sears C. Walker of the US Naval Observatory was searching historical records and surveys for possible prediscovery sightings of the planet Neptune that had been discovered the year before. He found that observations made by Lalande&#x27;s nephew, Michel Lefrançois de Lalande in 1795 were in the direction of Neptune&#x27;s position in the sky at that time and that Neptune might appear in the observation records. On 8 May and again on 10 May 1795 a &quot;star&quot; was observed and recorded with uncertainty noted on its position with a colon, this notation could also indicate an observing error so it was not until the original records of the observatory were reviewed that it was established with certainty that the object was Neptune and the position error between the two nights was due to the planet&#x27;s motion across the sky. The discovery of these records of Neptune&#x27;s position in 1795 led to a better calculation of the planet&#x27;s orbit.

==Awards and recognition==

* In 1765, Lalande was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
* In 1781, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
* His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
* The crater Lalande on the Moon is named after him.
* A high school in Bourg-en-Bresse is named after Lalande. This high school was awarded the Médaille de la Résistance in recognition of the wartime conduct of its teachers and pupils, a unique case among all schools in France.

==Notable works==

His published works include:
*&quot;Traité d&#x27;astronomie&quot; (1st Ed., 2 vols., 1764; 2nd Ed., 4 vols., 1771–1781; 3rd Ed., 3 vols., 1792)
*&quot;Histoire céleste française&quot; (1801), giving the places of 47,390 stars
*&quot;Bibliographie astronomique&quot; (1803), with a history of astronomy from 1780 to 1802
*&quot;Astronomie des dames&quot; (1785)
*&quot;Abrégé de navigation&quot; (1793)
*&quot;Voyage d&#x27;un françois en Italie&quot; (1769), a valuable record of his travel in 1765–1766.

<doc id="196264" wikidata="Q4892700" url="?curid=196264" title="Bermuda sloop">
<text>The Bermuda sloop is a historical type of fore-and-aft rigged single-masted sailing vessel developed on the islands of Bermuda in the 17th century. Such vessels originally had gaff rigs with quadrilateral sails, but evolved to use the Bermuda rig with triangular sails. Although the Bermuda sloop is often described as a development of the narrower-beamed Jamaica sloop, which dates from the 1670s, the high, raked masts and triangular sails of the Bermuda rig are rooted in a tradition of Bermudian boat design dating from the earliest decades of the 17th century. It is distinguished from other vessels with the triangular Bermuda rig, which may have multiple masts or may not have evolved in hull form from the traditional designs.

==History==
Jamaica was the locus of building fast single-masted vessels that became the model for small cruisers of the Royal Navy. Building of this type of vessel had become more active in Bermuda by the start of 18th century. Bermuda shipbuilders constructed sloops and other vessels, starting in the mid 17th century. Their sloops were gaff-rigged. The first triangular mainsails, characteristic of the Bermuda rig, were introduced on coastal vessels by the 1620s, but most sea-going vessels were gaff-rigged until the 1820s. The sloops were constructed in a range of sizes up to . The most prevalent size for such sloops was in the range of on deck with a long bowsprit.

Jamaican sloops had beams that were narrower than ocean-going Bermuda sloops, and could attain a speed of around 12 knots. They carried gaff rig, whereas in modern usage, a Bermuda sloop excludes any gaff rig. Jamaican sloops were built usually out of cedar trees, for much the same reasons that Bermudian shipwrights favoured Bermuda cedar: these were very resistant to rot, grew very fast and tall, and had a taste displeasing to marine borers. Cedar was favoured over oak as the latter would rot in about 10 years, while cedar would last for nigh on 30 years and was considerably lighter than oak. When the ships needed to be de-fouled from seaweed and barnacles, pirates needed a safe haven on which to careen the ship. Sloops were well suited for this because they were able to sail in shallow areas where larger ships would either run aground or be unable to sail through at all. These shallow waters also provided protection from ships of the British Royal Navy, which tended to be larger and required deep water to sail safely.

Later in the 19th century, the design of Bermudian vessels had largely dispensed with square topsails and gaff rig, replacing them with triangular main sails and jibs. The Bermuda rig had traditionally been used on vessels with two or more masts, with the gaff rig favoured for single-masted vessels. The reason for this was the increased height necessary for a single mast, which led to too much canvas. The solid wooden masts at that height were also too heavy, and not sufficiently strong. Single-masted sloops quickly became the norm in Bermudian racing, with the introduction of hollow masts and other refinements.

The colony&#x27;s lightweight Bermuda cedar vessels were widely prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind. The high, raked masts and long bowsprits and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels of all sizes to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago&#x27;s waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels it is very much less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas.

==Merchant and privateering use==
The Bermuda sloop became the predominant type of sailing vessel both in the Bermudian colony and among sloop rigs worldwide as Bermudian traders visited foreign nations. Soon, shipbuilding became one of the primary trades on the island and ships were exported throughout the English colonies on the American seaboard, in the West Indies, and eventually to Europe. In service of the burgeoning shipbuilding industry, many Bermudian colonists began to cultivate Bermuda cedar instead of lucrative trade crops such as tobacco. The archipelago’s ruling Somers Isles Company, which favored tobacco agriculture, attempted to limit Bermudian shipbuilding, inciting demonstrations, appeals, and unrest. This unrest led to violence, the eventual dissolution of the Somers Isles Company and the archipelago’s transition to royal colony status in 1684. 

Bermudians, largely slaves, built roughly a thousand ships during the 18th century. Although many of these were sold abroad, the colony maintained its own large merchant fleet which, thanks partly to the domination of trade in many American seaboard ports by branches of wealthy Bermudian families and partly to the suitability and availability of Bermudian vessels, carried much of the produce exported from the American south to Bermuda and to the West Indies aboard Bermudian mostly slave-manned vessels sailed southwest (more-or-less upwind) to the Turk Islands, where salt was harvested. This salt was carried to North American ports and sold at high profits. Bermudian vessels also developed a trade in moving goods such as grain, cocoa, brandy, wine and more from the Atlantic seaboard colonies to the West Indies.

The threat of piracy and privateering was a large problem for mariners of all nations during the 17th and 18th centuries, but it was also as widely popular an enterprise. During wartime, much of Bermuda&#x27;s merchant fleet turned to more lucrative labors: privateering. The evasive capabilities highly prized by merchantmen also made Bermuda sloops the ship of choice for the pirates themselves, earlier in the 18th century, as well as for smugglers. They often carried sufficient crew out to return with several prizes, and these extra crew were useful both as movable ballast and in handling the labor-intensive sloops. The shape of the ship enabled Bermudian mariners to excel. The same abilities allowed Bermuda sloops to escape from better-armed privateers and even larger man-of-war British naval ships which, with their square rigs, could not sail as closely to windward. The ability of the sloop rig in general to sail upwind meant a Bermuda sloop could outrun most other sailing ships by simply turning upwind and leaving its pursuers floundering in its wake.

Despite Bermudian privateers preying heavily on American shipping during the American War of Independence, some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at well over a thousand) built in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence.

==Slavery and the Bermuda sloop==
The commercial success of the Bermuda sloop must be credited to the contribution of Bermuda&#x27;s free and enslaved Blacks. For most of the 17th century, Bermuda&#x27;s agricultural economy was reliant on indentured servants. This meant that slavery did not play the same role as in many other colonies, though privateers based in Bermuda often brought enslaved blacks and Native Americans who had been captured along with ships of enemy nations. The first large influx of blacks was of free men who came as indentured servants in the middle of the century from former Spanish colonies in the West Indies (the increasing numbers of black, Spanish-speaking probable-Catholics alarmed the white Protestant majority, who were also alarmed by native Irish sent to Bermuda to be sold into servitude after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, and measures were taken to discourage black immigration and to ban the importation of Irish). After 1684, Bermuda turned wholesale to a maritime economy, and slaves, black, Amerindian, and Irish (the various minorities merged into a single demographic group, known as &quot;coloured&quot;, which included anyone who was not defined as entirely of European extraction), played an increasing role in this. Black Bermudians became highly skilled shipwrights, blacksmiths and joiners. Many of the shipwrights who helped to develop shipbuilding in the American South, especially on the Virginia shore of the Chesapeake (Bermuda, also known as &quot;Virgineola&quot;, had once been part of Virginia, and had maintained close connections ever since), were black Bermudian slaves, and the design and success of the area&#x27;s schooners owes something to them, also.

Due to the large number of white Bermudian men who were away at sea at any one time (and possibly due as much to fear of the larger number of enslaved black Bermudian men left behind) it was mandated that blacks must make up a percentage of the crew of every Bermudian vessel. By the American War of Independence, the use of many able black slaves as sailors added considerably to the power of the Bermudian merchant fleet due to their highly needed skill set, and these included the crews of Bermudian privateers. When the Americans captured the Bermudian privateer &quot;Regulator&quot;, they discovered that virtually all of her crew were black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but nearly all of the 70 captives elected to be treated as prisoners of war, claiming slavery was all they knew and out of fear for their families who were still in Bermuda. Sent to New York on the sloop &quot;Duxbury&quot;, those who were left seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda.

Slavery was not abolished in Bermuda until ordered by the British Government in 1834, though the Royal Navy had already made frequent use of Bermuda sloops in suppressing the trans-Atlantic slave trade (having formed the West Africa Squadron to this end in 1808, following passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807).

==Bermudian work boats==
The term &quot;Bermuda sloop&quot; was also to describe the working boats historically used for moving freight about Bermuda&#x27;s islands, for fishing, and other coastal activities, and today is used to designate any single-masted yacht with Bermuda rig. Motor vehicles were banned in Bermuda until after the Second World War, and the roads were few and poor until the requirements of that war advanced their development. Boats, as a consequence, remained the primary method of moving people and materials around Bermuda well into the 20th century. Although such small sloops are rare today, the design was further scaled down to produce the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy, a class of racing vessel used in traditional competition between Bermudian yacht clubs. The term &quot;Bermuda sloop&quot; has come to be used outside Bermuda, today, to describe any single masted, Bermuda rigged boat, also known as &quot;Marconi sloops&quot;, although most are far less extreme in their design than was once the norm in Bermuda, with bowsprits omitted, masts vertical and shortened, and booms similarly shortened. Spinnaker booms and multiple jibs are rarely seen. The reduced sail area makes modern boats much more manageable, especially for small or inexperienced crews.

<text>Hartland is a town in Carleton County, New Brunswick, Canada.

On 1 January 2023, Hartland annexed all or part of seven local service districts, greatly expanding its area and population. The annexed communities&#x27; names remain in official use. Revised census figures have not been released.

==Geography==
Hartland is situated on the Saint John River in the central-western portion of the province in the agricultural heartland of Carleton County.

==History==

The first settler in the area of what would become Hartland was William Orser (b.1762) and his son William Jr. William traveled there from New York with his wife and six children. His wife died of an illness and he remarried to a widow, Mary Blake, who also had six children. The pair later conceived an additional six children. The land was settled in 1797, and granted in 1809.

The town was named Hartland in 1874, to honour James R. Hartley, a surveyor and MLA.

It is the hometown of two of New Brunswick&#x27;s premiers during the 20th century: Hugh John Flemming and Richard Hatfield. U.S. Congressmen Isaac &amp; Samuel Stephenson and Prince Edward Island&#x27;s Lieutenant-Governor Barbara Oliver Hagerman are also from Hartland. Renowned Canadian poet Alden Nowlan also lived in the town for several formative years while working for the Hartland Observer newspaper.

The town is best known for being the site of the Hartland Bridge, the longest covered bridge in the world. Originally opened on July 4, 1901, the 1,282 foot (390.75 m) bridge is a national historic site. The bridge was covered as part of major repairs in 1921, and the pedestrian walkway added in 1945.

Prior to the building of the Mactaquac Dam, Hartland was also famous for its salmon pools, located slightly upstream of the Hartland Bridge.

Hartland is the headquarters of the North American trucking company Day &amp; Ross, itself a subsidiary of McCain Foods, as well as home to the New Brunswick Bible Institute.
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hartland had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Disasters==
===Fires===

July 15, 1907

An arsonist started a fire which consumed a large part of the town. The town was rebuilt.

October 24, 1946

The town&#x27;s dehydration plant, used to dehydrate potatoes, was destroyed by fire. The adjacent glucose and starch plants were also consumed.

August 25, 1980

A fire destroyed many businesses on Main Street.

===Floods===
Being built close to the Saint John River, the town is usually affected by the annual spring freshet. Ice jams threaten the Hartland Bridge, it being a choke point for loose ice.

<text>Pierre Charles Le Monnier (; 20 November 1715 – 3 April 1799) was a French astronomer. His name is sometimes given as Lemonnier.

==Biography==
Le Monnier was born in Paris, where his father Pierre (1675–1757), also an astronomer, was professor of philosophy at the college d&#x27;Harcourt.

His first recorded astronomical observation was made before he was sixteen, and the presentation of an elaborate lunar map resulted in his admission to the French Academy of Sciences, on 21 April 1736, aged only 20. He was chosen in the same year to accompany Pierre Louis Maupertuis and Alexis Clairaut on their geodetical expedition for measuring a meridian arc of approximately one degree&#x27;s length to Torne Valley in Lapland. In 1738, shortly after his return, he explained, in a memoir read before the academy, the advantages of John Flamsteed&#x27;s mode of determining right ascensions.

His persistent recommendation of British methods and instruments contributed effectively to the reform of French practical astronomy, and constituted the most eminent of his services to science. He corresponded with James Bradley, was the first to represent the effects of nutation in the solar tables, and introduced, in 1741, the use of the transit-instrument at the Paris Observatory. He visited England in 1748, and, in company with the Earl of Morton and James Shore the optician, continued his journey to Scotland, where he observed the annular eclipse of 25 July.

The liberality of King Louis XV of France, in whose favour Le Monnier stood high, furnished him with the means of procuring the best instruments, many made in Britain. Amongst the fruits of his industry may be mentioned a laborious investigation of the disturbances of Jupiter by Saturn, the results of which were employed and confirmed by Euler in his prize essay of 1748; a series of lunar observations extending over fifty years; some interesting researches in terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity, in the latter of which he detected a regular diurnal period; and the determination of the places of a great number of stars, including at least twelve separate observations of Uranus, between 1750 and its recognition as a planet. In his lectures at the Collège de France he first publicly expounded the analytical theory of gravitation, and his timely patronage secured the services of Jérôme Lalande for astronomy.

Le Monnier&#x27;s temper and hasty speech resulted in many arguments and grudges. He fell out with Lalande &quot;during an entire revolution of the moon&#x27;s nodes&quot;. His career was ended by paralysis late in 1791, and a repetition of the stroke terminated his life. He died at Héril near Bayeux. By his marriage with Mademoiselle de Cussy he left three daughters, one of whom became the wife of Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

Le Monnier was admitted on 5 April 1739 to the Royal Society, and was one of the 144 original members of the institute. On 29 January 1745 he also became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

The crater Le Monnier on the Moon is named after him.

<text>Alexis Claude Clairaut (; ; 13 May 1713 – 17 May 1765) was a French mathematician, astronomer, and geophysicist. He was a prominent Newtonian whose work helped to establish the validity of the principles and results that Sir Isaac Newton had outlined in the &quot;Principia&quot; of 1687. Clairaut was one of the key figures in the expedition to Lapland that helped to confirm Newton&#x27;s theory for the figure of the Earth. In that context, Clairaut worked out a mathematical result now known as &quot;Clairaut&#x27;s theorem&quot;. He also tackled the gravitational three-body problem, being the first to obtain a satisfactory result for the apsidal precession of the Moon&#x27;s orbit. In mathematics he is also credited with Clairaut&#x27;s equation and Clairaut&#x27;s relation.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early life===
Clairaut was born in Paris, France, to Jean-Baptiste and Catherine Petit Clairaut. The couple had 20 children, however only a few of them survived childbirth. His father taught mathematics. Alexis was a prodigy – at the age of ten he began studying calculus. At the age of twelve he wrote a memoir on four geometrical curves and under his father&#x27;s tutelage he made such rapid progress in the subject that in his thirteenth year he read before the Académie française an account of the properties of four curves which he had discovered. When only sixteen he finished a treatise on Tortuous Curves, &quot;Recherches sur les courbes a double courbure&quot;, which, on its publication in 1731, procured his admission into the Royal Academy of Sciences, although he was below the legal age as he was only eighteen. He gave a path breaking formulae called the distance formulae which helps to find out the distance between any 2 points on the cartesian or XY plane.

=== Personal life and death ===
Clairaut was unmarried, and known for leading an active social life. His growing popularity in society hindered his scientific work: &quot;He was focused,&quot; says Bossut, &quot;with dining and with evenings, coupled with a lively taste for women, and seeking to make his pleasures into his day to day work, he lost rest, health, and finally life at the age of fifty-two.&quot; Though he led a fulfilling social life, he was very prominent in the advancement of learning in young mathematicians.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 27 October 1737.

Clairaut died in Paris in 1765.

== Mathematical and scientific works ==

===The shape of the Earth===
In 1736, together with Pierre Louis Maupertuis, he took part in the expedition to Lapland, which was undertaken for the purpose of estimating a degree of the meridian arc. The goal of the excursion was to geometrically calculate the shape of the Earth, which Sir Isaac Newton theorised in his book &quot;Principia&quot; was an ellipsoid shape. They sought to prove if Newton&#x27;s theory and calculations were correct or not. Before the expedition team returned to Paris, Clairaut sent his calculations to the Royal Society of London. The writing was later published by the society in the 1736–37 volume of &quot;Philosophical Transactions.&quot; Initially, Clairaut disagrees with Newton&#x27;s theory on the shape of the Earth. In the article, he outlines several key problems that effectively disprove Newton&#x27;s calculations, and provides some solutions to the complications. The issues addressed include calculating gravitational attraction, the rotation of an ellipsoid on its axis, and the difference in density of an ellipsoid on its axes. At the end of his letter, Clairaut writes that: &quot;It appears even Sir Isaac Newton was of the opinion, that it was necessary the Earth should be more dense toward the center, in order to be so much the flatter at the poles: and that it followed from this greater flatness, that gravity increased so much the more from the equator towards the Pole.&quot; 

This conclusion suggests not only that the Earth is of an oblate ellipsoid shape, but it is flattened more at the poles and is wider at the centre.
His article in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; created much controversy, as he addressed the problems of Newton&#x27;s theory, but provided few solutions to how to fix the calculations. After his return, he published his treatise &quot;Théorie de la figure de la terre&quot; (1743). In this work he promulgated the theorem, known as Clairaut&#x27;s theorem, which connects the gravity at points on the surface of a rotating ellipsoid with the compression and the centrifugal force at the equator. This hydrostatic model of the shape of the Earth was founded on a paper by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin, which had shown that a mass of fluid set in rotation about a line through its centre of mass would, under the mutual attraction of its particles, take the form of an ellipsoid. Under the assumption that the Earth was composed of concentric ellipsoidal shells of uniform density, Clairaut&#x27;s theorem could be applied to it, and allowed the ellipticity of the Earth to be calculated from surface measurements of gravity. This proved Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory that the shape of the Earth was an oblate ellipsoid. In 1849 George Stokes showed that Clairaut&#x27;s result was true whatever the interior constitution or density of the Earth, provided the surface was a spheroid of equilibrium of small ellipticity.

=== Geometry ===
In 1741, Clairaut wrote a book called &quot;Éléments de Géométrie&quot;. The book outlines the basic concepts of geometry. Geometry in the 1700s was complex to the average learner. It was considered to be a dry subject. Clairaut saw this trend, and wrote the book in an attempt to make the subject more interesting for the average learner. He believed that instead of having students repeatedly work problems that they did not fully understand, it was imperative for them to make discoveries themselves in a form of active, experiential learning. He begins the book by comparing geometric shapes to measurements of land, as it was a subject that most anyone could relate to. He covers topics from lines, shapes, and even some three dimensional objects. Throughout the book, he continuously relates different concepts such as physics, astrology, and other branches of mathematics to geometry. Some of the theories and learning methods outlined in the book are still used by teachers today, in geometry and other topics.

===Focus on astronomical motion===
One of the most controversial issues of the 18th century was the problem of three bodies, or how the Earth, Moon, and Sun are attracted to one another. With the use of the recently founded Leibnizian calculus, Clairaut was able to solve the problem using four differential equations. He was also able to incorporate Newton&#x27;s inverse-square law and law of attraction into his solution, with minor edits to it. However, these equations only offered approximate measurement, and no exact calculations. Another issue still remained with the three body problem; how the Moon rotates on its apsides. Even Newton could account for only half of the motion of the apsides. This issue had puzzled astronomers. In fact, Clairaut had at first deemed the dilemma so inexplicable, that he was on the point of publishing a new hypothesis as to the law of attraction.

The question of the apsides was a heated debate topic in Europe. Along with Clairaut, there were two other mathematicians who were racing to provide the first explanation for the three body problem; Leonhard Euler and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. Euler and d&#x27;Alembert were arguing against the use of Newtonian laws to solve the three body problem. Euler in particular believed that the inverse square law needed revision to accurately calculate the apsides of the Moon.

Despite the hectic competition to come up with the correct solution, Clairaut obtained an ingenious approximate solution of the problem of the three bodies. In 1750 he gained the prize of the St Petersburg Academy for his essay &quot;Théorie de la lune&quot;; the team made up of Clairaut, Jérome Lalande and Nicole Reine Lepaute successfully computed the date of the 1759 return of Halley&#x27;s comet. The &quot;Théorie de la lune&quot; is strictly Newtonian in character. This contains the explanation of the motion of the apsis. It occurred to him to carry the approximation to the third order, and he thereupon found that the result was in accordance with the observations. This was followed in 1754 by some lunar tables, which he computed using a form of the discrete Fourier transform.

The newfound solution to the problem of three bodies ended up meaning more than proving Newton&#x27;s laws correct. The unravelling of the problem of three bodies also had practical importance. It allowed sailors to determine the longitudinal direction of their ships, which was crucial not only in sailing to a location, but finding their way home as well. This held economic implications as well, because sailors were able to more easily find destinations of trade based on the longitudinal measures.

Clairaut subsequently wrote various papers on the orbit of the Moon, and on the motion of comets as affected by the perturbation of the planets, particularly on the path of Halley&#x27;s comet. He also used applied mathematics to study Venus, taking accurate measurements of the planet&#x27;s size and distance from the Earth. This was the first precise reckoning of the planet&#x27;s size.

<doc id="196277" wikidata="Q1455620" url="?curid=196277" title="Kodachrome">
<text>Kodachrome is the brand name for a color reversal film introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1935. It was one of the first successful color materials and was used for both cinematography and still photography. For many years, Kodachrome was widely used for professional color photography, especially for images intended for publication in print media.

Because of its complex processing requirements, the film was initially sold only with the cost of processing; independent photography stores were prohibited from developing Kodachrome. To develop the film, customers had to mail it to Kodak, which would then send the developed film back as part of the purchase price. In 1954, the U.S. Department of Justice found that this practice violated antitrust laws by being uncompetitive. Kodak then entered into a consent decree, requiring the company to offer Kodachrome film for sale without the development fee, as well as license Kodachrome development patents to independent photography stores. Kodak had sold mailers to users who wanted their films to be processed by them. Nonetheless, the process-paid arrangement continued in other markets around the world.

Eventually, the growth and popularity of alternative photographic materials, and, much later, the widespread transition to digital photography, led to Kodachrome’s loss of market share. Its manufacture was discontinued in 2009, and processing ended in December 2010. In early 2017, Kodak announced it was investigating the possibility of re-introducing Kodachrome, but later conceded that this was unlikely to happen.

==Background==

Kodachrome was the first color film to be successfully mass-marketed that used a subtractive color method. Previous materials, such as Autochrome and Dufaycolor, had used the additive screenplate methods. Until its discontinuation, Kodachrome was the oldest surviving brand of color film. It was manufactured for 74 years in various formats to suit still and motion picture cameras, including 8mm, Super 8, 16mm for movies (exclusively through Eastman Kodak), 35mm for movies (exclusively available through Technicolor Corp as &quot;Technicolor Monopack&quot;) and 135, 120, 110, 126, 828 and large format for still photography.

Kodachrome is appreciated in the archival and professional market for its accurate color reproduction and dark-storage longevity. Because of these qualities, it was used by Walton Sound and Film Services in the UK in 1953 for the official 16mm film of the coronation of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Copies of the film for sale to the public were also produced using Kodachrome. More recent professional film photographers such as Steve McCurry, David Alan Harvey, Peter Guttman and Alex Webb also favored the film. It was used by McCurry for his iconic 1984 portrait of Sharbat Gula, &quot;Afghan Girl&quot;, for the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine.

==History==

===Before Kodachrome===
Before Kodachrome film was marketed in 1935 most color photography had been achieved using films that employed additive color methods and materials, such as Autochrome and Dufaycolor, These first practical color processes had several disadvantages because they used a Réseau filter made from discrete color elements that were visible upon enlargement. The finished transparencies absorbed between 70% and 80% of light upon projection, requiring very bright projection lamps, especially for large projections. Subtractive color methods avoided these disadvantages.

Rudolf Fischer was granted a patent in 1913 for a proposed color photography process in which three separate emulsions, each sensitive to a different color, would be exposed simultaneously. However, Fischer was unable to implement the idea.

===First use of &#x27;Kodachrome&#x27; name===
The first Kodak product called Kodachrome was invented by John Capstaff in 1913. His Kodachrome was a subtractive process that used only two colours: blue-green and red-orange. It required two glass plate negatives, one made using a panchromatic emulsion and a red filter, the other made using an emulsion insensitive to red light. The two plates could be exposed as a &quot;bipack&quot; (sandwiched emulsion to emulsion, with a very thin red filter layer between), which eliminated the need for multiple exposures or a special color camera. After development, the silver images were bleached out with chemistry that hardened the bleached portions of the gelatin.

Using dyes that were absorbed only by the unhardened gelatin, the negative that recorded the blue and green light was dyed red-orange and the red-exposed negative was dyed blue-green. The result was a pair of positive dye images. The plates were then assembled emulsion to emulsion, producing transparency that was capable of good (for a two-colour process) colour rendition of skin tones in portraits. Capstaff&#x27;s Kodachrome was made commercially available in 1915. It was also adapted for use as a 35mm motion picture film process. Today, this first version of Kodachrome is nearly forgotten, overshadowed by the next Kodak product bearing the same name Kodachrome.

In 2012 Capstaff&#x27;s early film tests were added to the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry under the title &quot;Two-Color Kodachrome Test Shots No. III&quot; (1922) for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

===Development of modern Kodachrome===

The next version of Kodachrome was invented in the early 1930s by two professional musicians, Leopold Godowsky Jr. and Leopold Mannes, who were also university-trained scientists.

Mannes and Godowsky first took an interest in color photography as high school students in 1917, when they saw a movie called &quot;Our Navy&quot;, a movie production using a four-color additive process. Both agreed the color was terrible. After researching the subject in the library, they started to experiment with additive color processes. Their experiments were continued during their college years, eventually producing a camera having two lenses that projected images side by side on a single strip of film. The color rendition of this additive two-color process was of fair quality, but aligning the two lenses of the projector was difficult.

Their experiments, which continued after they finished college, turned from multiple lenses that produced multiple, differently colored images that had to be combined to form the final transparency, to multiple layered film in which the different color images were already combined and therefore perfectly aligned. Such a multi-layered film had already been invented and patented in 1912 by the German inventor Rudolph Fischer. Each of the three layers in the proposed film would be sensitive to one of the three primary colors, and each of the three layers would have substances (called &quot;color couplers&quot;) embedded in them that would form a dye of the required color when combined with the by-products of the developing silver image. When the silver images were bleached away, the three-color dye image would remain. Fischer, however, failed to find a way to stop the color couplers and color sensitizing dyes from wandering from one layer into the other, where they would produce unwanted colors.

Mannes and Godowsky, using a similar approach, started experimenting with color couplers, but their experiments were hindered by a lack of money, supplies and facilities. In 1922 Robert Wood, a friend of Mannes, wrote a letter of introduction for Mannes and Godowsky to Kodak chief scientist Kenneth Mees, referencing their experiments and asking if Mees could let them use the Kodak facilities for a few days. Mees offered to help, and after meeting with Mannes and Godowsky, agreed to supply them with multi-layer emulsions made to their specifications. The pair then secured a $20,000 loan from the New York investment firm Kuhn, Loeb and Company, instigated by a secretary there that Mees had befriended.

By 1924, they patented a two-color process that employed &quot;controlled diffusion&quot;. By timing how long it took for an image to form in the top layer ahead of the lower level, they began to probe the prospects of timed processing as a means of controlling wandering dyes. Some three years later they were still experimenting with such a method in a multi-layer emulsion, but by then they had decided that instead of incorporating the color couplers into the emulsion layers themselves, they could be added to the developing chemicals.

When their money ran out in 1929, Mees helped them once more. He knew that the solution to the problem of the wandering dyes had already been found by one of Kodak&#x27;s scientists, Leslie Brooker, and so fronted Mannes and Godowsky the money to pay off their loan with Kuhn Loeb and offered them a yearly salary, coupled to a three-year deadline to come up with a finished and commercially viable product.

Shortly before their deadline at the end of 1933, Mannes and Godowsky had not produced anything usable, and thought their experiments would be terminated by Kodak. Instead, Mees granted them a one-year extension and, still having technical challenges, they eventually presented Mees with a mere two-color movie process in 1934, just as the original Kodachrome invented by John Capstaff some 20 years earlier.

Mees immediately set things in motion to produce and market this film, but just before Kodak was about to do so in 1935, Mannes and Godowsky completed work on the long-awaited but no longer expected, much better, three-color version. On April 15, 1935, this new film, borrowing the name from Capstaff&#x27;s process, was formally announced.

===Launch and later history===
Kodachrome was first sold in 1935 as 16 mm movie film with an ASA speed of 10 and the following year it was made available as 8mm movie film, and in 135 and 828 formats for still cameras.

In 1961, Kodak released Kodachrome II with sharper images and faster speeds at 25 ASA. In 1962, Kodachrome-X at ASA 64 was introduced. In 1974, with the transition to the K-14 process, Kodachrome II and Kodachrome-X were replaced by Kodachrome 25 and Kodachrome 64.

In later years, Kodachrome was produced in a wide variety of film formats including 120 and , and in ISO-ASA values ranging from 8 to 200.

Until manufacturing was taken over by rival film manufacturer GAF, View-Master stereo reels used Kodachrome films.

===Decline and discontinuation===
Later color transparency films, such as Agfachrome, Anscochrome, Fujichrome and Kodak&#x27;s own Ektachrome used simpler, quicker, and more accessible color development processes. Their higher film speeds also eroded Kodachrome&#x27;s market share, as the quality of competing films improved over time. As digital photography reduced the demand for all film after 2000, Kodachrome sales further declined. On June 22, 2009, Kodak announced it would no longer manufacture Kodachrome film, citing declining demand. During its heyday, many Kodak and independent laboratories processed Kodachrome, but by 2010, only one Kodak-certified facility remained: Dwayne&#x27;s Photo in Parsons, Kansas. On July 14, 2010, it was announced that the last roll of Kodachrome manufactured had been developed by Dwayne&#x27;s for photographer Steve McCurry, a National Geographic photographer. McCurry had asked Kodak for the last roll in stock, then went out on his own to use that roll. Although McCurry retains ownership of the slides, prints of the 36 exposures are permanently housed at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York and most of the pictures have been published on the Internet by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine.

====2017 reintroduction rumors====

After announcing the return of Ektachrome at the beginning of 2017, Eastman Kodak CMO Steven Overman told &quot;The Kodakery&quot; podcast, &quot;we are investigating Kodachrome, looking at what it would take to bring that back&quot;. Although the statement generated widespread media interest, it was subsequently conceded by an official at Kodak Alaris (which would be responsible for its production and sale) that the return of Kodachrome was probably impractical (due to the difficulty in restoring the now-dismantled infrastructure needed to support it) and therefore unlikely.

== Characteristics ==


=== Emulsion ===
Kodachrome films are non-substantive. Unlike substantive transparency and negative color films, Kodachrome film does not incorporate dye couplers into the emulsion layers. The dye couplers are added during processing. This means that Kodachrome emulsion layers are thinner and less light is scattered upon exposure, meaning that the film could record an image with more sharpness than substantive films. Transparencies made with non-substantive films have an easily visible relief image on the emulsion side of the film. Kodachrome 64 and 200 can record a dynamic range of about 2.3D or 8 f-stops, as shown in the characteristic curves. Kodachrome 25 transparencies have a dynamic range of around 12 f-stops, or 3.6–3.8D.

===Color===
The color rendering of Kodachrome films was unique in color photography for several decades after its introduction in the 1930s. Even after the introduction of other successful professional color films, such as Fuji Velvia, some professionals continued to prefer Kodachrome, and maintain that it still has certain advantages over digital. Steve McCurry told Vanity Fair magazine:&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanity Fair/McCurry&quot;&gt;David Friend (February 9, 2011). &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
===Contrast===
Kodachrome is generally used for direct projection using white light. As such, it possesses a relatively high contrast.

For professional uses, where duplication is expected and required, a special version, Kodachrome Commercial (KCO), was available in a 35 mm BH-perforated base (exclusively through Technicolor) and in a 16 mm base (exclusively through Eastman Kodak&#x27;s professional products division). In both cases, Eastman Kodak performed the processing.

Kodachrome Commercial has a low-contrast characteristic that complements the various duplication films with which it is intended to be used: silver separation negatives for 35 mm (controlled exclusively by Technicolor) and reversal duplicating and printing stocks for 16 mm (controlled exclusively by Eastman Kodak).

Kodachrome Commercial was available until the mid-1950s, after which Ektachrome Commercial (ECO) replaced it for these specific applications.

After the late 1950s, 16 mm Kodachrome Commercial-originated films (and Ektachrome Commercial-originated films as well) were quite often duplicated onto Eastmancolor internegative film, after which these films were printed on Eastmancolor positive print film, as a cost-reduction measure, thereby yielding relatively low-cost prints for direct projection.

===Archival stability===
When stored in darkness, Kodachrome&#x27;s long-term stability under suitable conditions is superior to other types of color film of the same era. While existing Kodachrome materials from before Kodak simplified the development process in 1938 are almost always faded, images on Kodachrome slides and motion picture films made after this point retain accurate color and density to this day. It has been calculated that the yellow dye, the least stable, would suffer a 20% loss of dye in 185 years. This is because developed Kodachrome does not retain unused color couplers. Nevertheless, Kodachrome&#x27;s color stability under bright light, for example during projection, is inferior to substantive slide films. Kodachrome&#x27;s fade time under projection is about one hour, compared to Fujichrome&#x27;s two and a half hours.

Unprocessed Kodachrome film may survive long periods between exposure and processing. In one case, several rolls were exposed and then lost in a Canadian forest. Upon discovery 19 years later they were processed and the images were usable.

=== Digital scanning and resolution ===

A 35mm Kodachrome transparency, like other 35mm transparencies on films of comparable ISO rating, contains an equivalent of approximately 20 megapixels of data in the 24 mm x 36 mm image. Scanning Kodachrome transparencies can be problematic because of the film&#x27;s tendency to scan with a blue color cast. Some software producers deliver special Kodachrome color profiles with their software to avoid this. An IT8 calibration with a special Kodachrome calibration target is necessary for accurate color reproduction.

Many scanners use an additional infrared channel to detect defects, as the long wave infrared radiation passes through the film but not through dust particles. Dust, scratches, and fingerprints on the slide are typically detected and removed by a scanner&#x27;s software. Kodachrome interacts with this infrared channel in two ways. The absorption of the cyan dye extends into the near infrared region, making this layer opaque to infrared radiation. Kodachrome also has a pronounced relief image that can affect the infrared channel. These effects can sometimes cause a slight loss of sharpness in the scanned image when Digital ICE or a similar infrared channel dust removal function is used.

== Processing ==

Kodachrome, and other non-substantive films, unlike most color films, required complex processing that could not practicably be carried out by amateurs. The process underwent four significant alterations since its inception. The final version of the process, designated K-14, was introduced in 1974. The process was complex and exacting, requiring technicians with extensive chemistry training and large, complex machinery. This is because most color films contain dye couplers in the film itself; during development, the couplers react with the developer to form the dyes that form the final image. Kodachrome film has no such couplers; instead the dyes are formed on the film by a complex processing sequence that required four different developers; one black and white developer, and three color developers. Normal color film requires just one developer. Also, processing Kodachrome film requires 8 or more tanks of processing chemicals, each of which must be precisely controlled for concentration, temperature and agitation, resulting in very complex processing equipment with precise chemical control, no small feat for small processing companies.

The first step in the process was the removal of the antihalation backing with an alkaline solution and wash. The film was then developed using a developer containing phenidone and hydroquinone, which formed three superimposed negative images, one for each primary color. After the first developer was washed out, the film underwent re-exposure and redevelopment. Re-exposure fogged the silver halides that were not developed in the first developer, limiting development to one layer at a time. A color developer then developed the fogged image, and its exhaustion products reacted with a color coupler to form a dye in the color complementary to the layer&#x27;s sensitivity. The red-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the base of the film with red light, then redeveloped forming cyan dye. The blue-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the emulsion side of the film with blue light, then redeveloped forming yellow dye. The green-sensitive layer was redeveloped with a developer that chemically fogged it and formed magenta dye. After color development, the metallic silver was converted to silver halide using a bleach solution. The film was then fixed, making these silver halides soluble and leaving only the final dye image. The final steps were to wash the film to remove residual chemicals that might cause deterioration of the dye image, then to dry, cut, and mount the film in slide frames.

===Prepaid processing===
Due to its complex processing requirements, Kodachrome film was initially sold at a price that included processing by Kodak. An envelope was included with the film in which the photographer would send the exposed film to the nearest of several designated Kodak laboratories. The film was processed, mounted in cardboard mounts in the case of 35 mm slides, and returned by mail to the sender. After 1954, as a result of a lawsuit from the federal government, this practice was prohibited in the United States as anticompetitive. Kodak entered into a consent decree that ended this practice in the United States, and allowed independent processing laboratories to acquire the chemicals needed to process Kodachrome films. In other countries, the price of Kodachrome film continued to include processing by Kodak.

==Decline==
The use of transparency film declined in the 1980s and 1990s, which, combined with competition from Fuji&#x27;s Velvia slide film, caused a drop in Kodachrome sales. Some business analysts speculated that heavy subsidies by the Japanese government propped up Fuji and may have even allowed dumping of Fuji&#x27;s films at below the cost to manufacture them. Kodachrome products were gradually discontinued and on June 22, 2009, Kodak announced that the remaining film, Kodachrome 64, would no longer be manufactured.

Because of the decline in business, many Kodak-owned and independent Kodachrome processing facilities were closed. The loss of processing availability further accelerated the decline in Kodachrome sales. In 1999, Kodak attempted to increase the availability of K-14 processing through its K-Lab program, where small labs equipped with smaller Kodak processing machines would supplement Kodak&#x27;s own processing services. This effort did not endure and all the K-labs were closed by 2005.

On July 25, 2006, extensive documentation about Kodak&#x27;s Lausanne Kodachrome lab&#x27;s impending closure was sent to the European Parliament by the Dutch office of the European Parliament because, although located in Switzerland, the facility served all of Europe and its closure would affect European photographers. The Parliamentary committees for Culture and Education and for Internal Market and Consumer Protection studied the matter.

===Cessation of processing===
After its Lausanne processing facility closed, Kodak subcontracted the processing work to Dwayne&#x27;s Photo, an independent facility in the United States, which became the world&#x27;s last Kodachrome processing facility. Dwayne&#x27;s processing of 35 mm films was fully endorsed by Kodak, but its Super-8 process was not endorsed because it required more agitation. Films sent for processing in the USA were mailed directly to Dwayne&#x27;s, while those in Europe were sent to the Lausanne facility&#x27;s address and forwarded to Dwayne&#x27;s.

Dwayne&#x27;s Photo announced in late 2010 that it would process all Kodachrome rolls received at the lab by December 30, 2010, after which processing would cease. As Dwayne&#x27;s final processing deadline approached, thousands of stored rolls of film were sent in for processing. Once film received by the deadline had been developed, the world&#x27;s last K-14 processing machine was taken out of service. The final roll to be processed was exposed by Dwayne Steinle, owner of Dwayne&#x27;s Photo. The cessation of processing by Dwayne&#x27;s Photo is commemorated in the book &quot;Kodachrome – End of the Run: Photographs from the Final Batches&quot;, edited by photographers Bill Barrett and Susan Hacker Stang with introductory essays by &quot;Time&quot; magazine worldwide pictures editor Arnold Drapkin and Dwayne&#x27;s Photo vice president Grant Steinle. The book presents a year of pictures shot by Webster University photography students on more than 100 rolls of by-then rare Kodachrome film and processed by Dwayne&#x27;s on the last day (extended to January 18, 2011) before processing chemicals officially ceased production. Kodachrome film can no longer be processed in color, but it can be processed in black and white by some labs that specialize in obsolete processes and old film processing.

===Discontinuation===
The Kodachrome product range diminished progressively through the 1990s and 2000s.

* Kodachrome 64 film in 120 format was discontinued in 1996.
* Kodachrome 25 was discontinued in 2002.
* Kodachrome 40 in the Super 8 movie format was discontinued in June 2005, despite protests from filmmakers. Kodak launched a replacement color reversal film in the Super 8 format, Ektachrome 64T, which uses the common E-6 processing chemistry.
* Kodachrome 200 was discontinued in November 2006.
* Kodachrome 64 and Kodachrome 64 Professional 135 format were discontinued in June 2009.

==Product timeline==
==In popular culture==
Kodachrome was the subject of Paul Simon&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;Kodachrome&quot;, and Kodachrome Basin State Park in Utah was named after it, becoming the only park named for a brand of film.

The brand is mentioned in The Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Psychobabble&quot;: &quot;Tell you &#x27;bout a dream that I have every night / It ain&#x27;t Kodachrome and it isn&#x27;t black and white&quot;.

Anticipating the approval of their merger, in 1985, the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroad companies repainted hundreds of locomotives into a unified red and yellow livery, which railfans nicknamed &quot;Kodachrome&quot;.

In 2017 the film &quot;Kodachrome&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and featured a dying photographer, played by Ed Harris, whose son, played by Jason Sudeikis, helps him to get the last of his Kodachrome photography processed.

<text>The Lamborghini Diablo (meaning &quot;devil&quot; in Spanish), is a series of high-performance V12, rear mid-engined sports cars in the supercar market segment, built by Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini from 1990 through 2001. It is the first production Lamborghini with a top speed in excess of .

In 1993, the Diablo VT (for &#x27;Viscous Traction&#x27;) became Lamborghini&#x27;s first all-wheel drive production sportscar. The car retained its rear-wheel drive character, but a computer-modulated system could direct up to 25% of the engine&#x27;s torque to the front wheels in case of rear-axle slip, to improve the car&#x27;s handling. In 1995, Lamborghini also began building their first open-top V12, in the form of a Diablo roadster. During the later years, a number of special editions were built, typically in very small numbers.

After the end of its production run in 2001, the Diablo was replaced by the Lamborghini Murciélago. 

==History of development==

At a time when the company was financed by the Swiss-based brothers Jean Claude and Patrick Mimran, Lamborghini began development of what was codenamed &quot;Project 132&quot; in June 1985 as a replacement for the Countach, Lamborghini&#x27;s then flagship sports car. The brief stated that the top speed of the new car had to be at least .

The design of the car was contracted to Marcello Gandini, who had designed its two predecessors. When Chrysler Corporation bought the company in 1987, funding the company to complete the car&#x27;s development, its management was displeased with Gandini&#x27;s designs and commissioned its design team in Detroit to execute a third extensive redesign, smoothing out the infamous sharp edges and corners of Gandini&#x27;s original design. Gandini would later realise his original design in the Cizeta-Moroder V16T.

The new car was named Diablo, carrying on Lamborghini&#x27;s tradition of naming its cars after breeds of fighting bulls. The Diablo was named after a ferocious bull raised by the Duke of Veragua in the 19th century, famous for fighting an epic battle with &#x27;El Chicorro&#x27; in Madrid on 11 July 1869.

The development is believed to have cost a total of 6 billion Lire.

==1990–1998==

===Diablo===
The Diablo was presented to the public for sale on 21 January 1990. Its power came from a 5.7 L (348 cu in) dual overhead cam, 4 valves per cylinder version of the existing V12 engine and computer-controlled multi-point fuel injection, producing a maximum output of and of torque to reach a top speed of . The Diablo was rear-wheel drive and the engine was mid-mounted to aid its weight balance. Auto Motor und Sport measured 0- in 4.5 seconds, 0- in 9.3 seconds and 0- in 13.7 seconds.

The Diablo came better equipped than the Countach; standard features included fully adjustable seats and steering wheel, electric windows, an Alpine stereo system, and power steering from 1993 onwards. Anti-lock brakes were not initially available, although they would eventually be used. A few options were available, including a custom-molded driver&#x27;s seat, remote CD changer and subwoofer, rear spoiler, factory fitted luggage set (priced at $2,600) and an exclusive Breguet clock for the dash (priced at $10,500).

===Diablo Roadster Concept===

Introduced at the 1992 Geneva Motor Show, the Diablo roadster concept showcased what a possible open top version of the car would look like. The roof was removed and the car had a shortened visor in place of the windshield which made its way to the doors indicating the adaptation of the barchetta body style. The chassis was strengthened in order to compensate for the loss of the roof and the car featured many unique components some of which made their way to the later variants of the Diablo. Such components included larger air intakes near the rear wing and the sides of the car for better engine cooling, a visor mounted rear view mirror, roll bars over the seats, unique wheels in body colour of the car and a unique engine cover which included a tunnel in the middle for better airflow over the rear view mirror. The signature scissor doors were retained despite the loss of the roof and the interior became more ergonomic and featured a unique two-tone beige colour. The concept generated a positive response among the public and demand among customers for such a car. As the car was not intended for production, German tuner Koenig Specials, with Lamborghini&#x27;s permission, converted customer cars into replicas of the concept. The cars featured different front and rear bumpers along with wheels than that of the concept due to copyright issues along with an upgraded engine. The conversion was no longer offered upon the request of Lamborghini as the company introduced the Diablo VT roadster in 1995.

===Diablo VT===

The Diablo VT was introduced in 1993. Although the VT differed from the standard Diablo in a number of ways, by far the most notable change was the addition of all wheel drive, which made use of a viscous center differential (a modified version of LM002&#x27;s 4WD system). This provided the new nomenclature for the car (VT stands for &quot;viscous traction&quot;). The new drivetrain could direct up to 25% of the torque to the front wheels to aid traction during rear wheel slip, thus significantly improving the handling characteristics of the car.

Other improvements debuting on the VT included front air intakes below the driving lamps to improve brake cooling, larger intakes in the rear arches, a more ergonomic interior with revised electronically adjustable dampers, four-piston brake calipers, power steering and minor engine refinements. Many of these improvements, save for the four-wheel drive system, filtered down to the base Diablo, making the cars nearly identical visually.

===Diablo SE30 and SE30 Jota===

The Diablo SE30 was introduced in 1993 as a limited-production special model to commemorate the company&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The engine received a boost to by means of a tuned fuel system, free-flowing exhaust, and magnesium intake manifolds. The car remained rear-wheel drive to save weight, and omitted the electrically adjustable shock absorbers of the VT model, but was equipped with adjustable-stiffness anti-roll bars which could be controlled from the interior, on the fly.

The car&#x27;s weight was lowered by replacing the power glass side windows with fixed plexiglas (with a small sliding vent window as on many race cars) and removing luxury features such as the air conditioning, stereo, and power steering. Carbon fibre seats with 4-point race harnesses and a fire suppression system added to the race nature of the vehicle.

On the outside, the SE30 differed from other Diablo models with a revised front fascia featuring straked brake cooling ducts and a deeper spoiler, while the rear cooling ducts were changed to a vertical body-colored design. The raging bull emblem was moved from the front of the luggage lid to the nose panel of the car between the front indicators. The engine lid had slats covering the narrow rear window, while a larger spoiler was installed as standard equipment. The single rear fog lamp and rear backup lamp, which had been on either side of the rear grille, were moved into the bumper; this change would be applied to all Diablo models across the lineup. Completing the exterior variations were special magnesium alloy wheels, SE30 badging, and a new metallic purple paint color (this could be changed upon request).

Only 150 SE30 models were built, and of these, about 15 were converted to &quot;Jota&quot; specification (although 28 Jota kits were produced). The &quot;Jota&quot; was a factory modification kit designed to convert the race-oriented SE30 into an actual circuit racer, albeit at the cost of street-legal operation. A revised engine lid with two ducts protruding above the roofline forced air into the intake system; a similar lid design would later be used on the Diablo SV model. With even more tuning of the Diablo&#x27;s venerable V12 engine, it had a power output of and of torque. The rear-view mirror from the interior was also removed because it was completely useless in conjunction with the revised engine lid, further adding to the race feeling of the car.

===Diablo SV===

The Diablo SV was introduced in 1995 at the Geneva Motor Show, reviving the &quot;Super Veloce&quot; title first used on the Miura SV. The SV is based on the standard Diablo and thus lacks the four-wheel drive system of the VT. A notable feature of the SV is an increase in power output to at 7,100 rpm and of torque at 5,900 rpm which, paired with the rear-wheel drive layout, can increase the likelihood of loss of traction during hard driving. Despite its higher power output, the SV was priced as the entry-level model in the Diablo range, falling below the standard Diablo by a small margin. An adjustable rear spoiler was installed as standard equipment and could be color-matched to the car body or formed from carbon fibre. Other exterior changes included black tail lamp surrounds, repositioned rear fog and reverse lamps as on the SE30, dual front fog lamps (rather than the quad style found on all previous models), an extra set of front brake cooling ducts, an engine lid similar to that installed on the Diablo SE30 Jota, and optional &quot;SV&quot; decals for the sides of the car. The SV also featured larger diameter front brakes () and a corresponding increase in front wheel size to 18 inches.

In 1998, a limited 20-car run of the Diablo SV was produced exclusively for the United States market and called the &quot;Monterey Edition&quot;. The most notable feature of this edition was the use of the SE30/VT Roadster style of air intakes in front of the rear wheels, unlike the traditional (and persisting) SV style. Several of the cars were painted in unusual, vibrant colours. One Monterey Edition, featuring an upgraded engine and brakes, was driven by Mario Andretti during the Lamborghini-sponsored &quot;Running of the Bulls&quot; event in California.

&quot;Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit&quot; uses the Lamborghini Diablo SV as the cover car of the game. The Diablo became emblematic of the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; franchise, making several appearances throughout the later entries in the series.

===Diablo VT Roadster===
The Diablo VT Roadster was introduced in December 1995 and featured a manually removable carbon fibre targa top which was stored above the engine lid when not in use. Besides the roof, the roadster&#x27;s body was altered from the fixed-top VT model in a number of ways. The front bumper was revised, replacing the quad rectangular driving lamps with two rectangular and two round units. The brake cooling ducts were moved inboard of the driving lamps and changed to a straked design, while the rear ducts featured the vertical painted design seen on the SE30.
The engine lid was changed substantially in order to provide proper ventilation when the roof panel was covering it. The roadster also featured revised 17 inch wheels and the air intakes on top/sides were made larger than the Diablo coupé. For the 1998 Diablo SV, VT, and VT Roadster, the wheels were updated to 18 inches to accommodate bigger brakes, and the engine power output raised to by adding the variable valve timing system. Top speed was also raised to .

===Diablo SV Roadster===
During 1998, Lamborghini sought to diversify the open top Diablo lineup with the introduction of a rear-wheel-drive variant of the Diablo VT Roadster. Dubbed the Diablo SV Roadster, the car combined the mechanical features offered on the Diablo SV in the open-top configuration of the Diablo VT Roadster. The model retained all the visual elements of the SV variant including the distinctive front bumper, side skirts and the large rear wing along with the repositioned rear lamps. Power output remained the same as the SV coupe at . Only one prototype of the SV roadster was built before Lamborghini decided to halt the project due to the financial turmoil faced by the company as well as the lack of interest in such a variant. When the Milanese distributor of Lamborghini, Emanuele Conforti, came to know about this variant, he requested then CEO Vittorio di Capua to commission one example for him. This resulted in a production example of the SV roadster being completed on 6 April 1998 in the signature Giallo Orion colour scheme with the &quot;SV&quot; decals on the sides of the car bearing the chassis number WLA12960 which brought up the production of this variant to two units, making it the rarest series-production Lamborghini automobile ever built.

==Facelift (1999–2001)==

===Diablo SV (1999)===

The Diablo received a mid-cycle facelift in 1999. Lamborghini simplified the model range by eliminating the &quot;base&quot; Diablo (since the SV model had become the new entry-level trim) and applied universal revisions across the lineup. The most immediately noticeable exterior change was the replacement of the previous Diablo&#x27;s pop-up headlamp units with fixed composite lenses, borrowed under license from their original application in the Nissan 300ZX (Z32). All models were also fitted with new 18 inch wheels.

The Diablo range also received an updated interior. Instead of the traditional flat dashboard with a separate upright instrument binnacle, as in many Italian sports cars of the era (and the outgoing Diablo), the new dashboard was an integrated wave-shaped design. A thin strip of black glass ran the length of the dash and contained various instrument indicator and warning lamps. This aesthetic design was inspired by Bang &amp; Olufsen Hi-Fi products.

The power output of the engine was increased to and of torque for both the SV and VT models and now featured variable valve timing. For the first time in a Lamborghini, the Diablo was equipped with a Kelsey-Hayes ABS system, complementing larger diameter brake rotors.

===Diablo VT and VT Roadster (1999)===

The second generation of the VT coupé and roadster received the same cosmetic and mechanical upgrades as the SV model, including the fixed headlamps, restyled interior, engine power output, and ABS; little else was changed from the previous generation. All US-spec VT models, coupé and roadster alike, shared the same unique front and rear fascias as seen on the original VT Roadster, along with the vertical rear brake ducts that had debuted on the SE30 model; these cosmetic variations were available as options on VT coupés available in the global market.

A special run of twelve Diablo VT models was produced exclusively for the United States market in 1999 and called the &quot;Alpine Edition&quot;. As the Diablo had been utilising Alpine stereo equipment since its inception, this very limited production was intended to showcase and celebrate the Lamborghini/Alpine collaboration. The Alpine Edition was a standard Diablo VT with no engine modifications but having carbon fibre trim in various locations along with highlighting the use of Alpine&#x27;s multimedia system. The stereo receiver was the top-end CVA-1005 model, with integrated navigation system; also included in the package was a DVD player, 6-disc CD changer, and Alpine&#x27;s top-of-the-line tweeters, midrange drivers, and subwoofers along with powered by &quot;Lamborghini&quot; badged Alpine amplifiers. Alpine logos adorned the seat headrests, floor mats, and the special car cover included with this rare model.

Another special twelve-car run of VT models for the US market consisted of VT Roadsters and was called the &quot;Momo Edition&quot;. Like the &quot;Alpine Edition&quot;, the Momo Edition catered to the US car buyer&#x27;s interest in aftermarket products. Lamborghini, rather than spending money to develop certain automotive components, had been using aftermarket suppliers such as Alpine and MOMO to outfit the Diablo. The Momo Edition was again a standard VT Roadster, but featured special upholstery, MOMO 4-point seatbelt harnesses, and MOMO chrome wheels. Like the Alpine Edition, the Momo Edition also had MOMO logos embroidered in the seat headrests and floor mats.

The VT Roadster enjoyed one final limited run of 30 cars for the 2000 model year, after the introduction of the Diablo VT 6.0 (see below). This &quot;Millennium Roadster&quot; model was available in just two colors, Titanium Metallic and yellow, with the 10 cars exported to the United States all finished in Titanium Metallic. Besides an optional carbon fiber spoiler, special two-tone leather interior, and the shorter-ratio SV rear differential (providing enhanced acceleration), this model featured no significant changes from the previous design, and merely served as a final tribute to the outgoing roadster.

===Diablo GT===

Lamborghini introduced the Diablo GT in 1998 with only 80 examples being made available for sale. The Diablo GT, like the SE30 and SE30 Jota before it, was a track-oriented iteration of the Diablo and featured many unique components exclusive to the model. The GT featured aggressive bodywork, a stripped-down interior, and an enlarged engine. The GT variant was exclusive to Europe only, but some were imported into the US.

Exterior changes included an all new black carbon fibre front air dam with large brake ducts and a central vent for the oil cooler (the car still featured driving lamps, the single pair of round units featured on the Diablo VT Roadster). At the front, a large air extractor was added, while the small corner vents on the front quarter panels were changed to NACA style ducts. The front quarter panels themselves were widened to accommodate a wider front track. At the rear, the bumper and its lamps were removed entirely, replaced by a large carbon fibre diffuser which shielded a pair of large center-mounted exhaust pipes. As a result of this modification, the fog and reversing lamps were integrated into the outer pair of the tail lamps. The engine lid featured a large central ram air duct protruding above the roof for better cooling and a rear spoiler was standard equipment. The GT&#x27;s body-work was composed mostly of carbon fibre, with the steel roof and aluminum doors being the only components to retain their standard material. Special 3-piece OZ wheels finished the GT&#x27;s exterior package.

Inside, the GT had more prominent carbon fibre panels, race-spec bucket seats with four-point seatbelt harnesses, a smaller steering wheel, and an optional Alpine LCD screen for GPS navigation along with a bumper mounted reversing camera. Despite the racing pretenses of the model, air conditioning was still installed as standard equipment. The airbags could be optionally omitted.

While the basic V12 block remained the same, the engine was stroked from to for a new displacement of ; this engine, which would later be used in the revised Diablo VT 6.0, had a power output of and of torque. The transmission was the same 5-speed unit as used in other Diablo variants, but different gear ratios could be specified by the buyer. The car omitted the all-wheel-drive system to save weight.

===Diablo VT 6.0 and VT 6.0 SE===
After the acquisition of Lamborghini by Audi AG in 1998, its new owners set out to modernise and refine the Diablo while its replacement, the Murciélago, was being developed. Audi tasked then Lamborghini chief designer Luc Donckerwolke to design a more refined and modern Diablo. The VT 6.0 as a result, featured significant styling changes both inside and out.

On the exterior, the VT 6.0 differed from its predecessors with a revised front fascia that featured two large air intakes (similar to those later used on the Murciélago). The air dam, front bumper, and quarter panels were all reworked, the turn-signals were enlarged and shifted below the headlights, and the small air inlets at the top of the quarter panels were removed. The rear of the car remained familiar, but the taillight surrounds were now body-colored (rather than transparent, red or black) and the lamps themselves used the configuration seen on the track-oriented GT variant. Aluminum 18 inch OZ wheels which were styled with a 5-hole &quot;phone dial&quot; design similar to that seen on the later models of the Countach were used. The interior was refined by improved air-conditioning and revised seat and pedal alignment.

The engine was shared with the limited production GT variant and had updated ECU software in addition to new intake and exhaust systems and a refined variable valve timing system with revised camshafts. The engine had a power output of and of torque.

Due to the development of the Murciélago, the Diablo VT 6.0 was only available in the coupé bodystyle with no more roadster or SV models planned; however, customers could specially order a rear-wheel drive version of the VT 6.0.

At the end of the Diablo&#x27;s production run, the company introduced the limited production Diablo VT 6.0 SE. This model was only available in two colours; the gold metallic &quot;Oro Elios&quot; represented sunrise, while the color-shifting bronze/maroon &quot;Marrone Eklipsis&quot; represented the sunset. Other changes included a new magnesium intake manifold, short-ratio transmission, special upholstery treatment, &quot;Lamborghini&quot; badged brake calipers, comprehensive road map software in the navigation system, and enhanced carbon fibre trim on the interior. The power output remained the same as on the Diablo VT 6.0. Production was limited to 42 units.

==Factory racing specials==

===Diablo Jota GT1 LM===

In early 1995, Lamborghini planned to compete in GT1 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans by entering a Diablo into the competition. Amos Racing in the UK was contracted to develop the vehicle and have it ready in time for the June 1995 24h race, The Larrousse formula one team under contract with Lamborghini at the time did the first testing and shake down on behalf of Lamborghini and Amos racing. Disputes between the factory and the sponsors led to the project&#x27;s demise and the car did not end up competing in the race.

===Diablo Jota JGTC===
In 1995, to compete in the newly formed JGTC class racing in Japan, Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) ordered two Diablos with competition specification from Lamborghini along with at least one road legal variation for homologation purposes. The cars were developed with technical support of Lamborghini Engineering and were allowed to be named Jota. All of the three cars produced still exist in Japan.

The first car, the Jota PO.01, actually competed in JGTC series racing in the 1995 and 1996 seasons. It has a dry-sump engine with Multi Mode Engine Control (MMEC) technology which had been developed during the 1991 Formula One season. The second car, the Jota PO.02, was also developed in 1995 with specifications for endurance racing and competed in the Suzuka 1000 km race. Although it was planned to enter 24 Hours of Le Mans but unknown reasons prevented it from competing The third car, the Jota PO.03, is the road legal homologation special.

===Diablo GT1 Stradale===
Following the foot-steps of Porsche in 1996 with the GT1, a purpose-built racing car that created a stir in motorsports, Lamborghini contracted Signes Advanced Technologies (SAT), a company based in Toulon, France, specialising in manufacturing prototype race cars, to develop a racing version of the Diablo to enter in the GT1 class racing for the second time. The company would build an entirely new chassis made of tubular steel and a carbon fibre body bearing only a slight resemblance to the road going Diablo with Lamborghini supplying the engine and getting the project through homologation.

The 5.7 L V12 engine used in the standard Diablo variants was stroked to a displacement of 6.0 L utilising a reprogrammed engine management system. The new engine had a maximum power output of at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm and transferred the power to the rear wheels through a 6-speed Hewland sequential manual transmission. The finished car weighed a total of making it the lightest Diablo variant ever produced. A very deep chin spoiler and fixed front lamps along with an adjustable rear wing was one of the main changes made to the body work. The front and rear section of the car were entirely removable to allow easy access to the mechanicals of the car, the wheelbase and length of the car was increased than a standard Diablo for enhanced performance. Larger air intakes on the rear, NACA ducts near the doors and air intakes from the Diablo SV improved engine cooling. The car utilised scissor doors and tail lights from a regular Diablo further increasing its resemblance with the road going model. Other features included purpose built race interior, plexiglass windows, 18-inch centre-lock OZ racing wheels and an integrated roll-cage. 

The car was presented in 1997 to the factory in the presence of FIA representatives who approved and homologated the car for racing. However, financial difficulties surrounding Lamborghini at that time forced the company to not go further with the project. Two cars were built, one was meant for racing and one was the road legal version which dropped the rear wing. The racing version was bought by the JLOC racing team from Japan, who used it in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship series from 1997 until 2000 with minimal success. From 2001 to 2003, the racing version competed under the Diablo JGT-1 guise, featuring a reworked chassis and suspension along with other parts independently built by JLOC for JGTC competition. However, it continued to struggle against the factory-backed entries in GT500 and JLOC subsequently retired the car in 2004. The road version remained in the ownership of SAT until it was sold to Mistral Motors in Italy.

===Diablo SV-R===

Unveiled at the 1996 Geneva Motor Show, the Diablo SV-R is a lightweight competition version of the SV and the first Lamborghini to be officially built for motorsport purposes, as Ferruccio Lamborghini had never desired to build &quot;street legal race cars&quot; like rival Ferrari. Rather than comply with the requirements for any established racing series, Lamborghini created its own &quot;Lamborghini Supertrophy&quot; which ran for four years (replaced later with the &quot;GTR Supertrophy&quot; for the Diablo GTR), with its inaugural round held as the support race to the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 28 Diablo SV-R&#x27;s entered, which were built in 4 months on the Diablo assembly line along with production SV&#x27;s, all finished this first event without significant problems.

The Diablo SV-R featured a stripped-down interior with a rollcage, racing seats, and a removable steering wheel; the power glass side windows were replaced with fixed Plexiglass with traditional race-style sliding sections. On the exterior, the electric pop-up headlamps were replaced either with fixed units (similar to those which appeared later on the road cars in 1999) or with air vents for the front brakes. A larger, deeper front spoiler was fitted, while the rear bumper was replaced with a diffuser assembly. The standard rear wing was also replaced with an adjustable carbon fibre unit. Side skirts were added for aerodynamics, but this left so little ground clearance that pneumatic air jacks also had to be installed to raise the car for service in the pit lane. Lightweight, hollow center-lock OZ wheels were used, although these were later switched to stronger Speedline units. Linear-rate springs were used with Koni shock absorbers and were adjusted to about twice the stiffness of stock Diablo SV suspension. With all modifications, the SV-R weighed , less than the standard SV model.

Under the engine lid, the standard 5.7 liter V12 engine remained, but was reworked to have a power output of and of torque by means of a revised fuel system and variable valve timing, which would later appear on production Diablos. The engine was bolted to a 6-speed manual transmission. Each car sold came with a season&#x27;s factory support and an entry to the one-make series. All repairs and maintenance were carried out by Lamborghini.
The series&#x27; first title winner was BPR regular, Thomas Bscher, who became involved with the business side of the brand in later years. In total, 31 examples of the SV-R were produced. Only a few cars have been modified for road use, including one in the United States which received a Diablo VT 6.0 front clip and was painted with the Stars and Stripes.

===Diablo GT2===

Following the success of the Diablo SV-R in lower class racing, Lamborghini decided to enter the Diablo in GT2 class racing. Primarily because of failed attempts in 1995 and 1996 to enter the famed GT1 class. A new car was developed based on the Diablo SV which later became the basis for the infamous Diablo GT and the Diablo GTR, the car was called the Diablo GT2 and it featured a detuned variant of the 6.0 L V12 engine used in the Diablo GT1 Stradale. The engine had a power output of . The interior was stripped of all luxuries and featured a racing steering wheel with an integrated digital speedometer, fire extinguisher system, racing cut off switch, removable engine cover with quick release system, plexiglass windows with sliding sections, integrated roll-cage, fast filling fuel cell system instead of the conventional fuel tank, centre-lock wheels and a large CFRP fixed rear wing. Many features of the car were carried out to the Diablo GT along with later Lamborghini models such as the large air intake at the front, removable engine covers, central dual exhaust system and the engine itself, which was detuned for road usage. The project was scrapped when Audi took over the company. The car was given an update sometime in 2002 and was known as the Diablo GT2 Evoluzione which included different front and rear bumpers, rear wing from the Diablo GTR and a modified air intake system for the engine, but the car was never entered into competitive racing.

===Diablo GTR===

After campaigning the Diablo SV-R for four years in the Diablo Supertrophy, Lamborghini launched a completely new car for the 2000 season. Just as the SV-R was a race-ready SV, the Diablo GTR, introduced at the 1999 Bologna Motor Show, was a Diablo GT converted to a track oriented specification with power and handling improvements, a stripped interior, and weight reduction.

The GTR&#x27;s interior was stripped down to save weight; the air conditioning, stereo, and sound and heatproofing were removed, and a single racing seat with 6-point seatbelt harness, MOMO fire suppression system and steering wheel, complete integrated roll cage, fixed Plexiglass windows with sliding sections, and newly designed air intake were fitted.

The GT had already featured an aggressive, track-oriented styling, but the GTR took this a little further with features such as an even larger rear wing bolted directly to the chassis like a true race car, 18 inch hollow magnesium Speedline centerlock wheels, pneumatic air jacks for raising the car in the pit lane (like the SV-R, it was too low for a rolling jack), and an emergency fuel shutoff switch on the left front fender.

The GTR utilized the same basic 6.0-litre V12 engine that had made its debut on the street-legal GT, but with revised fuel and ignition systems, individual throttle bodies, a dynamic air intake duct system, variable valve timing, titanium connecting rods, and a lightened crankshaft. These improvements allowed the engine to have a power output of and of torque. The engine was bolted to the usual 5-speed transmission in a rear-wheel drive layout. Extra heat exchangers were added for the differential and transmission oil to prevent overheating under extreme racing conditions. A fast-filling racing fuel cell replaced the standard gasoline tank. The suspension was stiffened and lowered, and racing brake calipers were installed.

Thirty cars were initially planned to be produced but actual production amounted to 40 units, and 40 chassis were prepared to replace cars wrecked in racing accidents.

In the hands of multiple Australian Drivers&#x27; Champion Paul Stokell, a Diablo GTR run by Team Lamborghini Australia won the 2003 and 2004 Australian Nations Cup Championships. The GTR was also raced by Stokell, Luke Youlden, Peter Hackett and Danish driver Allan Simonsen in the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour race where after qualifying 6th would go on to finish 8th outright after suffering a number of punctures throughout the race.

=== Introduction ===
In 1995, the ownership of Lamborghini was restructured. Indonesian company V&#x27;Power Corporation held 60 percent of the shareholding while the remaining 40 percent stake was controlled by a Malaysian company MyCom Bhd. The restructured ownership hired Vittorio Di Capua, an infamous automobile industry veteran, who had worked at Fiat S.p.A. for 40 years as the new president and CEO of the company, thus replacing Mike Kimberley who had disagreements with the shareholders. Di Capua, after taking the position, initiated a cost-cutting program that led to the departure of many executives and consultants. Under his guidance, the development of the aging Diablo&#x27;s successor began under the code name P147 (later changed to L147). Di Capua made a decision to use the Diablo&#x27;s chassis and running gear for the working prototypes in order to save development costs. This development program led to the development of two prototypes, named the Kanto and the Acosta.

==== Lamborghini Acosta (1996) ====

Following his involvement in the development of famous Lamborghini models namely the Miura and the Countach, Marcello Gandini, who had now been operating his own design consultancy firm, was entrusted with the design of the Diablo&#x27;s successor. The car called the Acosta was heavily based on the Diablo following the management&#x27;s cost cutting policies and was Gandini&#x27;s interpretation for a modern-day Lamborghini. The Acosta had a fairly angled design language when compared to the Canto (shown below). The large rear cooling intakes were more smooth and were inline with the design language but were followed by equally large outlets at the rear of the car. The front of the car had two thin headlamps joined by a scaffolding which created a bulge on the hood, the bulge were also present on the engine cover to create more room for the engine harking back to the Countach, reducing rear visibility. The wing mirrors were two large units incorporating large openings for better airflow. There was also a small spoiler present on the small window at the rear of the car.

This design was considered too aggressive for a modern Lamborghini and that it was loosely based around the Diablo&#x27;s design. It was ultimately rejected. The only car completed based on Gandini&#x27;s design was left without any running gear and is now stored in the Lamborghini Museum.

==== Zagato Raptor (1996) ====
The Zagato Raptor was a 1996 concept designed by Zagato an based on a Lamborghini Diablo VT. Designed with the iconic double-bubble roof which tilted forwards like a fighter jet canopy to provide access to the interior. The car remained a one off as plans to build a limited production run was cancelled.

==== Lamborghini Canto (1997) ====

After the rejection of Gandini&#x27;s design, many design propositions were made for the Diablo&#x27;s successor. Finally the design penned by Norihiko Harada, chief designer of Italian styling house Zagato was chosen.

The first running prototypes having Harada&#x27;s design began testing in 1997. In the early stages of the car&#x27;s development, the Canto had utilised the engine taken from a Diablo SV before moving on to a more powerful and modified power plant. During testing at the Nardò test track in Italy, the Canto had attained a top speed of , although, this was never officially confirmed.

When Lamborghini was sold to Audi in June 1998, the development work on the successor of the Diablo was overseen by Volkswagen Group president Ferdinand Piëch. He immediately rejected the design because he had been unimpressed by the design language, which was not as aggressive as previous Lamborghini models. He also reprimanded the big side air intakes present on rear of the car which disproportioned the overall look.

Keeping the suggestions in consideration, the car was heavily redesigned in 1999 and special attention was given to shorten the air intakes. The car was to be unveiled to the public at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show with plans of putting it into production but the car did not receive Piëch&#x27;s approval, primarily due to his continuing dissatisfaction with the design along with the use of the Diablo&#x27;s running gear and the project was shelved.

The Canto had later utilised a modified version of the 6.0-litre V12 engine used in Diablo SV-R which generated a maximum power output of during Dyno testing. The engine was detuned to for longevity and easy maintenance.

A claimed total of five cars are said to have been produced with one car (finished in black exterior colour) being sold to a Japanese collector. The Canto concept having the Diablo SV-R powerplant now resides in the Lamborghini Museum.

Following the failure of the two concepts, Piëch initiated development work of the successor of the Diablo from scratch. The design work was entrusted to the then Lamborghini chief designer Luc Donckerwolke and thus the Murciélago was developed.

<text>U.S. Route 49 (US 49) is a north–south United States highway. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Piggott, Arkansas, at an intersection with U.S. Route 62 (US 62). Its southern terminus is in Gulfport, Mississippi, at an intersection with US 90. US 49 is approximately 516 miles (830 km) in length.

It was at the junction of US 49 and U.S. Route 61 that blues singer Robert Johnson is said to have sold his soul to the Devil. The highway is also the subject of songs by Big Joe Williams and Howlin&#x27; Wolf (Chester Arthur Burnett).

US 49 has historically been one of the most important highways in Mississippi. It was the state&#x27;s first highway to see a significant rural segment four-laned. Today, it is the only four-laned route directly connecting Jackson, the state&#x27;s capital and largest city, to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Some urban segments along this portion of the route maintain three or more traffic lanes in each direction. US 49 serves as a primary hurricane evacuation route for Gulf Coast residents.
US 49 begins near the Port of Gulfport, Mississippi at a junction with US 90. It provides a major connection between the port, casinos, beaches and downtown with I-10 (exits 34A-B), where it has its first major junction being a full service cloverleaf interchange on the city&#x27;s north end. The crossing of these two roads is officially recognized by the state of Mississippi as the Castilgia Interchange. North of I-10, US 49 passes through suburban areas and enters De Soto National Forest. Various state highway interchanges and junctions are encountered before the route passes near Camp Shelby, then through an interchange with US 98 just south of Hattiesburg. At this point, travelers have an option of continuing on US 49 through Hattiesburg or using the I-59/US 98 bypass which reconnects with US 49 in the northern part of the city. Continuing on US 49 brings one to a cloverleaf interchange at US 11, one of very few in the South to lack merging lanes between loop ramps, thus exacerbating the weaving patterns which plague many cloverleaf interchanges.

US 49 passes Hattiesburg&#x27;s primary medical facility, Forrest General Hospital, and the campus of the University of Southern Mississippi before arriving at another, more standard cloverleaf interchange with I-59. Those who used the aforementioned bypass, wishing to reconnect with US 49 North to the state capital, must use exit 67B. It is also at I-59, where Mississippi Highway 42 (MS 42) runs with US 49 for a short distance as suburban development is soon encountered as the road returns to rural environs. Eventually, MS 42 departs from the four-laned highway and branches off to the west toward smaller towns, starting with Sumrall. Interchanges between Hattiesburg and Jackson provide access to various state highways, and one at Collins provides access to US 84.
At Jackson, US 49 upgrades to Interstate Highway standards before joining I-20 using a two-lane flyover. About a mile later, I-20/US 49 merges with I-55 at a stack interchange. I-20/I-55/US 49 crosses the Pearl River into Hinds County and bypasses Downtown Jackson, where I-55 departs to the south. US 49/I-20 continue west until US 49 ends its run with I-20 and joins I-220 before turning northwest to Yazoo City. A split in the highway, rare in the U.S. Highway System, begins here; both routes head into the Mississippi Delta, US 49W serving the towns of Belzoni and Indianola, where it junctions with US 82 and its four-lane segment ends, while two-laned US 49E serves Tchula before encountering US 82 at Greenwood. Both routes continue north from US 82 and are linked again at Tutwiler. Continuing northwest, the highway passes through an interchange with US 61 as it enters Clarksdale. It is at Clarksdale that US 49 encounters &quot;The Crossroads&quot;, the legendary junction with State Street (an old alignment of US 61) where the great blues musician Robert Johnson is reputed to have sold his soul to the devil.

From Clarksdale, US 49 continues north and crosses the Mississippi River using the Helena Bridge where it enters Arkansas near the town of Helena.


In May 2005 portions of extant US 49E were renamed the &quot;Emmett Till Memorial Highway&quot;.

The Mississippi section of US 49 and the routes of US 49E and US 49W are defined at Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3.

===Arkansas===
US 49 enters Arkansas near Helena-West Helena in Phillips County. US 49 Business runs around the north part of the city, with the main route meeting AR 242 in the southern portion. US 49 continues west to Walnut Corner where the route meets AR 1 (and briefly AR 316). The US 49/AR 1 concurrency ends in Marvell and US 49 enters Monroe County.

Upon entering Monroe County, US 49 turns north to begin a concurrency with AR 39. US 49 also crosses US 79 before meeting US 70 near Brinkley. The route crosses Interstate 40 north of Brinkley prior to entering Woodruff County. US 49 runs northeast through rural Woodruff County, not crossing of concurring with any important routes before crossing into Cross County.

The route meets US 64 in Fair Oaks and meets AR 42 in southern Hickory Ridge. It then enters Poinsett County, concurring with AR 214 from Fisher until Waldenburg. The route crosses AR 14 in Waldenburg.

US 49 runs along south Jonesboro, with US 49 Business formerly running into town. US 49 concurs with US 63 until again joining AR 1. The two routes angle north through downtown Jonesboro, crossing US 63 Business and passing by ASU Stadium before leaving town. US 49/AR 1 pass around Brookland, with US 49 Business serving the community.

Entering Greene County, US 49/AR 1 intersects US 412 and briefly meets AR 358 before entering Paragould. The routes cross US 412B near Kirk Field in Paragould, also meeting AR 135 north of town. US 49B also rejoins US 49/AR 1 north of Paragould.

Continuing northeast through rural Greene County, US 49/AR 1 meet AR 34 in Marmaduke and AR 90 in Rector. The route turns north to Piggott at Hargrave Corner, terminating at US 62/AR 139. The Arkansas portion of US 49 is mainly two-lane undivided.

==History==
One of the original US highways, US 49 was extended north from Clarksdale, Mississippi to US 70 in Brinkley, Arkansas via U.S. Route 61 and Highway 6 in 1963. US 49 was again extended north in 1978, replacing Highway 39 between Brinkley and Jonesboro. Highway 1 between Jonesboro and Piggott was redesignated as US 49 in 1979.

It is notable that for several years during the 1930s, a second split route existed on US 49 in South Mississippi, similar to but shorter than the split that still exists in the Delta region. Between Brooklyn and Hattiesburg, travelers had the option of a direct route via US 49W, or a somewhat shorter but broken route on US 49E, serving the Forrest County Agricultural High School and the small community of McLaurin, Mississippi.

<text>Shelta (; Irish: ) is a language spoken by Irish Travellers (), particularly in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It is widely known as the Cant, to its native speakers in Ireland as &#x27; or &#x27;, and to the linguistic community as Shelta. Other terms for it include the Seldru, and Shelta Thari, among others. The exact number of native speakers is hard to determine due to sociolinguistic issues but &quot;Ethnologue&quot; puts the number of speakers at 30,000 in the UK, 6,000 in Ireland, and 50,000 in the US. The figure for at least the UK is dated to 1990. It is not clear if the other figures are from the same source.

Linguistically Shelta is today seen as a mixed language that stems from a community of travelling people in Ireland that was originally predominantly Irish-speaking. The community later went through a period of widespread bilingualism that resulted in a language based heavily on Hiberno-English with heavy influences from Irish. As different varieties of Shelta display different degrees of anglicisation, it is hard to determine the extent of the Irish substratum. The &quot;Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; puts it at 2,000–3,000 words.

==Names and etymology==
The language is known by various names. People outside the Irish Traveller community often refer to it as &quot;[the] Cant&quot;, the etymology of which is a matter of debate. Speakers of the language refer to it as &quot;[the] Cant&quot;, or . Amongst linguists, the name &quot;Shelta&quot; is the most commonly used term.

Variants of the above names and additional names include &quot;Bog Latin&quot;, &quot;Gammon&quot;, &quot;Sheldru&quot;, &quot;Shelter&quot;, &quot;Shelteroch&quot;, &quot;the Ould Thing&quot;, &quot;Tinker&#x27;s Cant&quot;, and &quot;Shelta Thari&quot;.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;Shelta&quot; appeared in print for the first time in 1882, in the book &quot;The Gypsies&quot; by the &quot;gypsiologist&quot; Charles Leland, who claimed to have discovered it as the &quot;fifth Celtic tongue&quot;. The word&#x27;s etymology has long been a matter of debate. Modern Celticists believe that Irish &quot;to walk&quot; is at the root, either via a term such as &#x27;a walker&#x27; or a form of the verbal noun , cf. , &#x27;the walking people&#x27;, lit. &#x27;the people of walks&#x27;, the traditional Irish term for Travellers. 

The &quot;Dictionary of Hiberno-English&quot; cites it as possibly a corruption of the word &quot;Celt&quot;. Since Shelta is a mixture of English and Irish grammar, the etymology is not straightforward. The language is made up mostly of Irish lexicon, being classified as a grammar-lexicon language with the grammar being English-based.

==Origins and history==
Linguists have been documenting Shelta since at least the 1870s. The first works were published in 1880 and 1882 by Charles Leland. Celticist Kuno Meyer and Romani expert John Sampson both assert that Shelta existed as far back as the 13th century.

In the earliest but undocumented period, linguists surmise that the Traveller community was Irish-speaking until a period of widespread bilingualism in Irish and Hiberno-English, and Scots language in Scotland set in, leading to creolisation (possibly with a trilingual stage). The resulting language is referred to as Old Shelta, and it is suspected that this stage of the language displayed distinctive features, such as non-English syntactic and morphological features, no longer found in Shelta.

Within the diaspora, various sub-branches of Shelta exist. Shelta in England is increasingly undergoing anglicisation. American Irish-Traveller&#x27;s Cant, originally synonymous with Shelta, has by now been almost fully anglicised.

==Linguistic features==
Sociologist Sharon Gmelch describes the Irish Travellers&#x27; language as follows:

Thus, by design, it is not mutually intelligible with either English or Irish.

Shelta is a secret language. Travellers do not like to share the language with outsiders, named , or non-travellers. When speaking Shelta in front of Buffers, Travellers will disguise the structure so as to make it seem like they aren&#x27;t speaking Shelta at all.

===Lexicon===
While Shelta is influenced by English grammar, it is a mixture of Irish words as well. The word order is altered, syllables are reversed, and many of the original words are Irish that have been altered or reversed. Many Shelta words have been disguised using techniques such as back slang, where sounds are transposed. For example, &#x27;kiss&#x27; from Irish , or the addition of sounds, for example &#x27;father&#x27; from Irish . Other examples include or &#x27;girl&#x27; from Irish , and the word &#x27;door&#x27; from Irish .

===Grammar===
Shelta shares its main syntactic features with Hiberno-English and the majority of its morphological features such as &quot;-s&quot; plurals and past tense markers. Compare:
There is not as much importance put on gender in Shelta as in Irish. Plurals are shown with the English suffix /-s/ or /-i/, such as for &#x27;man&#x27; becomes for &#x27;men&#x27;.

=== Phonology ===
Shelta has 27 consonants and 6 phonemic vowels.

Many words are complex by incorporating numerous consonants within, as in the word for &#x27;tree, bush&#x27; with the consonant /ꭕ/ being a hissing sound that is held in the back of the throat, and is held longer than other consonants.
The vowel system features phonemic lengthening for all vowels except for //. Additionally, [ey, iy, ow, uw] can be realized as diphthongs in certain varieties of Shelta. 
==Loanwords==
Some Shelta words have been borrowed by mainstream English speakers, such as the word &quot;bloke&quot; meaning &#x27;a man&#x27; in the mid-19th century.

==Orthography==
There is no standard orthography. Broadly speaking, Shelta can either be written following an Irish-type orthography or an English-type orthography. For example, the word for &#x27;married&#x27; can either be spelled or ; the word for &#x27;woman&#x27; can either be spelled or .

==Comparison texts==
Below are reproductions of the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; in Shelta as it occurred a century ago, current Shelta Cant, and modern English and Irish versions for comparison. The 19th-century Shelta version shows a high Shelta lexical content while the later Cant version shows a much lower Shelta lexical content. Both versions are adapted from Hancock who notes that the Cant reproduction is not exactly representative of actual speech in normal situations.

<doc id="196313" wikidata="Q1291423" url="?curid=196313" title="St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church">
<text>The Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas () is a medieval church building in Galway, Ireland. It is a collegiate church and the parish church of St. Nicholas Church of Ireland parish, which covers Galway City. It was founded in 1320 and dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Myra, the patron saint of seafarers, in recognition of Galway&#x27;s status as a port. The monumental work of Irish genealogy, the Leabhar na nGenealach was produced here in 1650 by Duḃaltaċ MacḞirḃisiġ (Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh).

==Wardenship of Galway==
The church was raised to the status of a collegiate church by letters under the seal of Donatus Ó Muireadhaigh, the Archbishop of Tuam, on 28 September 1484, the same year in which Galway was granted a royal charter and given mayoral status. The granting of collegiate status was confirmed on 8 September 1485 by a papal bull issued by Pope Innocent VIII (&quot;Super Dominicum Gregem&quot;). Both events were commemorated in the Galway quincentennial year, 1984.

The granting of collegiate status in 1484 required that the City of Galway and some surrounding parishes be severed from the Archdiocese of Tuam. The priests of the city were constituted into a College of Vicars, the senior of whom was called the warden. The warden, a position and title unique in Irish ecclesiastical history, was the spiritual leader of the city and was entitled to wear attire traditionally associated with a bishop (such as the mitre and crosier), while not having the power of ordination. The warden and eight assisting vicars choral were elected every year in August by the mayor and members of the Corporation (city council) as then constituted. The warden presented himself for election every year; there was to be an election for the post of vicar only when there was a vacancy. The vicars were elected from the secular clergy, for life. The clergy were to be learned, virtuous and well-bred, and were to observe the English Rite and custom in the Divine Service.

At first, only the city and the parish of Claregalway constituted the wardenship. However, by the end of the century, the parishes of Oranmore and Maree, Oughterard, Rahoon, Moycullen and Skryne were included. The Archbishop of Tuam retained some vaguely defined visitation rights. The Protestant Reformation saw the creation of a second Anglican Wardenship that enjoyed the sponsorship of the government and an underground Roman Catholic Wardenship. The Anglican wardenship, however, never enjoyed popular support. These Wardenships continued until the early 19th century. The Anglican Wardenship was discontinued by the Church of Ireland and replaced by the parish of Galway under the care of a rector, while the Roman Catholic Wardenship was discontinued by the Holy See and the city and a large area of its hinterland was reconstituted as the Diocese of Galway.

==Historical notes==
Over the centuries St. Nicholas&#x27;s has played a central role in the life of the city. For many years the triennial elections of the mayor and corporation (city council) were held within its walls. Only male members of fourteen select Galway families, known as the Tribes of Galway, had suffrage.

Local legend states that Christopher Columbus worshipped there when he visited the city in 1477.

==Modern times==
In September 2002 the Collegiate Church attracted controversy when it was the scene of the first public blessing for a same-sex couple in an Irish church. The Avowing Friendship service for a lesbian couple, it was reported, was conducted by the rector, the Reverend Patrick Towers, in September 2002. The Bishop of Tuam, Richard Henderson, prohibited any further services of this kind, and Towers agreed to abide by this ruling.

The church was used for Catholic Mass by the congregation of St Augustine&#x27;s Church during the refurbishment of their church between April and December 2005. This generous act cemented good local relations between the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church. In gratitude for this, the parishioners of St Augustine&#x27;s presented the Collegiate Church with a processional cross. The church is regularly used for worship by the Romanian and Russian Orthodox Churches, and the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church.

The Reverend Patrick Towers was succeeded in July 2009 by Archdeacon Gary Hastings as Rector of St. Nicholas. Archdeacon Hastings is a well-known Irish traditional flute player, and author of &quot;With Fife and Drum&quot;, a study of the Orange Lambeg and fifing traditions of Ulster. He has played with the Chieftains, and plays with Fr. Séamus Quinn on the CD &quot;Slán le Loch Éirne&quot;. Hastings was succeeded in September 2018 by the Very Rev Lynda Peilow, the first woman to serve as Rector.

Every year on the Sunday before Christmas, the church holds the Civic Carol Service of Nine Lessons and Carols attended by the Mayor and City Council in full ceremonial robes and accompanied by the symbols of mayoral dignity - the Great Mace and Civic Sword. The service concludes with the solemn blessing of the city by the assembled clergy of many denominations including the Anglican Bishop of Tuam and the RC Bishop of Galway.

<doc id="196318" wikidata="Q183848" url="?curid=196318" title="Alija Izetbegović">
<text>Alija Izetbegović (; 8 August 1925 – 19 October 2003) was a Bosnian politician, Islamic philosopher and author, who in 1992 became the first president of the Presidency of the newly independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He later served as the first chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Shortly after his term began, the country&#x27;s Serb community revolted and created the Republika Srpska, attempting to prevent the secession of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia, which would lead to the outbreak of the Bosnian War. Izetbegović led the Bosniak forces initially alongside the Croat forces, until a separate war erupted between them. Relations between the two sides were resolved in the Washington Agreement, which he signed with Croatian president Franjo Tuđman. 

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued, with widespread ethnic cleansing and other war crimes committed, mostly by Bosnian Serb forces against the civil population throughout Bosnia. Massacres such as those in Foča, Doboj, Bosanski Šamac, Višegrad and Prijedor were icons of the brutality of the Bosnian Serb Army during the conflict, as well as ethnically cleansing of Bosniaks in Lašva Valley by the Croats. The war crimes committed by the Serbs eventually culminated in the massacre of male Bosniaks in Srebrenica by Serb forces which would later be determined to be genocide. Izetbegović was also a signatory for the Dayton Agreement, which ended the war in a stalemate following NATO bombings, and recognized Republika Srpska as an autonomous entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. He continued to serve in this role until 1996, when he became a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, serving until 2000.

Izetbegović was the founder and first president of the Party of Democratic Action. He was also the author of several books, most notably &quot;Islam Between East and West&quot; and the &quot;Islamic Declaration&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Izetbegović was born on 8 August 1925 in the town of Bosanski Šamac. While serving as a soldier in Üsküdar, Izetbegović&#x27;s paternal grandfather Alija married a Turkish woman named Sıdıka Hanım. The couple eventually moved to Bosanski Šamac and had five children. Izetbegović&#x27;s grandfather later became the town&#x27;s mayor.

Izetbegović&#x27;s father, an accountant, had fought for the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Italian Front during World War I and sustained serious injuries which left him in a semi-paralyzed state for at least a decade. He declared bankruptcy in 1927. The following year, the family moved to Sarajevo, where Izetbegović received a secular education.

In 1941, Izetbegović helped to found a Bosnian Islamist organization named &quot;Young Muslims&quot; (&quot;Mladi Muslimani&quot;), which was modeled after the Muslim Brotherhood. When the &quot;Young Muslims&quot; became torn between supporting the largely Muslim &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; Handschar Division or the communist Yugoslav Partisans, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, he joined the SS &quot;Handschar&quot;, despite a lack of evidence. Izetbegović&#x27;s family denied the claim and claimed that he had joined the communist Yugoslav Partisans. Izetbegović was detained by the Serb royalist Chetniks in mid-1944, but released by Chetnik voivode Dragutin Keserović. He was arrested by the Yugoslav communists following the war and sentenced to three years in prison in 1946 on charges of collaborating with the Nazi forces. Before incarceration, he had earned a law degree at the University of Sarajevo&#x27;s Faculty of Law. He remained engaged in politics after serving the sentence.

==Dissident and activist==
In 1970, Izetbegović published a manifesto entitled the &quot;Islamic Declaration&quot;, expressing his views on relationships between Islam, state and society. The manifesto was banned by the government. In it, he tried to reconcile Western-style progress with Islamic tradition. The work issued a call for &quot;Islamic renewal&quot; without mentioning Yugoslavia specifically. However, he and his supporters were accused by the Communist authorities of reviving the &quot;Young Muslims&quot; organisation and of a conspiracy to set up an &quot;Islamically pure&quot; Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The declaration designated Pakistan as a model country to be emulated by Muslim revolutionaries worldwide. One of the passages that was in particular picked out by his opponents during the trial was, &quot;There can be no peace or coexistence between the Islamic faith and non-Islamic social and political institutions...the state should be an expression of religion and should support its moral concepts.&quot; The declaration remains a source of controversy. Serbs, who were opposed to Izetbegović, often quoted the declaration as indicative of an intent to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Bosnia.

He himself later insisted many times that the statements about the creation of an Islamic state were hypothetical and were not to be the applied to the situation in Bosnia. Regardless, Bosnia&#x27;s non-Muslim population were unsettled by several of his statements in his writings. Passages from the declaration were frequently quoted by Izetbegović&#x27;s opponents during the 1990s, who considered it to be an open statement of Islamic fundamentalism. This opinion is also shared by some Western authors. Izetbegović vigorously denied these accusations.

===Imprisonment===
Izetbegović was first arrested in 1946 aged twenty-one. He was sentenced to jail in various cases in a total for 8 years for his membership in an organization fighting for human rights and religious rights.

In April 1983, Izetbegović and twelve other Bosniak activists (including Melika Salihbegović, Edhem Bičakčić, Omer Behmen, Mustafa Spahić and Hasan Čengić) were tried before a Sarajevo court for a variety of charges called &quot;offences as principally hostile activity inspired by Islamic ideologies, association for purposes of hostile activity and hostile propaganda&quot;. Izetbegović was further accused of organizing a visit to a Muslim congress in Iran. All of those tried were convicted and Izetbegović was sentenced to fourteen years in prison.

The verdict was strongly criticised by Western human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch, which claimed the case was based on &quot;communist propaganda&quot;, and the accused were not charged with either using or advocating violence. The following May, the Bosnian Supreme Court conceded the point with an announcement that &quot;some of the actions of the accused did not have the characteristics of criminal acts&quot; and reduced Izetbegović&#x27;s sentence to twelve years. In 1988, as communist rule faltered, he was pardoned and released after almost five years in prison. His health had suffered serious damage.

==Early political career and 1990 election==
The introduction of a multi-party system in Yugoslavia at the end of the 1980s prompted Izetbegović and other Bosniak activists to establish a political party, the Party of Democratic Action (&quot;Stranka Demokratske Akcije&quot;, SDA) in 1990. It had a largely Muslim character; similarly, the other principal ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs and Croats, also established ethnically based parties (SDS and HDZ BiH). The SDA won the largest share of the vote, 33% of the seats, with the next runners-up being nationalist ethnic parties representing Serbs and Croats. Fikret Abdić won the popular vote for Presidency member among the Bosniak candidates, with 44% of the vote, Izetbegović with 37%. According to the Bosnian constitution, the first two candidates of each of the &quot;three constitutient nations&quot; would be elected to a seven-member multi-ethnic rotating presidency (with two Croats, two Serbs, two Bosniaks and one Yugoslav); a Croat took the post of prime minister and a Serb the presidency of the Assembly. Abdić agreed to stand down as the Bosniak candidate for the Presidency and Izetbegović became Chairman of the Presidency.

==Presidency (1990–2000)==
Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s power-sharing arrangements broke down very quickly as ethnic tensions grew after the outbreak of fighting between Serbs and Croats in neighboring Croatia. Although Izetbegović was due to hold the presidency for only one year according to the constitution, this arrangement was initially suspended due to &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; and was eventually abandoned altogether during the war as the Serb and Croat nationalistic parties SDS and HDZ BiH abandoned the government. When fighting broke out in Slovenia and Croatia in the summer of 1991, it was immediately apparent that Bosnia and Herzegovina would soon become embroiled in the conflict. Izetbegović initially proposed a loose confederation to preserve a unitary Bosnian state and strongly urged a peaceful solution. He did not subscribe to the &quot;peace at all costs&quot; view and commented in February 1991 that &quot;I would sacrifice peace for a sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina ... but for that peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina I would not sacrifice sovereignty.&quot; He abandoned the Zulfikarpašić–Karadžić agreement which would see Bosnia as a sovereign state in a confederation with Serbia and Montenegro, with 60% of Sandžak ceded to Bosnia.

On 6 October 1991, Izetbegović gave a televised proclamation of neutrality, it included the statement &quot;it is not our war&quot;. Izetbegović made a statement before the Bosnian parliament on 14 October with regard to the JNA: &quot;Do not do anything against the Army. (...) the presence of the Army is a stabilizing factor to us, and we need that Army... Until now, we did not have problems with the Army, and we will not have problems later.&quot; Izetbegović had a testy exchange with Bosnian Serb leader and SDS president Radovan Karadžić in parliament on that day. After Karadžić wagered that the Bosniak Muslims could not defend themselves if a state of war developed, Izetbegović observed that he found Karadžić&#x27;s manner and speech offensive and it explained why the Bosniaks felt unwelcome, that his tone might explain why the others federated by Yugoslavia felt repelled, and that the threats of Karadžić were unworthy of the Serb people.

By the start of 1992, it had become apparent that the rival nationalist demands were fundamentally incompatible: the Bosniaks and Croats sought an independent Bosnia and Herzegovina while the Serbs wanted it to remain in a rump Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. Izetbegović publicly complained that he was being forced to ally with one side or the other, vividly characterising the dilemma by comparing it to having to choose between leukemia and a brain tumour. In January 1992, Portuguese diplomat José Cutileiro drafted a plan, later known as the Lisbon Agreement, that would turn Bosnia into a triethnic cantonal state. Initially, all three sides signed up to the agreement; Izetbegović for the Bosniaks, Karadžić for the Serbs and Mate Boban for the Croats. Some two weeks later, however, Izetbegović withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any type of partition of Bosnia, supposedly encouraged by Warren Zimmermann, the United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia at the time.

===Bosnian War===
In February 1992, Izetbegović called an independence referendum on the European condition for recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state, despite warnings from the Serb members of the presidency that it was unconstitutional and that any move towards independence would result in the Serb-inhabited areas seceding to remain with the rump Yugoslavia. The referendum achieved a 99.4% vote in favor on a 63% turnout, largely boycotted by the Serbs. Namely, according to the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the change of the state-legal status was not possible without the national consensus of all three nations. This mechanism was incorporated into the constitution due to the genocide committed against Serbs in World War II, which disturbed the ethnic balance. Another possibility was for two-thirds of the citizens to vote in a referendum to leave the Yugoslav federation. The Serbs did not agree with the secession from Yugoslavia. Furthermore, less than two-thirds of the population went to the referendum. Nevertheless, the EU and the US accepted the referendum.

The Bosnian parliament, already vacated by the Bosnian Serbs, formally declared independence from Yugoslavia on 29 February and Izetbegović announced the country&#x27;s independence on 3 March. It did not take effect until 7 April 1992, when the European Union and United States recognized the new country. Sporadic fighting between Serbs and government forces occurred across Bosnia in the run-up to international recognition. Izetbegović appears to have gambled that the international community would send a peacekeeping force upon recognising Bosnia in order to prevent a war, but this did not happen. Instead, war immediately broke out across the country as Serb and Yugoslav army forces took control of large areas against the poorly equipped government security forces. Initially, Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces systematically ransacked or burnt down Bosniak houses and apartments, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, including also being raped repeatedly by Serb soldiers or policemen.

Izetbegović consistently promoted the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia under central control, which seemed a hopeless strategy under the circumstances. The Bosnian Croats, disillusioned with the Sarajevo government and supported militarily and financially by the Croatian government, increasingly turned to establishing their own ethnically based state of &quot;Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia&quot; in Herzegovina and Central Bosnia. The Croats pulled out of the Sarajevo government and fighting broke out in 1993. In some areas local armistices were signed between the Serbs and Croats. Croat forces launched their first attacks on Bosniaks in central Bosnia in June 1992, but these failed. The Graz agreement caused deep division among Bosnian Croats and strengthened separatist Herzeg-Bosnia, and led to the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing campaign against Bosniak civilians from May 1992 to March 1993.

Adding to the general confusion, Izetbegović&#x27;s former colleague Fikret Abdić established an &quot;Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia&quot; in parts of Cazin and Velika Kladuša municipalities in opposition to the Sarajevo government and in cooperation with Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tuđman. Abdić&#x27;s faction was eventually routed by the Bosnian army. By this time, Izetbegović&#x27;s government controlled only about 25% of the country and represented principally the Bosniak community.

For three and a half years, Izetbegović lived precariously in a besieged Sarajevo surrounded by Serb forces. He denounced the failure of Western countries to reverse Serbian aggression and turned instead to the Muslim world, with which he had already established relations during his days as a dissident. The Bosnian government received money and arms. Osama bin Laden was given a Bosnian passport during Izetbegović&#x27;s presidency and went on to visit Bosnia and Kosovo several times. Bin Laden stated to a German reporter that he planned to bring Muslim volunteers to Bosnia. Following massacres on Bosnian Muslims by Serb and, to a lesser extent, Croat forces, foreign Muslim volunteers joined the Bosnian army in the so-called Bosnian mujahideen, numbering between 300 and 1,500. They quickly attracted heavy criticism amplified by Serb and Croat propaganda, who considered their presence to be evidence of &quot;violent Islamic fundamentalism&quot; at the heart of Europe. However, the foreign volunteers became unpopular even with many of the Bosniak population, because the Bosnian army had thousands of troops and no need for more soldiers, but for arms. Many Bosnian army officers and intellectuals were suspicious regarding foreign volunteers&#x27; arrival in the central part of the country, because they came from Split and Zagreb in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed Herzeg-Bosnia unlike Bosnian army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. According to general Stjepan Šiber, the highest-ranking ethnic Croat in the Bosnian army, the key roles in the foreign volunteers&#x27; arrival were played by Franjo Tuđman and Croatian counter-intelligence underground with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and mass crimes committed by Croat forces. Although Izetbegović regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world&#x27;s support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability.

In 1993, Izetbegović agreed to a peace plan that would divide Bosnia along ethnic lines but continued to insist on a unitary Bosnia government from Sarajevo and on the allocation to the Bosniaks of a large percentage of Bosnia&#x27;s territory. The war between the Bosniaks and Croats was eventually ended by a truce brokered with the aid of the Americans in March 1994, following which the two sides collaborated more closely against the Serbs. NATO then became increasingly involved in the conflict with occasional &quot;pinprick&quot; bombings conducted against the Bosnian Serbs, generally following violations of ceasefires and the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The Bosnian Croat forces benefited indirectly from US military training given to the Croatian Army. In addition, the Croatians provided considerable quantities of weaponry to the Bosnian Croats and much smaller amounts to the Bosnian army, despite a UN weapons embargo. Most of the Bosnian army&#x27;s supply of weapons was airlifted from the Muslim world, specifically Iran – an issue which became the subject of some controversy and a US congressional investigation in 1996. In September 1993, the Second Bosniak Congress officially re-introduced the historical ethnic name Bosniaks. The Yugoslav &quot;Muslims by nationality&quot; policy was considered by Bosniaks to be neglecting and opposing their Bosnian identity because the term tried to describe Bosniaks as a religious group, not an ethnic one.

====Ending the war====
The Washington Agreement in March 1994 ended the Croat-Bosniak War and divided the combined ARBiH and HVO territory into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In August 1995, following the Srebrenica massacre and the 2nd Markale massacre, NATO launched an intensive bombing campaign which destroyed the Bosnian Serb command and control system. This allowed the Croatian and Bosniak forces to overrun many Serb-held areas of the country, producing a roughly 50/50 split of the territory between the two sides. The offensive came to a halt not far from the de facto Serb capital of Banja Luka.

When the Croat and Bosniak forces stopped their advance they had captured the power plants supplying Banja Luka&#x27;s electricity and used that control to pressure the Serb leadership into accepting a ceasefire. The parties agreed to meet at Dayton, Ohio to negotiate a peace treaty under the supervision of the United States. Serb and Croat interests were represented by Milošević and Tuđman, respectively. Izetbegović represented the internationally recognized Bosnian government.

====After the war====
After the Bosnian War was formally ended by the Dayton peace accord in November 1995, Izetbegović became a Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. His party&#x27;s power declined after the international community installed a High Representative to oversee affairs of state, with more power than the Presidency or parliaments of either the Bosniak-Croat or Serb entities. He stepped down in October 2000 at the age of 74, citing poor health. However, Izetbegović remained popular with the Bosniak public, who nicknamed him &quot;Dedo&quot; (which in Bosnian means &quot;grandfather&quot;). His endorsement helped his party to bounce back in the 2002 general election. Some observers have described his rule as authoritarian with nationalist positions.

==Death==

Izetbegović died on 19 October 2003 of heart disease complicated by injuries suffered from a fall at home. An ICTY investigation of Izetbegović was in progress, but ended with his death. His funeral, held three days after his death, on 22 October, drew many Bosnian officials, dignitaries from 44 foreign countries, 105 members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and between 100,000 and 150,000 people, with his family receiving over 4,000 telegrams. Over 400 journalists attended the funeral as it was broadcast live on TV with 37 cameras.

Following Izetbegović&#x27;s death there was an initiative to rename a part of the main street of Sarajevo from Ulica Maršala Tita (Marshal Tito Street) and the Sarajevo International Airport in his honor. Following objections from politicians from Republika Srpska, the international community, and UN envoy Paddy Ashdown, both initiatives failed.

He had a son, Bakir, who also entered politics and served as Presidency member from 2010 to 2018, as well as two granddaughters (Jasmina and Mirzela Izetbegović).

On 11 August 2006, Izetbegović&#x27;s grave at the Kovači cemetery in Sarajevo was badly damaged by a bomb. The identity of the bomber or bombers has never been determined.

* The three awards Steely Dan won were their first ever career Grammy wins.
* Eminem&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, which had several nominations, including Album of the Year, caused outrage. 200 protesters on behalf of GLAAD and other groups gathered outside the Staples Center to protest Eminem&#x27;s album which they considered homophobic and sexist. He performed his hit single &quot;Stan&quot; as a duet with openly gay musician Elton John at the ceremony in response to these allegations. This version is also featured as the final track on Eminem&#x27;s 2005 compilation &quot;Curtain Call: The Hits&quot;.

<doc id="196323" wikidata="Q190025" url="?curid=196323" title="Federal Republic of Central America">
<text>The Federal Republic of Central America (), initially known as the United Provinces of Central America (), was a sovereign state in Central America that existed between 1823 and 1839/1841. The republic was composed of five states (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), and a Federal District from 1835 to 1839. Guatemala City was its capital city until 1834, when the seat of government was relocated to San Salvador. The Federal Republic of Central America was bordered on the north by Mexico, on the south by Gran Colombia and on its eastern coastline by the Mosquito Coast and British Honduras, both claimed by the federal republic.

After Central America (then known as the Captaincy General of Guatemala) declared its independence from the Spanish Empire in September 1821, it was annexed by the First Mexican Empire in January 1822 before regaining its independence and forming a federal republic in 1823. The Federal Republic of Central America adopted its constitution, based on that of the federal government of the United States, in November 1824. It held its first presidential election in April 1825, during which liberal politician Manuel José Arce was elected as the country&#x27;s first president. Arce subsequently aligned himself with the country&#x27;s conservatives due to liberal opposition to the concessions he granted conservatives to secure his election as president. The republic was politically unstable, experiencing civil wars, rebellions, and insurrections by liberals and conservatives. From 1827 to 1829, it fell into a civil war between conservatives who supported Arce and liberals who opposed him. Liberal politician Francisco Morazán led the liberals to victory, and was elected president in 1830. The republic descended into a second civil war from 1838 to 1840, by the end of which the states of Central America declared independence and the federal republic ceased to exist.

Historians have attributed the country&#x27;s political instability to its federal system of government and its economic struggles. Agricultural exports were insufficient and the federal government was unable to repay its foreign loans, despite favorable terms. Central America&#x27;s economic troubles were caused in part by the federal government&#x27;s inability to collect taxes and inadequate interstate infrastructure.

Central American politicians, writers, and intellectuals have called for the reunification of Central America since the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America. There have been several attempts by the republic&#x27;s successor states during the 19th and 20th centuries to reunify Central America through diplomatic and military means, but none succeeded in uniting all five former members for more than one year. All five former members of the Federal Republic of Central America are members of the Central American Integration System (SICA), an economic and political organization that promotes regional development.

== Names ==

The country&#x27;s initial name, adopted at independence from the First Mexican Empire on 1 July 1823, was the United Provinces of Central America (). Upon the adoption of the country&#x27;s constitution on 22 November 1824, the United Provinces of Central America changed its name to the Federal Republic of Central America (). In the years shortly after independence, some official government documents referred to the country as the Federated States of Central America (). The federal republic has also been referred to as the Federation of Central America ().

== Background ==

=== Colonial Central America ===

The Spanish conquered Central America in the 16th century. The region was divided into several (jurisdictions) until, in 1542, it was organized into a single extending north to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and south to the Isthmus of Panama. Spain transferred control of the Yucatán Peninsula to New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1560, and transferred control of Panama to Peru seven years later. In 1568, the Central American was reorganized as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. The captaincy was subdivided into , , greater mayorships, and intendancies.

Central America had a caste system, with Spaniards at the top, mixed-race individuals in the middle, and Africans and indigenous Central Americans at the bottom. Spaniards owned most of the region&#x27;s land and wealth, and indigenous people composed most of its labor force. The Catholic Church dominated all aspects of Central American society during Spanish colonial rule. Although the region&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants were gradually forced by colonial officials to convert to Catholicism, they retained many of their cultural traditions.

=== Central American independence ===

The Spanish king Ferdinand VII was overthrown in 1808 by the French emperor Napoleon, who installed his brother Joseph as king of Spain. Spain&#x27;s colonies in the Americas (including the Captaincy General of Guatemala) did not recognize Joseph as the legitimate king and established provisional governments, known as , which continued to recognize Ferdinand as king. Although the Central American colonial government remained loyal to Ferdinand, some leaders in Central America wanted greater autonomy. In November 1811, José Matías Delgado and Manuel José Arce launched a rebellion in San Salvador against Spanish rule which was defeated by loyalist forces. Additional independence rebellions occurred in ; in 1813 in Guatemala; and in . All were defeated by loyalist forces, but pro-independence sentiment spread among Central American leaders.

The Cortes of Cádiz (a Spanish constitutional congress in Cádiz) drafted the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which made Spain a constitutional monarchy. Ferdinand repealed the liberal constitution after returning to power in 1814, since he wanted to rule as an absolute monarch. His refusal to rule as a constitutional monarch and the desire of colonial leaders for greater local autonomy led to independence rebellions throughout Spain&#x27;s American colonies. The rebellions were primarily led by liberals who supported the 1812 constitution&#x27;s Enlightenment ideals. Conservatives joined the independence movements in 1820, when Ferdinand was forced by Colonel Rafael del Riego to restore the 1812 constitution. On 15 September 1821, Central American colonial leaders declared independence from Spain and signed the Act of Independence of Central America. They established the Consultive Junta to temporarily govern the region until a permanent government could be established. Most government administrators, including Brigadier General Gabino Gaínza (the final captain general of Guatemala), retained their positions.

After independence, Central American leaders were ideologically divided about whether to remain independent or to join the First Mexican Empire; monarchists supported annexation, opposed by republicans and nationalists. Mexican Regent (and later Mexican Emperor) Agustín de Iturbide asked the Consultive Junta to join the First Mexican Empire in November 1821, and the junta voted for annexation on 5 January 1822. The Mexicans sent Brigadier General Vicente Filísola to enforce the annexation. Liberals in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua resisted Mexican attempts to annex the region. Liberals and conservatives fought in Costa Rica&#x27;s Ochomogo War, which ended with the liberals gaining control of the country. Liberal rebels in El Salvador, led by Delgado and Arce, resisted two invasions by Filísola in 1822 and 1823. The former ended with an armistice and Mexican withdrawal; the latter resulted in Filísola overthrowing Delgado as the political leader of El Salvador (forcing Arce to flee to the United States) and capturing the city of San Salvador. General José Anacleto Ordóñez launched a rebellion against conservative Nicaraguan political leader , capturing several cities. Ordóñez&#x27;s rebellion continued after Central America declared its independence from Mexico.

On 19 March 1823, Iturbide abdicated the Mexican throne. When news of Iturbide&#x27;s abdication reached Filísola on 29 March, he called for Central American political leaders to establish a congress to determine the region&#x27;s future. The ordered Mexican forces in Central America to cease hostilities on 1 April, and the Central American congress convened on 24 June. Except for the state of Chiapas, it declared Central American independence from Mexico on 1 July.

== History ==

=== National Constituent Assembly ===

==== Drafting the constitution ====

At Central America&#x27;s independence from Mexico, the Central American congress established the United Provinces of Central America. The following day, the congress reorganized as the National Constituent Assembly and tasked itself with drafting a constitution for newly-independent Central America. José Matías Delgado was Central America&#x27;s provisional president until 10 July 1823, when the National Constituent Assembly appointed a consisting of Arce, Juan Vicente Villacorta and Pedro Molina Mazariegos. Since Arce was in the United States when the triumvirate was established, Antonio Rivera Cabezas was appointed as his substitute. The three rotated executive power on a monthly basis.

Initially, the National Constituent Assembly was composed of delegates from El Salvador and Guatemala; Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua did not send their delegates until October 1823, refusing to send them until Mexican soldiers withdrew from Central America. The National Constituent Assembly consisted of 64 delegates, distributed across Central America. The National Constituent Assembly was the &quot;de facto&quot; government of Central America until the constitution was adopted. Its two political factions were the liberals and the conservatives; the liberals supported federalism, and the conservatives supported centralism.

The National Constituent Assembly drafted the constitution on 12 June 1824, and published it on 4 July. The constitution was inspired by the federal government of the United States, the United States Declaration of Independence, and the Spanish Constitution of 1812. On 22 November, the constitution was formally adopted after all 64 members of the assembly signed it. The National Constituent Assembly dissolved itself on 23 January 1825, and was succeeded by the Federal Congress on 6 February.

==== Guatemalan mutiny ====

On 14 September 1823, Captain Rafael Ariza y Torres began an insurrection in Guatemala City (the capital city) because the Central American government was unable to pay its debts to the military. Although Ariza pledged his loyalty to the National Constituent Assembly, many assembly members fled the city and called on soldiers from Chiquimula, Quetzaltenango, and San Salvador to suppress the insurrection. Neither Ariza&#x27;s rebels nor Colonel José Rivas and his 750 soldiers from San Salvador wanted a battle. Conservatives took advantage of the situation, and forced the triumvirate to resign on 6 October. They installed a consisting of Arce, José Cecilio del Valle, and Tomás O&#x27;Horan. Since Arce and Valle were outside the country when the second triumvirate was formed, José Santiago Milla and Villacorta were substitutes. Valle and Arce did not sit on the triumvirate until February and March 1824, respectively.

The second triumvirate ordered Rivas to march 150 soldiers into Guatemala City and, soon afterwards, Ariza fled into exile in Mexico. The National Constituent Assembly then returned to Guatemala City. The Salvadoran government ordered Rivas to remain near Guatemala City and verify that the assembly was functioning. On 12 October 1823, Rivas determined that the National Constituent Assembly was suppressing civil liberties and marched back into the city. On 17 October, believing that Rivas was acting on behalf of El Salvador, 200 soldiers from Quetzaltenango arrived in Guatemala City and skirmished with his forces. After a few days, the assembly drafted an agreement to appease both sides. Rivas&#x27; forces withdrew to El Salvador, and the soldiers from Quetzaltenango returned home.

==== Internal conflict in Nicaragua ====

Liberals and conservatives had been fighting for control of Nicaragua since Ordóñez launched his rebellion against the pro-Mexico Nicaraguan government in 1823. The liberals had control of León (the liberal capital) and Granada, and the conservatives controlled Managua (the conservative capital), Rivas and Chinandega. Clashes resulted in hundreds of deaths. In October 1824, the second triumvirate sent Colonel Manuel Arzú to attempt to mediate peace between the liberals and conservatives. The mediation failed, and Arce led a federal invasion of Nicaragua on 22 January 1825 to end the civil conflict. His invading force got the liberals and conservatives to sign an armistice without engaging in combat. Arce dissolved both rival governments, and their leaders were exiled from Nicaragua.

=== Presidency of Manuel José Arce ===

==== 1825 election ====

The federal republic&#x27;s first presidential election was held on 21 April 1825. Arce was the liberals&#x27; candidate, and Valle the conservatives&#x27; choice. During the election, 41 of the 82 electors voted for Valle; 34 voted for Arce, four voted for other candidates, and three did not vote due to complications in receiving votes from their electoral districts. No candidate received a majority; the constitution required a majority, and the Federal Congress was tasked with electing the president instead. The congress voted 22–5 to elect Arce president. Valle was entitled to become vice president since he was the runner-up in the election, but refused to accept the position; so did liberal José Francisco Barrundia. Ultimately, the conservative Mariano Beltranena became Arce&#x27;s vice president. Arce and Beltranena took office on 29 April.

Arce&#x27;s electoral victory angered conservatives who backed Valle, and alienated liberals (particularly Guatemalan liberals) because he had won the votes of conservative senators by promising to allow the Federal Congress to decide if a Catholic archdiocese would be created in El Salvador; the conservatives opposed the archdiocese because Delgado, a liberal symbol of Salvadoran independence, would have become archbishop. The liberals considered Arce&#x27;s compromise with the conservatives as betraying his liberal positions. Liberals Molina Mazariegos and Mariano Gálvez refused to accept cabinet appointments as secretary of relations and secretary of finance, respectively, due to this perceived betrayal. Arce appointed conservatives to his cabinet as a result, which led to liberals continuing to accuse him of betraying the liberal cause.

==== Path to civil war ====

, José Francisco Barrundia&#x27;s brother, opposed the federal government and was one of Arce&#x27;s foremost critics. He moved Guatemala&#x27;s capital back to Guatemala City from Antigua Guatemala in mid-1825 (reversing the 1823 move) and seized private property to establish state government offices, since the federal government still occupied the state&#x27;s government buildings. After Juan Barrundia threatened to raise an army to &quot;contain the despotism of a tyrant&quot; (referring to Arce), the Federal Congress agreed to vacate the building used by the federal treasury and give it to the Guatemalan state government.

In August 1825, in response to the arrival of 28 French warships in the Caribbean Sea, Arce called for the army to raise 10,000 soldiers to defend their country against a European invasion. The Congress of Deputies approved Arce&#x27;s plan; the Senate vetoed it, however, citing a lack of funding. In mid-1826, Arce reduced his troop requirement to 4,000. Guatemalan liberals in the Federal Congress contacted French military officer to help draft a military code to prevent Arce from controlling the military, and Arce expelled Raoul from the country. Eventually, Arce and the Federal Congress compromised; the congress approved the raising of 4,000 soldiers, and Raoul oversaw recruitment. Despite a minor rebellion in Costa Rica led by José Zamora, who called himself a &quot;vassal of the king of Spain&quot;, the feared European invasion did not take place. As the liberals tried to circumvent his role as commander-in-chief, Arce refused to implement laws passed by the Federal Congress; the liberals began impeachment proceedings against him on 2 June 1826. Salvadoran liberals, still loyal to Arce, did not attend the impeachment proceedings and prevented the congress from reaching the quorum necessary to begin them. Ten days later, the Guatemalan liberals abandoned their impeachment attempt.

Arce sent federal soldiers to arrest Raoul in July 1826, accusing him of insubordination by sending letters to Arce calling for his resignation. Juan Barrundia sought to defend Raoul and sent 300 Guatemalan soldiers to arrest the federal soldiers&#x27; commander, arguing that the federal government needed a state governor&#x27;s permission to move soldiers within a state. When Arce sought to formally condemn Juan Barrundia, liberal Guatemalan senators boycotted the meeting and the Senate failed to reach the quorum necessary to condemn Barrundia. Despite Senate inaction, Arce had Barrundia arrested and removed from office on 6 September for attempting to conspire against the federal republic. In response to Barrundia&#x27;s arrest, Lieutenant Governor moved the Guatemalan state government to Quetzaltenango and passed several anti-clerical laws. An indigenous mob, spurred by conservatives and the church, attacked and killed Cirilo on 13 October for passing the laws. Arce invaded Quetzaltenango and defeated those who continued to support the remnants of Cirilo&#x27;s government on 28 October.

==== First civil war ====

In October 1826, Arce called for a special election to install a new Guatemalan government; the conservatives won, and Mariano Aycinena became governor of Guatemala on 1 March 1827. After the election, many liberals fled Guatemala for El Salvador in search of assistance from its liberals to regain power. They spread rumors that Arce was controlled by the Guatemalan conservatives and that would establish a centralized government. Arce called for an extraordinary congress to convene in Cojutepeque on 10 October to reestablish constitutional order, since the Federal Congress consistently failed to reach a quorum after Juan Barrundia&#x27;s arrest. The call for an extraordinary congress was unconstitutional, because it exceeded Arce&#x27;s presidential duties. On 6 December, in response to Arce&#x27;s call for an extraordinary congress, Mariano Prado (the liberal acting governor of El Salvador) called for delegates from all the states except Guatemala to convene their own extraordinary congress in Ahuachapán. Ultimately, neither congress convened.

Prado ordered Salvadoran soldiers to the El Salvador–Guatemala border in late December 1826 to prepare to overthrow Arce. Aycinena declared leading Guatemalan liberals, including Molina Mazariegos and Rivera Cabezas, as outlaws in Guatemala in early March 1827. Prado ordered his soldiers to invade Guatemala in response, beginning the First Central American Civil War without a formal declaration of war. Honduras supported El Salvador&#x27;s invasion, but Arce&#x27;s federal soldiers defeated the invasion in a 23 March battle at Arrazola (near Guatemala City). Arce launched a counter-invasion into El Salvador and was defeated on 18 May at Milingo, near San Salvador.

While Arce was campaigning in El Salvador, he sent a division of soldiers commanded by Colonel José Justo Milla into Honduras to arrest liberal Honduran Governor Dionisio de Herrera. Milla&#x27;s forces captured the Honduran capital of Comayagua on 10 May 1827 after a 36-day siege, and captured Herrera. Francisco Morazán—secretary general of Honduras in 1824, a Honduran state senator, and a military officer—was captured shortly afterwards in Tegucigalpa; Morazán escaped and fled to Nicaragua, where he rallied an army of Honduran exiles to oppose Arce. his forces were supported by Nicaraguan rebels led by Ordóñez, who launched an anti-Arce rebellion in León. Morazán&#x27;s army defeated Milla&#x27;s army at the Battle of La Trinidad on 10 November 1827, recapturing Comayagua and Tegucigalpa.

Arce offered to hold a presidential election in early 1828 in an attempt to appease the liberals, who declined his offer. He resigned the presidency on 14 February and fled to Mexico; Beltranena succeeded Arce as interim president. Morazán invaded El Salvador in June 1828 with an army of Honduran and Nicaraguan soldiers, capturing San Salvador on 23 October. In late 1828, Morazán raised 4,000 soldiers for an invasion of Guatemala. Beltranena&#x27;s government warned its citizens that Morazán&#x27;s primary objective was to destroy the Catholic Church; Morazán refuted the Guatemalan government&#x27;s warning, saying that his Christian &quot;Protector Allied Army of the Law&quot; (&quot;&quot;) did not seek to destroy the church and sought only to liberate Guatemala from &quot;the wrongs [they had] suffered&quot; (&quot;). He invaded in January 1829, and began besieging Guatemala City on 5 February. The city surrendered on 12 April and Morazán&#x27;s soldiers entered it the following day, ending the civil war.

=== Presidency of Francisco Morazán ===

==== Consolidating power ====

After capturing Guatemala City in April 1828, Beltranena was removed from the presidency; Morazán became the president of Central America, but did not officially assume office. On 22 June 1829, Morazán appointed a new Federal Congress. It elected José Francisco Barrundia, the Senate&#x27;s senior member, as Central America&#x27;s interim president three days later. At Morazán&#x27;s instruction, the Federal Congress declared all legislation passed after September 1826 null and void. Many leading conservatives were imprisoned or exiled under threat of death after the civil war, and many also had their property confiscated. Morazán also cracked down on the church. He expelled many members of the clergy from the country for supporting the conservatives, confiscated Church properties, and forced the church to reduce the number of priests and nuns in the country.

Morazán ran for president in the 1830 federal election. Although he finished first, with 202 electoral votes, he did not win a majority. Similar to 1825, the Federal Congress was given the authority to elect the president; the liberal-dominated congress voted for Morazán, and he took office on 16 September. The Federal Congress elected liberal Mariano Prado as Morazán&#x27;s vice president.

==== 1831–1832 conservative invasion ====

In May 1829, Morazán sent a letter to the Mexican minister of external relations falsely claiming that Central American refugees fleeing to Mexico were actually enemy forces who sought to &quot;chain and submit their towns to the Spanish yoke&quot; (&quot;&quot;). He asked the Mexican government to extradite the refugees back to Central America. Receiving no reply, José Francisco Barrundia sent a letter to Mexican President Vicente Guerrero in November 1829 with the same request; Guerrero did not respond either. After Central American Minister of Relations Manuel Julián Ibarra sent a third request to the Mexican government to extradite the refugees in December 1829, Mexico said that it could grant the Central American request.

Arce threatened to invade the Federal Republic of Central America in late 1831 from Soconusco (a territory along the Pacific coast claimed by Central America and Mexico over which neither had full control) to reclaim the presidency. General Ramón Guzmán, mayor of the Honduran city of Omoa, declared a state of rebellion in November 1831, raised a Spanish flag in the city, and sent ships to Cuba to ask for support from conservative archbishop (exiled by Morazán in 1829). This was followed by a second conservative invasion force, led by Colonel , that entered Central America from British Honduras and supported Guzmán&#x27;s rebellion and invaded inland Honduras. The Honduran cities of Opoteca and Trujillo also declared themselves in a state of rebellion. José María Cornejo, the conservative governor of El Salvador, supported Arce&#x27;s invasion and declared El Salvador&#x27;s secession from the federal republic on 7 January 1832.

On 24 February 1832, Raoul led federal soldiers into Soconusco and fought Arce&#x27;s rebel army in the town of Escuintla. He defeated Arce&#x27;s outnumbered army, and the victorious soldiers looted the town. After this defeat, Arce fled back to Mexico. Morazán invaded El Salvador in mid-March and captured San Salvador on 28 March, proclaiming himself the provisional governor of El Salvador on 3 April. Cornejo and 38 other Salvadoran political leaders were arrested and imprisoned in Guatemala for their involvement in the rebellion. Honduran soldiers under Colonel Francisco Ferrera began a siege of Omoa in March, recaptured Trujillo in April, and recaptured Opoteca in May. Reaching the Central American coast, Guzmán&#x27;s Spanish reinforcements were arrested by Honduran soldiers. He continued to resist federal forces in Omoa until 12 September, when his soldiers mutinied and turned him over to federal custody. This ended the rebellion; Guzmán was executed the following day, and Domínguez (captured by federal forces during the fall of Opoteca) was executed on 14 September.

==== Rebellions ====

On 1 April 1829, Costa Rica seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America &quot;without separating itself&quot; (&quot;&quot;) from the federal republic. The Costa Rican government justified its secession by saying that the federal government had ceased to exist. It rejoined the federal republic in February 1831 after recognizing Morazán as Central America&#x27;s president and renouncing its declaration of secession. Morazán defeated July 1829 rebellions in Honduras and Nicaragua, and a rebellion in Honduras in January 1830.

In May 1832, Prado resigned as vice president of Central America to become the governor of El Salvador; however, he was not popular among El Salvador&#x27;s residents for helping Morazán overthrow Arce in the civil war and Cornejo earlier in 1832. Prado imposed a tax to help raise funds for the state government. The tax was unpopular with Salvadoransparticularly indigenous Salvadorans, who saw it as a restoration of tribute to the white population that was abolished in 1811. San Salvador rebelled against Prado on 24 October, forcing his government to temporarily move to Cojutepeque. Similar rebellions against Prado broke out in Ahuachapán, Chalatenango, Izalco, San Miguel, Tejutla and Zacatecoluca, but were quickly suppressed by Salvadoran soldiers.

On 14 February 1833, indigenous laborer Anastasio Aquino launched a rebellion in San Juan Nonualco and Santiago Nonualco in response to indigenous killings by Ladinos (mixed-race people) the month before. Aquino and 2,000 supporters (known as the Liberation Army) marched on San Vicente, capturing it the following day. The Liberation Army proclaimed him as San Vicente&#x27;s political chief. Indigenous Salvadorans in Cojutepeque, Ilopango, San Martín, San Pedro Perulapán, and Soyapango supported Aquino&#x27;s rebellion. Initial efforts by Salvadoran soldiers to suppress the rebellion were defeated by the Liberation Army in San Vicente and Zacatecoluca, but Aquino&#x27;s army was defeated in battle by Morazán in San Vicente on 28 February. This ended the rebellion; Aquino was captured in April and executed on 24 July, with his body publicly displayed in San Vicente.

==== 1830s constitutional reforms ====

In 1831, Salvadoran conservatives called for political reforms in the federal government. Reforms included allowing the president to veto laws passed by the Federal Congress, abolishing the electoral college and implementing direct elections, and restricting eligibility to hold office to landowners. The arrest of these conservatives after Morazán&#x27;s military victory in El Salvador in 1832 led political leaders across the federal republic to call for political reforms. Nicaragua declared independence on 3 December 1832, citing fears of federal authoritarianism after Morazán&#x27;s invasion of El Salvador, and said that it would not rejoin the federal republic until the federal constitution was reformed. That month, Costa Rica proposed establishing a National Constituent Assembly to pass a constitutional reform; th assembly began on 20 April 1833. On 13 February 1835, the Federal Congress approved constitutional reforms drafted by the National Constituent Assembly. The reforms were minor, and only Nicaragua (which renounced its secession after the reforms were completed) and Costa Rica ratified them.

==== Federal capital move to San Salvador ====

Morazán and the Federal Congress wanted to move the national capital from Guatemala City beginning in 1830, since they wanted the capital in a better defensive position and the federal government felt that the city&#x27;s residents hated it due to the civil war. Morazán wanted to move the capital to San Salvador, but conservative Salvadoran political leaders resisted his proposal and seceded from the federal republic in January 1832. The federal government moved the national capital from Guatemala City to the Salvadoran city of Sonsonate on 5 February 1834, but Salvadoran politicians did not want it to move the capital to the city.

Salvadoran Governor Joaquín de San Martín believed that Morazán&#x27;s moving the federal capital to San Salvador was an attempt to remove him as governor, and saw the capital&#x27;s temporary relocation to Sonsonate as a threat. After nearly all of the Salvadoran state assembly resigned on 15 May 1834 due to rising tensions between San Martín and Morazán, San Martín announced his intention to resign; however, he retained his gubernatorial powers. In late May, Morazán invaded El Salvador to force San Martín out of office. Morazán captured San Salvador on 6 June, and San Martín resigned six days later. San Martín was succeeded as provisional governor by Carlos Salazar (José Gregorio Salazar&#x27;s brother), and by José Gregorio Salazar on 13 July. As provisional governor, José Gregorio Salazar defeated a rebellion launched by San Martín which sought to restore him to power.

San Salvador became the federal capital in June 1834 to symbolize the liberal victory over the conservatives in the 1827–1829 civil war. The federal government established the Federal District around the city on 7 February 1835 in accordance with article 65 of the federal constitution, which called for a federal district in the country&#x27;s capital when &quot;circumstances permitted&quot;. The district covered a radius around San Salvador and extended south to the Pacific Ocean. All federal-government offices relocated to the Federal District. El Salvador temporarily moved its state government from San Salvador to Cojutepeque before permanently relocating to San Vicente on 21 September.

==== 1833 and 1835 presidential elections ====

During the late 1833 presidential election, the electoral college chose Valle as Central America&#x27;s next president. Valle defeated Morazán because many voters and politicians opposed Morazán&#x27;s use of military force to settle disputes between liberals and conservatives, and saw Valle as a moderate who could offer peace. Valle died of illness on 2 March 1834 while he was traveling to Guatemala to become president. As Morazán finished second in the election and retained the presidency; on 2 June, the federal government called for a new presidential election the following year. On 2 February 1835, the electoral college re-elected Morazán as Central America&#x27;s president and José Gregorio Salazar as Morazán&#x27;s vice president; they were sworn in on 14 February.

=== Second civil war and dissolution ===

On 30 May 1838, the Federal Congress convened and declared that each of the federal republic&#x27;s five states was free to establish any form of republican government. Nicaragua seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America on 30 April 1838. Honduras did the same on 26 October, followed by Costa Rica on 15 November. On 2 February 1839, all of Central America&#x27;s federally-elected government officials (including Morazán) left office. They had no successors, since no federal election was held. On 17 April, Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera issued a decree dissolving the Federal Republic of Central America; the Federal Congress accepted his decree on 14 July. On 30 January 1841, El Salvador declared independence from the Federal Republic of Central America. At the fall of the federal republic, four of its five successor states were led by opponents of federal rule and proponents of their respective states&#x27; secession: Braulio Carrillo (Costa Rica), Francisco Malespín (El Salvador), Carrera (Guatemala), and Francisco Ferrera (Honduras).

== Government and politics ==

=== Federal government ===

According to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was &quot;popular, representative, and federal&quot;. All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office. In presidential, vice-presidential and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round. Voting was compulsory.

The federal republic&#x27;s government was divided into legislative, executive and judicial branches, with no term limits. The Federal Congress was its bicameral legislative branch. The Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) consisted of 41 deputies allocated across the states, with one deputy per 30,000 people. Each deputy was accompanied by a supplement deputy. Half of the Chamber of Deputies&#x27; members were elected annually. The Senate (the upper house) consisted of two senators from each state, for a total of ten senators. The Senate, which first met on 24 April 1825, acted as a &quot;de facto&quot; executive council that approved legislation passed by the Council of Deputies. An advisory body to the president, it could also review Supreme Court rulings. One-third of the Senate&#x27;s members were elected every year. The Council of Deputies could override a Senate legislative veto with a two-thirds majority, or a three-fourths majority for tax legislation. From 1824 to 1838, there were a total of 11 congressional terms.

The president led the executive branch. Elected to a four-year term, he was the commander-in-chief of the Federal Army. The president had a cabinet of three secretaries (ministers): the secretary of relations, the secretary of war, and the secretary of the treasury. Article 111 of the federal constitution allowed the president to seek consecutive re-election once, after which he must leave office for at least one term before being eligible for re-election a second time. The president was relatively weak in comparison with other contemporary Latin American presidents, particularly because he could not veto or pocket veto legislation, could not send legislation back to the Federal Congress for reconsideration, and was required to enact all laws passed by the Federal Congress within fifteen days. The authors of the federal constitution sought to oppose a -like president with dictatorial powers by implementing checks on presidential power to ensure legislative supremacy. , a 20th-century Costa Rican lawyer and rector of the University of Costa Rica, described the presidency of the Federal Republic of Central America as &quot;merely decorative&quot;.

The Supreme Court of Justice was established on 2 August 1824 as the federal republic&#x27;s judicial branch. It consisted of six justices, two of whom were elected every two years. The first justices took office on 29 April 1825. The Supreme Court could not enforce its rulings on unconstitutional laws passed by the Federal Congress, since its rulings were subject to Federal Congress review.

=== Armed forces ===

The Federal Republic of Central America found it difficult to maintain its federal army. Before Central American independence, few Central Americans pursued a military career. Guatemalan historian Manuel Montúfar y Coronado wrote that &quot;military influence was unknown in Central America; before Independence, there was no military career&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The Central American federal army originated as rebel groups who resisted annexation to Mexico in 1822 and 1823, and was not formally established as a political entity until 1829.

Although the president was commander-in-chief of the federal army, only the Federal Congress had the authority to raise and maintain armies and to declare war and peace. In July 1823, the Central American federal army had 10,000 soldiers. The legislature increased the size of the federal army to 11,800 soldiers in December of that year, organized into two light battalions, two squadrons, and one artillery brigade. The federal army established defensive garrisons along the Caribbean coast in case Spain attempted to reassert control of the region. George Alexander Thompson, a British diplomat who visited Central America in 1825, said that the federal army would only have been able to resist a Spanish invasion with guerrilla warfare.

By the end of 1829, the Central American federal army (now called the Protector Allied Army of the Law) totaled 4,000 soldiers. That year, the Federal Congress reduced the maximum size of the federal army to 2,000 soldiers due to general distrust by the states of the power and influence of the federal army. Each state was instructed to provide soldiers to the federal army. The federal peacetime army, as established by the Federal Congress in 1829, consisted of three infantry brigades, one artillery brigade, and one cavalry regiment. By 1831, only 800 federal soldiers remained; the state militias had more soldiers and were better funded and equipped. During the 1830s, the federal army&#x27;s military supremacy over the state militias relied on the discipline of its soldiers and public perception that a -like figure led the federal army. In 1836, Morazán said that the federal army had been reduced to &quot;a handful of ancient veterans that have survived the greatest dangers&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

=== Administrative divisions ===

The federal republic consisted of five states: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Each state was subdivided into 45 (districts). From 7 February 1835 to 3 May 1839, the Federal District was centered around San Salvador as the national capital. Briefly, from 1838 to 1839, the federal government considered separating Los Altos from Guatemala and elevating it to the status of a state. Although Guatemala claimed Belize as part of its territory, coastal Belize was occupied by the British. Guatemala and Mexico claimed sovereignty over Soconusco, but neither had full control of the region. Portions of Soconusco were effectively independent, but its leaders preferred union with Central America. Central America bordered the Mosquito Coast on the Caribbean, which it claimed as part of its territory. The Federal Republic of Central America covered approximately and spanned about north to south between the 8th and 18th parallel north.

On 5 May 1824, the National Constituent Assembly ordered each of the federal republic&#x27;s five states to draft a constitution and install state-level legislative, executive, and judicial branches similar to those of the federal government. Each state could elect legislators, a governor, and judicial officials in indirect elections. Like the Senate at the federal level, each state&#x27;s Senate was an executive council which advised the state governor. All the states drafted and ratified their constitutions by April 1826. The federal constitution recognized each state government as &quot;free and independent&quot; (&quot;&quot;), and the state governments could administer internal affairs not mandated for the federal government by the federal constitution.

=== Political factions ===

The two major political factions of the Federal Republic of Central America were the liberals (also known as ) and the conservatives (also known as ). The factions were not organized political parties. Liberals and conservatives saw each other as enemies, accusing each other of &quot;demagoguery, disorganization, and anarchism&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

Liberals supported a federal government and the devolution of power to the country&#x27;s states, considering the centralized colonial government inherently defective and radical change necessary. They attempted to implement freedom of religion in 1823. Resistance from the predominantly-Catholic population prevented implementation of the reform, however, and Catholicism was established as the country&#x27;s official religion. In 1825, an executive decree required all Catholic clergymen in the country to swear an oath of allegiance to the federal republic. The clergy opposed the decree, seeing it as diminishing the power of the Catholic Church. Liberals also supported economic policies, free trade, and foreign immigration in an effort to improve the economy. They were primarily supported by the upper middle class and intellectuals.

Conservatives supported centralizing power around the national government, believing that the colonial centralized government structure before independence was preferable to a new system of government (federalism) which might be a burden on society. They supported protectionist economic policies and defended the role of the Catholic Church in Central American society as an arbiter of morality which preserved the . The conservatives viewed Protestantism as inferior to Catholicism, and believed that the country&#x27;s indigenous population should be subservient to the ruling white and population. They primarily received support from wealthy landowners, established colonial-era families, and the clergy.

=== Foreign relations ===

The federal republic sent diplomats to Gran Colombia, France, the Holy See, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, and received diplomats from Chile, France, Gran Colombia, Hanover, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mexico recognized Central American independence in August 1823. On 15 March 1825, federal diplomats signed a treaty with Gran Colombia ensuring the existence of a &quot;perpetual confederation&quot; (&quot;) between the countries; the treaty was ratified on 12 September. Although France, the Holy See, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom sent diplomats to the Federal Republic of Central America, they recognized Central America&#x27;s independence only after the federal government had collapsed in the late 1830s.

The United States recognized the independence of the Federal Republic of Central America from Spain on 4 August 1824 when U.S. President James Monroe received Cañas as Central America&#x27;s envoy to the United States. The two countries signed the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation on 5 December 1825. On 3 May 1826, Central America received U.S. John Williams in Guatemala City. William S. Murphy was the last U.S. diplomat assigned to Central America; he left his post in March 1842 after the federal republic had collapsed.

On 16 June 1825, the Federal Congress passed a law approving construction of a canal in Nicaragua to connect the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The congress approved a contract with the government of the Netherlands to develop the canal project in October 1830, but the Dutch government canceled the contract the following year due to the Belgian Revolution. The Nicaraguan government asked the federal government in 1833 and 1838 to build a canal, but the federal government took no action on either request.

=== National symbols ===

While resisting the Mexican attempt to annex Central America in 1822, Arce&#x27;s forces waved a horizontal blue, white, and blue triband inspired by the flag of Argentina. The flag of the Federal Republic of Central America, adopted on 21 August 1823, was based on Arce&#x27;s 1822 design. The adopted flag retained the blue, white, and blue horizontal triband design, with the country&#x27;s coat of arms in the center. The federal republic&#x27;s coat of arms was an equilateral triangle; within the triangle were a rainbow at the top, a Phrygian cap with beams of light emanating from it in the center, and five rounded volcanoes surrounded by two oceans (the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) at the bottom. Surrounding the triangle was an oval with the name of the country within it.

The federal republic&#x27;s national anthem was &quot;, written by Rómulo E. Durón. Its national motto&quot;God, Union, Liberty&quot; (&quot;&quot;)was adopted on 4 August 1823, replacing the motto &quot;God keep you many years&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in use before independence.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===

In 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491. By 1836, it had an estimated population of 1,900,000; the estimate, by federal administrator Juan Galindo, &quot;largely over-estimated&quot; the number of whites and excluded Honduras&#x27; indigenous population. Central America was the most densely-populated country in the Americas. Its population was unevenly distributed across the states, with over half in Guatemala in 1824. The constitution granted political representation in the Federal Congress in proportion to population, so the population imbalance gave Guatemala greater representation in the legislature than the other states.

=== Ethnic composition ===

Central America was not ethnically homogenous. In 1824, 65 percent of the population was indigenous, 31 percent was mixed (Ladino or ), and four percent was white (Spanish or ). There was a small population of Blacks, and Galindo described the black population in 1836 as &quot;too inconsiderable to be taken into consideration&quot;. Ethnic composition varied throughout the Central American states. In 1824, up to 70 percent of Guatemala&#x27;s population was indigenous; El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua were almost entirely composed of , and Costa Rica self-reported that it was 80 percent white.

Central America&#x27;s white and mixed population primarily spoke Spanish, and the majority indigenous population spoke their indigenous languages. Most Central Americans in the federal republic were illiterate, and the federal and state governments lacked the funding to invest in schools. Morazán established universities in San Salvador and León in the early 1830s, although they lacked funding and professors.

=== Religion ===

Catholicism was the largest and the official religion of the Federal Republic of Central America. Initially, Catholicism was the only religion that could be practiced publicly. Public worship as part of any other religion was prohibited until May 1832, when the Federal Congress issued a decree permitting public practice of any religion (a right reinforced by an 1835 constitutional amendment). The Catholic Church influenced Central American politics, but the president and any Supreme Court justice were not allowed to be members of the clergy; only one of each state&#x27;s two senators could be a clergyman. Papal bulls issued by the pope to Central America had to be approved by the Federal Congress before they became effective.

=== Cities ===

In 1836, twenty-nine settlements were designated as cities in Central America.

== Economy ==

=== Currency ===

On 19 March 1824, the National Constituent Assembly passed a law that prohibited the minting of coins with &quot;the bust, coat of arms, or whatever other emblems which are typical and distinctive of the Spanish monarchy&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The law also ordered the creation of a new currency. The obverse would depict the country&#x27;s coat of arms, and the reverse would depict a tree with the phrase &quot;Grow Free and Fertile&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

The Central American currency, known as the &quot;national currency&quot;, was divided into , , and . One equaled two , and one equaled eight . were struck in gold in denominations of , 1, 2, 4, and 8; were struck in gold in denominations of 1 and 2; were struck in silver in denominations of , , 1, 2, and 8. The coins were minted in Guatemala City, San José, and Tegucigalpa.

=== Problems ===

Thomas L. Karnes, a history professor at Arizona State University, described the Federal Republic of Central America&#x27;s economy as &quot;chaotic&quot;. The federal republic constantly struggled to have enough money to finance its governmental obligations. In 1826, Williams wrote to United States Secretary of State Henry Clay that Central America&#x27;s economic situation was &quot;most unpromising&quot;. Robert S. Smith, an economics professor at Duke University, described the federal treasury as &quot;chronically empty&quot;. When Arce assumed the presidency in 1825, the treasury contained only 600 pesos.

Under Spanish colonial rule, Central America&#x27;s economy was reliant on agriculture because the region lacked abundant natural resources; the Federal Republic of Central America continued to rely on an agricultural economy. The federal republic&#x27;s largest source of income was the export of lumber products, indigo, cochineal, bananas, coffee, cacao, and (especially) tobacco; tobacco exports generated 200,000 to 300,000 pesos of income annually. Although agricultural exports provided the federal republic with much of its income, it was still reliant on foreign loans to finance everyday governance. Many of these foreign loans were granted at greatly-discounted rates, but still fell into default. The federal government defaulted on its foreign debt, which totaled GB£163,300 (), in 1828. In October 1823, the National Constituent Assembly had pledged to pay off the country&#x27;s internal debt (a total of 3,583,576 pesos); by February 1831, however, the debt had increased to 4,768,966 pesos.

Infrastructure between and within the federal republic&#x27;s states was poor due to Central America&#x27;s large areas of dense forest and mountainous terrain. Indigenous slaves had built and maintained Central America&#x27;s road network, but construction and maintenance of the roads nearly ended when slavery was abolished on 17 April 1824 by federal decree. Degradation of the country&#x27;s infrastructure reduced interstate commerce and industry. Outbreaks of leprosy, smallpox, and typhoid fever also hindered labor productivity.

Guatemala&#x27;s economy was the strongest of the five states, financing most of the federal government&#x27;s civil and military expenses; some states contributed to the federal government only intermittently due to strained economic conditions. Guatemala was responsible for paying almost half of the federal republic&#x27;s foreign debt until the 1828 default.

== Legacy ==

=== Historical assessment ===

Richard A. Haggerty, an editor for the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, described the Federal Republic of Central America as &quot;unworkable&quot; but the &quot;only successful political union of the Central American states&quot; after the end of Spanish colonial rule. El Salvador&#x27;s Ministry of Education described the federal republic as a &quot;political laboratory&quot; (&quot;&quot;) for ideas such as republicanism and constitutionalism.

Some experts criticized the federal constitution as &quot;too idealistic&quot;, as a major component of the federal republic&#x27;s collapse. Liberal Guatemalan politician Lorenzo Montúfar said that in &quot;adopting the federal system, [the federal republic] obtained for result, wars, and disasters&quot;. Nicaraguan journalist Pedro Joaquín Chamorro wrote that attempting to emulate the United States&#x27; federalism created divisions between Central America&#x27;s states where a centralized government would have succeeded. According to El Salvador&#x27;s Ministry of Education, the federal constitution was a &quot;fatal conclusion that led to anarchy and disorganization&quot; (&quot;&quot;). University of Massachusetts research scholar Lynn V. Foster described the federal republic during the 1820s as &quot;more like a loose confederation of small independent nations than a single republic&quot; due to the great amount of power and influence wielded by local officials in their states compared to the federal government. Guillermo Vázquez Vicente, an economics professor at King Juan Carlos University, wrote that achieving the constitution&#x27;s ideals for the federal republic was &quot;impossible&quot; (&quot;&quot;) without a coherent political, economic, and social plan. He cited the failure to reach the constitution&#x27;s republican ideals and separatist sentiment in the five states as an &quot;insurmountable impediment&quot; (&quot;&quot;) to achieving national unity.

Other experts disagree that the constitution, or federalism, were the primary cause of the Federal Republic of Central America&#x27;s collapse. Franklin D. Parker, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, said that the federal republic&#x27;s political leaders&#x27; failure to abide by and enforce the constitution&#x27;s provisions ultimately resulted in its collapse. Liberal Central American historian Alejandro Marure attributed &quot;all of the misfortunes which the nation suffered&quot; to Arce&#x27;s attempts to appease both liberals and conservatives during the 1820s. Honduran lawyer and politician Ramón Rosa wrote in his biography of Valle that Morazán&#x27;s 1835 re-election brought &quot;the ruin of the Central American Republic&quot; (&quot;&quot;), saying that Morazán&#x27;s use of military force to settle disputes instead of compromising undermined the federal government. Nicaraguan writer said that a primary cause of the federal republic&#x27;s collapse was a lack of efficient communication infrastructure between and within the states. Philip F. Flemion, a history professor at San Diego State University, attributed the collapse of the federal republic to &quot;regional jealousies, social and cultural differences, inadequate communication and transportation systems, limited financial resources, and disparate political views&quot;. Smith noted the federal republic&#x27;s &quot;financial maladministration&quot; and &quot;abortive economic development&quot; as playing at least a small role in its collapse.

=== Reunification attempts ===


As early as 1842, some Central Americans sought to reunite the region. Several attempts have been made at reunification by diplomacy or force during the 19th and 20th centuries, but none lasted longer than a few months or involved all five former members of the Federal Republic of Central America. According to Guatemalan historian Julio César Pinto Soria, Central America has failed to achieve reunification primarily due to the power of oligarchs in the federal republic&#x27;s former states who see reunification as an impediment to their goals.

Delegations from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua proclaimed Antonio José Cañas the president of a new federal government on 17 March 1842, but the governments of Costa Rica and Guatemala did not recognize the proclamation. Cañas&#x27; government ended in 1844, when El Salvador and Honduras invaded Nicaragua for granting asylum to Salvadoran and Honduran political exiles. Francisco Morazán also tried to reunite Central America by force in 1842 when he became the political leader of Costa Rica. After leading an invasion of Nicaragua, he was defeated, deposed, and executed by firing squad on 15 September of that year.

In 1848, delegates from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua met in Tegucigalpa to draft a new constitution for Central America. Further meetings were held the following year in León, during which the delegations signed a treaty to elect a Central American president, vice president, and national legislature. The Central American legislature declared the establishment of a Central American union on 9 October 1852, but resistance from the Nicaraguan Legitimist Party and the outbreak of civil war in Nicaragua led to the union&#x27;s failure by 1854. Neither El Salvador nor Nicaragua ratified the union&#x27;s constitution.

In 1876, Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios called for all five former members of the Federal Republic of Central America to send delegations to Guatemala City to negotiate the restoration of a united Central American country, but Barrios&#x27; invasion of El Salvador later that year ended the planned negotiations. On 28 February 1885, Barrios declared the establishment of the Central America Federation and proclaimed himself as its president. Honduras accepted Barrios&#x27; declaration, but Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua rejected it. Barrios invaded El Salvador on 29 March 1885 to force it to join the Central American Union, and was killed during the Battle of Chalchuapa on 2 April. Guatemalan forces withdrew from El Salvador, ending Barrios&#x27; attempt to reunite Central America.

On 20 June 1895, delegations from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua signed the Treaty of Amapala and declared the formation of the Greater Republic of Central America. The treaty allowed Costa Rica and Guatemala to join if their governments wished to do so. The United States established diplomatic relations with the republic in December 1896. The first session of the Executive Federal Council (the country&#x27;s legislature) was held on 1 November 1898, when the country&#x27;s constitution was adopted and its name was changed to the United States of Central America. On 13 November, Salvadoran General Tomás Regalado Romero overthrew President Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez and declared El Salvador&#x27;s withdrawal from the United States of Central America. On 29 November, the Executive Federal Council dissolved the union after failing to stop El Salvador&#x27;s secession.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has expressed a desire to reunite Central America. In some speeches since assuming office in 2019, he said that Central America should be &quot;one single nation&quot;. Bukele reaffirmed his belief in 2024 that Central America should reunite, saying that the region would be stronger if united but he needed &quot;the will of the peoples&quot; (&quot;&quot;) to achieve reunification.

<text>The Forward (), formerly known as The Jewish Daily Forward, is an American news media organization for a Jewish American audience. Founded in 1897 as a Yiddish-language daily socialist newspaper, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Seth Lipsky &quot;started an English-language offshoot of the Yiddish-language newspaper&quot; as a weekly newspaper in 1990.

In the 21st century &quot;The Forward&quot; is a digital only publication. In 2016, the publication of the Yiddish version changed its print format from a biweekly newspaper to a monthly magazine; the English weekly paper followed suit in 2017. Those magazines were published until 2019.

&quot;The Forward&quot;″s perspective on world and national news and its reporting on the centrist Jewish perspective on modern United States have made it one of the most influential American Jewish publications. It is published by an independent nonprofit association. 

The Yiddish &quot;Forward&quot; (&quot;Forverts&quot;) is a clearinghouse for the latest developments in the Yiddish world with almost daily news reports related to Yiddish language and culture as well as videos of cooking demonstrations, Yiddish humor and new songs. A Yiddish rendition of the Leonard Cohen song &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, translated and performed by klezmer musician Daniel Kahn, garnered over a million views.

On January 17, 2019, the publication announced it would discontinue its print edition and only publish its English and Yiddish editions online. Layoffs of its editor-in-chief and 20% of its editorial staff were also announced.

Jodi Rudoren was named editor in July 2019, and took charge in September 2019.

&quot;The Forward&quot;″s contributors include journalists Abigail Pogrebin, Debra Nussbaum Cohen, Sam Kestenbaum, and Ilene Prushner; opinion columnist Deborah Lipstadt; art critics Anya Ulinich and Jackson Arn; and cartoonist Liana Finck.

==History==
===Origins===

The first issue of &quot;Forverts&quot; appeared on April 22, 1897, in New York City. The paper was founded by a group of about 50 Yiddish-speaking socialists who had organized three months earlier as the Forward Publishing Association. The paper&#x27;s name, as well as its political orientation, was borrowed from the German Social Democratic Party and its organ .

&quot;Forverts&quot; was a successor to New York&#x27;s first Yiddish-language socialist newspaper, &quot;Di Arbeter Tsaytung&quot; (&quot;The Workman&#x27;s Paper&quot;), a weekly established in 1890 by the fledgling Jewish trade union movement centered in the United Hebrew Trades, as a vehicle for bringing socialist and trade unionist ideas to Yiddish-speaking immigrants, primarily from eastern Europe. This paper had been merged into a new Yiddish daily called &quot;Dos Abend Blatt&quot; (The Evening Paper) as its weekend supplement when that publication was launched in 1894 under the auspices of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP). As this publication established itself, it came under increased political pressure from the de facto head of the SLP, Daniel De Leon, who attempted to maintain a rigid ideological line with respect to its content. It was this centralizing political pressure which had been the motivating factor for a new publication.

Chief among the dissident socialists of the Forward Publishing Association were Louis Miller and Abraham Cahan. These two founding fathers of &quot;The Forward&quot; were quick to enlist in the ranks of a new rival socialist political party founded in 1897, the Social Democratic Party of America, founded by the nationally famous leader of the 1894 American Railway Union strike, Eugene V. Debs, and Victor L. Berger, a German-speaking teacher and newspaper publisher from Milwaukee. Both joined the SDP in July 1897.

Despite this political similarity, Miller and Cahan differed as to the political orientation of the paper and Cahan left after just four months to join the staff of &quot;The Commercial Advertiser,&quot; a well-established Republican newspaper also based in New York City.

=== First fifty years ===

For the next four years, until 1901, Cahan remained outside of &quot;The Forward&quot; office, learning the newspaper trade in a financially successful setting. He only returned, he later recalled in his memoir, upon the promise of &quot;absolute full power&quot; over the editorial desk.

The circulation of the paper, which was described as &quot;one of the first national newspapers,&quot; grew quickly, paralleling the rapid growth of the Yiddish speaking population of the United States. By 1912 its circulation was 120,000, and by the late 1920s/early 1930s, &quot;The Forward&quot; was a leading U.S. metropolitan daily with considerable influence and a nationwide circulation of more than 275,000 though this had dropped to 170,000 by 1939 as a result of changes in U.S. immigration policy that restricted the immigration of Jews to a trickle.

Early on, &quot;The Forward&quot; defended trade unionism and moderate, democratic socialism. The paper was a significant participant in the activities of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union; Benjamin Schlesinger, a former president of the ILGWU, became the general manager of the paper in 1923, then returned to the presidency of the union in 1928. The paper was also an early supporter of David Dubinsky, Schlesinger&#x27;s eventual successor.

In 1933–34, &quot;The Forward&quot; was the first to publish Fred Beal&#x27;s eyewitness reports of bureaucratic privilege and of famine in the Soviet Union, accounts of the kind that much of the liberal and left-wing press disparaged and resisted. His story corroborated that of the paper&#x27;s labor editor, Harry Lang, who had visited Soviet Ukraine.

In response to the first reports of atrocities against the Jewish population of German-occupied Poland, special correspondent A. Brodie complained of exaggerated dispatches and lack of facts. But as accounts accumulated in the winter of 1939-40 of mass arrests, forced labor, massacres, executions and expulsions, the paper discerned the outline of the unfolding Holocaust.

The best-known writer in the &quot;Yiddish Forward&quot; was Isaac Bashevis Singer, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other well known contributors included Leon Trotsky, S.L. Shneiderman, and Morris Winchevsky.

In 1953, &quot;The Forward&quot; took the position that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were guilty but held that the death sentence was too harsh a punishment.

===After World War II===

By 1962, circulation was down to 56,126 daily and 59,636 Sunday, and by 1983 the newspaper was published only once a week, with an English supplement. In 1990, the English supplement became an independent weekly which by 2000 had a circulation of 26,183, while the Yiddish weekly had a circulation of 7,000 and falling.

As the influence of the Socialist Party in both American politics and in the Jewish community waned, the paper joined the American liberal mainstream though it maintained a social democratic orientation. The English version has some standing in the Jewish community as an outlet of liberal policy analysis. For a period in the 1990s, conservatives came to the fore of the English edition of the paper, but the break from tradition did not last. (A number of conservatives dismissed from &quot;The Forward&quot; later helped to found the modern &quot;New York Sun&quot;.)

The Yiddish edition has recently enjoyed a modest increase in circulation as courses in the language have become more popular among university students; circulation has leveled out at about 5,500. Boris Sandler, one of the most significant contemporary secular writers in Yiddish, was the editor of the Yiddish &quot;Forward&quot; for 18 years, until March 2016; the new editor who succeeded him is Rukhl Schaechter.

From 2013 to 2017, prior to the current format as a monthly magazine, &quot;The Forward&quot; was published as a newspaper in separate English weekly and Yiddish biweekly editions, and online daily. Each was effectively an independent publication with its own contents. Jane Eisner became the first female editor in chief of the English &quot;Forward&quot; in June 2008. The previous editor in chief was J. J. Goldberg, who served from 2000 to 2007; since that time he has been editor at large. The paper maintains a left of center editorial stance.

In August 2015, &quot;The Forward&quot; received wide attention for reporting from Iran at a charged moment in American politics, as the U.S. Congress was ramping up to a vote on an accord reached the month before to limit Tehran&#x27;s nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Assistant Managing Editor Larry Cohler-Esses was, in the words of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The first journalist from an American Jewish pro-Israel publication to be given an Iranian visa since 1979.&quot;

For a few years, there was also a Russian edition. The website of &quot;The Forward&quot; describes its formation: &quot;In the fall of 1995 a Russian-language edition of the Forward was launched, under the editorship of Vladimir &quot;Velvl&quot; Yedidowich. The decision to launch a Russian Forward in the crowded market of Russian-language journalism in New York followed approaches to the Forward Association by a number of intellectual leaders in the fast-growing émigré community who expressed an interest in adding a voice that was strongly Jewish, yet with a secular, social-democratic orientation and an appreciation for the cultural dimension of Jewish life.&quot;

The Russian edition was sold to RAJI (Russian American Jews for Israel) in 2004, although initially it kept the name. In contrast to its English counterpart, the Russian edition and its readership were more sympathetic to right-wing voices. In March 2007, it was renamed the &quot;Forum&quot;.

Around the same time in 2004, the Forward Association also sold off its interest in WEVD to The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s sports division, ESPN.

The name of the publication was shortened to &quot;The Forward&quot; in April 2015.

As of July 2016, &quot;The Forward&quot; began publishing a monthly magazine. The last newspaper published was the June 30, 2016, issue.

===Notable columns and features===
For 24 years, &quot;The Forward&quot; was the home of the column &quot;Philologos&quot;. It now runs in &quot;Mosaic&quot;.

Alana Newhouse, who authored what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a coffee-table book&quot; (&quot;A Living Lens: Photographs of Jewish Life From the Pages of The Forward&quot;), was the paper&#x27;s arts and culture editor.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the paper&#x27;s &quot;A Bintel Brief&quot; feature as &quot;homespun advice ... which predated Dear Abby.&quot;

== Awards ==
In 2020, &quot;The Forward&quot; was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award and won nine Rockower Awards. &quot;The Forward&quot; won two Religion News Association Awards and 34 Rockower Awards in 2021. In 2022, the Forward won two Religion News Association Awards and a record of 43 Rockower Awards. In 2023, the American Jewish Press Association awarded &quot;The Forward&quot; 33 Rockower Awards.

==&quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot; Building==
At the peak of its circulation, &quot;The Forward&quot; erected a ten-story office building at 175 East Broadway on the Lower East Side, designed by architect George Boehm and completed in 1912. It was a prime location, across the street from Seward Park. The building was embellished with marble columns and panels and stained glass windows. The facade features carved bas relief portraits of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels (who co-authored, with Marx, &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;), and Ferdinand Lassalle, founder of the first mass German labor party. A fourth relief portrays a person whose identity has not been clearly established, and has been identified as Wilhelm Liebknecht, Karl Liebknecht, or August Bebel. The paper moved out in 1974, and in the real-estate boom of the 1990s the building was converted to condominiums. &quot;The Forward&quot;, which in 2007 was headquartered at East 33rd Street, is in the Financial District .

==Lists==
The &quot;Forward 50&quot; is a list of 50 Jewish Americans &quot;who have made a significant impact on the Jewish story in the past year&quot;, published annually as an editorial opinion of &quot;The Forward&quot; since 1994. The list was the initiative of Seth Lipsky, founding editor of the English &quot;Forward&quot;.

According to the magazine&#x27;s website, this is not a scientific study, but rather the opinion of staff members, assisted by nominations from readers. &quot;The Forward&quot; does not endorse or support any of the people in the listing. The rankings are divided into different categories (which may vary from year to year): Top Picks, Politics, Activism, Religion, Community, Culture, Philanthropy, Scandals, Sports and, as of 2010, Food.

The list also includes those Jews whose impact in the past year has been dramatic and damaging.

In 2021, &quot;The Forward&quot; published the &quot;Forward Shortlist&quot; instead, which named seven people. In celebration of the magazine&#x27;s 125th anniversary in 2022, the &quot;Forward 125&quot; was introduced, a list of the 125 most influential American Jews from 1897 to 2022.

In 2022, &quot;The Forward&quot; published its list of &quot;The 125 greatest Jewish movie scenes of all time.&quot;

==&quot;The Forward&quot; in English==
&quot;The Forward&quot; began publishing in English in the 1980s, and a 2019 review observed that both Yiddish and English were being produced for its online edition.

Funding for the English edition became available when &quot;The Forward&quot; sold its FM radio station.

While the idea was said to have germinated in 1983, when the Yiddish-only paper &quot;announced that it was going to retreat to weekly publication,&quot; and the actualization of an English edition as an ongoing paper in 1990, by 2010 Seth Lipsky was described as &quot;formerly editor of the English-language edition.&quot;

<text>Sprundel is a village in the southern Netherlands, in the Rucphen municipality.
In the past it was the main village of the region, with roads to Roosendaal to the west, Breda to the east, Rotterdam to the north and Antwerp to the south.

The village was first mentioned in 1282 as &quot;Hermano filio Nekers de Sprundele&quot;. The etymology is unknown. Sprundel developed in the Middle Ages on a stream ridge. The village was abandoned in 1583 when Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron was plundering the area. It was resettled around 1592.

The St John the Baptist Church was built in 1922. The 16th-century tower from the earlier church was retained. The grist mill De Hoop was built in 1840. By 1960, the wind mill was in a very poor condition. It was bought by the municipality in 1972 and extensively repaired between 1976 and 1977. It is frequently in service.

Sprundel was home to 390 people in 1840.
