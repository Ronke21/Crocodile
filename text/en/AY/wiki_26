<text>Nachem Malech Mailer (January 31, 1923 – November 10, 2007), known by his pen name Norman Kingsley Mailer, was an American writer, journalist and filmmaker. In a career spanning more than six decades, Mailer had 11 best-selling books, at least one in each of the seven decades after World War II.

His novel &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; was published in 1948 and brought him early renown. His 1968 nonfiction novel &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction as well as the National Book Award. Among his other well-known works are &quot;An American Dream&quot; (1965), &quot;The Fight&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; (1979), which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

Mailer is considered an innovator of &quot;creative nonfiction&quot; or &quot;New Journalism&quot;, along with Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, and Tom Wolfe, a genre that uses the style and devices of literary fiction in factual journalism. He was a prominent cultural commentator and critic, expressing his often controversial views through his novels, journalism, frequent press appearances, and essays, the most famous and reprinted of which is &quot;The White Negro&quot;. In 1955, he and three others founded &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, an arts and politics-oriented weekly newspaper distributed in Greenwich Village.

In 1960, Mailer was convicted of assault and served a three-year probation after he stabbed his wife Adele Morales with a penknife, nearly killing her. In 1969, he ran an unsuccessful campaign to become the mayor of New York, finishing fourth in the Democratic primaries. Mailer was married six times and had nine children.

==Early life==
Nachem &quot;Norman&quot; Malech (&quot;King&quot;) Mailer was born to a Jewish family in Long Branch, New Jersey, on January 31, 1923. His father, Isaac Barnett Mailer, popularly known as &quot;Barney&quot;, was an accountant born in South Africa, and his mother, Fanny (&quot;née&quot; Schneider), ran a housekeeping and nursing agency. Mailer&#x27;s sister, Barbara, was born in 1927.

Mailer was raised in Brooklyn, first in Flatbush on Cortelyou Road and later in Crown Heights at the corner of Albany and Crown Streets. He graduated from Boys High School and entered Harvard College in 1939, when he was 16 years old. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Signet Society. At Harvard, he majored in engineering but took writing courses as electives. He published his first story, &quot;The Greatest Thing in the World&quot;, at age 18, winning &quot;Story&quot; magazine&#x27;s college contest in 1941.

Mailer graduated from Harvard in 1943 with a Bachelor of Science with honors. He married his first wife Beatrice &quot;Bea&quot; Silverman in January 1944, just before he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Hoping to gain a deferment from service, Mailer argued that he was writing an &quot;important literary work&quot; that pertained to the war. The deferral was denied, and Mailer was forced to enter the Army. After training at Fort Bragg, he was stationed in the Philippines with the 112th Cavalry.

During his time in the Philippines, Mailer was first assigned to regimental headquarters as a typist, then assigned as a wire lineman. In early 1945, after volunteering for a reconnaissance platoon, he completed more than two dozen patrols in contested territory and engaged in several firefights and skirmishes. After the Japanese surrender, he was sent to Japan as part of the army of occupation, was promoted to sergeant, and became a first cook.

When asked about his war experiences, he said that the army was &quot;the worst experience of my life, and also the most important&quot;. While in Japan and the Philippines, Mailer wrote to his wife Bea almost daily, and these approximately 400 letters became the foundation of &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;. He drew on his experience as a reconnaissance rifleman for the central action of the novel: a long patrol behind enemy lines.

==Novelist==

Mailer wrote 12 novels in 59 years. After completing courses in French language and culture at the University of Paris in 1947–48, he returned to the U.S. shortly after &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; was published in May 1948. A &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller for 62 weeks, it was the only one of Mailer&#x27;s novels to reach the number one position. It was hailed by many as one of the best American wartime novels and included in a list of the hundred best English-language novels of the twentieth century by the Modern Library. The book that made his reputation sold more than a million copies in its first year, (three million by 1981) and has never gone out of print. It is still considered to be one of the finest depictions of Americans in combat during World War II.

&quot;Barbary Shore&quot; (1951) was not well received by the critics. It was a surreal parable of Cold War leftist politics set in a Brooklyn rooming-house, and Mailer&#x27;s most autobiographical novel. His 1955 novel, &quot;The Deer Park&quot; drew on his experiences working as a screenwriter in Hollywood from 1949 to 1950. It was initially rejected by seven publishers due to its purportedly sexual content before being published by Putnam&#x27;s. It was not a critical success, but it made the best-seller list, sold more than 50,000 copies its first year, and is considered by some critics to be the best Hollywood novel since Nathanael West&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;.

Mailer wrote his fourth novel, &quot;An American Dream&quot;, as a serial in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine over eight months (January to August 1964), publishing the first chapter two months after he wrote it. In March 1965, Dial Press published a revised version. The novel generally received mixed reviews, but was a best seller. Joan Didion praised it in a review in &quot;National Review&quot; (April 20, 1965) and John W. Aldridge did the same in &quot;Life &quot; (March 19, 1965), while Elizabeth Hardwick panned it in &quot;Partisan Review&quot; (spring 1965). Mailer&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;Why Are We in Vietnam?&quot; was even more experimental in its prose than &quot;An American Dream&quot;. Published in 1967, its critical reception was mostly positive, with many critics, like John Aldridge in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, calling the novel a masterpiece and comparing it to Joyce. Mailer&#x27;s obscene language was criticized by Granville Hicks writing in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; and the anonymous reviewer in &quot;Time&quot;. Eliot Fremont-Smith called the novel &quot;the most original, courageous and provocative novel so far this year&quot; that&#x27;s likely to be &quot;mistakenly reviled&quot;. Other critics, such as Denis Donoghue from the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; praised Mailer for his verisimilitude &quot;for the sensory event&quot;. Donoghue recalls Josephine Miles&#x27; study of the American Sublime, suggesting that the impact of &quot;Why Are We in Vietnam?&quot; was in its voice and style.

In 1972, Joyce Carol Oates called &quot;Vietnam&quot; &quot;Mailer&#x27;s most important work&quot;; it is &quot;an outrageous little masterpiece&quot; that &quot;contains some of Mailer&#x27;s finest writing&quot; and thematically echoes John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

In 1980, &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, Mailer&#x27;s &quot;real-life novel&quot; of the life and death of murderer Gary Gilmore, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Joan Didion reflected the views of many readers when she called the novel &quot;an absolutely astonishing book&quot; at the end of her front-page review in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;.

Mailer spent a longer time writing &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot;, his novel of Egypt in the Twentieth Dynasty (about 1100 BC), than any of his other books. He worked on it for periods from 1972 until 1983. It was also a bestseller, although reviews were generally negative. Harold Bloom, in his review said the book &quot;gives every sign of truncation&quot;, and &quot;could be half again as long, but no reader will wish so&quot;, while Richard Poirier called it Mailer&#x27;s &quot;most audacious book&quot;.

&quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, Mailer&#x27;s longest novel (1310 pages), appeared in 1991 and received his best reviews since &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;. It is an exploration of the untold dramas of the CIA from the end of World War II to 1965. He undertook a huge amount of research for the novel, which is still on CIA reading lists. He ended the novel with the words &quot;To be continued&quot; and planned to write a sequel, titled &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Grave&quot;, but other projects intervened and he never wrote it. &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot; sold well.

His final novel, &quot;The Castle in the Forest&quot;, which focused on Hitler&#x27;s childhood, reached number five on the &quot;Times&quot; best-seller list after publication in January 2007. It received reviews that were more positive than any of his books since &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song.&quot; &quot;Castle&quot; was intended to be the first volume of a trilogy, but Mailer died several months after it was completed. &quot;The Castle in the Forest&quot; received a laudatory 6,200-word front-page review by Lee Siegel in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, as well as a Bad Sex in Fiction Award by the &quot;Literary Review&quot; magazine.

==Journalist==
From the mid-1950s, Mailer became known for his countercultural essays. In 1955, he co-founded &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and was initially an investor and silent partner, but later he wrote a column called &quot;Quickly: A Column for Slow Readers&quot; from January to April 1956. His articles published in this column, 17 in total, were important in his development of a philosophy of hip, or &quot;American existentialism,&quot; and allowed him to discover his penchant for journalism.
Mailer&#x27;s famous essay &quot;The White Negro&quot; (1957) fleshes out the hipster figure who stands in opposition to forces that seek debilitating conformity in American society.
It is believed to be among the most anthologized, and controversial, essays of the postwar period. Mailer republished it in 1959 in his miscellany &quot;Advertisements for Myself&quot;, which he described as &quot;The first work I wrote with a style I could call my own.&quot; The reviews were positive, and most commentators referred to it as his breakthrough work.

In 1960, Mailer wrote &quot;Superman Comes to the Supermarket&quot; for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, an account of the emergence of John F. Kennedy during the Democratic Party convention. The essay was an important breakthrough for the New Journalism of the 1960s, but when the magazine&#x27;s editors changed the title to &quot;Superman Comes to the Supermart&quot;, Mailer was enraged, and would not write for &quot;Esquire&quot; for years. (The magazine later apologized. Subsequent references are to the original title.)

Mailer took part in the October 1967 march on the Pentagon, but initially had no intention of writing a book about it. After conversations with his friend, Willie Morris, editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine, he agreed to produce a long essay describing the march. In a concentrated effort, he produced a 90,000-word piece in two months, and it appeared in &quot;Harper&quot;&#x27;s March issue. It was the longest nonfiction piece to be published by an American magazine. As one commentator states, &quot;Mailer disarmed the literary world with &quot;Armies&quot;. The combination of detached, ironic self-presentation [he described himself in the third person], deft portraiture of literary figures (especially Robert Lowell, Dwight Macdonald, and Paul Goodman), a reported flawless account of the March itself, and a passionate argument addressed to a divided nation, resulted in a sui generis narrative praised by even some of his most inveterate revilers.&quot; Alfred Kazin, writing in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, said, &quot;Mailer&#x27;s intuition is that the times demand a new form. He has found it.&quot; He later expanded the article to a book, &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot; (1968), awarded a National Book Award and a Pulitzer Prize.

Mailer&#x27;s major new journalism, or creative nonfiction, books also include &quot;Miami and the Siege of Chicago&quot; (1968), an account of the 1968 political conventions; &quot;Of a Fire on the Moon&quot; (1971), a long report on the Apollo 11 mission to the moon; &quot;The Prisoner of Sex&quot; (1971), his response to Kate Millett&#x27;s critique of the patriarchal myths in the works of Mailer, Jean Genet, Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence; and &quot;The Fight&quot; (1975), an account of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s 1974 defeat in Zaire of George Foreman for the heavyweight boxing championship. &quot;Miami&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Prisoner&quot; were all finalists for the National Book Award. The hallmark of his five New Journalism works is his use of illeism, or referring to oneself in the third person, rather than the first. Mailer said he got the idea from reading &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; (1918) when he was a Harvard freshman. Mailer also employs many of the most common techniques of fiction in his creative nonfiction.

==Filmmaker==
In addition to his experimental fiction and nonfiction novels, Mailer produced a play version of &quot;The Deer Park&quot; (staged at the Theatre De Lys in Greenwich Village in 1967), which had a four-month run and generally good reviews. In 2007, months before he died, he re-wrote the script, and asked his son Michael, a film producer, to film a staged production in Provincetown, but had to cancel because of his declining health. Mailer obsessed over &quot;The Deer Park&quot; more than he did over any other work.

In the late 1960s, Mailer directed three improvisational avant-garde films: &quot;Wild 90&quot; (1968), &quot;Beyond the Law&quot; (1968), and &quot;Maidstone&quot; (1970). The latter includes a spontaneous and brutal brawl between Norman T. Kingsley, played by Mailer, and Kingsley&#x27;s half-brother Raoul, played by Rip Torn. Mailer received a head injury when Torn struck him with a hammer, and Torn&#x27;s ear became infected when Mailer bit it. In 2012, the Criterion Collection released Mailer&#x27;s experimental films in a box set, &quot;Maidstone and Other Films by Norman Mailer&quot;.
In 1987, he adapted and directed a film version of his novel &quot;Tough Guys Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; starring Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Isabella Rossellini, which has become a minor camp classic.

Mailer took on an acting role in the 1981 Miloš Forman film version of E.L. Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;Ragtime&quot;, playing Stanford White. In 1999, he played Harry Houdini in Matthew Barney&#x27;s &quot;Cremaster 2&quot;, which was inspired by the events surrounding the life of Gary Gilmore.

In 1976, Mailer went to Italy for several weeks to collaborate with Italian Spaghetti Western filmmaker Sergio Leone on an adaptation of the Harry Grey novel &quot;The Hoods&quot;.
Although Leone would pursue other writers shortly thereafter, elements of Mailer&#x27;s first two drafts of the commissioned screenplay would appear in the Italian filmmaker&#x27;s final film, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), starring Robert De Niro.

Mailer starred alongside writer/feminist Germaine Greer in D.A. Pennebaker&#x27;s &quot;Town Bloody Hall&quot;, which was shot in 1971 but not released until 1979.

In 1982, Mailer and Lawrence Schiller would collaborate on a television adaptation of &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Roseanna Arquette, and Eli Wallach. Airing on November 28 and 29, &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; received strong critical reviews and four Emmy nominations, including one for Mailer&#x27;s screenplay. It won two: for sound production and for Jones as best actor.

In 1987, Mailer was to appear in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s experimental film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, to be shot in Switzerland. Originally, Mailer was to play the lead character, Don Learo, in Godard&#x27;s unscripted film alongside his daughter, Kate Mailer. The film also featured Woody Allen and Peter Sellars. However, tensions surfaced between Mailer and Godard early in the production when Godard insisted that Mailer play a character who had a carnal relationship with his own daughter. Mailer left Switzerland after just one day of shooting.

In 1997, Mailer was set to direct the boxing drama &quot;Ringside,&quot; based on an original script by his son Michael and two others. The male lead role, an Irish-American streetfighter who finds redemption in the ring, was to be Brendan Fraser, and it was also to star Halle Berry, Anthony Quinn, and Paul Sorvino.

In 2001, he adapted the screenplay for the movie: &quot;Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story&quot;.

In 2005, Mailer served as a technical consultant on the Ron Howard boxing movie &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, about legendary boxer Jim Braddock. 

==Biographer==
Mailer&#x27;s approach to biography came from his interest in the ego of the artist as an &quot;exemplary type&quot;. His own biographer, J. Michael Lennon, explains that Mailer would use &quot;himself as a species of divining rod to explore the psychic depths&quot; of disparate personalities, like Pablo Picasso, Muhammad Ali, Gary Gilmore, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Marilyn Monroe. &quot;Ego,&quot; states Lennon, &quot;can be seen as the beginning of a major phase in his writing career: Mailer as biographer.&quot;

Beginning as an assignment from Lawrence Schiller to write a short preface to a collection of photographs, Mailer&#x27;s 1973 biography of Monroe (usually designated &quot;&quot;) was not approached as a traditional biography. Mailer read the available biographies, watched Monroe&#x27;s films, and looked at photographs of Monroe; for the rest of it, Mailer stated, &quot;I speculated.&quot; Since Mailer did not have the time to thoroughly research the facts surrounding her death, his speculation led to the biography&#x27;s controversy. The book&#x27;s final chapter theorizes that Monroe was murdered by rogue agents of the FBI and CIA who resented her supposed affair with Robert F. Kennedy. Mailer later admitted that he embellished the book with speculations about Monroe&#x27;s sex life and death that he did not himself believe to ensure its commercial success. In his own autobiography, Monroe&#x27;s former husband Arthur Miller wrote that Mailer saw himself as Monroe &quot;in drag, acting out his own Hollywood fantasies of fame and sex unlimited and power.&quot;

The book was enormously successful; it sold more copies than did any of Mailer&#x27;s works except &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;, and it is Mailer&#x27;s most widely reviewed book. It was the inspiration for the Emmy-nominated TV movie &quot;&quot;, which aired in 1980. Two later works co-written by Mailer presented imagined words and thoughts in Monroe&#x27;s voice: the 1980 book &quot;Of Women and Their Elegance&quot; and the 1986 play &quot;Strawhead&quot;, which was produced off Broadway starring his daughter Kate Mailer.

In the wake of the &quot;Marilyn&quot; controversy, Mailer attempted to explain his unique approach to biography. He suggests that his biography must be seen as a &quot;&quot;species&quot; of novel ready to play by the rules of biography.&quot; Exemplary egos, he explains, are best explained by other exemplary egos, and personalities like Monroe&#x27;s are best left in the hands of a novelist.

==Activist==
A number of Mailer&#x27;s nonfiction works, such as &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot; and &quot;The Presidential Papers&quot;, are political. He covered the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1992, and 1996, although his account of the 1996 Democratic convention has never been published. In the early 1960s he was fixated on the figure of President John F. Kennedy, whom he regarded as an &quot;existential hero&quot;. In the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s and 1970s, his work mingled autobiography, social commentary, history, fiction, and poetry in a formally original way that influenced the development of New Journalism.

Mailer held the position that the Cold War was not a positive ideal for America. It allowed the state to become strong and invested in the daily lives of the people. He critiqued conservative politics as they, specifically those of Barry Goldwater, supported the Cold War and an increase in government spending and oversight. This, Mailer argued, stood in opposition with conservative principles such as lower taxes and smaller government. He believed that conservatives were pro-Cold War because that was politically relevant to them and would therefore help them win. 

Indeed, Mailer was outspoken about his mistrust of politics in general as a way of meaningful change in America. In &quot;Miami and the Siege of Chicago&quot; (1968), he explained his view of &quot;politics-as-property&quot;, likening a politician to a property holder who is &quot;never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own.&quot; Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: &quot;If you played for a team, you did your best to play very well, but there was something obscene ... in starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State.&quot; Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. President Johnson, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had good charisma so all was forgiven.

In September 1961, Mailer was one of 29 original prominent American sponsors of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee organization with which John F. Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was associated in 1963. In December 1963, Mailer and several of the other sponsors left the organization.

In October 1967, Mailer was arrested for his involvement in an anti–Vietnam War demonstration at the Pentagon sponsored by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. In 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.

In 1980, Mailer spearheaded convicted killer Jack Abbott&#x27;s successful bid for parole. In 1977, Abbott had read about Mailer&#x27;s work on &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; and wrote to Mailer, offering to enlighten the author about Abbott&#x27;s time behind bars and the conditions he was experiencing. Mailer, impressed, helped to publish &quot;In the Belly of the Beast&quot;, a book on life in the prison system consisting of Abbott&#x27;s letters to Mailer. Once paroled, Abbott committed a murder in New York City six weeks after his release, stabbing 22-year-old Richard Adan to death. Consequently, Mailer was subject to criticism for his role. In a 1992 interview with the &quot;Buffalo News&quot;, he conceded that his involvement was &quot;another episode in my life in which I can find nothing to cheer about or nothing to take pride in.&quot;

The 1986 meeting of P.E.N. in New York City featured key speeches by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Mailer. The appearance of a government official was derided by many, and as Shultz ended his speech, the crowd seethed, with some calling to &quot;read the protest&quot; that had been circulated to criticize Shultz&#x27;s appearance. Mailer, who was next to speak, responded by shouting to the crowd: &quot;Up yours!&quot;

In 1989, Mailer joined with a number of other prominent authors in publicly expressing support for colleague Salman Rushdie, whose &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; led to a &quot;fatwa&quot; issued by Iran&#x27;s Islamic government calling for Rushdie&#x27;s assassination.

In 2003, in a speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, just before the Iraq War, Mailer said: &quot;Fascism is more of a natural state than democracy. To assume blithely that we can export democracy into any country we choose can serve paradoxically to encourage more fascism at home and abroad. Democracy is a state of grace that is attained only by those countries who have a host of individuals not only ready to enjoy freedom but to undergo the heavy labor of maintaining it.&quot;

From 1980 until his death in 2007, Mailer contributed to Democratic Party candidates for political office.

==Politician==

In 1969, at the suggestion of feminist Gloria Steinem, his friend the political essayist Noel Parmentel, and others, Mailer ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic Party primary for mayor of New York City, allied with columnist Jimmy Breslin (who ran for city council president), proposing the creation of a 51st state through New York City secession. Although Mailer took stands on a wide range of issues, from opposing &quot;compulsory fluoridation of the water supply&quot; to advocating the release of Black Panther Party leader Huey Newton, decentralization was the overriding issue of the campaign. Mailer &quot;foresaw the city, its independence secured, splintering into townships and neighborhoods, with their own school systems, police departments, housing programs, and governing philosophies.&quot; Their slogan was &quot;throw the rascals in.&quot; Mailer was endorsed by libertarian economist Murray Rothbard, who &quot;believed that &#x27;smashing the urban government apparatus and fragmenting it into a myriad of constituent fragments&#x27; offered the only answer to the ills plaguing American cities,&quot; and called Mailer&#x27;s campaign &quot;the most refreshing libertarian political campaign in decades.&quot; Mailer finished fourth in a field of five. Looking back on the campaign, journalist and historian Theodore H. White called it &quot;one of the most serious campaigns run in the United States in the last five years. . . . [H]is campaign was considered and thoughtful, the beginning of an attempt to apply ideas to a political situation.&quot; Characterizing his campaign, Mailer said: &quot;The difference between me and the other candidates is that I&#x27;m no good and I can prove it.&quot;

==Artist==
Mailer enjoyed drawing and drew prolifically, particularly toward the end of his life. While his work is not widely known, his drawings, which were inspired by Picasso&#x27;s style, were exhibited at the Berta Walker Gallery in Provincetown in 2007, and are now displayed on the online arts community POBA - Where the Arts Live.

==Recurring themes==
Norman Mailer&#x27;s career is characterized by several recurring themes and concerns that illustrate his philosophical, social, and psychological preoccupations. These thematic concerns reflect a lifetime of grappling with the contradictions of modern life, the nature of freedom, and the complexities of identity. His work is a sustained inquiry into what it means to be truly alive in a world he viewed as increasingly dehumanized by conformity, power structures, and moral ambiguity.

===Existential violence and masculinity===
Mailer believed that violence, while brutal, was a path to existential authenticity and a rejection of societal repression. In &quot;The White Negro&quot; (1957), Mailer introduced his &quot;Hipster&quot; archetype as an individual who uses violence as a form of rebellion and self-discovery, confronting societal hypocrisy and embracing primal impulses. This perspective underlies much of his work, particularly &quot;An American Dream&quot; (1965), in which protagonist Stephen Rojack commits violent acts that symbolize a radical break from societal constraints, reflecting Mailer&#x27;s existential philosophy.

Masculinity is depicted in Mailer&#x27;s work as both a source of strength and a potential path to self-ruin. His exploration of masculine identity is especially evident in &quot;Why Are We in Vietnam?&quot; (1967), where a young man&#x27;s hunting trip serves as an extended metaphor for American militarism and the nation&#x27;s obsessive masculinity. As critic J. Michael Lennon points out, Mailer used this novel to critique America’s association of manhood with domination and aggression. Mailer&#x27;s writing frequently frames masculinity as an essential, though sometimes destructive, force in the search for self-identity.

===The individual vs. society===
Many of Mailer&#x27;s protagonists are outsiders who seek to assert their individual wills in a conformist society, embodying his critique of modern institutions. In &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1948), Mailer contrasts the individual struggles of soldiers with the dehumanizing machinery of war, highlighting the tension between personal autonomy and authoritarian control. Mailer’s existential belief that &quot;to be alive was to stand alone&quot; reflects his view that true identity comes through opposition to societal norms. This theme is echoed in &quot;Advertisements for Myself&quot; (1959), where Mailer asserts that genuine artists must break away from societal norms to achieve true creative expression.

Mailer was an outspoken critic of what he saw as a &quot;cancer&quot; of conformity in American society. In &quot;Advertisements for Myself&quot; (1959), he argues that artists must defy conventional values to achieve authenticity, a statement that underpins his own often controversial approach to literature and life. His distrust of middle-class values and suburban complacency is a recurring motif in his works, where he often depicts the &quot;outsider&quot; as a figure of integrity against societal pressures to conform. Mailer sees society as a force that suppresses individuality, pushing people towards mediocrity.

===Politics and morality===
Mailer engaged directly with the politics of his time, often depicting political events and figures in morally ambiguous terms. His book &quot;Miami and the Siege of Chicago&quot; (1968) documents the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where he critiques the establishment&#x27;s moral failings and the inherent compromises of political power. Mailer&#x27;s political views were complex—while he supported some radical ideas, he also expressed skepticism toward revolutionary ideologies, revealing his belief that politics is rarely morally straightforward.

Mailer explored the idea of leadership and heroism, particularly in relation to the &quot;existential hero&quot; who could lead America away from conformity. In &quot;Superman Comes to the Supermarket&quot; (1960), he critiques the rise of consumer culture and its impact on political leadership, arguing that America needs a leader with the “existential courage” to confront societal decay. Mailer admired figures like John F. Kennedy, whom he saw as embodying this existential vitality, though he was wary of the superficiality of political power.

However, Mailer was critical of Kennedy&#x27;s limitations as a political leader. In &quot;The Presidential Papers&quot; (1963), he reflected on Kennedy&#x27;s presidency, voicing concerns over the tendency of political power to prioritize public image over substantial existential action. Mailer noted that Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;political realities&quot; sometimes fell short of his symbolic potential, a critique that grew stronger after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, when Mailer revisited his initial idealization with a degree of skepticism.

===Spirituality and the human condition===
As Mailer aged, his exploration of existential themes grew increasingly spiritual, reflecting a search for meaning and redemption. This is especially apparent in &quot;The Gospel According to the Son&quot; (1997), where he reimagines the story of Jesus from a first-person perspective, contemplating the nature of sin, grace, and redemption. Mailer&#x27;s evolving interest in spirituality demonstrates his shift from existential angst to a more contemplative stance on the mysteries of human existence.

Mailer saw life as a spiritual and psychological journey, with death as the ultimate test of authenticity. He viewed writing as a means to confront mortality and explore divine questions, likening the writer&#x27;s role to that of a prophet. His fascination with life and death extended to his personal philosophy, which embraced the idea of confronting one&#x27;s fears to gain insight into the divine and the self.

===Sexuality and gender dynamics===
Mailer&#x27;s works often present sexuality as a potent force, a battleground for power and transgression. His views on sexuality are vividly explored in &quot;The Prisoner of Sex&quot; (1971), where he famously counters feminist critiques, like that of Kate Millett, arguing that sexuality is inherently intertwined with both conflict and attraction. Millett critiques Mailer as a proponent of a &quot;virility cult&quot;, emphasizing his portrayal of sex as an expression of power and violence, and he positions male sexuality as combative and inherently dominating. Although his views sparked criticism, Mailer believed that sexual dynamics reveal deep-seated truths about power and human nature.

Mailer&#x27;s female characters are often depicted through archetypal lenses, reflecting his complex, sometimes problematic views on women. For instance, in &quot;Marilyn&quot; (1973), Mailer portrays Marilyn Monroe as both a victim and an idealized figure of femininity, embodying vulnerability, allure, and the destructive side of fame. This approach to female characters reveals Mailer&#x27;s ambivalence toward gender roles, often portraying women as both sources of inspiration and existential challenge.

Critics like Joyce Carol Oates argued that Mailer’s perspective, while ostensibly reverent toward femininity, ultimately &quot;dehumanized&quot; women by reducing them to carriers of biological destiny rather than as complex individuals with aspirations beyond motherhood and sexuality.

Power over bodies, societies, political entities, etc., reverberates throughout Mailer&#x27;s work. In addition – and notable for such a prominent mainstream American writer of his generation – Mailer, throughout his work and personal communications, repeatedly expresses interest in, includes episodes of, or makes references to bisexuality or homosexuality. He directly addresses the subject publicly in his essay &quot;The Homosexual Villain&quot;, for &quot;One&quot; magazine.

=== Views on race ===
Mailer focused on jazz as the ultimate expression of African-American bravado, and he represented musical figures such as Miles Davis in works including &quot;An American Dream&quot;. African-American men reflected a challenge to Mailer&#x27;s own notions of masculinity.

While in Paris in 1956, Mailer met African-American author James Baldwin. Mailer became even more fascinated with African-Americans after meeting Baldwin, and this friendship inspired Mailer to write &quot;The White Negro&quot;. To Mailer, Baldwin was a natural point of intrigue; Baldwin was gay, and his stature as an author was similar to Mailer&#x27;s own.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Mailer was married six times and had nine children. He fathered eight children by his various wives and informally adopted his sixth wife&#x27;s son from another marriage.

Mailer&#x27;s first marriage was to Beatrice Silverman. They eloped in January 1944 because neither family would likely have approved. They had one child, Susan, and divorced in 1952 because of Mailer&#x27;s infidelities with Adele Morales.

Morales moved in with Mailer during 1951 into an apartment on First Avenue near Second Street in the East Village, and they married in 1954. They had two daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. After hosting a party on Saturday, November 19, 1960, Mailer stabbed Adele twice with a two-and-a-half inch blade that he used to clean his nails, nearly killing her by puncturing her pericardium. He stabbed her once in the chest and once in the back. Adele required emergency surgery but made a quick recovery. Mailer claimed he had stabbed Adele &quot;to relieve her of cancer&quot;. He was involuntarily committed to Bellevue Hospital for 17 days. While Adele did not press charges, saying she wanted to protect their daughters, Mailer later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assault saying, &quot;I feel I did a lousy, dirty, cowardly thing&quot;, and received a suspended sentence of three years&#x27; probation. In 1962, the two divorced. In 1997, Adele published a memoir of their marriage entitled &quot;The Last Party&quot;, which recounted her husband stabbing her at a party and the aftermath. This incident has been a focal point for feminist critics of Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work.

His third wife, whom he married in 1962 and divorced in 1963, was the British heiress and journalist Lady Jeanne Campbell (1929–2007). She was the only daughter of Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll, a Scottish aristocrat and clan chief with a notorious private life, and his first wife Janet Gladys Aitken, who was a daughter of the press baron Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook. The couple had a daughter, actress Kate Mailer.

His fourth marriage, in 1963, was to Beverly Bentley, a former model turned actress. She was the mother of two of his sons, producer Michael Mailer and actor Stephen Mailer. They divorced in 1980.

His fifth wife was Carol Stevens, a jazz singer whom he married on November 7, 1980, and divorced in Haiti on November 8, 1980, thereby legitimating their daughter Maggie, born in 1971.

His sixth and last wife, whom he married in 1980, was Norris Church Mailer (born Barbara Jean Davis, 1949–2010), an art teacher. They had one son together, John Buffalo Mailer, a writer and actor. Mailer raised and informally adopted Matthew Norris, Church&#x27;s son by her first husband, Larry Norris. Living in Brooklyn, New York and Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mailer, Church worked as a model, wrote and painted.

===Works with his children===
In 2005, Mailer co-wrote a book with his youngest child, John Buffalo Mailer, titled &quot;The Big Empty&quot;. Mailer appeared in a 2004 episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; titled &quot;Norman Mailer, I&#x27;m Pregnant!&quot; with his son Stephen Mailer.

===Other relationships===
Over the course of his life, Mailer was connected with several women other than his wives, including Carole Mallory, who wrote a &quot;tell all&quot; biography, &quot;Loving Mailer,&quot; after his death.

In a chance meeting in an Upper East Side New York restaurant in 1982, Gloria Leonard first met Mailer. He struck up a conversation with Leonard after recognizing her. The meeting was rumored to have led to a brief affair between the two. Later, Leonard was approached by a group of movie distributors from the Midwest to finance what was described as &quot;the world&#x27;s first million-dollar pornographic movie&quot;. She invited Mailer to lunch and made her pitch for his services as a writer. In an interview Leonard said that the author &quot;sat straight up in his chair and said, &#x27;I always knew I&#x27;d one day make a porny. Leonard then asked what his fee would be and Mailer responded with &quot;Two-hundred fifty thousand&quot;. Leonard then asked if he&#x27;d be interested in adapting his novel-biography of Marilyn Monroe, but Mailer replied that he wanted to do something original. The project later ended due to scheduling conflicts between the two.

===Personality===
At the December 15, 1971 taping of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; with Janet Flanner and Gore Vidal, Mailer, annoyed with a less-than-stellar review by Vidal of &quot;Prisoner of Sex&quot;, allegedly insulted and head-butted Vidal backstage. As the show began taping a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted he had been drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on-air and referred to his own &quot;greater intellect&quot;. He openly taunted and mocked Vidal, who responded in kind, and earned the ire of Flanner who announced during the discussion that she was &quot;...becoming very, very bored...&quot; Flanner told Mailer and Vidal &quot;...you act as if you&#x27;re the only people here.&quot; As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailer&#x27;s intellect to his ego, Mailer stated &quot;Why don&#x27;t you look at your question sheet and ask your question?&quot;, to which Cavett responded &quot;Why don&#x27;t you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don&#x27;t shine?&quot; A long laugh ensued after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had come up with that line. Cavett replied &quot;I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy?&quot; The head-butting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his essay &quot;Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots&quot;.

According to his obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, his &quot;relentless machismo seemed out of place in a man who was actually quite small – though perhaps that was where the aggression originated.&quot;

Alan Dershowitz, in his book, &quot;Taking the Stand&quot;, recounts when Claus von Bülow had a dinner party after he was found not guilty at his trial. Dershowitz countered that he would not attend if it was a &quot;victory party&quot;, and von Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for &quot;several interesting friends&quot;. Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bülow&#x27;s innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wife&#x27;s arm, and said: &quot;Let&#x27;s get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Mailer died of acute renal failure on November 10, 2007, a month after undergoing lung surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He is buried in Provincetown Cemetery, Provincetown, Massachusetts.

Mailer was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature several times, and on the Nobel committee&#x27;s shortlist at least once, in 1974.

Mailer was referenced in the song &quot;Vlad the Impaler,&quot; by American heavy metal band GWAR on their 1990 album &quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot;.

More than a thousand boxes of Mailer&#x27;s papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin.

In 2003, the Norman Mailer Society was founded to help ensure the legacy of Mailer&#x27;s work. In 2008, The Norman Mailer Center and The Norman Mailer Writers Colony, a non-profit organization for educational purposes, was established to honor Mailer. Among its programs is the Norman Mailer Prize established in 2009. In 2008, Carole Mallory, a former mistress, sold seven boxes of documents and photographs to Harvard University, Mailer&#x27;s alma mater. They contain extracts of her letters, books and journals.

Throughout his lifetime, Mailer wrote more than 45,000 letters. In 2014, Mailer&#x27;s biographer J. Michael Lennon chose 712 of those letters and published them in &quot;Selected Letters of Norman Mailer&quot;, which covers the period between the 1940s and the early 2000s.

In March 2018, the Library of America published a two-volume collection of Mailer&#x27;s works from the sixties: &quot;Four Books of the 1960s&quot; and &quot;Collected Essays of the 1960s&quot;. Critic David Denby suggests that based on Mailer&#x27;s observations about the fractured political atmosphere in America that led to the 1967 march on the Pentagon, Mailer&#x27;s work seems to be as relevant today as it was fifty years ago and that &quot;Mailer may be due for reappraisal and revival.&quot;

In May 2018, the Norman Mailer Society and the city of Long Branch, New Jersey co-sponsored the installation of a bronze plaque where the Mailer family&#x27;s Queen-Anne style hotel, the Scarboro, used to stand on the city&#x27;s beachfront.

In October 2019, Wilkes University&#x27;s Farley Library opened a replica of Mailer&#x27;s last study in Provincetown, Massachusetts, replete with &quot;some of his private library, manuscripts and revisions dating from 1984 as well as his studio furniture&quot;. The archive also houses Mailer&#x27;s entire 4,000-volume library from his home in Brooklyn and an original portrait of Mailer by painter Nancy Ellen Craig donated by Mailer&#x27;s daughter Danielle. The room opened with an event on October 10, 2019, to coincide with the annual conference of the Norman Mailer Society and was attended by several members of Mailer&#x27;s family.

In 2019, Susan Mailer, Norman&#x27;s eldest daughter, published a memoir about her relationship with her father. &quot;In Another Place: With and Without My Father Norman Mailer&quot; explores her &quot;intense and complex&quot; relationship with her father and the extended Mailer family. Reviewer Nicole DePolo writes that Susan Mailer, a psychoanalyst, provides sharp insights about her father in &quot;crisp, vibrant prose that captures the essence of moments that are both remarkable and universally resonant&quot;.

In 2023, &quot;How to Come Alive with Norman Mailer,&quot; a documentary by Jeff Zimbalist, was released.

<text>Wasps of the genus Sphex (commonly known as digger wasps) are cosmopolitan predators that sting and paralyze prey insects. &quot;Sphex&quot; is one of many genera in the old digger wasp family Sphecidae (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), though most apart from the Sphecinae have now been moved to the family Crabronidae. There are over 130 known &quot;Sphex&quot; species.

==Behaviour==
In preparation for egg laying, they construct a protected &quot;nest&quot; (some species dig nests in the ground, while others use pre-existing holes) and then stock it with captured insects. Typically, the prey are left alive, but paralyzed by wasp toxins. The wasps lay their eggs in the provisioned nest and the wasp larvae feed on the paralyzed insects as they develop.

The great golden digger wasp (&quot;Sphex ichneumoneus&quot;) is found in North America. The developing wasps spend the winter in their nest. When the new generation of adults emerge, they contain the genetically programmed behaviors required to carry out another season of nest building. During the summer, a female might build as many as six nests, each with several compartments for her eggs. The building and provisioning of the nests takes place in a stereotypical, step-by-step fashion.

&quot;Sphex&quot; has been shown, as in some Jean-Henri Fabre studies, not to count how many crickets it collects for its nest. Although the wasp instinctively searches for four crickets, it cannot take into account a lost cricket, whether the cricket has been lost to ants or flies or simply been misplaced. &quot;Sphex&quot; drags its cricket prey towards its burrow by the antennae; if the antennae of the cricket are cut off, the wasp would not think to continue to pull its prey by a leg.

The navigation abilities of &quot;Sphex&quot; were studied by the ethologist Niko Tinbergen. Richard Dawkins and Jane Brockmann later studied female rivalry over nesting holes in &quot;Sphex ichneumoneus&quot;.

== Use in philosophy ==
Some writers in the philosophy of mind, most notably Daniel Dennett, have cited &quot;Sphex&quot;&#x27;s behavior for their arguments about human and animal free will.

Some &quot;Sphex&quot; wasps drop a paralyzed insect near the opening of the nest. Before taking provisions into the nest, the &quot;Sphex&quot; first inspects the nest, leaving the prey outside. During the inspection, an experimenter can move the prey a few inches away from the opening. When the &quot;Sphex&quot; emerges from the nest ready to drag in the prey, it finds the prey missing. The &quot;Sphex&quot; quickly locates the moved prey, but now its behavioral &quot;program&quot; has been reset. After dragging the prey back to the opening of the nest, once again the &quot;Sphex&quot; is compelled to inspect the nest, so the prey is again dropped and left outside during another stereotypical inspection of the nest. This iteration can be repeated several times without the &quot;Sphex&quot; changing its sequence; by some accounts, endlessly. Dennett&#x27;s argument quotes an account of &quot;Sphex&quot; behavior from Dean Wooldridge&#x27;s &quot;Machinery of the Brain&quot; (1963). Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett have used this mechanistic behavior as an example of how seemingly thoughtful behavior can actually be quite mindless, the opposite of free will (or, as Dennett described it, sphexishness).

Philosopher Fred Keijzer challenges this use of &quot;Sphex&quot;, citing experiments in which behavioral adaptations are observed after many iterations. Keijzer sees the persistence of the &quot;Sphex&quot; example in cognitive theory as an indication of its rhetorical usefulness, not its factual accuracy. Keijzer also noted that repeated inspection of a disturbed nest may very well be an adaptive behavior, thus diminishing the aptness of Hofstadter&#x27;s metaphor.

<doc id="189776" wikidata="Q156516" url="?curid=189776" title="Underground (1995 film)">
<text>Underground (), is a 1995 epic satirical black comedy war film directed by Emir Kusturica, with a screenplay co-written with Dušan Kovačević. It is also known by the subtitle Once Upon a Time There Was One Country (), the title of the five-hour miniseries (the long cut) shown on Serbian RTS television.

The film uses the epic story of two friends to portray a Yugoslav history from the beginning of World War II until the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars. It is an international co-production with companies from Yugoslavia (Serbia), France, Germany, Czech Republic and Hungary. The theatrical version is 163 minutes long. Kusturica stated in interviews that his original version ran for over five hours, and that co-producers forced edits.

&quot;Underground&quot; received critical acclaim, and won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. It was Kusturica&#x27;s second win following &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; (1985). It went on to win other honours.

==Plot==
On the morning of 6 April 1941 in Belgrade, the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, two &quot;bon vivants&quot;, Petar Popara, nicknamed Crni (Blacky) and Marko Dren, head home. They pass through Kalemegdan and shout salutes to Marko&#x27;s brother Ivan, an animal keeper in the Belgrade Zoo. Marko lets Blacky&#x27;s pregnant wife Vera know that they have enrolled Blacky in the Communist Party (KPJ).

===Part One: War===
The hungover Blacky eats breakfast while Vera complains about his supposed affair with a theatre actress. After the roar of the planes is heard, German bombs begin falling on Belgrade. After the air raid is over, Blacky goes out against Vera&#x27;s wishes and inspects the devastated city. Encountering ruins and escaped animals from the zoo, he also runs into disconsolate Ivan carrying Soni, a baby chimp. The Royal Yugoslav Army&#x27;s resistance is broken, and German troops occupy and dismember the Kingdom. Blacky starts operating clandestinely as a communist activist along with Marko and others. Blacky occasionally visits his mistress Natalija Zovkov who has been assigned to a special actors&#x27; labour brigade that is helping the city&#x27;s rebuilding effort under German occupation. A celebrated actress in the National Theatre, Natalija has caught the eye of Franz, a high-ranking German officer.

Marko has set up a weapons stash in the cellar of his grandfather&#x27;s house. Following their interception of a trainload of weapons, Marko and Blacky are identified as dangerous bandits in German radio bulletins. While Blacky hides in the woods as Germans intensify door-to-door raids, Marko takes Vera, Ivan and others into the cellar to hide. Vera is due and gives birth to a baby boy, who she names Jovan before dying.

In 1944, Blacky is in town to celebrate Jovan&#x27;s birthday at a communist hangout. The two best friends head for the theatre and see Natalija performing on stage in front of Franz and other German officers. Blacky shoots Franz in the chest (he survives) and, along with Natalija and Marko, reaches the river boat anchored outside Belgrade. There, they all get ready for a forced wedding despite Natalija&#x27;s protestations.

The party is interrupted by German soldiers surrounding the boat. Franz yells, demanding Blacky and Marko release Natalija, who runs to him. Blacky is captured by Germans and tortured in a hospital with electric shocks while Franz and Natalija visit her brother Bata there. Meanwhile, Marko finds a way to enter the building through an underground sewer passage. Sneaking up on Franz, Marko strangles him to death with a cord in front of Natalija who switches sides once again. Marko then proceeds to free Blacky. They leave with a fatigued Blacky hidden in a suitcase, but he is injured by a grenade.

Days later on Easter 1944, Marko and Natalija, now a couple, watch a comatose Blacky. In late October, the Red Army accompanied by Yugoslav Partisans enters Belgrade. Marko gives speeches from the National Theater balcony during the Trieste crisis, socializes with Josip Broz Tito, Aleksandar Ranković and Edvard Kardelj, and stands next to Tito during military parades through downtown Belgrade.

===Part Two: Cold War===
In 1961, Marko is one of Tito&#x27;s closest associates and advisors. The physically recovered Blacky and company are still in the cellar under the impression that the War is still going on above. Marko and Natalija attend a ceremony to open a cultural center and unveil a statue of Petar Popara Blacky, who everyone thinks died, becoming a People&#x27;s Hero. With the help of his grandfather who is in on the con, Marko oversees the weapons manufacturing and even controls time by removing hours to a day so the people in the cellar think that only 15 years passed since the beginning of World War II instead of 20.

The filming of a state-sponsored motion picture based on Marko&#x27;s memoirs titled &quot;Proleće stiže na belom konju&quot; (&quot;Spring Comes On A White Horse&quot;) begins above ground. Soon, Blacky&#x27;s 20-year-old son Jovan will marry Jelena, a girl he grew up with in the cellar. Soni wanders into a tank and fires it, blowing a hole in the wall. Soni wanders off, and Ivan follows.

Blacky, with his son Jovan, emerges from underground for the first time in decades. They encounter the movie set and, believing the war is still on, kill two extras and the actor playing Franz. In the manhunt, Jovan drowns but Blacky escapes.

=== Part Three: War ===
In 1992, at the height of the Yugoslav Wars, Ivan re-emerges with Soni with whom he was recently reunited. He stumbles upon Marko who attempts to broker an arms deal in the middle of a conflict zone. The deal falls through and Ivan catches up with Marko and beats him to unconsciousness, then commits suicide. Natalija arrives and rushes to Marko&#x27;s side. They are captured by militants and they are ordered to be executed as arms dealers by militants&#x27; commander, Blacky.

Blacky moves his people out to the cellar that he lived years ago, taking Soni with him. He sees an image of Jovan in a well, and falls in while reaching for him, presumably ending his life as well.

In a dreamlike sequence, Blacky, Marko, Vera and others re-emerge from underneath the water and are reunited at an outside dinner party on a small grass peninsula to celebrate Jovan&#x27;s wedding. Ivan gives a few parting words, saying that they will impart to their children fairy tales that start with &quot;Once upon a time, there was a country.&quot; As the group sings and dances, the ground separates from the peninsula, forming an island, and seemingly floats away into the distance with them still on it.

==Cast==
* Miki Manojlović as Marko Dren, a career-climbing Communist Party activist who becomes its high-ranking official and organizer of the communist resistance weapons manufacturing during World War II as well as the lucrative arms trade after the war ends. In parallel, he becomes an influential and wealthy arms dealer as well as a post-war Communist Yugoslavia state dignitary.
* Lazar Ristovski as Petar &quot;Blacky&quot; Popara, an electrician who idealistically joins the Communist Party right before World War II and goes on to mark himself out as a skilled and determined Partisan guerilla resistance fighter during the war&#x27;s early stages only to end up in a weapons manufacturing cellar for the remainder of it. Once he finally emerges from the cellar, many decades after World War II ended, he becomes a Yugoslavian patriot during the Yugoslav Wars.
* Mirjana Joković as Natalija Zovkov, an opportunistic theatre actress constantly switching loyalties
* Slavko Štimac as Ivan Dren, Marko&#x27;s stutterer brother who cares for zoo animals
* Ernst Stötzner as Franz, a Wehrmacht officer in charge of occupied Belgrade during World War II. Stötzner also portrays the actor playing Franz in &quot;Proleće stiže na belom konju&quot;.
* Srđan Todorović as Jovan Popara, Blacky&#x27;s son, who lives almost his entire life underground
* Mirjana Karanović as Vera, Blacky&#x27;s wife
* Danilo Stojković as Grandfather, Marko&#x27;s grandfather who owns the cellar and helps perpetuate his ruse
* Bora Todorović as Golub, the leader of the brass orchestra that frequently accompanies Blacky and Marko
* Davor Dujmović as Bata, Natalija&#x27;s crippled brother
* Mirsad Tuka as Investigator
* Predrag Zagorac as Tomislav

==Production==
The shooting of the film began in fall 1993 and lasted off-and-on until early spring 1995. The state-owned Radio Television of Serbia had a small role in financing the film, and the film used rented Yugoslav Army (VJ) equipment as props.

===Soundtrack===

The film&#x27;s soundtrack includes music by Goran Bregović and the participation of Cesária Évora.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Underground&quot; has not been widely reviewed by English-language critics, though it has gained generally favorable reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 86% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Offering an insightful look at Communist Eastern Europe through the microcosm of a long friendship, &quot;Underground&quot; is an exhausting, exhilarating epic.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generaly favorable reviews&quot;.

In the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Dave Kehr lauded the film as &quot;ferociously intelligent and operatically emotional,&quot; and Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it a &quot;sprawling, rowdy, vital film laced with both outrageous absurdist dark humor and unspeakable pain, suffering and injustice&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Deborah Young reviewed the film after seeing it at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, praising it as &quot;a steamroller circus that leaves the viewer dazed and exhausted, but mightily impressed&quot;, and adding that &quot;if Fellini had shot a war movie, it might resemble &quot;Underground&quot;&quot;.

Writing in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; in November 1996, British author Misha Glenny delivered a stinging attack on critics who view &quot;Underground&quot; or Srđan Dragojević&#x27;s &quot;Lepa sela lepo gore&quot; through a simplistic, reductionist pro- or anti-Serb critical lens.

Janet Maslin of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;real heart is its devastating idea of a morning after: the moment when, after being in the grip of a political delusion lasting several decades, a man can emerge from a subterranean hiding place in his native Yugoslavia and be told that there is no Yugoslavia any more&quot;. While acknowledging that &quot;the politics of &quot;Underground&quot; have been assailed and dissected by international audiences&quot;, she feels that &quot;this debate is largely specious as there&#x27;s no hidden agenda to this robust and not terribly subtle tale of duplicity with Mr. Kusturica&#x27;s central idea being a daringly blunt representation of political chicanery that fools an entire society, and of the corruption that lets one man thrive at the expense of his dearest friend&quot;. In her article &quot;Europe (Un)Divided: How Peace Was Won and the War Never Lost in Wim Wender&#x27;s &quot;Lisbon Story&quot; (1995) and Emir Kusturica&#x27;s &quot;Bila Jednom Jedna Zemlja/Underground&quot; (1995)&quot; for the &quot;Journal for Contemporary European Studies&quot;, Evelyn Preuss points out how the film critiques dominant Western ideologies by showing East and West as well as past and present in a continuity rather than divided or marked by caesuras. This critique explains the fervent political response to the film.

===Political response===
Critics saw the characters Marko and Blacky as &quot;Kusturica&#x27;s idealization of Serbs trapped into desperate acts by history and others&#x27; evil while the cowardly characters in the film were Croats and Bosnians, who chose betrayal and collaboration.&quot;

Stanko Cerović, director of the Serbo-Croatian editorial department of Radio France Internationale, strongly denounced the film in June 1995, accusing Kusturica of spreading Serbian propaganda, using historical footage in cases except &quot;the bombardment of Vukovar, or the three-year-long destruction of his native city by the Serbian army&quot;. However, in 2012 Cerović said that it was not propaganda and &quot;It&#x27;s quite possible that &quot;Underground&quot; will age well&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Kusturica was frequently attacked by French public intellectuals Bernard-Henri Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut in the French media over his life and career choices. Generally, the two viewed Kusturica as a &quot;traitor who crossed over to the enemy side thus turning his back on his city, his ethnic roots, and his nation&quot;. Finkielkraut had not seen the film, but wrote in &quot;Libération&quot; &quot;that offensive and stupid falsification of the traitor taking the palm of martyrdom had to be denounced immediately&quot;. Meanwhile, Lévy called Kusturica a &quot;fascist author&quot; while reserving his further judgment upon seeing the film. After watching &quot;Underground&quot;, Lévy called Kusturica a &quot;racist genius in the mold of Louis-Ferdinand Céline&quot;. Other intellectuals such as André Glucksmann and Peter Handke joined the debate.

During the September 2008 discussion between the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek and Bernard-Henri Lévy on the issues surrounding the historical and social significance of May 1968 in France, Žižek brought up &quot;Underground&quot; and Kusturica to Lévy by saying: &quot;&quot;Underground&quot; I think is one of the most horrible films that I&#x27;ve seen ... What kind of Yugoslav society you see in Kusturica&#x27;s &quot;Underground&quot;? A society where people all the time fornicate, drink, fight - a kind of eternal orgy.&quot; Lévy answered that he considers himself an &quot;enemy of Kusturica, the man&quot;, but that &quot;Underground&quot; is &quot;not a bad movie&quot; before going on to commend the film&#x27;s narrative structure and conclude that &quot;Kusturica is one of the cases, we have some writers like this, where the man is so, so, so more stupid than his work&quot;. Bosnian-American novelist Aleksandar Hemon criticized &quot;Underground&quot; in 2005, saying that it downplayed Serbian atrocities by &quot;presenting the Balkan war as a product of collective, innate, savage madness.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Underground&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or (Golden Palm) award at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, considered the festival&#x27;s highest honor. It was director Emir Kusturica&#x27;s second such award after &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot;. &quot;Underground&quot; was selected as the Serbian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. &quot;Underground&quot; also nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 13th Independent Spirit Awards nearly 3 years after the film won Palme d&#x27;Or, but lost to &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;.

==Libel lawsuit==
On 8 March 2001, Serbian newsmagazine &quot;Vreme&quot; published an op-ed piece by Serbian playwright Biljana Srbljanović under the headline &quot;Hvala lepo&quot; in which she refers to &quot;Underground&quot; in passing as &quot;being financed by Milošević&quot; and accuses Kusturica of being &quot;an immoral profiteer&quot;. She goes on to accuse the director of &quot;directly collaborating with the regime via his friend Milorad Vučelić&quot;. On 20 March 2001, Kusturica decided to sue Srbljanović for libel.

Before the first court date in September 2001, &quot;Vreme&quot; magazine organized a mediation attempt between the two parties, with Kusturica and Srbljanović meeting face to face in the magazine&#x27;s offices. At the meeting Kusturica expressed willingness to drop the charges if Srbljanović issued a public apology, which Srbljanović refused. The next day at the first court date Srbljanović once again rejected the offer of a public apology. The court case thus continued with Kusturica&#x27;s lawyer Branislav Tapušković presenting details of the film&#x27;s financing sources, most of which were French production companies. On 11 December 2003, the municipal court ruled in Kusturica&#x27;s favour, ordering Srbljanović to pay damages as well as to cover the court costs.

<doc id="189779" wikidata="Q3322476" url="?curid=189779" title="Thematic vowel">
<text>In Indo-European studies, a thematic vowel or theme vowel is the vowel or from ablaut placed before the ending of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word. Nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the Indo-European languages with this vowel are thematic, and those without it are athematic. Used more generally, a thematic vowel is any vowel found at the end of the stem of a word.

Outside Indo-European, the term &quot;thematic vowel&quot; is also used in the grammar of Kartvelian languages (see Georgian verb paradigm for more information on thematic vowels).

==Proto-Indo-European==
PIE verbs and nominals (nouns and adjectives) consist of three parts:
:formula_1

The thematic vowel, if present, occurs at the end of the suffix (which may include other vowels or consonants) and before the ending:
* &#x27;heat&#x27; &gt; Ancient Greek (&quot;thérmos&quot;)
* &#x27;(he) bears&#x27; &gt; Sanskrit &quot;bhárati&quot;, Gothic 

Athematic forms, by contrast, have a suffix ending in a consonant, or no suffix at all (or arguably a null suffix):
* &#x27;father&#x27; &gt; English &quot;father&quot;
* &#x27;(I) am&#x27; &gt; English &quot;am&quot;

For several reasons, athematic forms are thought to be older, and the thematic vowel was likely an innovation of late PIE: Athematic paradigms (inflection patterns) are more &quot;irregular&quot;, exhibiting ablaut and mobile accent, while the thematic paradigms can be seen as a simplification or regularisation of verbal and nominal grammar. In the Anatolian languages, which were the earliest to split from PIE, thematic verbs are rare or absent. Furthermore, during late PIE and in the older daughter languages, a number of athematic forms were replaced by thematic ones, as in prehistoric Greek *&quot;thes-&quot; &#x27;god&#x27; versus *&quot;thes-o-&quot; &gt; Classical Greek (&quot;theós&quot;).

The thematic vowel technically belongs to the suffix and not the ending, as each suffix is inherently either thematic or athematic. It is also used in some cases to derive stems from roots directly, acting as a suffix in itself (as in the second example above). However, when considering endings which are different for thematic and athematic inflections, it is generally included in the endings as well; see the section on fusion below.

===Verbs===
In verbs, the thematic vowel is word-finally or when the following ending begins with a coronal obstruent (, , or ) and otherwise. Here is the present active indicative paradigm of &#x27;carry&#x27;:

For comparison, here is an example of an athematic verb, &#x27;to draw&#x27;. The plural forms ablaut to zero-grade on the root and shift the accent to the ending:

(The first person singular ending is sometimes and sometimes , depending on tense, voice and thematicity.)

====Origin====
The PIE verb is characterized by two distinct sets of endings: one found in the thematic present and the perfect, and another found in the aorist and the athematic present. The middle endings seem like a mixture of these two. The thematic conjugation was widespread in what Donald Ringe terms &quot;Western Indo-European&quot; (Western IE), i.e. IE excluding Tocharian and especially Anatolian. The biggest problem on the origin of PIE thematic inflection is that the thematic endings have more in common with the PIE perfect (which formally, though not functionally and lexically, corresponds to the &quot;ḫi&quot;-conjugation in Hittite and other Anatolian languages), and that the actual etymological cognates reconstructed of thematic presents are few among the verbs belonging to the Anatolian &quot;ḫi&quot;-conjugation. In fact, most of the verbs belonging to the &quot;ḫi&quot;-conjugation in Anatolian actually have lexical cognates that inflect as &quot;athematic&quot; verbs in Western IE. All types of verbs belonging to the &quot;ḫi&quot;-conjugation in Hittite can be shown to have, or to originally have had the ablaut pattern with in the singular and the zero-grade in the plural, which is exactly the pattern of the Western PIE perfect.

The thematic presents in Western PIE also do not have quantitative ablaut, which indicates their relatively recent origin. This all has caused some linguists to speculate that perfect and thematic present endings go back to a single Early PIE prototype. According to Matasović, the Early PIE stative (becoming the perfect) is responsible for the original form of the thematic suffix , while the e-grade form is secondary. Verbs forming the underived thematic presents are overwhelmingly bivalent/transitive, and there are no statives in the Late PIE thematic inflection since all the original Early PIE statives either remained athematic presents, or they became Western PIE perfects. It is also probable that some Early PIE middle verbs also became thematic in the Western PIE period, since they lack middle correspondences in Anatolian.

===Nouns===
In nouns, the thematic vowel is almost always , and only becomes when there is no ending or when followed by in the neuter nominative/accusative plural. Here is an example paradigm for &#x27;bear&#x27;, a thematic animate noun, supplemented by the neuter &#x27;plough&#x27; for the nominative/accusative:

Again, athematic nouns show ablaut and accent shifts, mainly between the &quot;strong&quot; cases (nominative and vocative in all numbers, and accusative singular/dual) and the &quot;weak&quot; cases (all others). A few endings are also different from the thematic paradigm; for example, the nominative/accusative neuter has instead of . See Athematic accent/ablaut classes of PIE nouns for examples.

====Origin====
There are several theories about the rise of &quot;o&quot;-stems in PIE nominal inflection. Two are the most prominent:
* &quot;o&quot;-stems reflect an ergative system that existed in the prehistory of PIE, and
* &quot;o&quot;-stems arise from pronouns.

=====Ergative theory=====
Pedersen was the first to notice that the subject of the transitive verb looked as if it had the form of the genitive (a &quot;sigmatic&quot; case) if it were active, and as if it had the form of the instrumental case if it were inactive. Furthermore, the subject and object of intransitive verbs seemed to have the form of the absolutive (i.e. an &quot;asigmatic&quot; case). This caused an asymmetry between the valencies of transitive and intransitive verbs, summarized in the table below:
This theory was further developed by Beekes and Kortlandt, who assumed that the nominative syntax of old Indo-European languages was formed later and that the case system of the PIE language was primarily based on the ergative syntax. The same ending shared by the nominative and accusative neuter, originally designating inactive nouns, originated from the originally absolutive case, while the ergative was used with the active subject. Beekes claims the sigmatic genitive-ablative developed from the ergative. After the transformation of the ergative system into the nominative system, the form reconstructed as became the nominative, a new case of subject. Later what was to become the thematic vowel spread to other cases as well, giving rise to &quot;o&quot;-stem inflection.

Similar theories that assume the ergative past of the PIE syntax have been formulated by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov and Schmalstieg.

A related theory that also derives the thematic conjugation from an oblique case form was proposed by Ranko Matasović, who, however, identified the source form as the genitive. Matasović argued that the thematic o-stem nouns were the result of the nominalisation of adjectives, which in turn arose through the reinterpretation as nominative forms of original (attributively used) genitives of athematic (mostly deverbal) root-nouns. For example, the stem *&quot;(h)yug-o&quot; (cf. Latin &quot;&#x27;iugum&quot;) was abstracted from *&quot;(H)yug-os&quot;, which was originally a genitive of a root noun *&quot;(H)yewg-s&quot; (cf. Latin &quot;coniūx&quot;).Thus, a phrase like &quot;*ukwsōn yug-os&quot; &#x27;ox of yoking&#x27; was reinterpreted as &#x27;yoked ox&#x27;. This theory, like the previous one, would explain why there is much evidence in favour of original syncretism of the nominative and genitive singular in the o-stems.

=====Pronominal theory=====
According to Jean Haudry &quot;o&quot;-stems originated from pronouns with a determining function that were suffixed to a nominal base, playing the role of a postpositional article. There exists a number of typological parallels for such a development:
* in Balto-Slavic, where definite adjectives are formed by suffixing the PIE relative pronoun .
* modern Balkan and Scandinavian languages, which developed postpositional determination using demonstratives
* mimation and nunation in Semitic languages.

==Developments from thematic and athematic paradigms==
Thematic and athematic forms were passed on to the daughter languages of Proto-Indo-European. In the most ancient languages, such as Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, the distinction between athematic and thematic nouns and verbs is preserved. In later languages, the thematic versus athematic distinction in nouns was replaced by distinctions between various thematic (&quot;vowel&quot;) and athematic (&quot;consonant&quot;) declensions, and athematic verbs are typically regarded as irregular.

As a consequence of such language changes, the distribution of thematic and athematic words differs widely in Indo-European languages. Latin, for example, has only very few athematic verbs, while Sanskrit preserves a large number of these. Greek resembles both Sanskrit and Latin in different respects.

===Fusion===
Even in ancient languages, the thematic vowel is often indistinguishable from the case ending, because the two have fused together:

* Old Latin &quot;sax-o-is&quot; &gt; Classical Latin &quot;sax-īs&quot;, dative plural of &quot;sax-u-m&quot; (Old Latin &quot;sax-o-m&quot;) &#x27;stone&#x27;
* Homeric (&quot;the-ā́-ōn&quot;) &gt; Attic (&quot;the-ôn&quot;), genitive plural of (&quot;the-ā́&quot;) &#x27;goddess&#x27;

In Latin, athematic verbs were lost, except for a few, which were considered irregular or adopted into one of the four thematic conjugations:

* &quot;s-um, es, es-t, s-umus, es-tis, s-unt&quot; (irregular) &#x27;be&#x27;
* (&quot;ferō&quot;,) &quot;fer-s, fer-t&quot;, (ferimus,) &quot;fer-tis, fer-unt&quot; (irregular) &#x27;carry&#x27;
* (&quot;dō&quot;,) &quot;dā-s, da-t, da-mus, da-tis, da-nt&quot; (first conjugation) &#x27;give&#x27;

====Thematic &quot;a&quot;====
Although the &quot;a&quot; of the Greek and Latin first declension was not originally a thematic vowel, it is considered one in Greek and Latin grammar. In both languages, first-declension nouns take some endings belonging to the thematic second declension. An a-stem noun was originally a collective noun suffixed with , the ending of the neuter plural.

* (no case ending) &gt; Proto-Italic *&quot;farβā&quot; &gt; Latin &quot;barba&quot; &#x27;beard&#x27;

====Athematic vowels====
Sometimes vowels near the end of a noun or verb, where one would expect a thematic vowel, are not actually thematic vowels. Either these vowels are placed after an &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, or they are on their own.

In both Latin and Greek, there are athematic nouns whose stems end in &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (with the allophones &quot;y&quot; or &quot;w&quot; before vowels). These include Latin &quot;nāvis&quot; &#x27;ship&#x27; and Greek &quot;thesis&quot; &#x27;placement&#x27;; Latin &quot;senātus&quot; &#x27;council of elders&#x27; or &#x27;senate&#x27; and Greek &quot;basileus&quot; &#x27;king&#x27;. Because these vowels are not &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, they are not thematic, and the nouns take the same endings as consonant-stem nouns.

* Latin &quot;nāvi-s&quot;, &quot;senātu-s&quot; · &quot;rēg-s&quot; &#x27;king&#x27;
* Greek &quot;thesi-s&quot;, &quot;basileu-s&quot; · &quot;Arab-s&quot; (&quot;Araps&quot;) &#x27;Arab&#x27;

In Latin, there are four conjugations depending on the vowel before the endings (which include the thematic vowel): a, e, none, i. Although all the verbs belonging to these conjugations are thematic, these four vowels are not the thematic vowel of the different declensions: the thematic vowel is an &quot;e/o&quot; that has either fused with the endings and conjugation vowel or changed to &quot;i/u&quot;.

In Greek, some of the Latin conjugations are represented by contracted verbs instead, in which the stem vowel contracts with the ending (which includes the thematic vowel). This results in different vowels in the ending from the non-contracted verbs.

* &quot;tīmaeis&quot; &gt; &quot;tīmāis&quot; &#x27;you honor&#x27;

==Individual languages==

===Latin===
In Latin, nouns of the first, second, fourth, and fifth declensions are considered thematic; the first declension has the theme vowel &quot;a&quot;, the second &quot;o&quot;, the fourth &quot;u&quot;, and the fifth &quot;e&quot;. Stems with &quot;i&quot; are treated together with athematic stems in the third declension, as they came to closely resemble one another. Latin verbs are subject to a similar classification: the first conjugation contains vowel stems with &quot;a&quot;, the second with &quot;e&quot;, and the fourth with &quot;i&quot;. There are no Latin verbs with &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, and very few are athematic, but they are considered irregular verbs.

For example, consider the noun endings of the Latin &quot;first declension&quot; singular of the word &quot;rosa&quot; &#x27;rose&#x27;:

The vowel &quot;a&quot; is prominent in these case endings, so nouns like &quot;rosa&quot; came to be known as &quot;a-stem&quot; nouns, with &quot;a&quot; being the &quot;theme vowel,&quot; and such a word was later analysed as having a stem containing a root plus a suffix. In fact, philologists now believe that the suffix in PIE was , with a laryngeal that usually became &quot;a&quot; in the daughter languages.

===Sanskrit===
Sanskrit grammar ordains a &quot;vikaraṇapratyaya&quot; (modificatory affix) between a verbal root and the tense-ending. Thematic verbal roots are those with an &quot;-a&quot; in the vikaraṇapratyaya, to wit, roots belonging to the 1st, 4th, 6th and 10th conjugation classes.

Among nominals, those with the &quot;prātipadika&quot; (stem) ending in &quot;-a&quot; would the thematic nominals by this definition.

===Ancient Greek===

====Verbs====
The distinction between thematic and athematic stems is especially apparent in the Greek verb; they fall into two classes that are marked by quite different personal endings. Thematic verbs are also called -ω (-&quot;ō&quot;) verbs in Greek; athematic verbs are -μι (-&quot;mi&quot;) verbs, after the first person singular present tense ending that each of them uses. The entire conjugation seems to differ quite markedly between the two sets of verbs, but the differences are really the result of the thematic vowel reacting (fusing) with the verb endings, apart from the first person singular which already had different endings for thematic and athematic verbs in PIE. In classical Greek, the present tense active endings for athematic verbs are:

:-μι, -ς, σι, -μεν, -τε, -ασι(ν)
:(&quot;-mi, -s, -si, -men, -te, -asi(n)&quot;)

while the thematic verbs took the endings:

:-ω, -εις, -ει, -ομεν, -ετε, -ουσι(ν)
:(&quot;-ō, -eis, -ei, -omen, -ete, -ousi(n)&quot;)

In Greek, athematic verbs, except for those that end in -νῡμι -&quot;nūmi&quot;, are a closed class of inherited forms from PIE.

====Nouns====
Greek preserves thematic nouns in the first (or alpha) declension and second (or omicron) declension, and athematic nouns in the third declension.

Declension of the athematic noun (&quot;poús&quot;) &#x27;foot&#x27;:
Declension of the thematic noun (&quot;ánthropos&quot;) &#x27;human&#x27;:
===Other languages===
Most other Indo-European languages have similar distinctions, or had them in their past. Marked contrasts between thematic and athematic verbs appear in Lithuanian, and Old Church Slavonic. In the Germanic and Insular Celtic languages, the theme vowels are often hard to perceive because of the loss of final vowels. However, their presence is still felt, in a manner that defines different ways of declining nouns or conjugating verbs, so philologists still occasionally speak of vowel stems and consonant stems in these languages as well.

While Old English still contrasted &quot;vowel stems&quot; (thematic) and &quot;consonant stems&quot; (athematic), this distinction is no longer a meaningful one in Modern English, as in other languages whose morphology has been drastically simplified by analogy.

==Etymology==
In the term &quot;thematic vowel&quot;, &quot;theme&quot; refers to the stem of a word. For example, in the Ancient Greek verb (&quot;témnō&quot;) &#x27;cut&#x27;, &quot;tem-&quot; is the root, and &quot;temn-&quot; is the stem or theme for the present tense. Hence, &quot;thematic vowel&quot; loosely means &quot;stem vowel&quot;.

<text>The Columbus Clippers are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League (IL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians. They are located in Columbus, Ohio, and are named for speedy merchant sailing vessels known as clippers. The team has played their home games at Huntington Park since 2009. They previously played at Cooper Stadium from 1977 to 2008.

The Clippers were established in 1977 as members of the Triple-A International League. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Clippers were shifted to the Triple-A East, but this was renamed the IL in 2022. They won seven IL championships during a 28-year affiliation with the New York Yankees (1979–2006). Columbus has won four more IL titles and two Triple-A championships since affiliating with Cleveland in 2009.

==History==
===Before the Clippers===
Professional baseball was first played in Columbus, Ohio, in 1877 by the Columbus Buckeyes of the International Association. It has been represented at the highest levels of Minor League Baseball nearly continuously since 1902, at first in the American Association by the Columbus Senators (1902–1930) and Columbus Red Birds (1931–1954) and then in the International League (IL) by the Columbus Jets (1955–1970). In 1971, the Jets moved to Charleston, West Virginia, as the Charleston Charlies, touching off a six-year drought of minor-league baseball in Columbus. 

===International League===
====Pittsburgh Pirates (1977–1978)====

The Columbus Clippers began play in 1977 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the International League. They played their home games at Franklin County Stadium, which opened in 1932 as Red Bird Stadium and was renamed Cooper Stadium in 1985. The Clippers were named for speedy merchant sailing vessels known as clippers. Consecutive seventh-place finishes in their first two seasons kept the team out of the playoffs. Off the field, the franchise was recognized with the 1977 Larry MacPhail Award for outstanding minor league promotions.

====New York Yankees (1979–2006)====

Columbus changed its affiliation to the New York Yankees in 1979 in what would become a 28-year relationship and the most successful period in Clippers history. From 1979 to 1982, the Clippers finished atop the league standings and won three consecutive Governors&#x27; Cups, the International League championship. The 1979 team, managed by Gene Michael, won the league title by defeating the Syracuse Chiefs in the finals. Outfielder Bobby Brown was selected as the 1979 IL Most Valuable Player (MVP) and Rick Anderson as the Most Valuable Pitcher. Additionally, the franchise won its second Larry MacPhail Award. Joe Altobelli&#x27;s 1980 Clippers won the next Governors&#x27; Cup over the Toledo Mud Hens. First baseman Marshall Brant won the league MVP Award, Bob Kammeyer won the top pitcher award, and Altobelli was chosen as the Manager of the Year. In 1981, Frank Verdi led Columbus to its third title over the Richmond Braves in a championship series that was shortened due to inclement weather.

Columbus qualified for the playoffs in each of the next three seasons but was eliminated in the semifinals each time. Several Clippers were recognized with league awards during this period. Third baseman Tucker Ashford won the 1982 IL MVP Award. In 1984, catcher Scott Bradley was the MVP and Rookie of the Year, and the Clippers won a third Larry MacPhail Award. Outfielder Dan Pasqua was a dual MVP and Rookie of the Year in 1985. The 1985 club reached the finals, but they lost the Governors&#x27; Cup to the Tidewater Tides. Though missing the postseason in 1986, first baseman Orestes Destrade won the Rookie of the Year Award. The 1987 Clippers, managed by Bucky Dent, swept the Rochester Red Wings in the semifinals and Tidewater in the finals to win their fourth IL championship. Brad Arnsberg won the 1987 Most Valuable Pitcher Award. Columbus next returned to the playoffs in 1990 via a Western Division title, but they lost the single round of playoffs and the championship to Rochester. Outfielder Hensley Meulens was the MVP of the 1990 season, and Dave Eiland was the top pitcher.

Manager Rick Down led the Clippers to back-to-back Governors&#x27; Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The 1991 team defeated the Pawtucket Red Sox in the finals. They then advanced to the Triple-A Classic, a postseason championship series against the Denver Zephyrs, champions of the American Association, where they were defeated, 4–1. The 1992 squad won their championship over the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. First baseman J. T. Snow was selected as the MVP and Rookie of the Year, while Sam Militello was chosen as the Most Valuable Pitcher. In a 2001 ranking by baseball historians, the 1992 Clippers were recognized as the seventy-second greatest minor league team of all time.

The franchise was awarded the 1995 John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, recognizing them as the &quot;complete baseball franchise—based on franchise stability, contributions to league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion of the baseball industry.&quot; Columbus won its final IL championship as a Yankees affiliate in 1996 under Stump Merrill after winning the Western Division title, sweeping the Norfolk Tides in the semifinals, and sweeping Rochester in the championship round. They reached the finals in 1997 but lost in the final round to Rochester and were eliminated in the semifinals in 1999 and 2004. A pair of Clippers won awards in 1999: Ed Yarnall as the Most Valuable Pitcher and first baseman Kurt Bierek as Rookie of the Year. In 2003, first baseman Fernando Seguignol was selected as the league MVP.

====Washington Nationals (2007–2008)====

The Clippers became the Triple-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals in 2007. The partnership lasted two seasons, with Columbus finishing with losing records each season and failing to qualify for the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs. On September 1, 2008, the Clippers played their final game at Cooper Stadium before moving into a new facility the following season. Over 16,000 people attended the game, a 3–0 loss to Toledo.

====Cleveland Indians / Guardians (2009–present)====

In 2009, Columbus began their affiliation with the Cleveland Indians. The Clippers also began playing at Huntington Park, a $56-million dollar, 10,000-seat stadium located at the corner of Neil Ave. and Nationwide Blvd. in the Columbus&#x27;s Arena District. The inaugural home opener was played on April 18, 2009, when 11,950 people in attendance saw the Clippers lose to Toledo, 3–1.

Managed by Mike Sarbaugh, Columbus won consecutive IL championships in 2010 and 2011. After clinching a 2010 wild card berth, they defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in the semifinals then won the Governors&#x27; Cup against the Durham Bulls. The league title sent them to the Triple-A National Championship Game, a single game against the Tacoma Rainiers, champions of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which was won by Columbus, 12–6. As the 2011 Western Division winners, Columbus advanced to the finals with a win over Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and won the Governors&#x27; Cup over Durham. In the Triple-A National Championship Game, they defeated the PCL&#x27;s Omaha Storm Chasers, 8–3. Sarbaugh was recognized as the 2011 IL Manager of the Year.

The 2014 Clippers won the Western Division title but were ousted from the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs by Durham in the semifinals. In 2015, Columbus was declared co-champion of the Western Division after finishing the season tied for first place with the Indianapolis Indians. They were seeded as the division champion for the playoffs by tie-breaking procedures. Defeating Norfolk in the semifinals, the Clippers met the Indians in the Governors&#x27; Cup finals and won the IL championship under manager Chris Tremie. They then lost the Triple-A Championship to the PCL&#x27;s Fresno Grizzlies, 7–0. Columbus returned to the postseason in 2016 via a Western Division title, but they fell to the Gwinnett Braves in the semifinals. Outfielder Yandy Díaz was the 2016 IL Rookie of the Year. In 2019, under manager Tony Mansolino, the team captured its last International League championship. With another Western Division title and a semifinal win over the Gwinnett Stripers, they won the Governors&#x27; Cup against Durham. At the Triple-A National Championship Game they lost to the Sacramento River Cats, 4–0. The start of the 2020 season was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled altogether.

Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. The Clippers were organized into the Triple-A East and maintained their affiliation with the Cleveland Indians. Columbus ended the season in fifth place in the Midwestern Division with a 56–62 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Columbus finished the tournament tied for 23rd place with a 3–6 record.

In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, after Major League Baseball acquired the rights to the name. The Clippers won the second-half of the 2024 season, giving them a playoff berth, but they lost the IL championship to the Omaha Storm Chasers, 2–1, in a best-of-three series. Their full season record was 80–68. Outfielder Johnathan Rodríguez won the IL MVP Award.

The franchise has been awarded these honors by Minor League Baseball.

Eighteen players, two managers, and two executives have won league awards in recognition for their performance with Columbus.

==Radio and television==

All Clippers home and road games are broadcast on WMNI AM 920. Live audio broadcasts are also available online through the station&#x27;s website as well as on the team&#x27;s website and the MiLB First Pitch app. Games can be viewed through the MiLB.TV subscription feature of the official website of Minor League Baseball.

As of 2021, Ryan Mitchell and Scott Leo serve as play-by-play announcers. Several former Clippers broadcasters have gone to work in Major League Baseball, including: John Gordon (1977–1981), Rick Rizzs (1981–1982), Pat Hughes (1982), Terry Smith (1983–2001), and Tom Hamilton (1987–1989).

<text>WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) is the first web browser and web page editor. It was discontinued in 1994. It was the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.

The source code was released into the public domain on 30 April 1993. Some of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer&#x27;s status as a historical artifact. To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world, a project began in 2013 at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the Web.

==History==
Tim Berners-Lee wrote what would become known as WorldWideWeb on a NeXT Computer during the second half of 1990, while working for CERN, a European nuclear research agency. The first edition was completed &quot;some time before&quot; 25 December 1990, according to Berners-Lee, after two months of development. The browser was announced on the newsgroups and became available to the general public in August 1991. By this time, several others, including Bernd Pollermann, Robert Cailliau, Jean-François Groff, and visiting undergraduate student Nicola Pellow – who later wrote the Line Mode Browser – were involved in the project.

Berners-Lee considered different names for his new application, including &quot;The Mine of Information&quot; and &quot;The Information Mesh,&quot; before publicly launching the &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot; browser in 1991&quot;.&quot; When a new version was released in 1994, it was renamed &quot;Nexus Browser&quot;, in order to differentiate between the software (&quot;WorldWideWeb&quot;) and the World Wide Web.

The team created so called &quot;passive browsers&quot; which do not have the ability to edit because it was hard to port this feature from the NeXT system to other operating systems. Porting to the X Window System was not possible as nobody on the team had experience with the X Window System.

Berners-Lee and Groff later adapted many of WorldWideWeb&#x27;s components into a C programming language version, creating the libwww API.

A number of early browsers appeared, notably ViolaWWW. They were all eclipsed by Mosaic in terms of popularity, which by 1993 had replaced the WorldWideWeb program. Those involved in its creation had moved on to other tasks, such as defining standards and guidelines for the further development of the World Wide Web (e.g. HTML, and various communication protocols).

On 30 April 1993, the CERN directorate released the source code of WorldWideWeb into the public domain. Several versions of the software are still available on the web in various states. Berners-Lee initially considered releasing it under the GNU General Public License, but after hearing rumors that companies might balk at the concept if any licensing issues were involved, he eventually opted to release it into the public domain. In 2021, Sotheby&#x27;s held an auction for an NFT of the WorldWideWeb source code.

==Features==
Since WorldWideWeb was developed on and for the NeXTSTEP platform, the program uses many of NeXTSTEP&#x27;s components – WorldWideWeb&#x27;s layout engine was built around NeXTSTEP&#x27;s Text class.

WorldWideWeb is capable of displaying basic style sheets, downloading and opening any file type with a MIME type that is also supported by the NeXT system (PostScript, movies, and sounds), browsing newsgroups, and spellchecking. In earlier versions, images are displayed in separate windows, until NeXTSTEP&#x27;s Text class gained support for Image objects. WorldWideWeb is able to use different protocols: FTP, HTTP, NNTP, and local files. Later versions are able to display inline images.

The browser is also a WYSIWYG editor. It allows the simultaneous editing and linking of many pages in different windows. The functions &quot;Mark Selection&quot;, which creates an anchor, and &quot;Link to Marked&quot;, which makes the selected text an anchor linking to the last marked anchor, allow the creation of links. Editing pages remotely is not possible, as the HTTP PUT method had not yet been implemented during the period of the application&#x27;s active development. Files can be edited in a local file system which is in turn served onto the Web by an HTTP server.

WorldWideWeb&#x27;s navigation panel contains Next and Previous buttons that automatically navigate to the next or previous link on the last page visited, similar to Opera&#x27;s Rewind and Fast Forward buttons, or HyperCard; i.e., if one navigated to a page from a table of links, the Previous button would cause the browser to load the previous page linked in the table. This is useful for web pages which contain lists of links. Many still do, but the user interface link-chaining was not adopted by other contemporary browser writers, and it only gained popularity later. An equivalent functionality is nowadays provided by connecting web pages with explicit navigation buttons repeated on each webpage among those links, or with typed links in the headers of the page. This places more of a burden on web site designers and developers, but allows them to control the presentation of the navigation links.

WorldWideWeb does not have bookmarks as they exist in later browsers, but a similar feature was provided: to save a link for later use, users could link to it from their own home page (start page). Users could create multiple home pages, similar to folders in modern web browsers&#x27; bookmarks.

<text>Carl Auer von Welsbach (1 September 1858 – 4 August 1929), who received the Austrian noble title of Freiherr Auer von Welsbach in 1901, was an Austrian scientist and inventor, who separated didymium into the elements neodymium and praseodymium in 1885. He was also one of three scientists to independently discover the element lutetium (which he named &quot;cassiopeium&quot;), separating it from ytterbium in 1907, setting off the longest priority dispute in the history of chemistry.

He had a talent not only for making scientific advances, but also for turning them into commercially successful products. His work on rare-earth elements led to the development of the ferrocerium &quot;flints&quot; used in modern lighters, the gas mantle that brought light to the streets of Europe in the late 19th century, and the metal-filament light bulb. He took the phrase &quot;plus lucis&quot;, meaning &quot;more light&quot;, as his motto.

== Early life ==
Carl Auer was born in Vienna on 1 September 1858 to Alois Auer and his wife, Therese Neuditschka. He was the youngest of four children, his elder siblings being Leopoldine, Alois and Amalie. His father, ennobled in 1860 (as Alois Ritter Auer von Welsbach), was director of the Imperial printing office (&quot;K.-k. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei&quot;) in the days of the Austrian Empire.

Carl went to high schools in Mariahilf and Josefstadt. He attended the Realschule Josefstadt from 1873 to 1877, matriculating on July 16, 1877.

Next, he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army for one year of voluntary military service. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He joined on October 1, 1877, and received his patent as a lieutenant on December 15, 1878.

In 1878, Auer entered the University of Vienna, studying mathematics, general chemistry, engineering physics, and thermodynamics. He then moved to the University of Heidelberg in 1880, where he continued his studies in spectroscopy under the direction of Robert Bunsen, (inventor of the Bunsen burner). In 1882, he received his Ph.D. degree and returned to Vienna to work as an unpaid assistant in Professor Adolf Lieben&#x27;s laboratory, working with chemical separation methods for investigations on rare-earth elements.

== Rare earths ==
=== Neodymium and praseodymium===

In 1885, Auer von Welsbach used a method of fractional crystallization that he had developed himself to separate the alloy didymium into its two parts, for the first time. It had previously been believed to be an element. After 167 crystallizations, Auer von Welsbach differentiated it into two colored salts: he named the green colored salt &quot;praseodymium&quot; and the pink one &quot;neodidymium&quot;. 
He announced his achievement to the Vienna Academy of Sciences on 18 June 1885. His achievement was approved by Bunsen, but met with considerable skepticism from others.

The name &quot;neodidymium&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;neos&quot; (νέος), new, and &quot;didymos&quot; (διδύμος), twin. The name praseodymium comes from the Greek prasinos (πράσινος), meaning &quot;green&quot;. In naming both elements, and not leaving the original name didymium to the more-abundant component, Auer von Welsbach diverged from established practice, which was to give a new name only to the less-abundant component. Nonetheless, his name for the major fraction, neodidymium, after some modification, became the name of the element neodymium. Praseodymium was also accepted as the name of the minor fraction.

=== Lutetium and ytterbium===

The rare earth element lutetium was independently discovered by three scientists at around the same time in 1907: French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian Auer von Welsbach, and American Charles James. 
All three were successful in separating the substance then known as ytterbium into two new fractions. To name the newly discovered fraction,
Urbain suggested the name &quot;lutecium&quot;, for the Roman city of Lutetia that preceded Paris. Auer von Welsbach suggested the name &quot;cassiopeium&quot;. James&#x27; work was not yet published when the other&#x27;s work appeared, and he did not involve himself in subsequent disputes. Lutetium, a slight modification of Urbain&#x27;s name, was eventually accepted after a long battle between Urbain and Welsbach.

==Lighting innovations==
=== Gas mantle ===
On 23 September 1885, Auer von Welsbach received a patent on his development of the gas mantle, which he called &quot;Auerlicht&quot;, using a chemical mixture of 60% magnesium oxide, 20% lanthanum oxide and 20% yttrium oxide, which he called &quot;Actinophor&quot;. To produce a mantle, guncotton is impregnated with a mixture of Actinophor and then heated, the cotton eventually burns away, leaving a solid (albeit fragile) ash, which glows brightly when heated. These original mantles gave off a green-tinted light and were not very successful, and his first company formed to sell them failed in 1889.

In 1890 he introduced a new form of the mantle based on a mixture of 99% thorium dioxide and 1% cerium(IV) oxide, which he developed in collaboration with his colleague Ludwig Haitinger. These proved both more robust and having a much &quot;whiter&quot; light. Another company founded to produce the newer design was formed in 1891, working with fellow student from the university Ignaz Kreidl, and the device quickly spread throughout Europe.
In the United States this technique was adopted by The Coleman Company and became their logo for the company. In the 1980s it was reported that Thorium&#x27;s radio-daughters (Decay products)
could be volatilized and released into the air upon incandescence of the mantle. 
A lawsuit (&quot;Wagner v. Coleman&quot;) was brought against Coleman. The company changed its formulation to use non-radioactive materials, which apparently cost less and last longer.

=== Metal-filament light bulb===
Auer von Welsbach then started work on development of metal-filament mantles, first with platinum wiring, and then osmium. Osmium is very difficult to work with, but he developed a new method, which mixed osmium oxide powder with rubber or sugar into a paste, which is then squeezed through a nozzle and fired. The paste burns away, leaving a fine wire of osmium.

Although originally intended to be a new mantle, it was during this period that electricity was being introduced into the market, and he started experimenting with ways to use the filaments as a replacement for the electric arc light. He worked on this until finally developing a workable technique in 1898 and started a new factory to produce his &quot;Auer-Oslight&quot;, which he introduced commercially in 1902. The metal-filament light bulb was a huge improvement on the existing carbon-filament designs, lasting much longer, using about half the electricity for the same amount of light, and being much more robust.

=== Lighting flint ===

In 1903 Auer von Welsbach won another patent for a fire striker (&quot;flint&quot;) composition named ferrocerium. It takes its name from its two primary components: iron (from ), and the rare-earth element cerium. It is also known in Europe as &quot;Auermetall&quot; after its inventor. Three different Auermetalls were developed: the first was iron and cerium, the second also included lanthanum to produce brighter sparks, and the third added other heavy metals. In Auer von Welsbach&#x27;s first alloy, 30% iron (ferrum) was added to purified cerium, hence the name &quot;ferro-cerium&quot;.
Welsbach&#x27;s flints consisted of pyrophoric alloys, 70% cerium and 30% iron, which when scratched or struck would give off sparks. This system remains in wide use in cigarette lighters today. In 1907 he formed Treibacher Chemische Werke GesmbH to build and market the devices.

==Radium research==
For the rest of his life Auer von Welsbach turned again to &quot;pure&quot; chemistry. He worked largely on his estate at Welsbach Castle (Schloß Welsbach) near Treibach near Althofen. In addition to his work on elements and minerals, he made advances in the development of photographic techniques. He was also a devoted gardener, carefully supporting rare and difficult-to-grow plants in his garden, and breeding new varieties of roses and apple trees.

He published a number of papers on chemical separation and spectroscopy, working on radioactive elements as early as 1904. In 1910, one of his companies helped to establish Vienna as a center of radiation research by producing the first major quantity of radium chloride (3-4 grams) in Europe.

In 1910, Auer von Welsbach reported a &quot;mysterious observation&quot;, the induction of radioactivity in an inactive substance when exposed to a radioactive substance. Based on his report, it is possible that he may have been the first to observe neutron activation.

Between 1907 and 1918, Auer von Welsbach focused on isolating preparations of actinium and thorium as by-products of radium extraction.
He kept up an active correspondence with physicist Stefan Meyer, managing director of the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna, to discuss the extraction of actinium. Meyer and his staff do not appear to have had the chemical knowledge to understand Auer von Welsbach&#x27;s methods, and Auer von Welsbach resigned around 1917.

During World War I, he had difficulty finding staff to carry out research. After the war, he was active in supporting the work of the institute, and other scientists.
He presented a major paper on his spectroscopic work and the separation of radioactive elements in 1922.
The following photographs show scientific equipment from Auer von Welsbach&#x27;s laboratory, from &quot;Spektroskopische Methoden der analytischen Chemie&quot; (1922).
== Commemoration ==
In 2008 (150 years after his birth), Auer von Welsbach was selected as a main motif for a high-value collectors&#x27; coin: the Austrian €25 Fascination Light. The reverse has a partial portrait of Auer on the left-hand side. The sun shines in the middle of the green niobium pill, while several methods of illumination from the gas light from incandescent light bulbs and neon lamps to modern light-emitting diodes spread out around the silver ring.

He was also depicted on postage stamps of 1936, 1954 and 2012.

<text>USS &quot;Florida&quot; (BB-30) was the lead ship of the of dreadnought battleships of the United States Navy. She had one sister ship, . &quot;Florida&quot; was laid down at the New York Navy Yard in March 1909, launched in May 1910, and commissioned into the US Navy in September 1911. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and was very similar in design to the preceding s.

&quot;Florida&quot; was one of the first ships to arrive during the United States occupation of Veracruz in early 1914, and part of her crew joined the landing party that occupied the city. She was assigned to United States Battleship Division 9 after the American entrance into World War I in April 1917; the division was sent to Europe to reinforce the British Grand Fleet. During the war, &quot;Florida&quot; and the rest of her unit, reassigned as the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, conducted patrols in the North Sea and escorted convoys to Norway. She saw no action against the German High Seas Fleet, however.

&quot;Florida&quot; returned to normal peacetime duties in 1919. She was heavily modernized in 1924–1926, including a complete overhaul of her propulsion system. She remained in service until 1930, when the London Naval Treaty was signed. Under the terms of the treaty, &quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Utah&quot; were removed from active service. Therefore, &quot;Florida&quot; was decommissioned in 1931 and scrapped the next year in Philadelphia.

==Design==
&quot;Florida&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines rated at and twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She had a crew of 1,001 officers and men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten /45 caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin Mark 8 gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other three turrets were placed aft of the superstructure. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /51 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. As was standard for capital ships of the period, she carried a pair of torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Florida&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the armored deck was thick. The gun turrets had thick faces and the conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

&quot;Florida&quot; was laid down at the New York Navy Yard on 9 March 1909. She was launched on 12 May 1910, and commissioned into the US Navy on 15 September 1911. She spent the next several months on training cruises in the Caribbean and off Maine, after which she moved to Hampton Roads to join the Atlantic Fleet. She arrived on 29 March 1912, and was made the flagship of the 1st Battleship Division (BatDiv). For the next two years, she participated in the normal routine of peacetime exercises with her division and squadron and with the entire Atlantic Fleet. She also conducted extensive gunnery training and took midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on midshipman training cruises.

In early 1914 during the Mexican Revolution, the United States intervened in the fighting and occupied Veracruz. &quot;Florida&quot; and her sister were the first capital ships to arrive in Veracruz, on 16 February. These two ships and landed a total contingent of over a thousand marines and bluejackets to begin the occupation of the city on 21 April. Over the next three days, the marines battled Mexican defenders in the city and suffered ninety-four casualties (19 dead), while killing hundreds of Mexicans in return. Twenty-five men from &quot;Florida&quot;″s crew received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle. In July, &quot;Florida&quot; departed Mexican waters to return to normal fleet operations, and in October, she was reassigned to the 2nd Battleship Division.

===World War I===
On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany over its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. &quot;Florida&quot; participated in wartime readiness exercises in 1917, before steaming across the Atlantic with Battleship Division 9. The division, which consisted of &quot;Florida&quot;, , , and , left the United States on 25 November. The division was sent to European waters to reinforce the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea. After arriving in Scapa Flow, Battleship Division 9 became the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.
Starting in late 1917, the Germans had begun to use surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia; this forced the British to send squadrons from the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. On 6 February 1918, the 6th Battle Squadron and eight British destroyers escorted a convoy of merchant ships to Norway. While on the operation, &quot;Florida&quot;″s lookouts reported spotting a U-boat, though the commander of &quot;Wyoming&quot; later argued that this and others issued by the rest of the squadron were false reports. The squadron was back in Scapa Flow on 10 February; &quot;Delaware&quot; escorted two more such convoys in March and April. During the March convoy, &quot;Florida&quot;, &quot;Wyoming&quot;, , and four destroyers became separated from the convoy in heavy fog, and only relocated it the following morning when the fog had lifted. The squadron returned to Scapa Flow on 13 March.

On 22–24 April, the German High Seas Fleet sortied to intercept one of the convoys in the hope of cutting off and destroying the escorting battleship squadron. &quot;Florida&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow on 24 April in an attempt to intercept the Germans, but the High Seas Fleet had already broken off the operation and was on its way back to port. On 30 June, the 6th Squadron was cruising in the North Sea in support of a mine-laying operation; while on patrol, &quot;Florida&quot; and several other ships fired on what they incorrectly believed to be U-boat wakes. By early November, the Spanish Flu pandemic had spread to the Grand Fleet; &quot;Florida&quot; was the only ship of the American contingent not to be quarantined for the virus. On 20 November, &quot;Florida&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet rendezvoused with the High Seas Fleet, which was then interned in Scapa Flow, following the Armistice with Germany that ended the war. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Florida&quot; was replaced with the newly commissioned .

&quot;Florida&quot; then joined the passenger ship on 12 December, which was carrying President Woodrow Wilson on his way to France to participate in the peace negotiations. The ships arrived in Brest, France on 13 December, after which &quot;Florida&quot; returned to the United States. She was present during the Victory Naval Review in the North River in New York City at the end of December.

===Inter-War Period===
&quot;Florida&quot; returned to normal peacetime duties in January 1919, when she arrived in Norfolk on the 4th. She steamed to the Azores to take weather observations for Navy seaplanes that were to make the first aerial crossing the Atlantic. In August 1920, &quot;Florida&quot; was present during the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims&#x27; landing at Provincetown, Massachusetts. In December 1920, she made a good-will cruise to South America with US Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby aboard and over the next three years conducted amphibious operation training with the Marine Corps in the Caribbean. &quot;Florida&quot; also participated in the normal routine of exercises and midshipman cruises. During this period, she was made the flagship of the Commander, Control Force, US Fleet.

In early 1924, &quot;Florida&quot; took part in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where she and her sister &quot;Utah&quot; acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, &quot;Florida&quot; was taken out of service for a modernization at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one stack. The rear lattice mast was replaced with a pole mast, which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.

&quot;Florida&quot; remained in service for a few years in her modernized form, and participated in joint Army-Navy coast defense exercises in June 1928. Under the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, however, which reduced the battle fleets of the signatory countries, she was to be disposed of. She was decommissioned accordingly on 16 February 1931 at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, struck from the naval register on 6 April, and was broken up in Philadelphia later that year. Demolition work was completed by 30 September 1932. The one-ton ship&#x27;s bell was saved and transported to the University of Florida in Gainesville, where it was first installed in a clock atop a classroom building. The clock was removed in the early 1950s and the bell was put in storage. In 1960, it was installed atop the stands in the north end zone at Florida Field, where it was traditionally rung by either cheerleaders or fans at the conclusion of a victory by the Florida Gator football team. As the stadium underwent successive expansions and renovations, the bell was moved to a location under the north end zone concourse and then was removed from the stadium in 1992. It has been restored and is now housed in the lobby of the Museum of Florida History.

<doc id="189821" wikidata="Q2050944" url="?curid=189821" title="Papal coronation">
<text>A papal coronation is the formal ceremony of the placing of the papal tiara on a newly elected pope. The first recorded papal coronation was of Pope Nicholas I in 858. The most recent was the 1963 coronation of Paul VI, who soon afterwards abandoned the practice of wearing the tiara. To date, none of his successors have used the tiara, and their papal inauguration celebrations have included no coronation ceremony, although any future pope may elect to restore the use of the tiara at any point during his pontificate.

The papal inauguration celebration, with or without a coronation, has only symbolic significance, as a pope assumes office immediately on giving his consent to a valid election.

In Spanish, the term (English: &quot;Pontifical Coronation&quot;) is sometimes used for the canonical coronation of religious images through a formal, expressed Pontifical decree by a reigning pope.

==Ritual==

When a conclave elects a new pope, he assumes all of the rights and authority of the papacy immediately upon his acceptance of election; however, popes traditionally numbered their regnal years from the date of their coronation. If a newly elected pope is not a bishop, he is consecrated at once. In accordance with tradition, the right of consecration belongs to the dean of the College of Cardinals, in his absence to the subdean, and in the absence of both of these to the senior cardinal bishop. If the new pope is already a bishop, as is normally the case, his election is announced immediately to the people gathered in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square and he gives them his blessing.

The episcopal enthronement of the pope takes place in his cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. This ceremony was once combined with the coronation. During the Avignon papacy, the pope, being in France, could not be enthroned in his cathedral in Rome. The coronations continued, while enthronements had to await a return to Rome. When Gregory XI did return to Rome, the Lateran Palace was badly in need of repair, so the popes made the Vatican their residence and transferred coronations to Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The Lateran Basilica remains the cathedral of Rome, and the enthronement occurs there. During the &quot;prisoner in the Vatican&quot; period, the enthronement did not take place.

===Coronation Mass===
The coronation took place on the first Sunday or Holy Day following the election. It began with a solemn Papal Mass. During the chanting of Terce, he sat on a throne and all of the cardinals made what was called their &quot;first obeisance&quot; to him, approaching one by one and kissing his hand. Then the archbishops and bishops approached and kissed his feet.

Following this, at least from the beginning of the 16th century, the newly elected pope was carried in state through St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; under a white canopy, with the papal flabella (ceremonial fans) to either side. Instead of the papal tiara, he wore a jewelled mitre (the episcopal &quot;mitra pretiosa&quot;). Three times, the procession was stopped, and a bundle of flax lashed to a gilded staff was burnt before the newly elected pontiff, while a master of ceremonies said: &quot;Pater Sancte, sic transit gloria mundi&quot; (Holy Father, thus passes the glory of the world) as a symbolic reminder to set aside materialism and vanity. Once at the high altar, he would begin to celebrate Solemn High Mass with full papal ceremonial.

After the &quot;Confiteor&quot;, the pope was seated on the sedia gestatoria, which was resting on the ground, and the three senior cardinal bishops approached him wearing mitres. Each in turn placed his hands above him and said the prayer, &quot;Super electum Pontificem&quot; (over the elected pope). First the Cardinal Bishop of Albano said:God, who are present without distinction whenever the devout mind invokes you, be present, we ask you, we and this your servant, __, who to the summit of the apostolic community has been chosen as the judge of your people, infuse with the highest blessings that he experience your gift who has reached this point.

Then the Cardinal Bishop of Porto said:We supplicate you, Almighty God, effect your customary devotion and pour out on this your servant, __, the grace of the Holy Spirit that he who is constituted at the head of our church as the servant of the mystery, you would strengthen with the fullness of virtue.

Finally the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia said:God, who willed your Apostle Peter to hold first place in the inner fellowship of the apostles, that universal Christianity overcome evil, look propitiously we ask on this your servant, __, who from a humble position has suddenly been enthroned with the apostles on this same principal sublimity, that just as he has been raised to this exalted dignity, so may he likewise merit to accumulate virtue; in bearing the burden of the universal church, help him, make him worthy and for thee who are blessed may merits replace vices.

Then, the senior cardinal deacon placed the pallium on his shoulders saying: Accept the pallium, representing the plenitude of the Pontifical office, to the honour of Almighty God, and the most glorious Virgin Mary, his Mother, and the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and the Holy Roman Church.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, the &quot;immantatio&quot;, or bestowal of the mantum (a papal vestment consisting of a very long red cope fastened with an elaborate morse) on the newly elected pope was regarded as especially symbolic of investiture with papal authority, and was conferred with the words: &quot;I invest thee with the Roman papacy, that thou rule over the city and the world.&quot;

After the investiture with the pallium, the pope incensed the high altar and then went to the throne, placed on the choir side, between the Altar of the Confession and the Altar of the Chair, and there, during the singing of the Kyrie, he received again the obeisance of the cardinals, archbishops and bishops. Then the Mass continued. After the Gloria in excelsis and the &quot;Pax vobis&quot;, the pope said the Collect for the day and then secretly a prayer for himself. After the pope had returned again to his seat the Papal &quot;Laudes&quot; were chanted:

As with all Papal High Masses, the Epistle and the Gospel were read in both Greek and Latin and the pope communicated at his throne.

=== Coronation ===
After the Mass, the new pope was crowned with the papal tiara. This frequently took place on the balcony of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, overlooking the crowds gathered in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. The pope was seated on a throne with the flabella to either side of him. After the Dean of the College of Cardinals recited a few prayers, including the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and a collect, the senior cardinal deacon, the protodeacon, removed the pope&#x27;s mitre and placed the tiara on his head with the words:

Following his coronation, the pope imparted the solemn papal blessing &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot;. Following 1929, the new pope would have received a salute by a guard of honour of the Italian Armed Forces and the Swiss Guards together with the Noble Guard, as military bands play the Pontifical Anthem and Il Canto degli Italiani (until 1946 the Marcia Reale and S&#x27;hymnu sardu nationale).

===Taking possession of the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome===

The last act of the inauguration of a new pope is still the formal taking possession (&quot;possessio&quot;) of his cathedra as Bishop of Rome in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. This is the final ceremony mentioned in Pope John Paul II&#x27;s apostolic constitution on the vacancy of the Apostolic See and the election of the Roman pontiff. The pope is enthroned in the same manner as other bishops. He is solemnly conducted to the episcopal throne, and takes possession by seating himself on it. He receives the kiss of peace and listens to the reading of a passage of Holy Scripture, whereupon he pronounces an address that used to be called the &quot;sermo inthronisticus&quot;.

In ancient times, the letters that the pope sent to the patriarchs in token of being in communion with them in the same faith were called &quot;litterae inthronisticae&quot; or &quot;syllabai enthronistikai&quot;.

==Location of the ceremony==
The earliest papal coronations took place in St. John Lateran, the pope&#x27;s cathedral. However, for hundreds of years papal coronations have traditionally taken place in the environs of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, though a number of coronations took place in Avignon, during the Avignon papacy. Earlier, Pope Celestine V was twice crowned in L&#x27;Aquila. In 1800 Pope Pius VII was crowned in the crowded church of the Benedictine island monastery of San Giorgio, Venice, after his late predecessor, Pope Pius VI, had been forced into temporary exile during Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s capture of Rome. Since the French seized the tiara along with the previous pope, he was crowned with a papier-mâché tiara, for which the ladies of Venice gave up their jewels.

All coronations after 1800 took place in Rome. Leo XIII was crowned in the Sistine Chapel, due to fears that anti-clerical mobs, inspired by Italian unification, might attack the Basilica and disrupt the ceremony. Benedict XV was also crowned in the chapel in 1914. Pius XI was crowned at the dais in front of the High Altar in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Popes Pius IX, Pius XII, and John XXIII all were crowned in public on the balcony of the basilica, facing crowds assembled below in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. Paul VI was crowned in front of St Peter&#x27;s on a special dais with the entire coronation ceremony outdoors, as St Peter&#x27;s was filled with special seating for the Vatican Council sessions.

Pius XII&#x27;s 1939 coronation broke new ground by being the first to be filmed and the first to be broadcast live on radio. The ceremony, which lasted for six hours, was attended by leading dignitaries; these included the heir to the Italian throne, the Prince of Piedmont, former kings Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and Alfonso XIII of Spain, the 16th Duke of Norfolk (representing King George VI of the United Kingdom), and the Irish Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, the last two being in evening dress (white tie and tails).

==Paul VI and the coronation==
The last pope to be crowned was Pope Paul VI. He decided to cease wearing a papal tiara and laid his own on the altar of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in a gesture of &quot;humility.&quot; His 1975 apostolic constitution, &quot;Romano Pontifici Eligendo&quot; prescribed that &quot;the new pontiff is to be crowned by the senior cardinal deacon&quot;.

His successor, Pope John Paul I, opted not to be crowned and to have instead a less elaborate &quot;solemn Mass to mark the start of his ministry as Supreme Pastor&quot; in September 1978.

==John Paul II and the coronation==
After John Paul I&#x27;s sudden death following a thirty-three-day reign, the new pope, John Paul II, opted to copy his predecessor&#x27;s ceremony without coronation. In his homily at his inauguration Mass, he said that Paul VI had &quot;left his successors free to decide&quot; whether to wear the papal tiara. He went on:
John Paul II&#x27;s 1996 Apostolic Constitution, &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot;, now in force, does not specify the form that the &quot;solemn ceremony of the inauguration of the pontificate&quot; of a new pope should take, whether with or without a coronation.

A number of papal tiaras are available for a future pope to use.

<doc id="189823" wikidata="Q1459964" url="?curid=189823" title="USS Louisiana (BB-19)">
<text>USS &quot;Louisiana&quot; (BB-19) was a of the United States Navy. She was the second member of the class of six pre-dreadnought battleships, and the third ship to carry her name. &quot;Louisiana&quot; was laid down in February 1903, launched in August 1904, and commissioned in June 1906. She was a battleship capable of . Her main armament consisted of four guns supported by a mixed secondary battery of and guns.

&quot;Louisiana&quot; primarily operated along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean during her career. In 1908–1909, she took part in the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. A pair of trips to European waters took place in 1910 and 1911. From 1913, she began to become involved in the Mexican Revolution, as the US Navy began to send ships to protect American interests in the country. This activity culminated in the US occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. During World War I, &quot;Louisiana&quot; was employed as a training ship before serving as a convoy escort in late 1918. After the war ended that year, she was used to ferry American soldiers back from France. With this work completed, she was decommissioned in October 1920 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1923.

==Design==
The followed the s, but corrected some of the most significant deficiencies in the earlier design, most notably the superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns. A heavier tertiary battery of guns replaced the guns that had been used on all previous US designs. Despite the improvements, the ships were rendered obsolescent by the revolutionary British battleship , completed before most of the members of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class.

&quot;Louisiana&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. She had a crew of 827 officers and enlisted men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch /45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /45 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Louisiana&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Louisiana&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating. The secondary turrets had of frontal armor. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
===Early career and the Great White Fleet===
The keel for &quot;Louisiana&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 7 February 1903. Her completed hull was launched on 27 August 1904, and she was commissioned into the fleet on 2 June 1906. The ship then conducted a shakedown cruise off the coast of New England before being ordered to Cuba. She left the United States on 15 September with Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Bacon aboard; they were requested as a peace commission by Cuban President Tomás Estrada Palma to suppress an insurrection in the country. Taft and Bacon helped to create a provisional government, during which time &quot;Louisiana&quot; remained in Cuba. After their work was completed, Taft and Bacon returned to the ship, which took them back to Fortress Monroe, Virginia.

On 8 November, &quot;Louisiana&quot; carried President Theodore Roosevelt from Piney Point, Maryland to Panama, where the Panama Canal was being built. After inspecting the progress of construction, Roosevelt boarded &quot;Louisiana&quot; and made a visit to Puerto Rico to examine the new government building there before continuing on to Piney Point, arriving on 26 November. Over the course of the following year, the ship made a series of cruises to American ports, including New Orleans and Norfolk, and visits to Havana and Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. During this period, she also took part in training exercises off New England.

&quot;Louisiana&quot; joined the Great White Fleet on 16 December 1907, when they departed Hampton Roads to begin their circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. 

After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for Theodore Roosevelt.

===1910–1923===
&quot;Louisiana&quot; underwent an extensive overhaul after returning from the voyage, after which she conducted training maneuvers in the Atlantic. Captain Washington Irving Chambers took command of the ship on 1 June. On 1 November 1910, she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Atlantic Fleet, which crossed the Atlantic to visit British and French cities. A second trip to Europe followed in 1911, this time to the Baltic Sea. There, the ships stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, Trälhavet, Sweden, Kronstadt, Russia, and Kiel, Germany. They were inspected by the monarchs of each country. The worsening unrest of the Mexican Revolution led the United States to begin intervening in the conflict to protect American interests; in support of these interventions, &quot;Louisiana&quot; made three trips to Mexico between July 1913 and September 1915. The first lasted from 6 July to 29 December 1913. The second, from 14 April to 8 August 1914, supported the United States occupation of Veracruz. The third deployment lasted from 17 August to 24 September 1915.

After returning from the last operation, &quot;Louisiana&quot; was reduced to reserve status at Norfolk and employed as a training ship for midshipmen and naval militia units. Following the United States&#x27; declaration of war on Germany on 6 April 1917, &quot;Louisiana&quot; was used to train gunners and engine room personnel. During this period, she was involved in a gunnery accident. During training on 1 June 1918, the crews for three of the 7-inch guns aboard the battleship accidentally began firing at one of the submarine chasers present; they fired several salvos before they received the order to cease fire. One of the shells struck &quot;Louisiana&quot;, killing one man and wounding several more. The ship was thereafter used to examine one of Arthur Pollen&#x27;s Argo Clocks, a fire control system that incorporated the first mechanical analog computer. The system was installed starting on 19 June, with work being completed by 1 July.

In September 1918, she was reassigned as a convoy escort; her first operation covered a convoy to Halifax on the 25th of the month. This duty did not last long, as the Germans signed the Armistice that ended the war on 11 November. &quot;Louisiana&quot; was then used to transport American soldiers back from France, starting on 24 December. The first trip was made in company with &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, and arrived in Brest, France on 5 January 1919. Between the two of them, they carried 2,169 men back to the United States. She made three additional trips to Brest in this role. After this task ended, she was transferred to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned on 20 October 1920. The ship was eventually sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.

<text>The Volkswagen Scirocco is a three-door, front-engine, front-wheel-drive, sport compact hatchback manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen in two generations from 1974 to 1992 and a third generation from 2008 until 2017. Production ended without a successor.

The Scirocco derives its name from the Mediterranean wind.


==First generation (1974)==

Volkswagen began work on the car during the early 1970s as the replacement for the aging Karmann Ghia coupe, and designated it the &quot;Typ 53&quot; internally. Although the platform of the Golf was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by Giorgetto Giugiaro) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the 1973 Geneva Motor Show.
Launched six months before the Golf, in order to resolve any teething troubles before production of the high volume hatchback started, the Scirocco went on sale in Europe in 1974 and in North America in 1975. Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.
The design of the vehicle combined with the lack of D.O.T.-approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use, and all four for high beam use for all the cars imported to the US. Many European owners of Scirocco with smaller engines replaced the two rectangular headlights with four round headlights to eliminate the differentiation between smaller and less powerful engines and larger and more powerful ones. However, the European &quot;TS&quot; version, for which maximum power was listed as , was easily distinguishable from the less powerful &quot;L&quot; and &quot;S&quot; (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights. An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975. Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside North America.

The Scirocco GTi entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn&#x27;t unveiled until the autumn of the same year. Its high-revving, 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car&#x27;s solid front brake discs were replaced with ventilated discs. Anti-roll bars were also fitted front and rear.


During the production of the &quot;Type 53&quot;, there were subtle changes to the body and trim. On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage. However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975. The possibility to retrofit the installation, together with a larger battery, was offered to existing owners. In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile. Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper. In 1979, the one-piece &quot;flag&quot; style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror. The car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).
There were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called &quot;Sidewinder&quot;, &quot;Sidewinder II&quot;, &quot;Champagne Edition&quot;, &quot;Champagne Edition II&quot; and the &quot;S&quot;. The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 &quot;S&quot; versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This &quot;S&quot; model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 &quot;S&quot; versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the &quot;S&quot; non-&quot;S&quot; vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the &quot;Storm&quot; models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.

===Japan===
The Scirocco was sold in Japan at Yanase dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles with right hand drive starting in 1976, initially offering the TS trim package with the 1.5-liter engine and a 4-speed manual transmission. In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5-liter engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only.

===North America===
The 1975–1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979–1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5 L (1471 cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with in 1976 and 1977. For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457 cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier. Power dropped accordingly, down to but with some fuel economy improvements. Buyers demanded otherwise and for 1979 the 1.6 (1588 cc) was reinstated, now with power up somewhat to . 1981 USA models had a standard 1.7 (1,715 cc), all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.

==Second generation (1981)==
A heavily redesigned &quot;Type 2&quot; variant (internally designated &quot;Typ 53B&quot;) went on sale in 1981, although it remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by Karmann of Osnabrück (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the 1981 Geneva Motor Show in March that year. Designed by Volkswagen&#x27;s own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space and a reduction in the coefficient of drag. One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined &quot;&quot; script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.
Halfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second &quot;transfer&quot; fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models.

Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner Oettinger in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show. It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44 kW (60 PS) to 82 kW (112 PS) for the 8-valve engines and either 95 kW (129 PS) or 102 kW (139 PS) for the 16-valve engines.

Numerous trim levels existed, depending on the model year and market, and included the L, CL, GL, LS, GLS, GLI, GT, GTI, GTL, GTS, GTX, GT II, Scala, GT 16V and GTX 16V. Special limited edition models including the California Edition (1983, USA), Storm (1984, UK), White Cat (1985, Europe), Tropic (1986, Europe), Wolfsburg Edition (1983–1985, USA and Canada) and Slegato (1988, Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.

Scirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. In the UK, the final Sciroccos were sold as 1993 models. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the Corrado in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.

The Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.

===North America===
Specifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce and of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce and of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.

==Third generation (2008)==

Volkswagen officially announced in June 2006 production of a new Scirocco model at the Autoeuropa assembly plant in Palmela, Portugal.
The new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the PQ35 platform of the Golf V and was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. It went on sale in summer 2008 in Europe, with sales in other countries beginning early 2009. The Type 3 Scirocco won &quot;Car of the Year 2008&quot; from &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot;.

The 2008 model of the Scirocco received a five star safety rating from Euro NCAP even after the driver test dummy&#x27;s head hit the steering wheel when the airbag bottomed out.
The model tested was a left-hand-drive three-door hatchback and scored in four areas:
* Adult Occupant , 31 points.
* Child Occupant , 36 points.
* Pedestrian , 19 points.
* Safety Assist , 5 points.

===Scirocco R-line (2011–2017)===
In 2011, Volkswagen added the R-line trim for all engine versions of the car. It included new front and back bumpers, side skirts on the exterior, and seats with grey Alcantara, R-line badges on the backs of the seats, driving wheel and on the doorsteps inside the car.

===Scirocco R (2009–2017)===
The Scirocco R is a production model based on the GT24. Its TSI straight-four engine is rated at at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 2,500 rpm, large air intake openings in the front bumper, an integrated front spoiler, bi-xenon headlights, larger rear roof edge spoiler, black diffuser, dual exhaust with chrome tailpipes, Talladega 19-inch alloy wheels. In September 2014 the R model had a face lift on the styling of the car and a power increase taking it to .

UK models went on sale in 2009.

=== Facelift ===
Six years after its launch in 2008, Volkswagen revealed the 2014 Scirocco facelift at the Geneva Motor Show. On the outside the changes weren&#x27;t obvious as Volkswagen installed only a slightly re-profiled bumper, new bi-xenon headlights with LED daytime running lights and they also tweaked the grille. At the back there were restyled LED taillights, along with a reworked bumper and boot lid. The changes carried over onto the range-topping Scirocco R as well.

===Scirocco GTS (2015–2017)===
Volkswagen unveiled the Scirocco GTS, featuring the same engine found in the Mk7 Golf GTI.

===Engines===
All models include standard six-speed manual transmission. The 1.4 TSI (162 PS) can optionally be fitted with a seven-speed DSG transmission, while the 2.0 TSI 200, 2.0 TSI 210, R 2.0 TSI 265 and 2.0 TDI are available with a six-speed DSG transmission.The EA888 2.0 TSI uses an IHI K03 water-cooled turbocharger incorporated in exhaust manifold, while a BorgWarner turbocharger is used in EA113 2.0 TSI versions.

The 140 bhp 2.0 TDI engine is also provided with the BlueMotion Technology package. This package features stop start technology and regenerative braking to reduce emissions to 118 g/km .

===Motorsports===

In the 24 Hours Nürburgring in May 2008, three new Volkswagen Sciroccos competed, finishing 11th and 15th out of a field of over 200 cars, with veteran Hans-Joachim Stuck driving both cars (and Carlos Sainz the slower one). The direct competitors, two Opel Astra H GTC driven by drivers selected from 18,000 hopefuls in a year-long TV covered process, were beaten decisively. In the 2012 edition of the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship Johan Kristoffersson won the championship for Volkswagen Team Biogas in a Scirocco.

===Absence of a North American version===
In April 2007, Volkswagen America vice president Adrian Hallmark claimed that Volkswagen preferred not to bring the Scirocco to North America since it could negatively affect Golf GTI sales. It was later stated that the final decision would be made in 2008 by Martin Winterkorn (Volkswagen&#x27;s CEO), not Volkswagen of America.

In early March 2008, MotorAuthority reported that, due to the increasing gap between the United States dollar and the euro, the Scirocco would not be made available for American consumers. &quot;This car would fit the U.S. market but at the current exchange rate we wouldn&#x27;t make any money,&quot; Volkswagen sales and marketing chief Detlef Wittig told Bloomberg reporters.

===Concepts===

====IROC concept (2006)====
A concept car previewing the then upcoming Scirocco III was unveiled at the 2006 Paris Motor Show. Named IROC, from the middle four letters of &quot;Scirocco&quot;, it used a TSI engine.

====Scirocco GT24 (2008–)====
The Scirocco GT24 is a race car for the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring. It has a 2.0 L TSI engine rated at and at 2,100 rpm as well as a DSG transmission.

The GT24 was unveiled at the GTI Meet 2008 in Wörthersee.

====Scirocco Studie R (2008)====
The Studie R is a concept car based on the Scirocco GT24, after Volkswagen had cancelled the production of the Scirocco R32. It has a 2.0 L TSI engine rated at , six-speed dual clutch transmission, four-piston brake calipers and a sound-optimized exhaust system with oval tailpipes.

The Studie R was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show.

==Future==

In 2017, Volkswagen&#x27;s Chief Development Officer Dr. Frank Welsch stated that Volkswagen was contemplating options for a new small coupé, and wasn&#x27;t clear on how they would approach a new Scirocco, and the possibility of a MEB-based concept. Welsch said that if the Scirocco name was to be used again, it would only be for a sporty 2-door coupe, and would not have a drastically different design from previous Sciroccos. In 2020, when asked if a new Scirocco was planned, board member Thomas Ulbrich answered &quot;I don&#x27;t think so&quot;, and that they were in no rush to release a new coupé.

<doc id="189826" wikidata="Q2706100" url="?curid=189826" title="USS Alabama (BB-8)">
<text>USS &quot;Alabama&quot; (BB-8) was an pre-dreadnought battleship built for the United States Navy. She was the second ship of her class, and the second to carry her name. Her keel was laid down in December 1896 at the William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard, and she was launched in May 1898. She was commissioned into the fleet in October 1900. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns and she had a top speed of .

&quot;Alabama&quot; spent the first seven years of her career in the North Atlantic Fleet conducting peacetime training. In 1904, she made a visit to Europe and toured the Mediterranean. She took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet until damage to her machinery forced her to leave the cruise in San Francisco. She instead completed a shorter circumnavigation in company with the battleship . The ship received an extensive modernization from 1909 to 1912, after which she was used as a training ship in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She continued in this role during World War I. After the war, &quot;Alabama&quot; was stricken from the naval register and allocated to bombing tests that were conducted in September 1921. She was sunk in the tests by US Army Air Service bombers and later sold for scrap in March 1924.

==Description==
Design work on the of pre-dreadnought battleships began in 1896, at which time the United States Navy had few modern battleships in service. Initial debate over whether to build a new low-freeboard design like the s in service or a higher-freeboard vessel like (then under construction) led to a decision to adopt the latter type. The mixed secondary armament of guns of previous classes was standardized to just 6-inch weapons to save weight and simplify ammunition supplies. Another major change was the introduction of modern, balanced turrets with sloped faces instead of the older &quot;Monitor&quot;-style turrets of earlier American battleships.

&quot;Alabama&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into a pair of funnels placed side by side. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 536 officers and enlisted men, which increased to 690–713.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in two twin-gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Alabama&quot; carried four  torpedo tubes in deck mounted launchers.

&quot;Alabama&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating on their exposed sides. Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
===Construction – 1911===

&quot;Alabama&quot; was laid down at the William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard in Philadelphia on 2 December 1896 and was launched on 18 May 1898. She was commissioned on 16 October 1900, the first member of her class to enter service. The ship&#x27;s first commander was Captain Willard H. Brownson. &quot;Alabama&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, though she remained at Philadelphia until 13 December, when she made a visit to New York, where she remained through January 1901. On the 27th, &quot;Alabama&quot; steamed south for the Gulf of Mexico, where she joined the rest of the North Atlantic Squadron for training exercises off Pensacola, Florida. In August 1901, while the North Atlantic Squadron conducted target practice off of Nantucket Island, &quot;Alabama&quot; experienced an outbreak of mumps and was placed in quarantine, unable to participate.

For the next six years, she followed a pattern of fleet training in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean during the winter, followed by repairs and then operations off the east coast of the United States from the middle of the year onward. The only interruption came in 1904, when she, the battleships , , and &quot;Iowa&quot;, and the protected cruisers , , and made a visit to southern Europe. During the trip, they stopped in Lisbon, Portugal, before touring the Mediterranean until mid-August. They then recrossed the Atlantic, stopping in the Azores while en route, and arrived in Newport, Rhode Island on 29 August. Toward the end of September, &quot;Alabama&quot; went into dry dock at the League Island Navy Yard for repairs, which were completed by early December. On 31 July 1906, the ship was involved in a collision with her sister .

&quot;Alabama&quot;″s next significant action was the cruise of the Great White Fleet around the world, which started with a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

On 17 December, the fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads and cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco, where &quot;Alabama&quot; was detached from the rest of the fleet. The ship could not keep up with the fleet due to a cracked cylinder head, which necessitated repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard. The battleship &quot;Maine&quot; also left the fleet, as her boilers had proved to be badly inefficient, requiring excessive amounts of coal.

On 8 June, &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Maine&quot; began their crossing of the Pacific independently, via Honolulu, Hawaii, Guam, and Manila in the Philippines. They then cruised south to Singapore in August and crossed the Indian Ocean, stopping in Colombo, Ceylon, and Aden on the Arabian peninsula on the way. The ships then steamed through the Mediterranean, stopping only in Naples, Italy, before calling at Gibraltar and then proceeding across the Atlantic in early October. They stopped in the Azores before arriving off the east coast of the United States on 19 October; the two ships then parted company, with &quot;Alabama&quot; steaming to New York, while &quot;Maine&quot; went to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Both ships arrived the following day. Following her arrival, &quot;Alabama&quot; was reduced to reserve status on 3 November. She remained in New York, and on 17 August 1909, she was decommissioned for a major overhaul that lasted until early 1912.

===1912–1919===

&quot;Alabama&quot; returned to service on 17 April 1912 in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, under Commander Charles F. Preston. The ships of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet—which included eight other battleships and three cruisers—were kept in service with reduced crews that could be fleshed out with naval militiamen and volunteers in the event of an emergency. There were enough officers and men in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet to fully man two or three ships, which allowed them to take them to sea in rotating groups to ensure that the ships were in good condition. On 25 July, &quot;Alabama&quot; was temporarily placed in full commission for service with the Atlantic Fleet during the summer training exercises, before returning to reserve status on 10 September. In mid-1913, the Navy began to use the Atlantic Reserve Fleet to train naval militia units. &quot;Alabama&quot; operated off the east coast of the United States and made two training cruises to Bermuda that summer to train men from the naval militias of several states. These operations ended on 2 September, and on 31 October she was again laid up.

The ship remained largely inactive in Philadelphia for the next three years. On 22 January 1917, she became a receiving ship for naval recruits. &quot;Alabama&quot; was transferred to the southern Chesapeake to begin training recruits in the middle of March. Shortly thereafter, on 6 April, the United States declared war on Germany. Two days later, &quot;Alabama&quot; became the flagship of the 1st Division, Atlantic Fleet, and for the rest of the war she continued her training mission of the east coast of the United States. During this period, she made one cruise to the Gulf of Mexico from late June to early July 1918. On 11 November, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe; &quot;Alabama&quot; continued training naval recruits, though at a reduced level of intensity. She took part in fleet maneuvers in February and March 1919 in the West Indies before returning to Philadelphia in April for repairs. A summer training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy followed; &quot;Alabama&quot; departed Philadelphia on 28 May bound for Annapolis, where she arrived the next day. After taking on a contingent of 184 midshipmen, she steamed out of Annapolis on 9 June. The cruise went to the West Indies and passed through the Panama Canal and back. By mid-July, the ship was cruising off the coast of New England. She returned south in August for maneuvers, and at the end of the month she returned the midshipmen to Annapolis before docking in Philadelphia.

===Bombing tests===

&quot;Alabama&quot; was decommissioned for the final time on 7 May 1920, having spent the previous nine months inactive at Philadelphia. The ship was transferred to the War Department for use as a target ship on 15 September 1921, and she was stricken from the naval register. She was allocated to bombing tests conducted by the US Army Air Service on 27 September 1921, under the supervision of General Billy Mitchell. In addition to &quot;Alabama&quot;, the old battleships and were to be sunk in the tests. The first phase of the testing began on 23 September, and included tests with chemical bombs, including tear gas and white phosphorus, to demonstrate how such weapons could be used to disable command and control systems and kill exposed personnel. That night, another test with 300 lb (136 kg) demolition bombs took place, the purpose of which was to determine whether flares could sufficiently illuminate a target for precise bombing. The second phase took place the next morning, and it was a much larger operation. The 1st Provisional Air Brigade took part in the tests, which were to simulate a combat scenario. A group of eight Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, armed with 25 lb (11 kg) bombs attacked first; their bombs and machine gun fire were intended to simulate clearing the decks of anti-aircraft gunners in preparation for the heavy bombers. Four Martin NBS-1 bombers attacked next, with 300 lb (136 kg) bombs at an altitude of 1500 ft (457 m). Two of the bombs hit the deck toward the bow. Three more NBS-1s followed with 1100 lb (499 kg) armor-piercing bombs, though none of these hit.

On 25 September 1921, the last round of tests took place. Seven more NBS-1s attacked the ship; three carried 1,100 lb (499 kg) bombs, while the other four carried one bomb each. One of the 2,000 lb (907 kg) bombs landed close to the ship on the port side; the mining effect caused considerable damage, and &quot;Alabama&quot; began listing to port. The bombers scored two more near-misses with the 2,000 lb (907 kg) bombs, followed by a direct hit and two near misses with the 1,100 lb (499 kg) bombs. The last bomb, a 2,000 lb (907 kg) weapon, struck the ship at her stern. The blast broke her anchor chains, and the battered ship began to drift toward the wrecks of &quot;San Marcos&quot; and , the latter having been sunk in bombing tests earlier that year. The ship remained afloat for another two days before finally sinking in shallow water on 27 September 1921. Mitchell attempted to use the sinking as evidence of the predominance of the bomber in his efforts to secure an independent air force, though the Navy pointed out that the ship was stationary, undefended, unmanned, and was not protected with the latest &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor scheme. The sunken wreck was sold for scrap on 19 March 1924.

== Salvage ==

The wreck of ex-&quot;Alabama&quot; contained tons of steel which were valuable as scrap metal. The Navy sold the salvage rights to the wrecks of ex-&quot;Alabama&quot;, ex-&quot;Indiana&quot;, and ex-&quot;San Marcos&quot; to Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation of New York for $10,600. In July 1925 officials of Union Shipbuilding Company of Baltimore Maryland made an inspection cruise of ex-&quot;Alabama&quot; to consider the feasibility of salvage. It bought the right to salvage ex-&quot;Alabama&quot; from Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott. Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis approved the transaction and granted permission for Union Shipbuilding to raise and remove ex-&quot;Alabama&quot; on 23 April 1926.

The company&#x27;s effort to raise the ship began in May 1926. It dispatched one of its steamers, &quot;Arbutus&quot;, to examine the wreck. Ex-&quot;Alabama&quot; was resting on the bottom in about of water. She had a 13 degree list to port. Two divers were sent down to examine the sunken hull. They found the ship deeply embedded in the sand. Once the sand was cleared away, two enormous holes were discovered below the waterline. The Navy had not reported these holes, likely because the sand hid them. Their discovery both changed the assessment of the bombing trials and substantially lengthened the salvage effort. In mid-December 1926 Union Shipbuilding paused the salvage effort due to winter weather. The War Department&#x27;s original license to salvage the ship had a term of one year. Due to the newly discovered holes, it extended its permission for five months, giving the company until 30 September 1927 to complete the removal.

Two steel patches, one long and wide, the other long and wide, covered the large holes, and crude cement plugs filled smaller holes. After the holes were patched, the ship was pumped out and refloated four times between 19 June and 10 September 1927. Weather and safety issues caused her to sink back to the bottom on the first three attempts. The hulk was surveyed prior to being granted permission to enter Baltimore Harbor, lest the wreck sink and block the channel. Towed by three tugs, the wreck of ex-&quot;Alabama&quot; left the spot where she sank on 10 September 1927 and was anchored at Baltimore the next day. A skeleton crew was aboard throughout, to keep electric pumps running lest the ship sink again.

The hulk was pulled on shore on Union Shipbuilding&#x27;s marine railway to begin the scrapping process.

<text>USS &quot;Alabama&quot; (BB-60) is a retired battleship. She was the fourth and final member of the of fast battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1940s. The first American battleships designed after the Washington Treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to guns, but Congressional refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of . A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships. Overcrowding was exacerbated by wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries and significantly increased their crews.

After entering service, &quot;Alabama&quot; was briefly deployed to strengthen the British Home Fleet, tasked with protecting convoys to the Soviet Union. In 1943, she was transferred to the Pacific for operations against Japan; the first of these was the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign that began in November that year. While operating in the Pacific, she served primarily as an escort for the fast carrier task force to protect the aircraft carriers from surface and air attacks. She also frequently bombarded Japanese positions in support of amphibious assaults. She took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in June–September and the Philippines campaign in October–December. After a refit in early 1945, she returned to the fleet for operations during the Battle of Okinawa and the series of attacks on the Japanese mainland in July and August, including several bombardments of coastal industrial targets.

&quot;Alabama&quot; assisted in Operation Magic Carpet after the war, carrying some 700 men home from the former war zone. She was decommissioned in 1947 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained until 1962 when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. A campaign to save the ship from the breakers&#x27; yard succeeded in raising the necessary funds, and &quot;Alabama&quot; was preserved as a museum ship in Mobile Bay, Alabama.

==Design==

The was ordered in the context of global naval rearmament during the breakdown of the Washington treaty system that had controlled battleships construction during the 1920s and early 1930s. Under the Washington and London treaties, so-called treaty battleships were limited to a standard displacement of and a main battery of guns. In 1936, following Japan&#x27;s decision to abandon the treaty system, the United States Navy decided to invoke the &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the Second London treaty that allowed displacements to rise to and armament to increase to guns. Congressional objections to increasing the size of the new ships forced the design staff to keep displacement as close to 35,000 LT as possible while incorporating the larger guns and armor sufficient to defeat guns of the same caliber.

&quot;Alabama&quot; is long overall and has a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried three Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her peace time crew numbered 1,793 officers and enlisted men, but during the war the crew swelled to 2,500.

The ship was armed with a main battery of nine 16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The secondary battery consisted of twenty 5-inch /38 caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on either side. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of twelve guns and twelve .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, but she was completed with a battery of six quadruple Bofors guns in place of the 1.1 in guns and thirty-five Oerlikon autocannon in single mounts instead of the .50-cal. guns.

The main armored belt is thick, while the main armored deck is up to thick. The main battery gun turrets have thick faces, and they are mounted atop barbettes that are thick. The conning tower has thick sides.

===Modifications===
&quot;Alabama&quot; received a series of modifications through her wartime career, consisting primarily of additions to anti-aircraft battery and various types of radar sets. The first addition was the installation of SC air search radar in 1941, fitted in the foremast, which was later replaced with an SK type set. At the same time, an SG surface search radar was installed on the forward superstructure; a second SG set was added to the main mast after experiences during the Guadalcanal campaign in 1942. In 1943, she received a Mark 3 fire-control radar, mounted on her conning tower to assist in the direction of her main battery guns. The Mark 3 was quickly replaced with more modern Mark 8 fire-control radar, and Mark 4 radars for the secondary battery guns. She later received Mark 12/22 sets in place of the Mark 4s. &quot;Alabama&quot; also received a TDY jammer. In 1945, her traditional spotting scopes were replaced with Mark 27 microwave radar sets.

The ship&#x27;s light anti-aircraft battery was gradually expanded. Four more 40 mm quadruple mounts were allocated to the ship in late 1942, but by the time she underwent her refit in November 1943, the allotted armament had been increased to twelve quadruple mounts. Two more were to be added to the forecastle in 1945, but experience with other ships demonstrated these to be excessively wet in most sea conditions and thus unusable, so they were never installed aboard &quot;Alabama&quot;. In May 1943, she had another eight 20 mm guns installed, bringing the total to fifty-three of the guns. By 1945, the ship&#x27;s 20 mm battery had grown to fifty-six guns, all in single mounts. She was slated to have these exchanged for forty twin mounts, but the work was not done before the war ended and she was removed from service.

==Service history==

===Construction and Atlantic operations===
The keel for &quot;Alabama&quot; was laid down on 1 February 1940 at the Norfolk Navy Yard. She was launched on 16 February 1942; &quot;Crane Ship No. 1&quot; (ex-) assisted with the installation of the ship&#x27;s heavy armor and armament. She was commissioned just six months later on 16 August. Fitting-out work then commenced, and on 11 November she began her shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay. She then began initial training to prepare the ship&#x27;s crew for wartime service, first out of Casco Bay, Maine. On 11 January 1943, &quot;Alabama&quot; returned to Chesapeake Bay for further training before moving to Norfolk. She was then assigned to Task Group (TG) 22.2 and sent back to Casco Bay on 13 February for tactical training.

&quot;Alabama&quot;″s first deployment came in April with the temporary assignment to the British Home Fleet to reinforce the Allied naval forces available to escort the Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union. At the time, the British had sent several capital ships to the Mediterranean Sea to support the Allied invasion of Sicily, stripping away forces necessary to counter German naval strength in Norway, most significantly the battleship . Accordingly, &quot;Alabama&quot; and her sister ship got underway on 2 April as part of Task Force (TF) 22. Screened by five destroyers, the two battleships steamed to the Orkney Islands by way of Little Placentia Sound and Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, arriving in the main British naval base at Scapa Flow on 19 May. There, they were organized as TF 61, Home Fleet, and the ships began thorough training to familiarize the American ships with their British counterparts for joint operations. TF 61 was commanded by Rear Admiral Olaf M. Hustvedt; over the course of the next three months, they frequently operated with the battleships and .

&quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and several British units covered an operation to reinforce the island of Spitzbergen in the Arctic Ocean in early June. The following month, &quot;Alabama&quot; took part in Operation Governor, a demonstration to distract German attention during the Sicily invasion. The Allies also hoped to lure out &quot;Tirpitz&quot; to sink her, but the Germans took no notice of the ships and remained in port. On 1 August, &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot; were detached to return to the United States; they departed immediately and arrived in Norfolk on 9 August, where &quot;Alabama&quot; underwent an overhaul in preparation for operations against Japanese forces in the Pacific Theater. &quot;Alabama&quot; emerged from the shipyard on 20 August and began the voyage to the Pacific by way of the Panama Canal, which she transited on 25 August. She reached Efate in the New Hebrides on 14 September.

===Pacific operations===
====Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign====
On arriving in the south Pacific, &quot;Alabama&quot; embarked on an extensive training program that lasted for a month and a half to prepare the battleship to operate with the fast carrier task force. She then steamed to Fiji on 7 November before departing four days later to support the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, which began with the invasion of Tarawa on 20 November. &quot;Alabama&quot; escorted the aircraft carriers while they struck Japanese airfields on nearby islands in the Marshalls to neutralize their ability to interfere with the landing. She then supported the landing on Betio in the Tarawa Atoll on 20 November, followed by the landing at Makin. &quot;Alabama&quot; twice engaged Japanese aircraft that approached the fleet on the night of 26 November.

&quot;Alabama&quot; and five other fast battleships bombarded Nauru on 8 December, which the Japanese used as a source of phosphate. The destroyer , which had been hit by Japanese artillery fire, came alongside &quot;Alabama&quot; and transferred three wounded men to the battleship. The ships then escorted the carriers and back to Efate, which they reached on 12 December. &quot;Alabama&quot; got underway on 5 January 1944 for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 12 January for maintenance that included replacing one of her propellers. She arrived in Funafuti in the Ellice Islands on 21 January, where she joined the fleet for the next operation in the campaign. She was assigned to Task Group (TG) 58.2, which sortied on 25 January to begin Operation Flintlock, the invasion of Kwajalein. &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and the battleship shelled the island of Roi-Namur over the course of 29 and 30 January, targeting defensive positions, airfields, and other facilities. For the remainder of the campaign, she patrolled to the north of Kwajalein to guard against a possible Japanese counterattack that did not materialize.

Over the next two months, the fast carrier task force embarked on a series of raids on Japanese-held islands in the central Pacific to prepare for the next major offensive. The ships of TG 58.2 sortied on 12 February to participate in Operation Hailstone, a major raid on the island of Truk, which had been the primary staging area for the Japanese fleet in the central Pacific. &quot;Alabama&quot; escorted the carriers that struck the island over the course of 16–17 February, inflicting heavy damage to the Japanese forces and infrastructure there. The fleet then continued on to raid Japanese bases on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. During a Japanese air attack on the fleet on 21 February, &quot;Alabama&quot;″s No. 9 5-inch turret accidentally fired into the No. 5 mount, killing five and wounding eleven men. That day, &quot;Alabama&quot; took part in a sweep to the southeast of Saipan to search for Japanese vessels that might be in the area. Having found none, the fleet steamed to Majuro to replenish fuel and ammunition. While there, she served as the flagship of Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, the commander of the fast carrier task force, from 3 to 8 March.

&quot;Alabama&quot; and the rest of the fleet departed Majuro on 22 March to attack the next set of targets: Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai in the Caroline Islands. By this time, &quot;Alabama&quot; had been transferred to TG 58.3 as part of the screen for the carrier . While en route to the Carolines, the ships came under attack from a group of Japanese aircraft on the night of 29 March and &quot;Alabama&quot; shot one of them down and assisted with another. The next day, the carriers began their raids and &quot;Alabama&quot; stood by, engaging Japanese aircraft as they attacked the fleet. She helped to drive off a lone Japanese aircraft late that day before it could close to attack. The fleet then returned to Majuro for replenishment before departing on 13 April; &quot;Alabama&quot; now escorted the veteran carrier for a series of strikes along the coast of western New Guinea in support of Army operations in the New Guinea campaign. The final action in the series of raids saw the fleet return to the Carolines to strike Pohnpei, which &quot;Alabama&quot; and five other battleships bombarded on 1 May. The group then returned once again to Eniwetok on 4 May to begin preparations for the invasion of the Marianas.

====Mariana and Palau Islands campaign====


&quot;Alabama&quot; sortied with the rest of TF 58 in early June, now as part of TG 58.7; the fleet had arrived off the initial target, Saipan, by 12 June. The next day, &quot;Alabama&quot; took part in a preparatory bombardment of the island intended to weaken Japanese defenses so that minesweepers could begin to clear approaches to the landing beach. &quot;Alabama&quot;″s gunners were not as experienced with shore bombardment as other dedicated bombardment ships, and her shooting was not particularly effective. She thereafter screened the carriers as they struck Japanese positions around the island, and ground troops landed on the island on 15 June. The landing was a breach of Japan&#x27;s inner defensive perimeter that triggered the Japanese fleet to launch a major counter-thrust with the 1st Mobile Fleet, the main carrier strike force.

The Japanese fleet arrived on 19 June, leading to the Battle of the Philippine Sea. &quot;Alabama&quot; was the first vessel to pick up the incoming Japanese aircraft on her radar, away, at 10:06. The battleship quickly corroborated the report, and 40 minutes later the Japanese aircraft arrived over the fleet. A total of seven waves hit the American fleet, though only three of them hit TG 58.7. Of those, &quot;Alabama&quot; was able to engage Japanese aircraft in two of the attacks. During one of the attacks, a pair of aircraft penetrated the Combat Air Patrols and attacked &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and &quot;Alabama&quot; was among the vessels that fired on them. About an hour after that attack, two torpedo bombers attempted to attack &quot;South Dakota&quot; again, but &quot;Alabama&quot; helped to drive them off with a barrage of anti-aircraft fire. During this latter attack, a single dive bomber was able to use the gunners&#x27; distraction with the torpedo bombers to approach &quot;Alabama&quot;, but the pilot nevertheless missed with his bombs and caused no damage. Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee, the TG 58.7 commander, commended &quot;Alabama&quot;″s radar operators for their prompt detection of the Japanese aircraft, which allowed the American carriers to launch their fighters with enough time to intercept the attackers away from the fleet.

&quot;Alabama&quot; remained on station, escorting the carriers while they raided Saipan, Guam, Tinian, and Rota throughout the campaign. She was then detached from the fleet to Eniwetok in the Marshalls for periodic maintenance. The ship then became the flagship of Rear Admiral Edward Hanson, the commander of Battleship Division (BatDiv) 9, and left the island on 14 July in company with &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;. The next stage in the campaign, the invasion of Guam, began on 21 July and &quot;Alabama&quot; performed her role of carrier escort during operations there for the next three weeks. On 11 August, she left to return to Eniwetok before embarking on the next assault on 30 August, code-named Operation Stalemate II; this consisted of a series of landings on Pelelieu, Ulithi, and Yap. By this time, the fast carrier task force had been transferred from Fifth Fleet to Third Fleet and accordingly renumbered as TF 38, so &quot;Alabama&quot; was now part of TG 38.3. She escorted the carriers while they launched a series of strikes on the islands from 6 to 8 September to prepare for the amphibious assaults.

====Philippines campaign====

After the strikes in the Carolines, the fast carrier task force left the area to begin initial raids in the Philippines, with the first strikes occurring from 12 to 14 September. Aircraft from the carriers hit Japanese bases on the islands of Cebu, Leyte, Bohol, and Negros. Another series of strikes, concentrated around the capital of Manila, followed on 21 and 22 September, and in the central Philippines on the 24th. &quot;Alabama&quot; returned to Saipan on 28 September before proceeding to Ulithi, which was by now a major staging area for the US fleet, on 1 October. Five days later, the fast carrier task force sortied to begin a major raid on the island of Formosa (Taiwan) and other islands to neutralize the airfields there in advance of the invasion of the Philippines. &quot;Alabama&quot; continued to escort the carriers as part of TG 38.3, providing heavy anti-aircraft support. On 14 October, the fleet turned south to begin raids on Luzon in the Philippines and &quot;Alabama&quot; engaged aircraft that attempted to attack the fleet. The ship&#x27;s gunners claimed to have destroyed three Japanese aircraft and damaged another.

=====Battle of Leyte Gulf=====
&quot;Alabama&quot; supported the landing at Leyte on 15 October before returning to the carrier screen to escort them for another series of air strikes on islands throughout the Philippines on 21 October, by now having been transferred to TG 38.4. The landings on Leyte led to the activation of Operation Shō-Gō 1, the Japanese navy&#x27;s planned riposte to an Allied landing in the Philippines. The plan was a complicated operation with three separate fleets: the 1st Mobile Fleet, now labeled the Northern Force under Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, the Center Force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, and the Southern Force under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura. Ozawa&#x27;s carriers, by now depleted of most of their aircraft, were to serve as a decoy for Kurita&#x27;s and Nishimura&#x27;s battleships, which were to use the distraction to attack the invasion fleet directly.

Kurita&#x27;s ships were detected in the San Bernardino Strait on 24 October, and in the ensuing Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, American carrier aircraft sank the powerful battleship , causing Kurita to temporarily reverse course. This convinced Admiral William F. Halsey, the commander of Third Fleet, to send the fast carrier task force to destroy the 1st Mobile Fleet, which had by then been detected. &quot;Alabama&quot; steamed north with the carriers, and on the way Halsey established TF 34, consisting of &quot;Alabama&quot; and five other fast battleships, seven cruisers, and eighteen destroyers, commanded by Vice Admiral Willis Lee. TF 34 was arrayed ahead of the carriers, serving as their screen. On the morning of 25 October, Mitscher began his first attack on the Northern Force, initiating the Battle off Cape Engaño; over the course of six strikes on the Japanese fleet, the Americans sank all four carriers and damaged two old battleships that had been converted into hybrid carriers. Unknown to Halsey and Mitscher, Kurita had resumed his approach through the San Bernardino Strait late on 24 October and passed into Leyte Gulf the next morning. While Mitscher was occupied with the decoy Northern Force, Kurita moved in to attack the invasion fleet; in the Battle off Samar, he was held off by a group of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts, TU 77.4.3, known as Taffy 3. Frantic calls for help later that morning led Halsey to detach Lee&#x27;s battleships to head south and intervene.

However, Halsey waited more than an hour after receiving orders from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, to detach TF 34; still steaming north during this interval, the delay added two hours to the battleships&#x27; voyage south. A need to refuel destroyers further slowed TF 34&#x27;s progress south. Heavy resistance from Taffy 3 threw Kurita&#x27;s battleships and cruisers into disarray and led him to break off the attack before &quot;Alabama&quot; and the rest of TF 34 could arrive. Halsey detached &quot;Iowa&quot; and as TG 34.5 to pursue Kurita through the San Bernardino Strait while Lee took the rest of his ships further southwest to try to cut off his escape, but both groups arrived too late. The historian H. P. Wilmott speculated that had Halsey detached TF 34 promptly and not delayed the battleships by refueling the destroyers, the ships could have easily arrived in the strait ahead of Center Force and, owing to the marked superiority of their radar-directed main guns, destroyed Kurita&#x27;s ships.

=====Later operations=====
Having failed to intercept the retiring Japanese fleet, &quot;Alabama&quot; and the rest of TF 34 returned to their positions screening the carriers. On 30 October, the fleet withdrew to Ulithi to replenish ammunition and fuel. On 3 November, the fleet departed for another series of raids on Japanese airfields and other facilities on Luzon as the amphibious force prepared for its next landing on the island of Mindoro in the western Philippines. Over the next few weeks, &quot;Alabama&quot; cruised with the carriers, protecting them from Japanese aircraft, while the carriers struck targets on Luzon and the Visayas in the central Philippines. The fleet returned to Ulithi once again on 24 November and through early December &quot;Alabama&quot; was occupied with routine maintenance and training exercises with other vessels in the fleet. During this period, the fleet was reorganized and &quot;Alabama&quot; was assigned to TG 38.1. The fleet sortied again on 10 December for more strikes on Luzon that lasted from 14 to 16 December; the carriers massed so many aircraft that they could keep Japanese airfields constantly suppressed to prevent them from interfering with the passage of the Mindoro invasion fleet.

On 17 December, the fleet withdrew to refuel at sea, but late in the day, Typhoon Cobra swept through the area, battering the fleet. The storm conditions—&quot;Alabama&quot; recorded wind gusts as high as and heavy seas that caused her to roll up to thirty degrees—sank three destroyers and inflicted serious damage to several other vessels, though &quot;Alabama&quot; emerged with only minor damage to her superstructure, and both of her Kingfishers were wrecked. The fleet returned to Ulithi on 24 December and &quot;Alabama&quot; was detached for an overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. She entered the dry-dock there on 18 January 1945 for work that lasted until 25 February, at which point she was floated out of the dry-dock for further repairs, which were completed on 17 March. The ship then began a series of sea trials and training exercises along the coast of California before departing on 4 April for Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 10 April, spent a week on additional training exercises, and then proceeded on to Ulithi, arriving there on 28 April.

====Operations off Japan and the end of the war====
At Ulithi, &quot;Alabama&quot; re-joined the fast carrier task force, which had by this point reverted to Fifth Fleet. The fast carrier task force got underway on 9 May to support the forces fighting in the Battle of Okinawa, who had gone ashore on 1 April. The Japanese had massed significant reserves of aircraft for kamikaze strikes against the invasion fleet. During one such attack on 14 May, while approximately 120 miles southeast of the Japanese home island of Kyushu, &quot;Alabama&quot; shot down two Japanese aircraft and helped to destroy two others, but one kamikaze nevertheless penetrated the fleet&#x27;s anti-aircraft defenses and struck &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The operations off Okinawa continued for the next two weeks and on 4–5 June, the fleet was hit by another typhoon and &quot;Alabama&quot;—part of TG 38.1 at this time—again suffered only superficial damage, though many other vessels in the group were badly damaged. The fleet resumed its normal operations in support of the Okinawa fight on 7 June, including air strikes on Japanese airfields on Kyushu the next day that &quot;Alabama&quot; supported. With an escort of five destroyers on 9 June, &quot;Alabama&quot;, , and steamed to shell Japanese facilities on the island of Minami Daito Jima; they repeated the attack the next day. The fleet thereafter returned to Leyte Gulf to begin preparations for a series of attacks on the Japanese Home Islands.

Third Fleet resumed control of the carrier fleet for these operations, which began on 1 July when the fleet sortied from Leyte Gulf. The carriers conducted wide-ranging attacks on various military and industrial targets throughout Japan, particularly concentrating on the area around Tokyo. On the night of 17–18 July, &quot;Alabama&quot;, four other American battleships, the British battleship , and a pair of cruisers bombarded six industrial facilities northeast of Tokyo. On 9 August, &quot;Alabama&quot; shelled targets at Kamaishi in company with two battleships and six American and British cruisers. The same day, &quot;Alabama&quot; transferred a medical party to the destroyer , which took them to the destroyer , which had been hit by a kamikaze and needed medical assistance. When she received word of the Japanese surrender on 15 August, &quot;Alabama&quot; was still at sea off the coast of Japan. She contributed sailors and marines to the initial occupation force, and she cruised with the carriers while they used their aircraft to search for prisoner of war camps.

On 5 September, &quot;Alabama&quot; steamed into Tokyo Bay, where she re-embarked crew-members who had gone ashore. She remained there until 20 September, when she got underway for Okinawa, where she took on 700 men, most of whom were Seabees, to carry them back to the United States as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The ship arrived in San Francisco on 15 October and remained there for the Navy Day celebrations held there on 27 October, where she hosted some 9,000 visitors. Two days later, she steamed to San Pedro, California, where she lay until 27 February 1946, when she got underway for an overhaul at Puget Sound to prepare her for deactivation.

===Reserve and museum ship===

She was decommissioned on 9 January 1947 at the Naval Station in Seattle and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, stationed in Bremerton, Washington. Plans were drawn up during the period she was in reserve to modernize &quot;Alabama&quot; and the other ships of her class should they be needed for future active service. In March 1954, a program to equip the four ships with secondary batteries consisting of ten twin guns were proposed, but the plan came to nothing. Another plan to convert the ship into a guided missile battleship arose in 1956–1957, but the cost of the conversion proved to be prohibitive. She would have had all three main battery turrets removed and replaced with a twin RIM-8 Talos missile launcher forward, two RIM-24 Tartar launchers aft, anti-submarine weapons, and equipment to handle helicopters. The cost of the project amounted to $120 million.

On 1 June 1962, &quot;Alabama&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register for disposal; with the ship slated to be broken up, the state of Alabama passed a bill to establish the &quot;USS Alabama Battleship Commission&quot; with a view toward preserving the battleship as a museum ship. Governor George Wallace signed the law on 12 September 1963, and the commission set about raising funds to acquire the ship; ultimately around $800,000 was raised, of which an eighth came from children in the state, the rest coming primarily from corporate donations.

On 16 June 1964, the Navy awarded the ship to her namesake state, with a provision that the Navy would retain the ability to recall the ship to service in the event of an emergency. &quot;Alabama&quot; was formally handed over on 7 July during a ceremony in Seattle, and she was then towed to Mobile, Alabama to be restored as a museum, by way of the Panama Canal. On the way to the canal, one of the tugboats accidentally sank. The ship&#x27;s screws were removed for the voyage to avoid any damage. The carrier , a veteran of the fast carrier task force and still in service, escorted the ship while she was towed through the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;Alabama&quot; arrived in Mobile on 14 September having traveled some , the longest tow of a vessel that was not an active warship. The channel in Mobile Bay to her permanent berth had not yet been completed, and she had to wait until the end of the month before dredging work was finished. Once the ship was moored in her berth, work began to prepare the ship for visitors, including sandblasting painted surfaces, applying primer, and then re-painting the entire ship. The museum was opened on 9 January 1965.

In the early 1980s, when the Navy reactivated the four s, parts were cannibalized from &quot;Alabama&quot; and the other preserved battleships, including &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot;, to restore the &quot;Iowa&quot;s to service. Engine room components that were no longer available in the Navy&#x27;s inventory accounted for most of the material removed from the ships. The ship was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. During her career as a museum ship, &quot;Alabama&quot; has been used as a set for several movies including &quot;Under Siege&quot; in 1992 and &quot;USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage&quot; in 2016.

In the early 2000s, the museum raised funds to complete major repairs to &quot;Alabama&quot;, including removing 2.7 million gallons of water contaminated with fuel oil from the ship. This involved erecting a cofferdam around the ship and pumping it dry, which also allowed workers to repair the ship&#x27;s hull. At the same time, the submarine , another component of the museum, was moved from the water to a display on land so her hull could be repaired. &quot;Alabama&quot; was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, taking on water and a list to port; repairs were effected by Volkert, Inc.

<text>USS &quot;Nebraska&quot; (BB-14) was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy, the second of five members of the class, and the first ship to carry her name. She was built by the Moran Brothers shipyard in Seattle, Washington, with her keel-laying in July 1902 and her launching in October 1904. The completed ship was commissioned into the US Navy in July 1907. The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four guns and eight guns, and she was capable of a top speed of .

&quot;Nebraska&quot; joined the Great White Fleet after it reached the west coast of the United States in 1908 and continued with it during its circumnavigation of the globe. From 1909 to 1914, the ship conducted normal training and ceremonial duties with the Atlantic Fleet. She was deployed twice to Mexico during the Mexican Revolution, in mid-1914 and mid-1916, before being decommissioned briefly in 1916. She was reactivated shortly before the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and was thereafter used as a training ship and later as a convoy escort. After the war, she transported American soldiers back from France, and in 1919 she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet, though she remained in service for less than a year, being decommissioned in July 1920. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty mandated her disposal, which was effected in November 1923, when she was broken up for scrap.

==Design==
Design work on the began in 1899, after the United States&#x27; victory in the Spanish–American War, which had demonstrated the need for sea-going battleships suitable for operations abroad, finally resolving the debate between proponents of that type and those who favored low-freeboard types useful for coastal defense. The designers included a superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns, which proved to be a significant disappointment in service, as firing either set of guns interfered with the others, slowing the rate of fire.

&quot;Nebraska&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 812 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 caliber guns and twelve /50 caliber Mark 6 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve /50 caliber guns, mounted in casemates along the side of the hull, and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Nebraska&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Nebraska&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and elsewhere. The faces of the main battery gun turrets (and the secondary turrets on top of them) were thick. Each turret rested on a supporting barbettes that had of armor plating. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===

The keel for &quot;Nebraska&quot; was laid down at the Moran Brother&#x27;s Shipyard in Seattle, Washington on 4 July 1902. She was launched on 7 October 1904 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1907, the last member of the class to enter service. Her first commander was Captain Reginald F. Nicholson. After entering service, she conducted shakedown cruises and had minor alterations made. In May 1908, she steamed to San Francisco, arriving on the 6th. There, she joined the Great White Fleet, which had departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, the previous year on the first leg of its global cruise. &quot;Nebraska&quot; replaced the battleship , and the fleet departed San Francisco on 7 July. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific, with a visit to Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.

After the conclusion of the ceremonies, &quot;Nebraska&quot; remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet. In late 1909 she took part in the Hudson–Fulton Celebration in New York. The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson&#x27;s discovery of the Hudson River. In 1912, &quot;Nebraska&quot; took part in a ceremony for the centennial anniversary of Louisiana&#x27;s entrance into the United States. The ship was deployed to Mexico twice to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution, the first from 1 May to 21 June 1914, and the second from 1 June to 13 October 1916. For these actions, the ship was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. The ship was briefly decommissioned in 1916, but returned to service on 3 April 1917.

===World War I===

Three days after &quot;Nebraska&quot; was recommissioned, the United States declared war on Germany over the latter&#x27;s unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, thereby joining World War I. The ship was assigned to the 3rd Division, Battleship Force of the Atlantic Fleet, and on 13 April, she joined the rest of the fleet for battle training in the Chesapeake Bay. She remained on the eastern coast of the United States and was tasked with training guard crews for transport ships. On 15 April 1918, she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance. On 16 May, &quot;Nebraska&quot; embarked the remains of the recently deceased Uruguayan ambassador, Carlos DePena, at Hampton Roads. She departed that day with the armored cruiser —the flagship of the Pacific Fleet—and arrived in Montevideo, Uruguay on 10 June. The commander of the Pacific Fleet came aboard &quot;Nebraska&quot; for the transfer ceremonies. The two ships left Montevideo on 15 June and reached Hampton Roads on 26 July.

Starting in September, &quot;Nebraska&quot; began to be employed as an escort for convoys to Europe. On the 17th, she departed New York with convoy HX 49, a group of eighteen ships; the rest of the escort included the destroyer and the armed merchant cruiser (AMC) &quot;Rochester&quot;, and the British AMC . At a rendezvous point in the eastern Atlantic, she handed the convoy off to other escorts that would take the ships to France. &quot;Nebraska&quot; arrived back in Hampton Roads on 3 October. She escorted another two convoys before the war ended in November 1918. In December, she was equipped to carry American soldiers back from France. She made four such trips to Brest, France, and carried some 4,540 men back to the United States. The first trip began on 30 December; she reached Brest on 11 January 1919 and after embarking a contingent of soldiers, departed for Newport News, Virginia, where they arrived on 28 January. The fourth trip concluded on 21 June 1919, also in Newport News.

On 22 June 1919, &quot;Nebraska&quot; was transferred from the Cruiser and Transport Force to the Pacific Fleet. She departed the east coast shortly thereafter, bound for the Pacific. On 2 July 1920, the ship was decommissioned, and on the 15th she was reclassified as BB-14. She remained out of service until 12 July 1922 when she was stricken from the naval register in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty signed earlier that year. The terms of the treaty mandated significant reductions in naval strength, and on 9 November 1923, &quot;Nebraska&quot; was declared to have been rendered unfit for further warlike service in accordance with the treaty. She was then sold to ship breakers.

<text>A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language &quot;elements&quot;, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how &quot;high-level&quot; a programming language is.

In the 1960s, a high-level programming language using a compiler was commonly called an &quot;autocode&quot;.
Examples of autocodes are COBOL and Fortran.

The first high-level programming language designed for computers was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse. However, it was not implemented in his time, and his original contributions were largely isolated from other developments due to World War II, aside from the language&#x27;s influence on the &quot;Superplan&quot; language by Heinz Rutishauser and also to some degree ALGOL. The first significantly widespread high-level language was Fortran, a machine-independent development of IBM&#x27;s earlier Autocode systems. The ALGOL family, with ALGOL 58 defined in 1958 and ALGOL 60 defined in 1960 by committees of European and American computer scientists, introduced recursion as well as nested functions under lexical scope. ALGOL 60 was also the first language with a clear distinction between value and name-parameters and their corresponding semantics. ALGOL also introduced several structured programming concepts, such as the codice_1 and codice_2 constructs and its syntax was the first to be described in formal notation – &quot;Backus–Naur form&quot; (BNF). During roughly the same period, COBOL introduced records (also called structs) and Lisp introduced a fully general lambda abstraction in a programming language for the first time.

== Features ==
&quot;High-level language&quot; refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses, and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or Boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. Unlike low-level assembly languages, high-level languages have few, if any, language elements that translate directly into a machine&#x27;s native opcodes. Other features, such as string handling routines, object-oriented language features, and file input/output, may also be present. One thing to note about high-level programming languages is that these languages allow the programmer to be detached and separated from the machine. That is, unlike low-level languages like assembly or machine language, high-level programming can amplify the programmer&#x27;s instructions and trigger a lot of data movements in the background without their knowledge. The responsibility and power of executing instructions have been handed over to the machine from the programmer.

== Abstraction penalty ==
High-level languages intend to provide features that standardize common tasks, permit rich debugging, and maintain architectural agnosticism; while low-level languages often produce more efficient code through optimization for a specific system architecture. &quot;Abstraction penalty&quot; is the cost that high-level programming techniques pay for being unable to optimize performance or use certain hardware because they don&#x27;t take advantage of certain low-level architectural resources. High-level programming exhibits features like more generic data structures and operations, run-time interpretation, and intermediate code files; which often result in execution of far more operations than necessary, higher memory consumption, and larger binary program size. For this reason, code which needs to run particularly quickly and efficiently may require the use of a lower-level language, even if a higher-level language would make the coding easier. In many cases, critical portions of a program mostly in a high-level language can be hand-coded in assembly language, leading to a much faster, more efficient, or simply reliably functioning optimised program.

However, with the growing complexity of modern microprocessor architectures, well-designed compilers for high-level languages frequently produce code comparable in efficiency to what most low-level programmers can produce by hand, and the higher abstraction may allow for more powerful techniques providing better overall results than their low-level counterparts in particular settings.
High-level languages are designed independent of a specific computing system architecture. This facilitates executing a program written in such a language on any computing system with compatible support for the Interpreted or JIT program. High-level languages can be improved as their designers develop improvements. In other cases, new high-level languages evolve from one or more others with the goal of aggregating the most popular constructs with new or improved features. An example of this is Scala which maintains backward compatibility with Java, meaning that programs and libraries written in Java will continue to be usable even if a programming shop switches to Scala; this makes the transition easier and the lifespan of such high-level coding indefinite. In contrast, low-level programs rarely survive beyond the system architecture which they were written for without major revision. This is the engineering &#x27;trade-off&#x27; for the &#x27;Abstraction Penalty&#x27;.

== Relative meaning ==

Examples of high-level programming languages in active use today include Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Delphi, Perl, PHP, ECMAScript, Ruby, C#, Java and many others.

The terms &quot;high-level&quot; and &quot;low-level&quot; are inherently relative. Some decades ago, the C language, and similar languages, were most often considered &quot;high-level&quot;, as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered &quot;low-level&quot;. Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing; it therefore, readily blends with assembly language and the machine level of CPUs and microcontrollers. Also, in the introduction chapter of The C Programming Language (second edition) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, C is described as &quot;not a very high level&quot; language.

Assembly language may itself be regarded as a higher level (but often still one-to-one if used without macros) representation of machine code, as it supports concepts such as constants and (limited) expressions, sometimes even variables, procedures, and data structures. Machine code, in turn, is inherently at a slightly higher level than the microcode or micro-operations used internally in many processors.

== Execution modes ==

There are three general modes of execution for modern high-level languages:
; Interpreted: When code written in a language is interpreted, its syntax is read and then executed directly, with no compilation stage. A program called an &quot;interpreter&quot; reads each program statement, following the program flow, then decides what to do, and does it. A hybrid of an interpreter and a compiler will compile the statement into machine code and execute that; the machine code is then discarded, to be interpreted anew if the line is executed again. Interpreters are commonly the simplest implementations of the behavior of a language, compared to the other two variants listed here.
; Compiled: When code written in a language is compiled, its syntax is transformed into an executable form before running. There are two types of compilation:
:; Machine code generation: Some compilers compile source code directly into machine code. This is the original mode of compilation, and languages that are directly and completely transformed to machine-native code in this way may be called &quot;truly compiled&quot; languages. See assembly language.
:; Intermediate representations: When code written in a language is compiled to an intermediate representation, that representation can be optimized or saved for later execution without the need to re-read the source file. When the intermediate representation is saved, it may be in a form such as bytecode. The intermediate representation must then be interpreted or further compiled to execute it. Virtual machines that execute bytecode directly or transform it further into machine code have blurred the once clear distinction between intermediate representations and truly compiled languages.
; Source-to-source translated or transcompiled: Code written in a language may be translated into terms of a lower-level language for which native code compilers are already common. JavaScript and the language C are common targets for such translators. See CoffeeScript, Chicken Scheme, and Eiffel as examples. Specifically, the generated C and C++ code can be seen (as generated from the Eiffel language when using the EiffelStudio IDE) in the EIFGENs directory of any compiled Eiffel project. In Eiffel, the &quot;translated&quot; process is referred to as transcompiling or transcompiled, and the Eiffel compiler as a transcompiler or source-to-source compiler.

Note that languages are not strictly &quot;interpreted&quot; languages or &quot;compiled&quot; languages. Rather, implementations of language behavior use interpreting or compiling. For example, ALGOL 60 and Fortran have both been interpreted (even though they were more typically compiled). Similarly, Java shows the difficulty of trying to apply these labels to languages, rather than to implementations; Java is compiled to bytecode which is then executed by either interpreting (in a Java virtual machine (JVM)) or compiling (typically with a just-in-time compiler such as HotSpot, again in a JVM). Moreover, compiling, transcompiling, and interpreting is not strictly limited to only a description of the compiler artifact (binary executable or IL assembly).

=== High-level language computer architecture ===
Alternatively, it is possible for a high-level language to be directly implemented by a computer – the computer directly executes the HLL code. This is known as a &quot;high-level language computer architecture&quot; – the computer architecture itself is designed to be targeted by a specific high-level language. The Burroughs large systems were target machines for ALGOL 60, for example.

<text>A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer&#x27;s instruction set architecture, memory or underlying physical hardware; commands or functions in the language are structurally similar to a processor&#x27;s instructions. These languages provide the programmer with full control over program memory and the underlying machine code instructions. Because of the low level of abstraction (hence the term &quot;low-level&quot;) between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being &quot;close to the hardware&quot;. Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture.

Low-level languages are directly converted to machine code with or without a compiler or interpreter—second-generation programming languages depending on programming language. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint. A program that written with those programming languages often end up becoming architecture dependent or operating system dependent, due to using low level APIs.

== Machine code ==
&quot;Machine code&quot; is the form in which code that can be directly executed is stored on a computer. It consists of machine language instructions, stored in memory, that perform operations such as moving values in and out of memory locations, arithmetic and Boolean logic, and testing values and, based on the test, either executing the next instruction in memory or executing an instruction at another location.

Machine code is usually stored in memory as binary data. Programmers almost never write programs directly in machine code; instead, they write code in assembly language or higher-level programming languages.

Although few programs are written in machine languages, programmers often become adept at reading it through working with core dumps or debugging from the front panel.

Example of a function in hexadecimal representation of x86-64 machine code to calculate the &quot;n&quot;th Fibonacci number, with each line corresponding to one instruction:
 89 f8
 85 ff
 74 26
 83 ff 02
 76 1c
 89 f9
 ba 01 00 00 00
 be 01 00 00 00
 8d 04 16
 83 f9 02
 74 0d
 89 d6
 ff c9
 89 c2
 eb f0
 b8 01 00 00
 c3

== Assembly language ==

Second-generation languages provide one abstraction level on top of the machine code. In the early days of coding on computers like TX-0 and PDP-1, the first thing MIT hackers did was to write assemblers.
Assembly language has little semantics or formal specification, being only a mapping of human-readable symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants, strings and so on. Typically, one machine instruction is represented as one line of assembly code, commonly called a &quot;mnemonic&quot;. Assemblers produce object files that can link with other object files or be loaded on their own.

Most assemblers provide macros to generate common sequences of instructions.

Example: The same Fibonacci number calculator as above, but in x86-64 assembly language using Intel syntax:

fib:
 mov rax, rdi ; The argument is stored in rdi, put it into rax
 test rdi, rdi ; Is the argument zero?
 je .return_from_fib ; Yes - return 0, which is already in rax
 cmp rdi, 2 ; No - compare the argument to 2
 jbe .return_1_from_fib ; If it is less than or equal to 2, return 1
 mov rcx, rdi ; Otherwise, put it in rcx, for use as a counter
 mov rdx, 1 ; The first previous number starts out as 1, put it in rdx
 mov rsi, 1 ; The second previous number also starts out as 1, put it in rsi
.fib_loop:
 lea rax, [rsi + rdx] ; Put the sum of the previous two numbers into rax
 cmp rcx, 2 ; Is the counter 2?
 je .return_from_fib ; Yes - rax contains the result
 mov rsi, rdx ; No - make the first previous number the second previous number
 dec rcx ; Decrement the counter
 mov rdx, rax ; Make the current number the first previous number
 jmp .fib_loop ; Keep going
.return_1_from_fib:
 mov rax, 1 ; Set the return value to 1
.return_from_fib:
 ret ; Return
In this code example, the registers of the x86-64 processor are named and manipulated directly. The function loads its 64-bit argument from in accordance to the System V application binary interface for x86-64 and performs its calculation by manipulating values in the , , , and registers until it has finished and returns. Note that in this assembly language, there is no concept of returning a value. The result having been stored in the register, again in accordance with System V application binary interface, the instruction simply removes the top 64-bit element on the stack and causes the next instruction to be fetched from that location (that instruction is usually the instruction immediately after the one that called this function), with the result of the function being stored in . x86-64 assembly language imposes no standard for passing values to a function or returning values from a function (and in fact, has no concept of a function); those are defined by an application binary interface (ABI), such as the System V ABI for a particular instruction set.

Compare this with the same function in C:
unsigned int fib(unsigned int n)
 if (!n)
 return 0;
 else if (n &lt;= 2)
 return 1;
 else
 unsigned int f_nminus2, f_nminus1, f_n; 
 for (f_nminus2 = f_nminus1 = 1, f_n = 0; ; --n)
 f_n = f_nminus2 + f_nminus1;
 if (n &lt;= 2)
 return f_n;
 f_nminus2 = f_nminus1;
 }


This code is similar in structure to the assembly language example but there are significant differences in terms of abstraction:

* The input (parameter ) is an abstraction that does not specify any storage location on the hardware. In practice, the C compiler follows one of many possible calling conventions to determine a storage location for the input.
* The local variables , , and are abstractions that do not specify any specific storage location on the hardware. The C compiler decides how to actually store them for the target architecture.
* The return function specifies the value to return, but does not dictate &quot;how&quot; it is returned. The C compiler for any specific architecture implements a standard mechanism for returning the value. Compilers for the x86-64 architecture typically (but not always) use the register to return a value, as in the assembly language example (the author of the assembly language example has &quot;chosen&quot; to use the System V application binary interface for x86-64 convention but assembly language does not require this).

These abstractions make the C code compilable without modification on any architecture for which a C compiler has been written, whereas the assembly language code above will only run on processors using the x86-64 architecture.

== C programming language ==

C has variously been described as low-level and high-level. Traditionally considered high-level, C’s level of abstraction from the hardware is far lower than many subsequently developed languages, particularly interpreted languages. The direct interface C provides between the programmer and hardware memory allocation and management make C the lowest-level language of the 10 most popular languages currently in use.

C is architecture independent — the same C code may, in most cases, be compiled (by different machine-specific compilers) for use on a wide breadth of machine platforms. In many respects (including directory operations and memory allocation), C provides “an interface to system-dependent objects that is itself relatively system independent”. This feature is considered “high-level” in comparison of platform-specific assembly languages.

== Low-level programming in high-level languages ==
During the late 1960s and 1970s, high-level languages that included some degree of access to low-level programming functions, such as PL/S, BLISS, BCPL, extended ALGOL and NEWP (for Burroughs large systems/Unisys Clearpath MCP systems), and C, were introduced. One method for this is inline assembly, in which assembly code is embedded in a high-level language that supports this feature. Some of these languages also allow architecture-dependent compiler optimization directives to adjust the way a compiler uses the target processor architecture.

Furthermore, as referenced above, the following block of C is from the GNU Compiler and shows the inline assembly ability of C. Per the GCC documentation this is a simple copy and addition code. This code displays the interaction between a generally high level language like C and its middle/low level counter part Assembly. Although this may not make C a natively low level language these facilities express the interactions in a more direct way. 
int src = 1;
int dst; 

asm (&quot;mov %1, %0\n\t&quot;
 &quot;add $1, %0&quot;
 : &quot;=r&quot; (dst) 
 : &quot;r&quot; (src));

printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, dst);

<text>Saúl Gustavo Lisazo Oscoidi (; born June 1, 1956, in Los Toldos, province of Buenos Aires in Argentina) is an Argentine actor and ex-footballer.

==Biography==
Saúl Gustavo Lisazo Oscoidi is one of 6 siblings: Maria, Fernanda, Araceli, Alejandro, Mauricio, and Vanina. One event in his childhood that marked him was the death of his father when he only was 12 years old. Football is one of his passions; he started playing football with his father when he was a little boy and it grew to be his favorite sport and one that would take him to other countries around the world. In Spain, he met who would become the woman of his life, former model Mónica Viedma, whom he married. The pair has two kids, Paula, who was born on June 4, 1999, and Martin, born on November 11, 2003.

He played in Sarmiento for 10 years. He also played in Atlanta in Argentina, SK Beveren, where he won the Belgian League in 1979, and KV Mechelen in Belgium; and in Juventus from Brazil. Saúl had to leave the sport but he tried to play in Barcelona until an injury in his knee forced him to leave it completely. In 1983, he decided to become a model.

In 1988, he started studying dramatic arts in Spain, at the academy of the Argentine actress Cristina Rotta. After two and a half years of preparation he had his first opportunity, in the movie &quot;El Regreso a la Isla del Tesoro&quot;. During the early 1990s, Saúl flew to Mexico City, where he was the image of a very important liquor company which brought him international fame. Meanwhile, he acted in theater shows like &quot;La Fierecilla Domada&quot;, &quot;Tartufo,&quot; and others.

His first telenovela break came in 1990, when Mexican actress Lucía Méndez insisted that he be her partner in her new novela, &quot;Amor de Nadie&quot;, which became a major hit across Latin America. After that he started in other telenovelas, such as &quot;Acapulco, Cuerpo y Alma&quot;, and &quot;La Jaula de Oro&quot;, among others. He also was in productions such as Tenias que ser Tu, Prisionera de Amor.

<text>The River Tweed, or Tweed Water, , ), is a river long that flows east across the Border region in Scotland and northern England. Tweed cloth derives its name from its association with the River Tweed. The Tweed is one of the great salmon rivers of Britain and the only river in England where an Environment Agency rod licence is not required for angling. The river generates a large income for the local borders region, attracting anglers from all around the world.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Tweed&quot; may represent an Old Brittonic name meaning &quot;border&quot;. A doubtful proposal is that the name is derived from a non-Celtic form of the Indo-European root &quot;*teuha-&quot; meaning &quot;swell, grow powerful&quot;.

==Course==

The River Tweed flows primarily through the scenic Borders region of Scotland. Eastwards from the settlements on opposing banks of Birgham and Carham it forms the historic boundary between Scotland and England.

It rises in the Lowther Hills at Tweed&#x27;s Well near to where the Clyde, draining northwest ( from the Tweed&#x27;s Well), and the Annan draining south ( from the Tweed&#x27;s Well) also rise. &quot;Annan, Tweed and Clyde rise oot the ae hillside&quot; is a saying from the Border region. East of Kelso, it becomes a section of the eastern part of the border. Entering England, its lower reaches are in Northumberland, where it enters the North Sea at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

== Catchment ==
The river east of St Boswells runs through a drumlin field. It is the relic of a paleo-ice stream that flowed through the area during the last glaciation. Major towns through which the Tweed flows include Innerleithen, Peebles, Galashiels, Melrose, Kelso, Coldstream and Berwick-upon-Tweed, where it flows into the North Sea. Tweed tributaries include:
*Whiteadder Water
**Blackadder Water
*River Till
*Eden Water
*Teviot Water
*Leader Water
*Ettrick Water
**Yarrow Water
**Tima Water
*Gala Water
*Leithen Water
*Quair Water
*Eddleston Water
*Manor Water
*Lyne Water
*Holms Water

The upper parts of the catchment of the Tweed in Scotland form the area known as Tweeddale, part of which is protected as the Upper Tweeddale National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development.

==Management==




Despite that the catchment straddles the border between Scotland and England, management of it – in terms of water quality, bio-security, and ultimately protection of the salmon of the River Tweed – is overseen by a single body, the River Tweed Commission.

==River Tweed Trail==
, work is in progress on the development of a walking and cycling route following the length of the river from Moffat to Berwick-on-Tweed. The work includes new sections of path, upgrades to existing paths, bridge replacement and repairs, pedestrian road crossings, lighting and signage. The path is expected to be completed during 2028.

<doc id="189855" wikidata="Q312351" url="?curid=189855" title="Emperor Ninkō">
<text>Ayahito (16 March 1800 – 21 February 1846), posthumously honored as Emperor Ninkō, was the 120th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Ninkō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1817 until his death in 1846, and saw further deterioration of the power of the ruling &quot;Shōgun&quot;. Disasters, which included famine, combined with corruption and increasing Western interference, helped to erode public trust in the &quot;bakufu&quot; government. Emperor Ninkō revived certain court rituals and practices upon the wishes of his father. However, it is unknown what role, if any, the Emperor had in the turmoil which occurred during his reign.

His family included fifteen children from various concubines, but only three of them lived to adulthood. His fourth son, Imperial Prince Osahito became Emperor Kōmei upon Ninkō&#x27;s death in 1846. While political power at the time still resided with the &quot;Shōgun&quot;, the beginnings of the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; (end of military government) were at hand.

==Events of Ninkō&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Ninkō&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . He was born on 16 March 1800 and was the fourth son of Emperor Kōkaku. He was the only child of sixteen others to survive into adulthood. Ayahito was named as crown prince in 1809, having been adopted by his father&#x27;s chief wife , also known as . His birth mother was one of his father&#x27;s concubines named . 

===Reign===

Prince Ayahito was enthroned as Emperor on 31 October 1817, after his father retired from the throne. Following his father the Retired Emperor&#x27;s wishes, he attempted to revive certain court rituals and practices. These included, among other things, restoring the title &quot;tennō&quot;, which identified the Emperor. Among Ninkō&#x27;s innovations was the establishment of the &quot;Gakushūsho&quot; (the predecessor of the &quot;Gakushūin&quot;) for the Court Nobility just outside the Imperial Palace. One major event during his reign was the Tenpō famine which lasted from 1833 to 1837. The famine was most severe in northern Honshū and was caused by flooding and cold weather.

Ninkō&#x27;s reign also saw some deterioration of the Shōgun&#x27;s power. Damage from the Tenpō famine and other concurring natural disasters shook the faith of the people in the ruling Shōgun. In 1837, Ōshio Heihachirō led a revolt in Osaka against corrupt officials who refused to help feed the impoverished residents of the city. That same year also had an incident take place where an American merchant vessel was driven away by coastal artillery. While order was eventually restored, long term resentment resonated with the commoners against the ruling government. It is unclear though what role, if any, the Emperor played during this period of unrest.

Emperor Ninkō died on 21 February 1846 and was enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, , which is at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined in &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji are this Emperor&#x27;s immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi, Go-Momozono and Kōkaku. The shrine complex also encompasses the &quot;misasagi&quot; of Ninkō&#x27;s immediate successor – Kōmei. Empress Dowager Yoshikō is also entombed at this Imperial mausoleum complex.

==Eras and Kugyō==
The years of Ninkō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. While is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

The following eras occurred during Ninkō&#x27;s reign: 

* &quot;Bunka&quot; (1804–1818)
* &quot;Bunsei&quot; (1818–1830)
* &quot;Tenpō&quot; (1830–1844)
* &quot;Kōka&quot; (1844–1848)

During Ninkō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 

* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Tadayoshi, 1814–1823
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Masamichi, 1823–1856
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Genealogy==

Emperor Ninkō&#x27;s family included 7 sons and 8 daughters from various concubines, but only the future Emperor Komei (Komei&quot;-tennō&quot;), Princess Sumiko (Sumiko&quot;-naishinnō&quot;) and Princess Chikako (Chikako&quot;-naishinnō&quot;) survived beyond childhood.

<doc id="189857" wikidata="Q313806" url="?curid=189857" title="Emperor Kōkaku">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 119th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Kōkaku reigned from 1779 until his abdication in 1817 in favor of his son, Emperor Ninkō. After his abdication, he ruled as also known as a until his death in 1840. The next emperor to abdicate was Akihito, 202 years later.

Major events in Kōkaku&#x27;s life included an ongoing famine that affected Japan early into his rule. The response he gave during the time was welcomed by the people, and helped to undermine the shōgun&#x27;s authority. The Kansei Reforms came afterwards as a way for the shōgun to cure a range of perceived problems which had developed in the mid-18th century but was met with partial success.

A member of a cadet branch of the Imperial Family, Kōkaku is the founder of the dynastic imperial branch which currently sits on the throne. Kōkaku had one spouse during his lifetime, and six concubines who gave birth to 16 children. Only one son, Prince Ayahito, survived into adulthood and eventually became the next emperor. Genealogically, Kōkaku is the lineal ancestor of all the succeeding emperors up to the current emperor, Naruhito.

==Events of Kōkaku&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Kōkaku&#x27;s accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . He was the sixth son of Sukehito, Prince Kan&#x27;in, the second Prince Kan&#x27;in of the Kan&#x27;in-no-miya imperial collateral branch. As a younger son of a cadet branch, the Kan&#x27;in house, it was originally expected that Morohito would go into the priesthood at the Shugoin Temple. The situation changed in 1779 in the form of a problem as Emperor Go-Momozono was dying without an heir to the throne. In order to avoid a dynastic interregnum, the now-retired empress Go-Sakuramachi and the emperor&#x27;s chief adviser encouraged Go-Momozono to hastily adopt Prince Morohito. The adopted prince was the Emperor&#x27;s second cousin once removed in the biological male line. Go-Momozono died on 16 December 1779, and a year later Morohito acceded to the throne at age nine.

===As Emperor===
During his reign, Kōkaku attempted to re-assert some of the Imperial authority over the Shōgun (or bakufu). He undertook this by first implementing a relief program during the Great Tenmei famine, which not only highlighted the ineffectiveness of the bakufu in looking after its subjects, but also focused the subjects&#x27; attention back to the Imperial household. He also took an active interest in foreign affairs; keeping himself informed about the border dispute with Russia to the north, as well as keeping himself abreast of knowledge regarding foreign currency, both Chinese and European. The new era name of &quot;Tenmei&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;) was created to mark the enthronement of new Emperor. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; 11, on the 2nd day of the 4th month. In his first year of reign, Kōkaku was instrumental in reviving old ceremonies involving the old Imperial Court, as well as those performed at the Iwashimizu and Kamono shrines.

An analysis of silver currency in China and Japan &quot;Sin sen sen pou (Sin tchuan phou)&quot; was presented to the Emperor in 1782 by Kutsuki Masatsuna (1750–1802), also known as Kutsuki Oki-no kami Minamoto-no Masatsuna, hereditary &quot;daimyōs&quot; of Oki and Ōmi with holdings in Tanba and Fukuchiyama. Masatsuna published &quot;Seiyō senpu&quot; (&quot;Notes on Western Coinage&quot;) five years later, with plates showing European and colonial currency. Countrywide currency reforms later came after the Meiji Restoration when a new system was adopted around the Japanese yen. In 1786, former Empress Go-Sakuramachi engaged Go-Momozono&#x27;s only child (Princess Yoshiko) to the new emperor. Yoshiko formally became Empress consort to Emperor Kōkaku at age 15.

The Emperor and his court were forced to flee from a fire that consumed the city of Kyoto in 1788, the Imperial Palace was destroyed as a result. No other re-construction was permitted until a new palace was completed. The Dutch &quot;VOC&quot; &quot;Opperhoofd&quot; in Dejima noted in his official record book that &quot;people are considering it to be a great and extraordinary heavenly portent.&quot; The new era name of Kansei (meaning &quot;Tolerant Government&quot; or &quot;Broad-minded Government&quot;) was created in 1789 to mark a number of calamities including the devastating fire at the Imperial Palace. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in Tenmei 9, on the 25th day of the 1st month. During the same year, the emperor came into dispute with the Tokugawa shogunate about his intention to give the title of Abdicated Emperor (&quot;Daijō Tennō&quot;, 太上天皇) to his father, Prince Sukehito. This dispute was later called the &quot;&quot;Songo&quot; incident&quot; (the &quot;respectful title incident&quot;), and was resolved when the Bakufu gave his father the honorary title of &quot;Retired Emperor&quot;.

Two more eras would follow during Kōkaku&#x27;s reign, on 5 February 1801 a new era name (Kyōwa) was created because of the belief that the 58th year of every cycle of the Chinese zodiac brings great changes. Three years later the new era name of Bunka (meaning &quot;Culture&quot; or &quot;Civilization&quot;) was created to mark the start of a new 60-year cycle of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch system of the Chinese calendar which was on New Year&#x27;s Day. During this year, Daigaku-no-kami Hayashi Jussai (1768–1841) explained the shogunate foreign policy to Emperor Kōkaku in Kyoto. The rest of Kōkaku&#x27;s reign was quiet aside from two 6.6m earthquakes which struck Honshū in the years 1810 and 1812. The effects on the population from these earthquakes (if any) is unknown.

===Kansei Reforms===
The were a series of reactionary policy changes and edicts which were intended to cure a range of perceived problems which had developed in mid-18th-century Tokugawa Japan. Kansei refers to the &quot;nengō&quot; (or Japanese era name) that spanned the years from 1789 through 1801 (after &quot;&quot;Tenmei&quot; and before &quot;Kyōwa&quot;&quot;); with the reforms occurring during the Kansei period but between the years 1787–1793. In the end, the shogunate&#x27;s interventions were only partly successful. Intervening factors like famine, floods and other disasters exacerbated some of the conditions which the &quot;shōgun&quot; intended to ameliorate.

Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759–1829) was named the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s chief councilor (&quot;rōjū&quot;) in the summer of 1787; and early in the next year, he became the regent for the 11th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Ienari. As the chief administrative decision-maker in the bakufu hierarchy, he was in a position to effect radical change; and his initial actions represented an aggressive break with the recent past. Sadanobu&#x27;s efforts were focused on strengthening the government by reversing many of the policies and practices which had become commonplace under the regime of the previous &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Ieharu. Sadanobu increased the bakufu&#x27;s rice reserves and required daimyos to do the same. He reduced expenditures in cities, set aside reserves for future famines, and encouraged peasants in cities to go back to the countryside. He tried to institute policies that promoted morality and frugality, such as prohibiting extravagant activities in the countryside and curbing unlicensed prostitution in the cities. Sadanobu also cancelled some debts owed by daimyos to the merchants.

These reform policies could be interpreted as a reactionary response to the excesses of his rōjū predecessor, Tanuma Okitsugu (1719–1788). The result was that the Tanuma-initiated, liberalizing reforms within the &quot;bakufu&quot; and the relaxation of &quot;sakoku&quot; (Japan&#x27;s &quot;closed-door&quot; policy of strict control of foreign merchants) were reversed or blocked. Education policy was changed through the Kansei Edict (寛政異学の禁 &quot;kansei igaku no kin&quot;) of 1790 which enforced teaching of the Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi as the official Confucian philosophy of Japan. The decree banned certain publications and enjoined strict observance of Neo-Confucian doctrine, especially with regard to the curriculum of the official Hayashi school.

This reform movement was related to three others during the Edo period: the Kyōhō reforms (1722–1730), the Tenpō reforms (1841–1843) and the Keiō reforms (1864–1867).

===Abdication and death===
In 1817, Kōkaku abdicated in favor of his son, Emperor Ninkō. In the two centuries before Kōkaku&#x27;s reign most Emperors died young or were forced to abdicate. Kōkaku was the first Japanese monarch to remain on the throne past the age of 40 since the abdication of Emperor Ōgimachi in 1586. Until the abdication of Emperor Akihito in 2019, he was the last emperor to rule as a Jōkō (上皇), an emperor who abdicated in favor of a successor. Kōkaku travelled in procession to Sento Imperial Palace, a palace of an abdicated emperor. The Sento Palace at that time was called Sakura Machi Palace. It had been built by the Tokugawa shogunate for former-Emperor Go-Mizunoo.

After Kōkaku&#x27;s death in 1840, he was enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, , which is at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined in &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi&quot;, at Sennyū-ji are this emperor&#x27;s immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono. This mausoleum complex also includes &quot;misasagi&quot; for Kōkaku&#x27;s immediate successors – Ninkō and Kōmei. Empress Dowager Yoshikō is also entombed at this Imperial mausoleum complex.

==Eras and Kugyō==
The following years of Kōkaku&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. 
* &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; (1772–1781)
* &quot;Tenmei&quot; (1781–1789)
* &quot;Kansei&quot; (1789–1801)
* &quot;Kyōwa&quot; (1801–1804)
* &quot;Bunka&quot; (1804–1818)

 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Kōkaku&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Kujō Naozane, 1779–1785
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Kujō Naozane, 1785–1787
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Sukehira, 1787–1791
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Teruyoshi, 1791–1795
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Masahiro, 1795–1814
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Tadayoshi, 1814–1823

==Genealogy== 
===Spouse===

Yoshiko was the only child of former emperor Go-Momozono. She formally became Empress consort (&quot;chūgū&quot;) to Emperor Kōkaku at age 15 after she was engaged to the new emperor by former empress Go-Sakuramachi. The couple had two sons but both died before reaching adulthood. Yoshiko eventually functioned as an official mother to the heir who would become Emperor Ninkō. In 1816, Emperor Ninkō granted Empress Yoshiko the title of Empress Dowager after Emperor Kōkaku abdicated. She later became a Buddhist nun after her husband died, and changed her name to in 1841.

===Concubines===
===Issue=== 
Emperor Kōkaku fathered a total of 16 children (8 sons and 8 daughters) but only one of them survived into adulthood. The sole surviving child (Prince Ayahito) later became Emperor Ninkō when Kōkaku abdicated the throne.

<text>Intolerance is a 1916 epic anthology silent film directed by D. W. Griffith. Subtitled as &quot;Love&#x27;s Struggle Throughout the Ages&quot; and &quot;A Sun-Play of the Ages&quot;, the three-and-a-half-hour epic intercuts four parallel storylines, each separated by several centuries: first, a contemporary melodrama of crime and redemption; second, a Biblical story: Christ&#x27;s mission and death; third, a French story: the events surrounding the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of 1572; and fourth, a Babylonian story: the fall of the Babylonian Empire to Persia in 539 BC. Each story had its own distinctive color tint in the original print. The scenes are linked by shots of a figure representing Eternal Motherhood, rocking a cradle.

Griffith chose to explore the theme of intolerance partly in response to his previous film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) being derided by the NAACP and others for perpetuating and supporting racial stereotypes and glorifying the Ku Klux Klan. &quot;Intolerance&quot; was not, however, an apology, as Griffith felt he had nothing to apologize for; in numerous interviews, Griffith made clear that the film was a rebuttal to his critics and he felt that they were, in fact, the intolerant ones. In the years following its release, &quot;Intolerance&quot; strongly influenced European film movements and is regarded as one of the most influential films of the silent era. In 1958, the film was voted number 7 in the World Expo film poll. In 1989, it was one of the first films to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

== Storylines ==

The film consists of four distinct, but parallel, stories—intercut with increasing frequency as the film builds to a climax—that demonstrate mankind’s persistent intolerance throughout the ages. The timeline covers approximately 2,500 years.

# The ancient &quot;Babylonian&quot; story (539 BC) depicts the conflict between Prince Belshazzar of Babylon and Cyrus the Great of Persia. The fall of Babylon is a result of intolerance arising from a conflict between devotees of two rival Babylonian gods—Bel-Marduk and Ishtar.
# The Biblical &quot;Judean&quot; story (c. AD 27) recounts how—after the Wedding at Cana and the Woman Taken in Adultery—intolerance led to the Crucifixion of Jesus. This sequence is the shortest of the four.
# The Renaissance &quot;French&quot; story (1572) tells of the religious intolerance that led to the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre of Protestant Huguenots fomented by the Catholic Royal House of Valois.
# The American &quot;Modern&quot; story (c. 1914) demonstrates how crime, moral puritanism, and conflicts between ruthless capitalists and striking workers help ruin the lives of marginalized Americans. To get more money for his spinster sister&#x27;s charities, a mill owner orders a 10% pay cut to his workers&#x27; wages. An ensuing workers&#x27; strike is crushed and The Boy and The Dear One make their way to another city; she lives in poverty and he turns to crime. After they marry, he tries to break free of crime but is framed for theft by his ex-boss. While he is in prison, his wife must endure their child being taken away by the same &quot;moral uplift society&quot; that instigated the strike. Upon his release from prison, he discovers his ex-boss attempting to rape his wife. A struggle begins and in the confusion the girlfriend of the boss shoots and kills the boss. She escapes and The Boy is convicted and sentenced to the gallows. A kindly policeman helps The Dear One find the real killer and together they try to reach the Governor in time so her reformed husband will not be hanged.

Breaks between differing time periods are marked by the symbolic image of a mother rocking a cradle, representing the passing of generations. The film simultaneously cross-cuts back and forth and interweaves the segments over great gaps of space and time, with over 50 transitions between the segments. One of the unusual characteristics of the film is that many of the characters do not have names. Griffith wished them to be emblematic of human types. Thus, the central female character in the modern story is called The Dear One, her young husband is called The Boy, and the leader of the local Mafia is called The Musketeer of the Slums. Critics and film theorists maintain that these names reveal Griffith&#x27;s sentimentalism, which was already hinted at in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, with names such as The Little Colonel.

== Production ==


&quot;Intolerance&quot; was a colossal undertaking featuring monumental sets, lavish period costumes, and more than 3,000 extras. The lot on Sunset Boulevard featured a Babylon set with tall walls as well as streets of Judea and medieval France. The total payroll for extras was reported to have reached $12,000 daily. Griffith began shooting the film with the Modern Story (originally titled &quot;The Mother and the Law&quot;), whose planning predated the great commercial success of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. He then greatly expanded it to include the other three parallel stories under the theme of intolerance. Three hundred thousand feet of film were shot.

The total cost of producing &quot;Intolerance&quot; was reported to be close to $2 million including $250,000 for the Belshazzar feast scene alone, an astronomical sum in 1916, but accounts for the film show the exact cost to be $385,906.77. A third of the budget went into making the Babylonian segments of the film.

== Reception ==

&quot;Intolerance&quot; was met with an enthusiastic reception from film critics upon its premiere. Scholar Frank Beaver argues that &quot;Griffith&#x27;s intended message in &quot;Intolerance&quot; was not lost on reviewers&quot;, noting that in &quot;The San Francisco Bulletin&quot; a contemporary critic declared, &quot;Griffith&#x27;s film comes powerfully to strengthen the hand of the believers in love.&quot; Although &quot;Intolerance&quot; was a commercial failure upon its initial release, it has since received very positive reviews and later gained popularity. It has been called &quot;the only film fugue&quot;. Theodore Huff, one of the leading film critics of the first half of the 20th century, believed that it was the only motion picture worthy of taking its place alongside Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling paintings, etc., as a separate and central artistic contribution.

&quot;Intolerance&quot; was shown out of competition at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. In 1989, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, the first year of voting. In 2007, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) ranked &quot;Intolerance&quot; as the 49th best American film of all time. 

Pauline Kael considered &quot;Intolerance&quot; the greatest film ever made: &quot;&quot;Intolerance&quot; is one of the two or three most influential movies ever made, and I think it is also the greatest.&quot; Half-a-century later, Armond White concurs, writing, &quot;A century later we are as close to its subject as we are distant from its art.&quot;

David Thomson argued that the film&#x27;s impact is weakened by its &quot;self-destructive frenzy&quot;, adding that &quot;The cross-cutting, self-interrupting format is wearisome. [...] The sheer pretension is a roadblock, and one longs for the &quot;Modern Story&quot; to hold the screen. [...] Anyone concerned with film history has to see &quot;Intolerance&quot;, and pass on.&quot;

The film has been widely reported to have been a box office bomb, but this is a myth attributed to its misreported budget. Even though up to that time it was the most expensive American film made and grossed far less than &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, it earned approximately $1.75 million for its backers, a respectable performance and enough to recoup its budget.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Values&quot;.

== Influence ==

&quot;Intolerance&quot; and its unorthodox editing were enormously influential, particularly among European and Soviet filmmakers. Many of the numerous assistant directors Griffith employed in making the film—Erich von Stroheim, Tod Browning, Woody Van Dyke—went on to become important and noted Hollywood directors in subsequent years.

The film was parodied by Buster Keaton in &quot;Three Ages&quot; (1923).

In 1954, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art held a screening of the 1916 film, with organist Vernon Geyer performing the original score.

The 1987 Taviani brothers film Good Morning, Babylon takes place on the set of Intolerance.

&quot;Intolerance&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Babylon&quot; set is a feature location in the 2011 video game &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, even though the game is set in 1947 and the Babylon set was torn down before this date.

== Versions ==

&quot;Intolerance&quot; is now in the public domain. There are currently four major versions of the film in circulation on home video.

# The Killiam Shows Version – Taken from a third-generation 16 millimeter print, this version contains an organ score by Gaylord Carter. Running approximately 176 minutes, it is the version that has been the most widely seen in recent years. It has been released on LaserDisc and DVD by Image Entertainment and is the most complete version currently available on home video, if not the longest.
# The Official Thames Silents Restoration – In 1989 this film was given a formal restoration by film preservationists Kevin Brownlow and David Gill. This version, also running 177 minutes, was prepared by Thames Television from original 35 millimeter material, and its tones and tints were restored per Griffith&#x27;s original intent. It also has a digitally recorded orchestral score by Carl Davis. It was released the same year on VHS in the US by HBO Video, then went out of print. This version is part of the Rohauer Collection. The Rohauer company worked in association with Thames on the restoration. It was given a further digital restoration by Cohen Media Group (which currently serves as keeper of the Rohauer library, and is the copyright holder on this restored version), and was reissued to select theatres, as well as on DVD and Blu-ray, in 2013. It is distributed under the Masters of Cinema label in Europe. While not as complete as the Killiam Shows Version, this print contains footage not found on that particular print.
# The Kino Version – Pieced together in 2002 by Kino International, this version, taken from 35 millimeter material, is transferred at a slower frame rate than the Killiam Shows and Rohauer prints, resulting in a longer running time of 197 minutes. It contains a synthetic orchestral score by Joseph Turrin. An alternative &quot;happy ending&quot; to the &quot;Fall of Babylon&quot; sequence, showing the Mountain Girl surviving and re-united with the Rhapsode, is included on the DVD as a supplement. Despite the longer runtime, this version is less complete than the Killiam Shows and Rohauer prints.
# The Restored Digital Cinema Version – Restoration conducted by ZZ Productions in collaboration with the Danish Film Institute and Arte France of the version shown at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London on April 7, 1917. This version runs approximately 177 minutes, and premiered at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 2007, and on arte on October 4, 2007.

A further extensive 1989 restoration was a collaboration between silent film composer-conductor Gillian Anderson, the Museum of Modern Art and the Library of Congress. It is somewhat controversial but perhaps the most accurate to date; however, it is unavailable on home video.

There are other budget/public domain video and DVD versions of this film released by different companies, each with varying degrees of picture quality depending on the source that was used. Most are of poor picture quality, but even the restored 35 millimeter versions exhibit considerable film damage.

The Internet Movie Database lists the standard running time as 163 minutes, which is the running length of the DVD released by &quot;Public Domain Flicks&quot;. The Delta DVD released in Region 1 as &quot;Intolerance: A Sun Play of the Ages&quot; and in Region 2 as &quot;Intolerance: Love&#x27;s Struggle Throughout the Ages&quot; clocks in at 167 minutes. The version available for free viewing on the Internet Movie Archive is the Killiam restoration.

Cameraman Karl Brown remembered a scene with the various members of the Babylonian harem that featured full frontal nudity. He was barred from the set that day, apparently because he was so young. While there are several shots of slaves and harem girls throughout the film (which were shot by another director without Griffith&#x27;s involvement), the scene that Brown describes is not in any surviving versions.

It is also known that a major segment of the Renaissance &quot;French&quot; story, involving the attempted assassination of the Admiral Coligny, was cut before the film&#x27;s release.

Film historian Kevin Brownlow has written that, when Griffith re-released &quot;The Modern Story&quot; separately as &quot;The Mother and the Law&quot; in 1919, he softened in the film, due to the First Red Scare that year. &quot;He was obliged to put this title in the strike sequence: &#x27;The militiamen having used blank cartridges, the workmen now fear only the company guards. In fact, &quot;machine guns could not operate with blank cartridges at this period&quot;, Brownlow noted.

<text>Amblypygi is an order of arachnids also known as whip-spiders or tailless whip-scorpions, not to be confused with whip-scorpions or vinegaroons that belong to the related order Thelyphonida. The name &quot;amblypygid&quot; means &quot;blunt tail&quot;, a reference to a lack of the flagellum that is otherwise seen in whip-scorpions. Amblypygids possess no silk glands or venom. They rarely bite if threatened but can grab fingers with their pedipalps, resulting in thorn-like puncture-injuries.

As of 2023, five families, 17 genera, and around 260 species had been discovered and described. They are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, mainly in warm and humid environments. They like to stay protected and hidden within leaf litter, caves, or underneath bark. Some species are subterranean; all are nocturnal. Fossilized amblypygids have been found dating back to the Carboniferous period, such as &quot;Weygoldtina&quot;.

==Description==

===Body-plan===
Being arachnids, Amblypygi possess two body-segments; the prosoma and the opisthosoma (often referred to as the cephalothorax and abdomen), four pairs of legs, pedipalps, and chelicerae. Their bodies are broad and highly flattened, with a solid prosoma and a segmented opisthosoma.

Amblypygids range from in legspan. Most species have eight eyes; a pair of median eyes at the front of the carapace above the chelicerae and 2 smaller clusters of three eyes each further back on each side.

The first pair of legs act as sensory organs and are not used for walking. The sensory legs are very thin and elongated, have numerous sensory receptors, and can extend several times the length of the body.

====Pedipalps====
Amblypygids have raptorial pedipalps modified for grabbing and retaining prey, much like the forelegs of mantisses. The pedipalps are generally covered in spines, used for impaling and capturing prey. They are kept folded in front of the prosoma when not in use. Recent work suggests that the pedipalps display sexual dimorphism in their size and shape.

Pedipalp anatomy varies strongly with species, with configurations often conforming to a particular style of prey capture. The pedipalps of some genera such as Euphrynicus are extremely long, and free of spines until near the extreme distal end of the appendage.

====Exoskeleton====
Whip-spiders are covered with a layer of a solidified secretion that forms a super-hydrophobic coating. Studies on the spotted tailless whip-scorpion also show their exoskeleton is enriched with several trace-elements, including calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, sodium, and zinc, which tends to accumulate as the individual gets older. The same trace-elements are also present in the exoskeleton of the other members of Tetrapulmonata.

==Behavior==

Amblypygids have eight legs, but use only six for walking, often in a crab-like, sideways fashion. The front pair of legs are modified for use as antennae-like feelers, with many fine segments giving the appearance of a &quot;whip&quot;. When a suitable prey is located with the antenniform legs, the amblypygid seizes its victim with large spines on the grasping pedipalps, impaling and immobilizing the prey. This is typically done while climbing the side of a vertical surface and looking downward at their prey. 

Pincer-like chelicerae then work to grind and chew the prey prior to ingestion. The tailless whip scorpion may go for over a month in which no food is eaten. Often this is due to pre-molt. Due to the lack of venom the tailless whip scorpion is very nervous in temperament, retreating away if any dangerous threat is sensed by the animal.
Courtship involves the male depositing stalked spermatophores, which have one or more sperm masses at the tip, onto the ground, and using his pedipalps to guide the female over them. She gathers the sperm and lays fertilized eggs into a sac carried under the abdomen, or opisthosoma. When the young hatch, they climb up onto the mother&#x27;s back; any which fall off before their first molt will not survive.

Some species of amblypygids, particularly &quot;Phrynus marginemaculatus&quot; and &quot;Damon diadema&quot;, may be among the few examples of arachnids that exhibit social behavior. Research conducted at Cornell University suggests that mother amblypygids communicate with their young with her antenniform front-legs, and the offspring reciprocate both with their mother and siblings. The ultimate function of this social behavior remains unknown. Amblypygids hold territories that they defend from other individuals.

The amblypygid diet mostly consists of arthropod prey, but these opportunistic predators have also been observed feeding on vertebrates. Amblypygids generally do not feed for a period of time before, during, and after molting. Like other arachnids, an amblypygid will molt several times during its life. Molting is done while hanging from the underside of a horizontal surface in order to use gravity to assist in separating the old exoskeleton from the animal.

==As pets==
Several genera of Amblypygi are sold and kept as pets, including &quot;Acanthophrynus&quot;, &quot;Charinus,&quot; &quot;Charon,&quot; &quot;Damon, Euphrynichus,&quot; &quot;Heterophrynus&quot;, &quot;Phrynus&quot;, &quot;Paraphrynus&quot;, and &quot;Phrynichus&quot;. Tailless whip-scorpions are kept in tall enclosures with arboreal climbing surfaces to allow for two things: Enough vertical space for climbing and molting, and enough space for heat to dissipate in order to keep the enclosure between and . of substrate at the bottom of the enclosure is generally sufficient to allow for burrowing and also serves as a method to retain water in order to keep the humidity above 75%. Tailless whip-scorpions live anywhere between 5 and 10 years. Feeding can include small insects such as crickets, mealworms, and roaches.

<doc id="189874" wikidata="Q1390978" url="?curid=189874" title="Kent Hovind">
<text>Kent E. Hovind (born January 15, 1953) is an American Christian fundamentalist evangelist and convicted tax evader. His young Earth creationist ministry focuses on denial of received scientific knowledge in the fields of biology (evolution and abiogenesis), geophysics, and cosmology in favor of a literalist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative found in the Bible. Hovind&#x27;s views, which combine elements of creation science and conspiracy theory, are dismissed by the scientific community as fringe theory and pseudo-scholarship. Answers in Genesis openly criticized him for continued use of discredited arguments abandoned by others in the movement.

Hovind established Creation Science Evangelism (CSE) in 1989 and Dinosaur Adventure Land in 2001 in Pensacola, Florida. He frequently spoke on Young Earth creationism in schools, churches, debates, and on radio and television broadcasts. His son Eric Hovind took over operation of CSE after Hovind began serving a ten-year prison sentence in January 2007 for federal convictions for failing to pay taxes, obstructing federal agents, and structuring cash transactions. In September 2021, Hovind was convicted of domestic violence against his estranged wife.

== Biography ==
At the age of 16, Hovind became a born-again Christian within the Independent Fundamental Baptist church.

In 1971, he graduated from East Peoria Community High School in East Peoria, Illinois. He entered Illinois Central College and then transferred to the unaccredited Midwestern Baptist College in 1972, attaining a Bachelor of Religious Education in 1974.

He married his wife Jo in 1973 and they had three children between 1977 and 1979. Between 1975 and 1988, Hovind served as an assistant pastor and teacher at three private Baptist schools, including one he started.

In 1989, the family moved to Pensacola, Florida, where Jo attended (then unaccredited) Pensacola Christian College and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music and master&#x27;s degrees in music and sacred music.

In 1998, Hovind created his &quot;Dr. Dino&quot; web site and began producing articles and selling video tapes, books, and fossil replicas. Prior to his incarceration, Hovind had numerous speaking engagements (around 700 in 2004) at churches, private schools, and other venues each year, in addition to hosting a daily internet radio talk show and establishing &quot;Dinosaur Adventure Land&quot; in Pensacola, Florida. In 1999, his son Eric Hovind began traveling to present his arguments and seminars. Kent and Jo divorced in 2016.

In 1988 and 1991 respectively, Hovind received a master&#x27;s degree and doctorate in Christian Education through correspondence from (also unaccredited) Patriot University, then in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Patriot University is a diploma mill.

Having a website called &quot;Dr. Dino&quot; has provoked some academics to look closely at how Hovind presents his education and credentials. All his known degrees are from unaccredited institutions, and he has no training in paleontology. Barbara Forrest, a professor of philosophy, expert on the history of creationism and activist in the creation–evolution controversy, wrote that Hovind&#x27;s lack of training makes academic discussion impossible and has said that his understanding of historical and scientific research is deficient. Karen Bartelt, an organic chemistry professor who debated Hovind, examined Hovind&#x27;s dissertation and found it is incomplete, contains numerous spelling errors, lacks references, shows flawed reasoning, and states that it does not present any original research.

=== Creation Science Evangelism and Creation Today ===
Hovind established Creation Science Evangelism in 1989 to evangelize and teach creationism. In May 1999, his son Eric joined Creation Science Evangelism as a speaker, and his daughter Marlissa began training to become Hovind&#x27;s secretary. That year, CSE merged with Faith Baptist Fellowship of Hawthorne, Florida, beginning a relationship that lasted until 2002. In 2003, with the aid of Glenn Stoll (a promoter of tax-avoidance schemes), Hovind set up a series of entities starting with &quot;an unincorporated association of pure trust&quot; on May 13, under which a corporation sole and several ministerial trusts were established starting on May 23. CSE properties were conveyed to the trusts which operated under business licenses from the &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;.

Hovind is associated with the Unregistered Baptist Fellowship (UBF), a loosely affiliated group of roughly 100 churches which share a &quot;theology of Christian resistance&quot; to civil governments. Because the UBF would consider it an acknowledgement of government authority over the church, they reject the highly favorable 501(c)(3) status, which makes donations tax deductible and exempts them from income tax, but not FICA taxes or employee income tax withholding. The UBF holds that governmental authority stops &quot;at the threshold of the church&quot;, and Hovind has likened his ministry&#x27;s status to that of the Vatican City State. When the federal government obtained a search warrant in 2004, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigator made the sworn statement that the organization did not have a business license and did not have tax-exempt status.

Hovind was convicted of 58 felony counts in November 2006 and sentenced to ten years in prison in January 2007; Eric Hovind took over Creation Science Evangelism. In July 2007, God Quest Inc. was incorporated with Eric Hovind as president, and that November, God Quest Inc. filed in Florida to do business under the trade name Creation Science Evangelism. In June 2008, Eric announced that the CSE website would incorporate the CSE blog and change format allowing for &quot;only positive comments&quot; about Hovind and CSE, and in late 2011, Creation Science Evangelism&#x27;s &quot;DrDino.com&quot; website was redirected to &quot;CreationToday.org&quot;. The new website announced &quot;Creation Today is a ministry of God Quest, Inc.&quot; with focus on &quot;creation, apologetics and evangelism.&quot;

=== Dinosaur Adventure Land ===


In 2001, Hovind started Dinosaur Adventure Land, a young Earth creationist theme park located behind Hovind&#x27;s home in Pensacola. With the slogan, &quot;Where Dinosaurs and the Bible meet!&quot;, the facility on roughly had an indoor &quot;Science Center&quot; and an outdoor space with a variety of simple dinosaur-themed rides and activities, each of which was tied to some religious message. For example, the &quot;Jumpasaurus&quot; was a trampoline next to a basketball hoop; children would have one minute to make as many baskets as they could, and the message was that one has to be coordinated to do more for Jesus. Annual attendance was 38,000. The park depicted humans and dinosaurs co-existing in the last 4,000–6,000 years and also contains a depiction of the Loch Ness Monster. The Southern Poverty Law Center said the park also &quot;claims that a few small dinosaurs still roam the planet&quot;. A 2004 &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; article discussed a visit to Hovind&#x27;s dinosaur theme park and concluded that the park is &quot;deceptive on many levels&quot;. In &quot;Reports of the National Center for Science Education&quot;, George Allan Alderman described it as &quot;essentially a playground with a few exhibits, several fiberglass dinosaurs, a climbing wall, and a couple of buildings.&quot; He summarized it as &quot;shabby&quot;.

The venture encountered legal issues when the owners did not get a building permit in 2002 (see below). In April 2006, Escambia County officials closed the building in question. In July 2009, the courts ruled that the properties could be seized and sold to satisfy Hovind&#x27;s criminal penalties (see below). Another Florida ministry theme park, the Holy Land Experience, successfully lobbied for a property tax exemption law for parks &quot;used to exhibit, illustrate, and interpret biblical manuscripts&quot; in 2006; Dinosaur Adventure Land, which was not a 501(c)(3) organization, failed to have the law expanded to be included. Eric Hovind kept the park and CSE operating throughout 2008, but in July 2009, a judge allowed the government seizure to proceed. In August 2009, Dinosaur Adventure Land&#x27;s website announced it was closed, and CSE announced its re-opening as the &quot;Creation Store&quot; in November 2010.

In April 2016, Hovind discussed plans for a new Dinosaur Adventure Land, which included an 80-foot-tall model dinosaur that would be the largest in the state, with commissioners in Conecuh County, Alabama. A supporter donated a parcel of land in Lenox, Alabama, a former gravel pit. Volunteers started work by June 2016, and it opened in April 2018. , total attendance had exceeded 1,000, according to Hovind. Dinosaur Adventure Land is operated by a 501(c)(3) organization, Creation Science Evangelism Ministries Inc. Its revenue streams are donations, book and DVD sales, and YouTube advertising. There is no admission charge and it operates without liability insurance. Facilities include a science center, a campground, a four-wheeler park, and church services including baptisms.

On March 15, 2020, a seven-year-old boy drowned at the park.

== Creationism ==

=== The Hovind Theory ===
Hovind presented a version of young Earth creationism he calls the &quot;Hovind Theory&quot; in lectures and in the book &quot;Unmasking the False Religion of Evolution&quot;. The Hovind Theory is entirely rejected in the scientific community, and its plausibility has even been criticized by other young Earth creationists.

In Hovind&#x27;s narrative, dinosaurs and humans coexisted and &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; was a vegetarian prior to the fall of man. Hovind expands upon the late 19th- and early 20th-century vapor canopy concept of a protective shield that made Earth a relative paradise between the expulsion from Paradise and Noah&#x27;s flood. The flood is expressed as a function of natural rather than miraculous processes. Noah&#x27;s family and two of every kind of animal (including dinosaurs, which fit because babies were taken aboard and conditions allowed larger humans, making the ark&#x27;s size, based on cubits, larger) boarded Noah&#x27;s Ark before an ice meteor impacted the Earth. Fragments from the meteor caused planetary rings and impact craters on the moon and other solar system bodies. The remainder were drawn to the North and South Poles by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field as cataclysmic snowfall which buried the mammoths standing up. The ice on the poles cracked the Earth&#x27;s crust, releasing the &quot;fountains of the deep&quot;. According to Hovind, these events caused an ice age, and made the Earth wobble around, collapsing the vapor canopy that protected it.

In the next few months of the flood, the dead animals and plants were buried, and became oil, coal, and fossils. The last months of the flood included geological instability, when the plates shifted, forming ocean basins and mountain ranges. The Grand Canyon was formed in a couple of weeks during this time.

=== Criticism from creationists ===
In a rare case of open dissent within the movement over the substance of creation science, Answers in Genesis (AiG) published a 2002 position paper titled: &quot;Arguments we think creationists should NOT use&quot;. After Hovind issued a point-by-point rebuttal, Carl Wieland, Ken Ham, and Jonathan Sarfati of AiG wrote that the claims made by Hovind were &quot;fraudulent&quot; and contained &quot;mistakes in facts and logic which do the creationist cause no good.&quot; In particular, AiG criticized Hovind for &quot;persistently us[ing] discredited or false arguments&quot; as well as &quot;fraudulent claims&quot; from Ron Wyatt, and described one of Hovind&#x27;s claims as &quot;self-refuting&quot;. Rancorous disagreements resulted in AiG splitting into U.S. and Australian chapters in 2005. The Australian branch, renamed Creation Ministries International (CMI), maintained content critical of Hovind on their website, while the U.S. branch, led by Ken Ham, removed it. In 2009, CMI said that they had relaxed their stance because CSE&#x27;s revamped website had removed some of Hovind&#x27;s claims to which they objected.

Greg Neyman, an old-Earth creationist who runs the Old Earth Ministries website (renamed from Answers in Creation), writes that Hovind&#x27;s articles about humans and dinosaurs coexisting are unsupported by evidence and that they &quot;embarrass the young earth creation science community as a whole&quot;.

To the Orthodox Jewish creationist, Hovind&#x27;s approach relies upon a strict literal reading of the King James translation. Where Jews interpret the Hebrew through Talmud and Midrash, Hovind relies on a direct reading of English. For example, Hovind claims that the word &quot;dinosaur&quot;, which was introduced to English in 1841, refers to what previously had been called &quot;dragon&quot;. Dragon is used where &quot;tannin&quot; () appears, but it means &quot;serpent&quot; or &quot;crocodile&quot;.

=== Anti-evolution claims ===
Hovind contends that &quot;Darwinism&quot; produced &quot;Communism, Socialism, Nazism, abortion, liberalism and the New Age Movement&quot;. He blamed the forced Cherokee resettlement on a belief in evolution, although the Trail of Tears preceded &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the book which first presents the theory of evolution by natural selection, by roughly two decades. Hovind maintains that biology textbooks are lying in order to brainwash youth. He said, &quot;Satan is using evolution theory to make kids go to hell.&quot; Hovind claims he is not trying to eliminate evolution from schools, but says &quot;schools should teach both viewpoints.&quot; Hovind said that in order to forge &quot;missing link&quot; transitional fossils to support human evolution, the Smithsonian Institution has 33,000 sets of human remains in its basement, some taken alive (murder). In an interview prior to speaking at Kent State University, Hovind said &quot;You should have another rebellion here at Kent State and do it for the right reason,&quot; the reason being protesting evolution and referred to the Kent State shootings when he added, &quot;This time, don&#x27;t get shot.&quot;

In the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, Hovind published and co-authored &quot;Claws, Jaws, and Dinosaurs&quot; with William Gibbons, another Creationist who has searched for dinosaurs in the Congo under the belief that discovering a cryptid would somehow undermine evolutionary theory and that dinosaurs were dragons. Dinosaur Adventure Land had displays about the existence of the Loch Ness Monster and &quot;Beowulf&quot; as history rather than legend.

=== Debates ===
Prior to his convictions, Hovind was a prolific debater. While Hovind campaigns against evolution, the level of support for evolution is essentially universal within the scientific community and academia; support for creationism is minimal among scientists in general, and virtually nonexistent among those in the following fields: biology, paleontology, geology, &quot;etc&quot;. C. A. Chinn and L. A. Buckland classify his debate style, common among Young Earth Creationists, as eristic: focused on winning by rhetoric rather than illuminating by careful examination of evidence.

In 1993, Hovind announced that he would debate the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, who had a longstanding opposition to debating Creationists and had turned down numerous challenges. When contacted about the announcement, Gould said he had never heard of Hovind, much less agreed to debate.

In May 2004, Michael Shermer debated Hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience. Shermer claimed the exchange was &quot;not an intellectual exercise&quot;, but rather &quot;an emotional drama&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion.&quot; Massimo Pigliucci also debated Hovind, and expressed surprise at Hovind&#x27;s ignorance of evolutionary theory. Pigliucci recalled Hovind tried &quot;to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks&quot; and subsequently &quot;evolved from bananas.&quot; William Reville, Director of Microscopy at University College Cork, wrote that Hovind&#x27;s ideas are not rational or scientific because they are not testable. Hovind has repeatedly declined offers for written debates where his claims would be scrutinized by scientists, including his decline of a debate offer from Dave Thomas.

During a debate with Farrell Till, Hovind said that Donald Johanson had uncovered the leg bones of Lucy at a different site over a mile away from the reported site, in a deeper stratum, quipping, &quot;I would like to know how fast the train was going that hit that chimpanzee.&quot; This was clearly contrary to the published statements by Johanson. After Hovind had been informed in 1993 that his statement was false, he agreed to stop using the claim. When he repeated the claim in 1995, he once more agreed he was in error.

=== $250,000 offer ===
In 1990, Hovind made a $10,000 offer to anyone who could meet a set of requirements he said would prove evolution, and he later raised the amount to $250,000. In 2007, Creation Science Evangelism removed the offer from its website.

The premises of Hovind&#x27;s offer have been rejected both by scientists and fellow creationists as fundamentally flawed. Hovind&#x27;s conditions would require a claimant not only to prove the theory of evolution, but also abiogenesis, astrophysics and cosmology, and additionally prove that no gods could possibly exist. The judges would be hand-picked without assurances that they would be unbiased or qualified to assess the merit of claims, and it is possible that no panel was convened when a claim was submitted. Some forms of evidence would be excluded prior to judging.

Answers in Genesis dismissed the challenge as a gimmick. A 2005 challenge on &quot;Boing Boing&quot; offered $250,000 to anyone who could prove that the Flying Spaghetti Monster (the deity of a parody religion constructed to make a point about giving time to alternative views on evolution) was not the father of Jesus.

=== Political activity ===
In 1999, a Bradenton, Florida pastor asked the school board to consider adding Creationism to the curriculum. The school board chairman&#x27;s actions raised issues when, in his capacity as a citizen, he helped fund a series of seminars by Hovind, but he was within ethical guidelines. More controversy was raised when a school employee was sent to videotape the lectures, although without intention for rebroadcast. Ultimately, there was no curriculum change.

Hovind was criticized for his involvement with Arkansas state Representative Jim Holt&#x27;s Anti-Evolution Bill in 2001 (House Bill 2548). This bill &quot;would have required that when public schools refer to evolution that it be identified as an unproven theory.&quot; Opponents of the bill worried that it would subject Arkansas to the same type of derision that occurred when the state&#x27;s balanced-treatment law was struck down in &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot;. Holt called upon Hovind as an expert who &quot;testified for Holt before the State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee, alleging much of the information pertaining to evolution in our science textbooks is false.&quot;

In 2007, David Vitter added a $100,000 earmark in a U.S. Senate appropriations bill, directed towards the Louisiana Family Forum &quot;to develop a plan to promote better science education&quot;. Their website included a document, A Battle Plan—Practical Steps to Combat Evolution&#x27; by Kent Hovind&quot;. After a reporter&#x27;s inquiries, the document, which called evolution &quot;not a harmless theory but a dangerous religious belief&quot; and blamed it for atrocities by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Pol Pot, was removed from their website. The earmark was withdrawn from the bill.

=== Chick tracts ===
The most widely distributed antievolution work, &quot;Big Daddy?&quot;, was first published in 1972 and revised several times; it is one of the controversial Chick tracts, comic strips intended to convert people to fundamentalist Christianity. Material from Hovind was incorporated into the 2000 revision.

=== Miscellaneous ===
Hovind believes that the King James Version is the most accurate English-language Bible translation.

== Politics and conspiracy theories ==

Hovind has made controversial remarks regarding conspiracies, science, creation, equal rights, religion, and government. His presentations on creationism and evolution are a mix of Christian Fundamentalism and conspiracy theories. His creationist presentations have asserted that creationism is not taught in public schools due to a New World Order conspiracy, established by Satan and involving Ted Turner and Jane Fonda, the British Royal Family, the State of Israel, the American Civil Liberties Union (which he calls &quot;the American Communist Lawyers Union&quot;), U.S. government officials, business leaders, and social activists. In May 1999, he claimed &quot;the implementation of the NWO&#x27;s world-domination plan was May 5, 2000.&quot;

Hovind has promoted several conspiracy theories about the U.S. government. He has claimed that the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 attacks and the Oklahoma City bombing. Regarding UFOs, Hovind recommends books by conspiracy theorists who believe &quot;some UFO&#x27;s are U.S. Government experiments with electrogravitic propulsion as opposed to jet propulsion, while others are Satanic apparitions.&quot; The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) criticized Hovind for referring followers to books by Irwin Schiff, a tax protester who has been convicted of tax evasion multiple times. The SPLC has criticized Hovind for &quot;point[ing] his followers to &quot;Citizens Rule Book&quot;, popular among antigovernment &#x27;Patriots&#x27;, and to &quot;Media Bypass&quot;, an antigovernment magazine with strong antisemitic leanings&quot;, and for selling of books such as Des Griffin&#x27;s &quot;Fourth Reich of the Rich&quot; and Peter Kershaw&#x27;s &quot;In Caesar&#x27;s Grip&quot;, and recommending &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a well-known antisemitic hoax.

Hovind claims that the cyanide-releasing compound laetrile is a &quot;cancer cure&quot; which the U.S. government is conspiring to suppress and that diseases including HIV, Gulf war syndrome, Crohn&#x27;s colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer&#x27;s were engineered by &quot;the money masters and governments of the world&quot; for the purpose of global economic domination. He has denounced democracy as &quot;evil and contrary to God&#x27;s law&quot;, and called global warming a communist conspiracy.

In his lectures, he claimed that the United States government was implanting pet-tracking microchips into people allowing them to be tracked by satellite, even though the transponder range made that impossible. On his website, Hovind associated the UPC bar code with the Mark of the Beast, and wrote that there were reports of people paying for groceries by having their hands scanned in 1999.

On September 16, 2007, the Rational Response Squad (RRS) complained that Creation Science Evangelism was filing spurious DMCA requests that had caused RRS YouTube videos to be taken down and the RRS YouTube account to be banned. In response to the copyright claims, the RRS threatened a lawsuit.

At the time of the complaints, the CSE&#x27;s website indicated the videos were not copyrighted, and the CSE encouraged copying and distributing them. Five days later, the CSE copyright page was changed to say that copied material must be left unedited. According to a spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, CSE&#x27;s claim was &quot;clearly bogus&quot;, and as of September 25, 2007, the Rational Response Squad account had been reinstated, and some of the videos had been put back online.

== Legal issues ==

=== Escambia County (2002–2006) ===
On August 15, 2002, Hovind was arrested for assault, battery, and burglary in an incident with a CSE secretary. The charges were dropped in December.

On September 13, 2002, Hovind was charged with failure to observe county zoning regulations for Dinosaur Adventure Land, a misdemeanor. In April 2006, the Dinosaur Adventure Land buildings were closed by county officials, and the Florida circuit court found the owners in contempt, ordering fines of $500 for each day the buildings were used. Hovind argued he did not need a permit due to the nature of the building, but after a 5-year court battle over the $50 building permit, on June 5, 2006, Hovind pleaded &quot;nolo contendere&quot; as charged to three counts: constructing a building without a permit, refusing to sign a citation, and violating the county building code. Hovind paid fines totaling $675.

=== Federal civil tax matters, bankruptcy, and renouncing citizenship (1996–2006) ===

Hovind was originally reported to the Internal Revenue Service by Pensacola Christian College senior vice President Rebekah Horton in the mid-1990s, after she learned of Hovind&#x27;s anti-tax stand. Hovind&#x27;s organization had neither business licenses nor tax-exempt status, nor was it considered a church by people who worked there. The ministry&#x27;s organizational structure was described by the United States Tax Court as appearing to be &quot;based on various questionable trust documents purchased from Glen Stoll, a known promoter of tax avoidance schemes&quot;, leading the Court to conclude that Hovind used these trust documents as well as other fraudulent means to conceal the ownership and control of his activities and properties.

According to the IRS, Hovind earned $50,000 a year through speaking engagements, and in 2002 alone, CSE sold more than $1.8 million in merchandise. On average, Hovind made bank deposits in excess of $1 million each year, and eventually that grew to about $2 million a year. About half that income went to employees who were salaried or were paid hourly wages. However, Hovind derived &quot;substantial revenue&quot; from these activities that appeared to be &quot;income to [him] personally&quot;.

On March 1, 1996, Hovind filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition to avoid paying federal income taxes, claiming he was not a citizen of the United States and that he did not earn income. He claimed that as a minister, everything he owned belonged to God and he was not subject to paying taxes for doing God&#x27;s work. On June 5, 1996, the Court dismissed Hovind&#x27;s bankruptcy case, finding he had lied about his possessions and income. The court upheld the IRS&#x27;s determination that his claim &quot;was filed in bad faith for the sole purpose of avoiding payment of federal income taxes&quot; and called Hovind&#x27;s arguments &quot;patently absurd&quot;. It also said that &quot;the IRS has no record of the debtor ever having filed a federal income tax return.&quot;

In 1998, the IRS requested account information about Hovind from an internet provider after Hovind made claims on an internet broadcast about his own tax law noncompliance, going back to the 1970s. When the provider initially balked, the courts granted a subpoena on the basis that the IRS could demonstrate that Hovind had received income but had filed no income tax returns going back to 1991. In 2003, Hovind would tell &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I haven&#x27;t filed a tax return in 30 years.&quot;

On May 13, 1998, Hovind and his wife filed a &quot;Power of Attorney and Revocation of Signature&quot; document in Escambia County which would nullify any of their promises, debts, or legal agreements made prior to April 15, 1998. The Hovinds claimed they had signed government documents &quot;due to the use of various elements of fraud and misrepresentations, duress, coercion, under perjury, mistake, &#x27;bankruptcy&#x27;,&quot; and argued that Social Security is a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;. The document referred to the United States Government as &quot;the &#x27;bankrupt&#x27; corporate government&quot;, renounced the Hovinds&#x27; United States citizenship and Social Security numbers to become &quot;a natural citizen of &#x27;America&#x27; and a natural sojourner&quot;, and referred to their home state of Florida as &quot;the State of Florida Body-Politic Corporation.&quot; Judges and the IRS did not appear to honor this as a legally relevant document in future decisions. In 2002, Hovind was again delinquent in paying his taxes, and unsuccessfully sued the IRS for harassment.

At various times, the government alleged that Hovind had not filed personal U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1989 through 1997. In the spring of 2004, the IRS conducted an audit and criminal investigation regarding Hovind&#x27;s unfiled personal Federal income tax for 1995 through 1997. IRS agent Scott Schneider said, &quot;Since 1997, Hovind has engaged in financial transactions indicating sources of income and has made deposits to bank accounts well in excess of $1 million per year during some of these years, which would require the filing of federal income taxes.&quot; On June 3, 2004, the IRS executed a search warrant on Hovind&#x27;s home and businesses to confiscate financial records and attempt to deliver notices of Federal tax liens of $504,957.24, which Hovind refused to accept. Agents confiscated $42,000 in cash found in various places in the residence. Six guns were present, including an SKS semiautomatic rifle. That day, Hovind withdrew $70,000 from the CSE bank account, half in cash.

On July 7, 2006, the United States Tax Court found that Hovind was deficient in paying his federal income taxes in 1995–1997, totaling $520,099. The Tax Court ruled that the IRS had a valid lien on Hovind&#x27;s property and said that Hovind&#x27;s defense was based on &quot;bizarre arguments, some of which constitute tax protester arguments involving excise taxes and the alleged &#x27;100% voluntary&#x27; nature of the income tax.&quot; With penalties, he owed $3.3 million for tax years 1998–2006 by 2013. Jo Hovind was ordered to pay $1.6 million.

=== Federal criminal tax-related trial and convictions in 2006 ===

On July 11, 2006, Hovind was indicted on 58 counts in the District Court in Northern Florida in Pensacola. The first 12 counts were charges for willful failure to collect, account for, and pay over federal income taxes and FICA taxes in connection with the CSE operation, totaling $473,818 for the 12 fiscal quarters of 2001–2003. The next 45 counts were charges for knowingly structuring transactions by making multiple cash withdrawals totaling $430,500 in amounts just under the $10,000 which requires reporting (a technique known as &quot;structuring&quot;), for which his wife was also charged. The last count was a charge of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the administration of the internal revenue laws by falsely listing the IRS as his only creditor when filing for bankruptcy, filing a false and frivolous lawsuit against the IRS in which he demanded damages for criminal trespass, making threats of harm to those investigating him and to those who might consider cooperating with the investigation, filing a false complaint against IRS agents investigating him, filing a false criminal complaint against IRS special agents (criminal investigators), and destroying records. Because of reports of weapons on the Hovind property, the indictment was originally sealed for fear of danger to the arresting agents.

At arraignment, Hovind claimed incomprehension to the charges, telling the court: &quot;I still don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m being charged for and who is charging me.&quot; The presiding magistrate judge asked Hovind if he wrote and spoke English, to which Hovind responded, &quot;To some degree.&quot; The judge replied that the government adequately explained the allegations and the defendant understands the charges &quot;whether you want to admit it or not.&quot; Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government&#x27;s right to try him on tax-fraud charges. At first he attempted to enter a plea of &quot;subornation of false muster,&quot; but then entered a not guilty plea &quot;under duress&quot; when the judge offered to enter a plea for him. When asked about his home, Hovind called it a &quot;church parish&quot;, and denied any residence except the &quot;church of Jesus Christ&quot;, worldwide. Hovind&#x27;s passport and guns were seized. Hovind protested, arguing that he needed his passport to continue his evangelism work, and that &quot;thousands and thousands&quot; were waiting to hear him preach in South Africa the following month. The court refused to reconsider, accepting the argument that &quot;like-minded people&quot; might secret Hovind away if he left the country.

The trial began on October 21, 2006. Hovind hoped to convince a jury that his amusement park admission and merchandise sales, over $5 million from 1999 through March 2004, belonged to God and could not be taxed. Evidence produced at the trial revealed that Jo Hovind had requested financial assistance from Baptist Healthcare by claiming that the Hovinds had no income. IRS agents told the court how Hovind had attempted &quot;bullying tactics&quot; and had sued the government three times to pressure them to stop investigating. The lawsuits had been thrown out. The prosecution countered attempts to describe workers as missionaries, ministers, and volunteers, introducing memos in which they had been called employees. Workers testified that they had to punch time cards, had vacation and sick days, and did not receive W-2 tax forms. After the IRS executed the search warrant, employees were required to sign non-disclosure agreements to remain employed. A lawyer who did work for a non-profit Christian organization testified that Hovind claimed to have &quot;beat&quot; the tax system and that he favored cash transactions because they were untraceable and, consequently, untaxable.

Hovind&#x27;s lawyer engaged in a lengthy cross-examination of the lead IRS investigator, and the case ended on November 1 with the defense calling no witnesses. After closing arguments were presented on November 2, the jury deliberated three hours before finding the Hovinds guilty on all counts, 58 for Hovind and 45 for his wife. The &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; said, &quot;The saddest thing: had they cooperated with the agents, they probably wouldn&#x27;t be worrying about prison sentences now.&quot;

=== Sentencing, appeals, and imprisonment (2007–2019) ===

After the convictions and pending sentencing, Hovind was incarcerated in the Escambia County Jail as a &quot;danger to the community&quot; and a flight risk. His wife would remain free until after the appeal.

On January 19, 2007, Hovind was sentenced to ten years in prison with three years&#x27; probation and ordered to pay the federal government restitution of over $600,000. During the sentencing phase, a tearful Hovind, hoping to avoid prison, told the court, &quot;If it&#x27;s just money the IRS wants, there are thousands of people out there who will help pay the money they want so I can go back out there and preach.&quot; However, Hovind&#x27;s court room behavior was in stark contrast to phone calls he made while in jail and played by the prosecution. The tapes, posted online by the &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot;, included one conversation with Hovind and son Eric, who were planning to hide a motor vehicle title and property deeds to prevent the government from collecting the property to pay for owed debt. At sentencing, he denied being a &quot;tax protester&quot;, but the prosecution, an IRS spokesman, and the &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; used the term to describe him.

On June 29, 2007, Jo Hovind was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, three years of supervision upon release and fined $8,000. In court, Jo Hovind offered explanations for the 45 checks just under $10,000 and for checks cashed before and after the reporting deadline, telling the judge &quot;I really did not have a leadership role in CSE&quot; and finished &quot;I would never knowingly do anything illegal.&quot; The judge said that while Hovind was the principal authority at CSE, Jo managed the payroll; she had cashed roughly 200 checks totaling $1.5 million over a four-year period, relying on cash to avoid IRS scrutiny. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied both appeals on December 30, 2008, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied &quot;certiorari&quot; on November 2, 2009.

Hovind appealed the amount of his 2006 U.S. Tax Court ruling on personal income taxes to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, but on July 2, 2007, a three-judge panel denied the appeal, finding that Hovind had failed to raise the issue at the appropriate time.

In November 2010, Hovind filed a motion in U.S. District Court Northern District of Florida claiming the prosecution and defense erred at various stages of the case; it was denied the following May. It was one of at least six motions to dismiss he filed that year on various procedural or constitutional grounds.

In July 2015, Hovind was released to home confinement for roughly one month to finish his prison sentence for his 2006 conviction. Almost a year after his release, Hovind said he would continue to fight his conviction and the property seizure.

In October 2019, Hovind filed a motion to vacate in the trial court without obtaining the required certification from the appellate court; the motion was dismissed, summarily.

=== CSE property forfeitures ===

In 2007, the government placed liens on ten of the Hovinds&#x27; properties for money owed following a June 27, 2007, judgment, which included an order that the properties be forfeited under for costs of $5,800, a fine of $2000, and restitution of $604,874.87. On December 30, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the Hovinds&#x27; appeal and affirmed the convictions and sentences entered by the district court. Following the appeal, Jo Hovind served her prison term from January 20, 2009, to December 3, 2009.

In 2008, Eric Hovind and Glen Stoll, an individual who has been associated with the Embassy of Heaven organization and who has falsely claimed to be a lawyer, attempted to prevent the forfeitures of Hovind&#x27;s ten properties, including Dinosaur Adventure Land, in connection with the federal tax problems. (In early 2019, Stoll himself was indicted by a Federal grand jury in Portland, Oregon on unrelated charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, making a false statement on a loan application, and tax evasion.) The government sought the property, deeded to Stoll and Eric prior to Hovind&#x27;s convictions, since cash had been withdrawn from the bank accounts and could not be recovered. In a court filing, however, Eric Hovind said that he owned one of the properties and that he &quot;took active control over the lot by personally building a home on it with $70,000 he borrowed from CSE.&quot; The court accepted Eric&#x27;s ownership of that property, but allowed the government to seize the other nine properties. The court ruling denying the Hovinds&#x27; appeal cleared the way for forfeiture proceedings on Hovind-owned properties, including those on which Dinosaur Adventure Land sat, to continue to satisfy the debt.

In March 2012, the federal government sued Creation Science Evangelism to remove liens placed on Hovind&#x27;s former property that was seized after his conviction, and in June, the court ruled in favor of the government.

In May 2013, facing the sale of lots that were once part of Dinosaur Adventure land, Hovind acted. Using legal advice from another inmate, he filed a civil right suit against corrections personnel (a &quot;Bivens action&quot;) alleging that they intentionally delayed court documents which hindered another appeal. Based on the assumption that it would trigger a chain of rulings that would ultimately result in the original sentence being overturned, he then filed several &quot;lis pendens&quot; on the properties. A federal judge rejected Hovind&#x27;s claims and dismissed the filings (&quot;void &quot;ab initio&quot;&quot;), and asked for a &quot;show of cause&quot; from Hovind to explain why he should not be found in contempt of court for the false filings. His release date was approaching when he would face new charges related to the &quot;lis pendens&quot; filings.

=== Federal mail fraud and criminal contempt trial in 2015 ===

On October 21, 2014, Hovind was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pensacola, Florida, on two counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy with Paul John Hansen to commit mail fraud, and one count of criminal contempt for interfering with the sale of Pensacola properties Hovind was forced to forfeit as a result of the 2006 case. Hovind and Hansen pleaded not guilty and were tried together.

On March 2, 2015, the trial began in U.S. District Court for Northern Florida. On the first day of testimony, the prosecution discussed Hovind and Hansen&#x27;s &quot;dozens of filings&quot;, including several &quot;lis pendens&quot;, used to resist a court-ordered forfeiture due in part to legal advice Hovind took from his &quot;cellmate in a New Hampshire prison camp&quot;. The prosecution case included numerous emails, recorded phone calls, and court filings related to the forfeited properties. The prosecution presented audio of Hovind characterizing a &quot;lis pendens&quot; by asking his daughter, &quot;Have you ever taken a step into dog crap and it gets stuck on your feet and it&#x27;s really hard to get off?&quot; Hansen and Hovind took the stand in their own defense. According to journalist Kevin Robinson, during Hovind&#x27;s testimony, he &quot;refused to give short answers&quot; and said that he believed his actions were lawful. On March 12, 2015, Hovind was found guilty on one count of criminal contempt, Hansen on two counts of criminal contempt, and the jury was hung on the remaining charges.

A trial on the counts on which the jury could not reach a verdict had been ordered to begin on May 18, 2015. However, on May 16, 2015, the prosecution filed its &quot;Government&#x27;s Motion to Dismiss Counts One, Two and Four of the Superseding Indictment Without Prejudice,&quot; citing &quot;issues regarding the technical sufficiency of the Superseding Indictment, including the adequacy of notice.&quot; Later, on May 16, the Court cancelled the jury selection and trial that had been scheduled to begin on Monday, May 18, in order, in the Court&#x27;s words, to permit the defendants to respond to the government&#x27;s motion.

On Monday, May 18, 2015, the U.S. District Court made two decisions. First, the Court granted the prosecutor&#x27;s request for a &quot;without prejudice&quot; dismissal of the three remaining charges against Hovind, allowing the prosecutor to go back to a Federal grand jury and seek a new indictment if desired. Second, the Court rendered a judgment of acquittal on the criminal contempt charge on which Hovind had been found guilty by the jury. On that point, the Court concluded that in the specific order that Hovind had been found guilty of violating, there was no actual language that prohibited Hovind from doing anything.

On August 21, 2015, Paul John Hansen was sentenced to 18 months in prison and three years&#x27; probation for the two counts of contempt.

===Domestic violence===
Hovind was arrested in Alabama on July 30, 2021, for allegedly throwing his estranged wife, Cindi Lincoln, to the ground in October 2020. Additionally, she petitioned for a protective order in Conecuh County, Alabama, saying that she had to go to the emergency room after being &quot;bodyslammed&quot;. She has also stated that she had been threatened by one of Hovind&#x27;s associates. At a bench trial in the Connecuh County Courthouse on September 20, 2021, he was found guilty of domestic violence. He was sentenced to one year in jail which would be suspended following 30 days in the county jail to start by October 18, fined $500, and ordered to pay restitution for medical expenses. A request for a retrial was denied, and an appeal requesting a jury trial was filed in the Alabama Circuit Courts.

<text>Los Chamos were a famous Venezuelan boy band formed in Caracas in 1981 to rival Menudo&#x27;s success. Los Chamos were made up of six members and released their first album, &quot;Los Chamos-El Soldadito&quot;, sponsored by channel 8 of Venezuelan National TV.

In 1982, they released their second album called &quot;Siempre Te Amare&quot;, which spanned the international hit “Canta Chamo”. That album went Gold and Platinum in many Latin American countries. 
That hit led them to sing at Mexico&#x27;s Estadio Azteca, among other big venues in Latin America.

In 1983 they released a third hit album called &quot;Tu Como Yo&quot; produced by famous singer and composer Rudy LaScala.

That same year Los Chamos released a blockbuster movie called &quot;Secuestro En Acapulco-Canta Chamo&quot; alongside famous actresses Yuri-also a singer- and La Chilindrina

Los Chamos went on tour for many years through Mexico, the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Central America, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, etc. After that huge success, four group members alleged poor working conditions and left to pursue other musical endeavors. Four more boys were brought in to form Los Chamos&#x27; line up, and another album was released. The sudden, drastic line up change and new album weren&#x27;t as positively received by the public, and Los Chamos dissolved soon after. They tried their hand at a fifth release in 1990, with six new members, and after that, Los Chamos officially called it quits.

Nowadays some of the former members relocated and live in the United States, Mexico, Germany and Brazil. On August 28, 2018, Mexican television reporter Ana Maria Canseco announced on her webpage that former member Chamo Will Marquez Uzcategui, &quot;Chamo Will&quot;, died unexpectedly from a respiratory condition in his native Venezuela.

<doc id="189879" wikidata="Q19123" url="?curid=189879" title="Schizomida">
<text>Schizomida, also known as sprickets or short-tailed whip-scorpions, is an order of arachnids, generally less than in length. The order is not yet widely studied. E. O. Wilson has identified schizomids as among the &quot;groups of organisms that desperately need experts to work on them.&quot;

==Taxonomy==
Schizomids are grouped into three families:
* Calcitronidae † (fossil; dubious)
* Hubbardiidae
* Protoschizomidae (2 genera, 15 species)
**&quot;Agastoschizomus&quot;
** &quot;Protoschizomus&quot;

About 300 species of schizomids have been described worldwide, most belonging to the Hubbardiidae family. A systematic review including a full catalogue may be found in Reddell &amp; Cokendolpher (1995). The Schizomida is sister to the order Uropygi, the two clades together forming the Thelyphonida (in the broad sense of the name). Based on molecular clock dates, both orders likely originated in the late Carboniferous somewhere in the tropics of Pangea, and the Schizomida underwent substantial diversification starting in the Cretaceous. The oldest known fossils of the group are from the Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar, which are assignable to the Hubbardiidae.

==Morphology==
Schizomids are relatively small, soft-bodied arachnids, somewhat similar in appearance to whip scorpions. The prosoma (cephalothorax) is divided into three regions, each covered by plates, the large protopeltidium and the smaller, paired, mesopeltidia and metapeltidia. The name means &quot;split or cleaved middle&quot;, referring to the way the prosoma is divided into two separate plates.

The opisthosoma (abdomen) is a smooth oval of 12 recognizable segments. The first is reduced and forms the pedicel, while the last three are constricted, forming the pygidium. The last segment bears a short whip-like tail or flagellum, consisting of no more than four segments. The females generally have 3-4-segmented flagella, while in males it is single segmented.

Like the related orders Uropygi and Amblypygi, and the more distantly related Solifugae, the schizomids use only six legs for walking, having modified their first two legs to serve as sensory organs. They also have large well-developed pincer-like pedipalps just before the sensory legs. The hind legs are modified for jumping, as part of their escape response when threatened.

Schizomids have no actual eyes, but a few species have vestigial eyespots capable of telling light from dark. They breathe through a single pair of book lungs located on the second abdominal segment, as the second pair on third abdominal segment found in the other orders of Tetrapulmonata is lost.

==Distribution and habitat==
Schizomids are generally tropical and subtropical creatures, and they have a global distribution in these habitats, including in Southeast Asia, India, Australia, several Pacific Islands, Central and South America, and Africa. Additionally, some populations have been found in neighboring temperate regions such as California and Texas. Of the two extant families of sprickets, Hubbardiidae has a global distribution while Protoschizomidae is only found in Mexico and Texas. While schizomids are not native to Europe, they have been introduced to the continent in Britain, France, the Czech Republic, and Poland via soil stock imported for botanical gardens; however, thus far they are still restricted to the artificial greenhouse environments. Despite their global distribution, most schizomid species have very restricted distributions, with many only known from their original locality.

Humidity is vital to determining the habitats in which sprickets can live as they need to avoid desiccation. They typically live in rainforest leaf litter, particularly in the top layer of organic soil, under rocks, in and beneath rotten logs, and even in caves. Although most species are restricted to rainforests, they can also be found in neighboring woody areas. The Australian species &quot;Draculoides vinei&quot; is believed to have been forced to move into a nearby humid cave system after its original forests dramatically decreased in size. Additionally, some species have been found in insect nests; &quot;Afrozomus machadoi&quot; lives in termite mounds, while &quot;Stenochrus portoricensis&quot; has been found in ant colonies. Schizomids are also occasionally found living in the trees; the South American &quot;Surazomus arboreus&quot; lives in rainforest that is seasonally flooded, forcing the arachnids to move higher into the trees to avoid drowning.

While sprickets are not typically found in colder climates, several Californian &quot;Hubbardia&quot; species have been found living under snow-covered rocks, and &quot;Hubbardia briggsi&quot; in particular is often found in snowy habitats during the winter.

==Biology==
While not much is known about the lifespans of schizomids, they have been found to live for several months in captivity.

===Mortality and defense===
Not much is known about the natural predators of sprickets. Amblypygids have been observed eating schizomids. Additionally, despite their small size, schizomids have been observed being parasitized by tiny nematodes; the opisthosoma of one &quot;Stenochrus goodnightorum&quot; was nearly completely filled by a parasitic nematode.

===Diet and feeding===
Sprickets are active predators, constantly using their antenniform legs to examine the forest soil for potential prey. A wide range of invertebrates are prey items, including isopods, millipedes, cockroaches, worms, springtails, termites, booklice, zorapterans, and even other schizomids. Prey can range in size from 10% of their body size to as much as 100%. Once potential prey is located, the arachnid uses their antenniform legs to determine the size of the creature and note any extremities. Should the schizomid not retreat, it will lunge forward and seize its victim with its palps. The prey is then subdued, and possibly taken to the shelter of a nearby crevice to be eaten. The chelicerae dismember the prey item before the tissues are liquified into chyme and ingested via suction with the mouth.

Schizomids can survive a long time without food; some &quot;Hubbardia pentapeltis&quot; have been shown to survive five months without food.

<doc id="189886" wikidata="Q139497" url="?curid=189886" title="Westmount">
<text>Westmount () is a city on the Island of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is an enclave of the city of Montreal, with a population of 19,658 as of the 2021 Canadian census.

Westmount is home to schools, an arena, a pool, a public library and a number of parks, including Westmount Park, King George Park (also known as Murray Hill Park) and Westmount Summit. The city operates its own electricity distribution company Westmount Light &amp; Power (Hydro-Westmount). The city is also the location of two Canadian Forces Primary Reserve units: The Royal Montreal Regiment and 34th Signals Regiment.

Traditionally, the community of Westmount has been a wealthy and predominantly anglophone enclave, having been at one point the richest community in Canada. It is still the most affluent neighbourhood in Canada outside of Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary.

==History==
There are indications of a First Nations presence 4000 to 5000 years ago. A large amount of prehistoric burial sites were found within the area of Westmount. The Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee (Iriquois) peoples have historically inhabited the Island of Montreal as well as much of Quebec.
When the first French colonists settled in the area in the middle of the seventeenth century, this area was known by several names including La Petite Montagne, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Côte-Saint-Antoine. A former farmhouse from this era, Hurtubise House, is the oldest house still standing in Westmount.

The Village of Côte St-Antoine was first incorporated in 1874. It later became the Town of Côte St-Antoine.

It was renamed Westmount, in 1895, reflecting the geographical location of the city on the southwest slope of Mount Royal and the presence of a large English-speaking population.

During the twentieth century, Westmount became a wealthy residential area within the island of Montreal; a small city dotted with many green spaces. Architect Robert Findlay, a resident in the early twentieth century, designed many municipal buildings in the city, including the library, Westmount City Hall and several other buildings of public order.

In the twentieth century, Westmount was home to some of Montreal&#x27;s wealthiest families including the Bronfmans and the Molsons. This made the city a symbolic target of Front de libération du Québec terrorist bombings in the 1960s, culminating in the 1970 October Crisis.

Following the death of former Quebec Premier René Lévesque in 1987, the city of Montreal renamed Dorchester Boulevard René Lévesque Boulevard. After the city of Montreal changed the name, Westmount retained the name of Dorchester on their portion, as did Montréal-Est.

===Merger with Montreal===
In 2001, while trying to prevent Westmount from being amalgamated into the city of Montreal, Westmount Mayor Peter Trent and city council asserted that the city was a designated anglophone institution and should not be merged into francophone greater Montreal. In response to this opposition, Municipal Affairs Minister Louise Harel said that Westmount&#x27;s resistance &quot;reeked of colonialism&quot; and that the opposition was an &quot;ethnic project&quot;, statements for which she would refuse to apologize. When asked for comment, Quebec Premier Bernard Landry said the minister had his full support and that the opposition was little more than Quebec bashing. Several federalist public figures criticized Landry&#x27;s statement: Jean Charest called it insulting to the intelligence of the citizens of Quebec; Joseph Gabary, president of the Quebec Chapter of the Canadian Jewish Congress, called the language &quot;crude&quot;; Alliance Quebec also criticized the premier for singling out the city for special criticism.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, Westmount was merged into the city of Montreal and became a borough. However, after a change of government and a 2004 referendum, it was re-constituted as an independent city on January 1, 2006. It is now one of fifteen independent cities on the Island of Montreal, and the only one that directly borders the downtown core.

Nevertheless, it remains part of the urban agglomeration of Montreal and the bulk of its municipal taxes go to the Agglomeration Council, which oversees activities common to all municipalities on the Island of Montreal (e.g. police, fire protection, public transit) even after the demerger.

==Geography==
The city is roughly , and occupies an area of land on the south face of Westmount Summit, the western peak of Mount Royal. The city, most of which is on steep terrain, extends from the summit to the end of the narrow plateau at the foot of the mountain.

==Cityscape==

<text>Kirkcudbrightshire ( ) or the County of Kirkcudbright or the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright is one of the historic counties of Scotland, covering an area in the south-west of the country. Until 1975, Kirkcudbrightshire was an administrative county used for local government. Since 1975, the area has formed part of Dumfries and Galloway for local government purposes. Kirkcudbrightshire continues to be used as a registration county for land registration. A lower-tier district called Stewartry covered the majority of the historic county from 1975 to 1996. The area of Stewartry district is still used as a lieutenancy area. Dumfries and Galloway Council also has a Stewartry area committee.

Kirkcudbrightshire forms the eastern part of the medieval lordship of Galloway, which retained a degree of autonomy until it was fully absorbed by Scotland in the 13th century. In 1369, the part of Galloway east of the River Cree was placed under the control of a steward based in Kirkcudbright and so that area became known as the &quot;Stewartry of Kirkcudbright&quot;. The rest of Galloway remained under the authority of a sheriff based in Wigtown, and so became known as Wigtownshire. Kirkcudbrightshire was occasionally referred to as East Galloway. It is bounded on the north by Ayrshire, on the west by Wigtownshire, on the south by the Irish Sea and Solway Firth, and on the east by Dumfriesshire. The county town is Kirkcudbright.

==History==
===Early history===
The country west of the Nith was originally peopled by a tribe of Celts called Novantae, who long retained their independence.

After Gnaeus Julius Agricola&#x27;s invasion in 79 AD, the country nominally formed part of the Roman province of Britannia, but the evidence is against there having been a prolonged effective Roman occupation. There was a Roman temporary marching camp at Shawhead, in Kirkpatrick Irongray.

After the retreat of the Romans, the fate of the Novantae is unknown. By the 6th century, Galloway was part of the Brythonic kingdom of Strathclyde.

During the ninth century, the region was part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. A hoard that has been attributed to either a Northumbrian metal-worker, or a Viking campaigner, was deposited near Talnotrie c.875-900.

===11th, 12th, and 13th centuries===
During the next two hundred years the area was subject to incursions by Danes, Saxons and Scandinavians.

After Malcolm Canmore defeated and killed Macbeth in 1057, he married the dead king&#x27;s relative, Ingibiorg, a Pictish princess, (the view that there were Picts in Galloway in historical times cannot be wholly rejected) an event which marked the beginning of the decay of Norse influence. The Galloway chiefs became lieges of the Scottish king, while retaining some independence as the sub-kingdom or semi-autonomous Lordship of Galloway. Following the death of Lord Alan of Galloway in 1234 the area was brought fully under the control of the Scottish crown.

===14th and 15th centuries===
In 1308 the district was cleared of the English and brought under allegiance to the king, when the lordship of Galloway was given to Edward Bruce.

In 1369 Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas, was given the part of Galloway east of the River Cree, where he appointed a steward to administer the area, which became known as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The following year, he acquired the rest of Galloway west of the Cree, which continued to be administered by the king&#x27;s sheriff, and so became known as the Shire of Wigtown. This led to the local custom of referring to Kirkcudbrightshire as &quot;The Stewartry&quot; and Wigtownshire as &quot;The Shire&quot;, which continued into the 20th century.

In 1455 Threave Castle, the most important fortress in Galloway, which Archibald the Grim had built on the Dee immediately to the west of the modern town of Castle Douglas, was reduced and converted into a royal keep.

===16th and 17th centuries===
As the Douglases went down the Maxwells rose, and the debatable land on the south-east of Dumfriesshire was for generations the scene of strife and raid, not only between the two nations but also among the leading families, of whom the Maxwells, Johnstones and Armstrongs were always conspicuous. After the Battle of Solway Moss (1542) the shires of Kirkcudbright and Dumfries fell under English rule for a short period. The treaty of Norham (24 March 1550) established a truce between the nations for ten years; and in 1552, the Wardens of the Marches consenting, the debatable land ceased to be matter for debate, the parish of Canonbie being annexed to Dumfriesshire, that of Kirkandrews to Cumberland.

===18th century===
McCulloch and Gordon families were of &quot;Cardoness Castle, Anwoth Parish&quot; and Rev. Rutherford was minister of Anwoth.

After the union (1707) things mended slowly but surely, curious evidence of growing commercial prosperity being the enormous extent to which smuggling was carried on. No coast could serve the &quot;free traders&quot; better than the shores of Kirkcudbright, and the contraband trade flourished until the 19th century. The Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 elicited small sympathy from the inhabitants of the shire. In the 1760s a military road was constructed from Bridge of Sark, near Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway to Portpatrick by Major William Caulfeild.

===19th century===

Elected county councils were established in Scotland in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. Kirkcudbrightshire County Council established its headquarters at County Buildings, 121–123 High Street, Kirkcudbright, being a converted pair of late 18th century houses. A large extension was built in 1952 to the rear of the building facing Daar Road.

Kirkcudbrightshire was abolished as an administrative county in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. A two-tier system of regions and districts was put in place instead, with the area becoming part of the Dumfries and Galloway region. Most of Kirkudbrightshire became part of the Stewartry district. The two parishes of Kirkmabreck and Minnigaff in the west of the county went instead to the Wigtown district, while the five parishes of Kirkbean, Kirkpatrick Irongray, New Abbey, Terregles, and Troqueer in the east of the county went to the Nithsdale district.

Further local government reform in 1996 saw the Stewartry, Wigtown and Nithsdale districts abolished and their functions passed to Dumfries and Galloway Council, which continues to operate area committees based on the pre-1996 districts, subject to some boundary changes where ward boundaries no longer follow the pre-1996 district boundaries. The former Stewartry district is used as a lieutenancy area under the name the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright.

==Geography==
Kirkcudbrightshire has a shoreline on the Solway Firth, between the rivers Nith and Cree. Inland, the area has many hills, with its highest point being Merrick .

There are many &quot;burns&quot; and &quot;waters&quot;, but their length seldom exceeds . Among the longer rivers are the Cree, which rises in Loch Moan and reaches the sea near Creetown after a course of about ; the Dee or Black Water of Dee (so named from the peat by which it is coloured), which rises in Loch Dee which after a course mainly S.E. and finally S., enters the sea at St Mary&#x27;s Isle below Kirkcudbright, its length being nearly ; the Urr, rising in Loch Urr on the Dumfriesshire border, falls into the sea a few miles south of Dalbeattie from its source.

===Geology===
Silurian and Ordovician rocks are the most important in this county; they are thrown into oft-repeated folds with their axes lying in a north-east–south-west direction. The Ordovician rocks are graptolitic black shales and grits of Llandeilo and Caradoc age. They occupy all the northern part of the county north-west of a line which runs some 3 m. north of New Galloway and just south of the Rinns of Kells. South-east of this line graptolitic Silurian shales of Llandovery age prevail; they are found around Dalry, Creetown, New Galloway, Castle Douglas and Kirkcudbright.

Overlying the Llandovery beds on the south coast are strips of Wenlock rocks; they extend from Bridgehouse Bay to Auchinleck and are well exposed in Kirkcudbright Bay, and they can be traced farther round the coast between the granite and the younger rocks. Carboniferous rocks appear in small faulted tracts, unconformable on the Silurian, on the shores of the Solway Firth. They are best developed about Kirkbean, where they include a basal red breccia followed by conglomerates, grits and cement stones of Calciferous Sandstone age.

Brick-red sandstones of Permian age just come within the county on the W. side of the Nith at Dumfries. Volcanic necks occur in the Permian and basalt dikes penetrate the Silurian at Borgue, Kirkandrews, etc.

Most of the highest ground is formed by granite plutons which have been intruded into the Ordovician and Silurian rocks; the Criffel pluton lies about Dalbeattie and Bengairn, another mass extends east and west between the Cairnsmore of Fleet and Loch Ken, another lies north-west and south-east between Loch Doon and Loch Dee and a small mass forms the Cairnsmore of Carsphairn. Much granite was quarried from Kirkmabreck, near Creetown for dock construction from 1830 on.

Glacial deposits occupy much of the low ground; the ice, having travelled in a southerly or south-easterly direction, has left abundant striae on the higher ground to indicate its course. Radiation of the ice streams took place from the heights of Merrick, Kells, etc.; local moraines are found near Carsphairn and in the Deagh and Minnoch valleys. Glacial drumlins of boulder clay lie in the vales of the Dee, Cree and Urr.

===Climate and agriculture===

The climate and soil suit grass and green crops rather than grain. The annual rainfall averages . The mean temperature for the year is 9 °C (48 °F); for January 4 °C (39 °F)and 15 °C (59 °F) for July.

==Railways==

Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway was incorporated on 21 July 1856; the act was obtained by the Glasgow and South Western Railway. It opened on 7 November 1859 and was substantially closed, under the Beeching cuts, on 14 June 1965. The Portpatrick Railway was authorised on 10 August 1857. By 12 March 1861, the line connected Stranraer to Castle Douglas, where it joined the newly constructed Castle Douglas and Dumfries railway. The branch to Portpatrick opened the following year, on 28 August 1862, with the Stranraer Harbour branch, which opened on 1 October 1862; although building work continued on the line for another five years. The Kirkcudbright Railway was a railway branch line linking Kirkcudbright to the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway at Castle Douglas. It opened in 1864, and closed in 1965.

The Beeching cuts cut off the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway and Portpatrick Railway in 1965 resulting in an adverse mileage increase via the Glasgow South Western Line to reach Stranraer Harbour (for and Port of Belfast) from , and the West Coast Main Line to London Euston, and leaving the county without any railway permanent way.

<doc id="189891" wikidata="Q217142" url="?curid=189891" title="Snowdon">
<text>Snowdon (), or (), is a mountain in Snowdonia in North Wales. It has an elevation of above sea level, which makes it both the highest mountain in Wales and the highest in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. Snowdon is designated a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna, and is located within Snowdonia National Park.

The rocks that form Snowdon were produced by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif has been extensively sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. It is part of the larger Snowdon range, which includes Garnedd Ugain, Yr Aran, and Moel Eilio. There are several lakes on the mountain, the largest of which is Llyn Lydaw (), located on the eastern flank at .

The mountain has been described as the &quot;busiest in the United Kingdom&quot;, and in 2022 it was climbed by 543,541 walkers. There are six main paths to the summit, the most popular of which begins in the town of Llanberis to the north. The summit can also be reached using the Snowdon Mountain Railway, which carried 98,567 passengers in 2021. The rack railway, which opened in 1896, operates over , from Llanberis to the Summit station. It generally operates from March to the end of October, with trains running to the summit station from May. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest. The mountain, alongside Ben Nevis in Scotland and Scafell Pike in England, is climbed as part of the National Three Peaks Challenge.

==Toponymy==

The name &quot;Snowdon&quot; is first recorded in 1095 as &quot;Snawdune&quot;, and is derived from the Old English elements &#x27; and &#x27;, meaning &quot;snow hill&quot;.

The Welsh name of the mountain, , is first recorded in Latin as in 1284. This is probably an approximation of . The element in this context means &#x27;height, promontory&#x27;, and also appears in the Welsh name for the town of Mold, .

 later developed the meaning &quot;burial cairn&quot;, and there is a legend that the giant Rhita is buried under the mountain&#x27;s summit cairn. One legend claims that Rhita was defeated and buried on the mountain by King Arthur, and another states that Rhita was killed by the giant Idris who lived on the mountain Cadair Idris. The mountain is also linked to other figures from Arthurian legend, a legendary &quot;&quot; (water monster) and the (fairies).

It has been argued that Snowdon strictly refers to a higher mountain in British Columbia, Canada, with the Welsh mountain simply being &quot;Snowdon&quot;. However, the Welsh mountain has been referred to in some uses as &quot;Mount Snowdon&quot; or &quot;Mt Snowdon&quot;.

In November 2022, national park authority announced they are to refer to the mountain by its Welsh name &quot;Yr Wyddfa&quot;, not Snowdon. Following a two-year transition period, in November 2024, the authority announced the name would be kept following its success in gaining support and adoption by businesses and media.

==Environment==
===Geography and geology===
A 1682 survey estimated that the summit of Snowdon was at an elevation of ; in 1773, Thomas Pennant quoted a later estimate of above sea level at Caernarfon. It was long believed to be the tallest mountain on the island of Great Britain until measurements taken in the 18th century confirmed that Ben Nevis and several other Scottish peaks were taller. Recent surveys give the height of the summit as , making Snowdon the highest mountain in Wales, and the highest point in the British Isles outside Scotland.

The rocks which today make up Snowdon and its neighbouring mountains were formed in the Ordovician Period. At that time, most of modern-day Wales was near the edge of Avalonia, submerged beneath the ancient Iapetus Ocean. In the Soudleyan (former British regional) stage () of the Caradoc (British regional) epoch, a volcanic caldera formed, and produced ash flows of rhyolitic tuff, which formed deposits up to thick. The current summit is near the northern edge of the ancient caldera; the caldera&#x27;s full extent is unclear, but it extended as far as the summit of Moel Hebog in the south-west.

Snowdon and its surrounding peaks have been described as &quot;true examples of Alpine topography&quot;. The summits of Snowdon and Garnedd Ugain are surrounded by cwms, rounded valleys scooped out by glaciation. Erosion by glaciers in adjacent cwms caused the characteristic arêtes of Crib Goch, Crib y Ddysgl and Y Lliwedd, and the pyramidal peak of Snowdon itself. Other glacial landforms that can be seen around Snowdon include roches moutonnées, glacial erratics and moraines.

===Climate===
In winter, Snowdon often has a covering of snow (giving rise to its English name). Although the amount of snow on Snowdon in winter varies significantly, 55% less snow fell in 2004 than in 1994. The slopes of Snowdon have one of the wettest climates in Great Britain, receiving an annual average of more than of precipitation.

===Flora and fauna===

The environment of Snowdon, particularly its rare plants, has led to the designation of much of the eastern part of the massif as a national nature reserve. In addition to plants that are widespread in Snowdonia, Snowdon is home to some plants rarely found elsewhere in Britain. These include the &quot;Snowdon lily&quot;, &quot;Gagea serotina&quot;, which is also found in the Alps and in North America; it was first discovered in Wales by Edward Lhuyd, and the genus &quot;Lloydia&quot; (now included in &quot;Gagea&quot;) was later named in his honour by Richard Anthony Salisbury. Snowdon lies in the northern part of Snowdonia National Park, which has also provided some legal protection since the park&#x27;s establishment in 1951.

Otters, polecats, and goats have been seen near or on the mountain, although pine martens have not been seen for many years. Birds that can be seen include the raven, red-billed chough, peregrine, osprey, merlin, red kite and moorland birds.

===Lakes===

A number of lakes are found in the various cwms of the Snowdon range:
* Llyn Llydaw – high, – lies in Cwm Dyli, Snowdon&#x27;s eastern cwm, and is one of Snowdonia&#x27;s deepest lakes, at up to deep. Various explanations of its name have been put forward, including &#x27; (&quot;ash&quot;), from ashen deposits along the shore, to &#x27; (&quot;Brittany&quot;). It contains evidence of a crannog settlement, and was the location of a dugout canoe described in the &quot;Cambrian Journal&quot; in 1862. The lake is significantly coloured by washings from the copper mines nearby, and is used by the Cwm Dyli hydroelectric power station, which opened in 1906. The lake is crossed by a causeway, built in 1853 and raised in the 20th century to prevent the causeway from flooding frequently.
* Glaslyn – high, – lies higher up Cwm Dyli than Llyn Llydaw. It was originally called &quot;&quot;, and has a depth of . For a long time, it was believed to be bottomless, and is also the location for various myths.
* Llyn Ffynnon-y-gwas – high, – lies in Cwm Treweunydd, Snowdon&#x27;s north-western cwm, and is passed by the Snowdon Ranger path. It was enlarged by damming for use as a reservoir for use by slate quarries, but the level has since been lowered, and the lake&#x27;s volume reduced to .

Other lakes include: Llyn Du&#x27;r Arddu below Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu, at a height of , ; Llyn Teyrn near Pen-y-pass, at a height of , ; and several smaller pools.

==Leisure activities==
Snowdon has been described as &quot;the busiest mountain in Britain&quot;, with some 543,541 people having walked up the mountain in 2022. There are six main walking paths, which can be combined in various ways. In addition, the circular walk starting and ending at and using the route and the route over , both of which involve scrambling, is called the Snowdon Horseshoe, and is considered &quot;one of the finest ridge walks in Britain&quot;. The routes are arranged here anticlockwise, starting with the path leading from Llanberis. In winter conditions, all these routes become significantly more dangerous and the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team state that &quot;additional skills, equipment and knowledge are required&quot;. Many inexperienced walkers have been killed over the years attempting to climb the mountain via the main paths.

The mountain itself may also be viewed on takeoff and approach to both Manchester Airport and Liverpool John Lennon Airport on very clear days, and even from Howth Head in Dublin, Ireland.
On 26 June 2018, Sam Laming became the first ever Wingsuit pilot to perform a &#x27;Proximity Flight&#x27; over a UK mountain, by flying approximately 30 metres over Snowdon&#x27;s summit, after jumping from a helicopter with fellow wingsuit camera pilot, Mike Hitchcock.

In 2021, John Harold, the director of the Snowdonia Society, reported that the number of visitors ascending Snowdon was exceeding capacity. At popular times walkers queue for upwards of 45 minutes for an opportunity to take a photo at the summit pillar.

===Rock climbing===

The Snowdon Massif includes a number of cliffs, and holds an important place in the history of rock climbing in the United Kingdom. Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu is often colloquially known as &#x27;Cloggy&#x27; among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded climb in Britain, in 1798. It was carried out by Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley, while searching for rare plants. It is now considered to be one of the best cliffs in Britain for rock climbing.

Y Lliwedd was also explored by early climbers, and was the subject of a 1909 climbing guide, &quot;The Climbs on Lliwedd&quot; by J. M. A. Thompson and A. W. Andrews, one of the first in Britain. Snowdon was used by Edmund Hillary and his group during preparations for their successful 1953 expedition to climb Mount Everest.

===Paths===

The first recorded ascent of Snowdon was by the botanist Thomas Johnson in 1639. However, the 18th-century Welsh historian Thomas Pennant mentions a &quot;triumphal fair upon this our chief of mountains&quot; following Edward I&#x27;s conquest of Wales in 1284, which could indicate the possibility of earlier ascents.

The six main paths were mapped by the Google Trekker in 2015. The elevations and gradients given here are for the start point on a public road, based on Ordnance Survey mapping. Other definitions are possible so alternative figures can be found (e.g.).
====Llanberis Path====
Length: . Elevation gain: . Overall gradient: 1 in 7.1 (14.1%).

The Llanberis Path is the longest route to the summit. It follows close to the line of the railway, and being the easiest ascent, it is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, which has a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit.

The section of the Llanberis Path above Clogwyn station has long been called the &quot;Killer Convex&quot;; in icy conditions, this convex slope can send unwary walkers over the cliffs of Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu. Four people died there in February 2009.

====Snowdon Ranger Path====

Length: . Elevation gain: . Overall gradient: 1 in 6.7 (14.9%).

The Snowdon Ranger Path () begins at the youth hostel beside Llyn Cwellyn, to the west of the mountain, served by the A4085 and Snowdon Ranger railway station. This was formerly the Saracen&#x27;s Head Inn, but was renamed under the ownership of the mountain guide John Morton. It is thought to be the oldest path to the summit.

The route begins with zigzags through turf, before reaching a flatter boggy area in front of Llyn Ffynnon-y-gwas. The path then climbs to Bwlch Cwm Brwynog, and then snakes along the ridge above Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu towards the summit. This path meets the railway, the Llanberis Path, the Crib Goch path, and the combined Pyg Track and Miners&#x27; Track all within a short distance, just below the summit.

====Rhyd Ddu path====
Length: . Elevation gain: or depending on exact start point. Overall gradient: 1 in 6.4 (15.7%).

The Rhyd Ddu path, formerly called the Beddgelert Path, leads from the village of Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge dropping west from the summit. It is considered one of the easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit. An alternative start begins at Pitt&#x27;s Head on the A4085 road.

====Watkin Path====

Length: . Elevation gain: . Overall gradient: 1 in 6.1 (16.5%).

The Watkin Path is &quot;the most demanding route direct to the summit of Snowdon&quot;, since it starts at the lowest elevation of any of the main routes and has the steepest overall gradient. It was first conceived by Sir Edward Watkin, a railway owner who had attempted to build a railway tunnel under the English Channel, and had a summer home in Nant Gwynant near the start of the path. It was originally designed as a donkey track and opened in 1892.

The start of the Watkin Path has been described as &quot;the prettiest beginning&quot; of the routes up Snowdon. It begins at Bethania on the A498 and climbs initially through old broadleaved woodland. After leaving the woods, the path climbs past the waterfalls of the Afon Llan to the glacial cirque of Cwm Llan, crossing a disused incline from an abandoned slate quarry. It then reaches Plas Cwmllan, formerly the home of the quarry manager for the South Snowdon Slate Works beyond, and later used for target practice by commandos during the Second World War. Near Plas Cwmllan is the large boulder known as Gladstone Rock, which bears a plaque commemorating a speech given in 1892 by William Ewart Gladstone, the then 82-year-old Prime Minister, on the subject of &quot;Justice for Wales&quot;. The slate workings in Cwm Llan were opened in 1840, but closed in 1882 due to the expense of transporting the slate to the sea at Porthmadog. Various buildings, including barracks and dressing sheds, remain.

From the slate quarries, the Watkin Path veers to the north-east to reach Bwlch Ciliau, the col between Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, which is marked by a large orange-brown cairn. From here, it heads west to meet the Rhyd Ddu Path at a standing stone shortly below the summit of Snowdon.

====Over Y Lliwedd====

Length: .

The route over Y Lliwedd is more frequently used for descent than ascent, and forms the second half of the Snowdon Horseshoe walk, the ascent being over Crib Goch. It is reached from the summit by following the Watkin Path down to Bwlch y Saethau, and then continuing along the ridge to the twin summits of Y Lliwedd. The path then drops down to Cwm Dyli to join the Miners&#x27; Track towards Pen-y-Pass.

====Miners&#x27; Track====

Length: . Elevation gain: . Overall gradient: 1 in 9.1 (10.9%).

The Miners&#x27; Track () begins at the car park at Pen-y-Pass, at an elevation of around , and has the shallowest overall gradient. It begins by skirting Llyn Teyrn before climbing slightly to cross the causeway over Llyn Llydaw. It follows the lake&#x27;s shoreline before climbing to Glaslyn, from where it ascends steeply towards Bwlch Glas. It is joined for most of this zigzag ascent by the Pyg Track, and on reaching the summit ridge, is united with the Llanberis Path and Snowdon Ranger Path. Derelict mine buildings are encountered along several parts of the path.

====Pyg Track====
Length: . Elevation gain: . Overall gradient: 1 in 7.3 (13.7%).

The &quot;Pyg Track&quot; (), or &quot;Pig Track&quot; (both spellings may be encountered), also leads from Pen-y-Pass. The track climbs over Bwlch y Moch on the eastern flanks of Crib Goch, before traversing that ridge&#x27;s lower slopes. Above Glaslyn, it is joined by the Miners&#x27; Track for the zigzag climb to Bwlch Glas between Snowdon and Garnedd Ugain, where it joins the combined Llanberis and Snowdon Ranger paths.

From the website of the Snowdonia National Park Authority,

====Crib Goch====
Length: .

The traverse of has been described as &quot;one of the finest ridge walks in Britain&quot;, and forms part of the Snowdon Horseshoe, a circuit of the peaks surrounding Cwm Dyli. The path follows the Pyg Track before separating off from it at and leading up the East ridge of Crib Goch. After the Crib Goch ridge, it descends slightly to Bwlch Coch, then ascends to the peak of Garnedd Ugain (), before dropping to join the Llanberis path. All routes which tackle Crib Goch are considered mountaineering routes or scrambles.

==Snowdon Mountain Railway==

The Snowdon Mountain Railway (SMR) () is a narrow-gauge rack-and-pinion mountain railway that travels for from Llanberis to the Summit station of Snowdon. It is the only public rack and pinion railway in the United Kingdom, and after more than 100 years of operation it remains a popular tourist attraction, carrying more than 130,000 passengers annually. Single carriage trains are pushed up the mountain by either steam locomotives or diesel locomotives. It has also previously used diesel railcars as multiple units. The railway was constructed between December 1894, when the first sod was cut by Enid Assheton-Smith (after whom locomotive No.2 was named), and February 1896, at a total cost of £63,800 (equivalent to £ as of ).

===Summit===

The first building to be erected at the Snowdon summit was in 1838 to sell refreshments, and a licence to sell intoxicating liquor was granted in 1845. Very basic accommodation was also provided for visitors. When the Snowdon Mountain Railway was opened in 1896, the company strove to get an alcohol licence for its own proposed new hotel, but being unable to, took over both summit huts by 1898.

During the 1930s, many complaints were received about the state of the facilities at the summit and in 1934/5 a new station building was erected in two phases; the upstairs accommodation was completed in 1937. It was designed by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis and included rooms for visitors and a cafe. The other operators were bought out and the ramshackle collection of buildings on the summit was cleared. The flat roof was intended to be used as a viewing platform and some photographs show it being used in this way. However, other photographs taken of the cafe show that the roof leaked, which probably explains why the practice was stopped. The Summit was taken over by government agencies during the war and the accommodation was restricted to staff use afterwards. Having become increasingly dilapidated in post-war decades, this building was described by Prince Charles as &quot;the highest slum in Wales&quot;. Its state led to a campaign to replace the building. In April 2006, Snowdonia National Park Authority, with the support of the Snowdonia Society, agreed a deal to start work on a new cafe and visitor centre complex. By mid-October 2006 the old building had been largely demolished.

The new RIBA Award-winning £8.4 million visitor centre, &#x27;, designed by Ray Hole Architects in conjunction with Arup and built by Carillion, was officially opened on 12 June 2009 by First Minister Rhodri Morgan. The Welsh National Poet, Gwyn Thomas, composed a new couplet for the new building, displayed at its entrance and on the windows, which reads &quot; / The summit of Snowdon: You are, here, nearer to Heaven&quot;. The name &quot;Hafod Eryri&quot; was chosen from several hundred put forward after a competition was held by the BBC. &#x27; is Welsh for an upland summer residence, while &quot;&quot; is the Welsh name for Snowdonia.

The summit pillar was built in 2001, the brass toposcope carrying the date 2000. This plate details exactly 100 locations—mostly other peaks—which can be seen, given ideal visibility. Of the locations mentioned, Mount Leinster (in the Blackstairs Mountains in Ireland) is the furthest, at 188 miles away, with the Wicklow Mountains (also in Ireland) being 100 miles away. Slieve Donard, in Northern Ireland, is 108 miles away. The Lake District is 100 miles away, Penmaen Dewi (St David&#x27;s Head in Pembrokeshire) is 96 miles away, Kinder Scout (in the Peak District) is 94 miles away, and the Isle of Man is 84 miles away.

Originally Snowdon and its summit were owned by three agricultural estates, Vaynol, Hafod y Llan and the Baron Hill Estate. Today the Vaynol land at the summit is owned by the Snowdonia National Park Authority, Hafod y Llan by the National Trust and the Baron Hill Estate retains its holding. The Baron Hill Estate land consists of the farm of Gwastadannas, which includes the Snowdon Horseshoe, Glaslyn, Llyn Llydaw and the northern end of Nant Gwynant.

==Welsh literature==

In Welsh folklore, the summit of Snowdon is said to be the tomb of Rhitta Gawr, a giant. This is claimed to be the reason for the Welsh name &quot;Yr Wyddfa&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the tumulus&quot;. Rhitta Gawr wore a cloak made of men&#x27;s beards, and was slain by King Arthur after claiming Arthur&#x27;s beard. Other sites with Arthurian connections include Bwlch y Saethau, on the ridge between Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, where Arthur himself is said to have died. A cairn, &quot;Carnedd Arthur&quot;, was erected at the site and was still standing as late as 1850, but no longer exists. According to the folklore, Arthur had Bedivere throw his sword &quot;Excalibur&quot; into Glaslyn, where Arthur&#x27;s body was later placed in a boat to be carried away to Afallon. Arthur&#x27;s men then retreated to a cave on the slopes of Y Lliwedd, where they are said to sleep until such time as they are needed. Merlin is supposed to have hidden the golden throne of Britain among the cliffs north of Crib y Ddysgl when the Saxons invaded.
Glaslyn was also the final resting place of a water monster, known as an &quot;&quot; (also the Welsh word for beaver), which had plagued the people of the Conwy valley. They tempted the monster out of the water with a young girl, before securing it with chains and dragging it to Glaslyn. A large stone known as Maen Du&#x27;r Arddu, below Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu, is supposed to have magical powers. Like several other sites in Wales, it is said that if two people spend the night there, one will become a great poet while the other will become insane. Llyn Coch in Cwm Clogwyn has been associated with the Tylwyth Teg (fairies), including a version of the fairy bride legend.

==In popular culture==
In 1968, scenes representing the Khyber Pass were filmed for &quot;Carry On... Up the Khyber&quot; on the lower part of the Watkin Path. In 2005, Angela Douglas, one of the stars of the film, unveiled a plaque at the precise location where filming took place to commemorate the location filming. It now forms part of the North Wales Film and Television Trail run by the Wales Screen Commission.

== Injuries and deaths ==
In January and February 2009 on Snowdon there were four people who died and three of these four deaths were related to people falling. In 2021 there were four people who died on Snowdon.

In 2021 two people were injured and taken to hospital after being struck by lightning on top of Snowdon.

== Use of &quot;Yr Wyddfa&quot; in English ==
In April 2021 a motion was put forward by Gwynedd Councillor John Pughe Roberts for Snowdon to be called by its Welsh name &quot;Yr Wyddfa&quot; in all official use, and for Snowdonia to similarly be known only as &quot;Eryri&quot;. The motion, however, was rejected as the National Park already had a task group looking at the use and retention of Welsh names. An earlier petition calling for the National Park Authority to do this had been rejected by the Senedd the previous year after it was found to be the responsibility of the park itself, rather than the Welsh Government.

In May 2021, following the dismissal of the motion, YouGov conducted a poll on Snowdon&#x27;s name. Sixty per cent of Welsh adults supported the English name &quot;Snowdon&quot;, compared to 30% wanting the Welsh name . Separating by language, 59% of Welsh speakers preferred the Welsh name, while 37% wanted &quot;Snowdon&quot; to not be scrapped entirely; 69% of non-Welsh speakers firmly supported &quot;Snowdon&quot; as the mountain&#x27;s name.

In November 2022, Snowdonia National Park Authority voted to use &quot;Yr Wyddfa&quot; and &quot;Eryri&quot; (rather than Snowdon and Snowdonia) in its usage, though in statutory documents both Welsh and English will still be required by law.

In November 2024, the authority stated that the name change had been a &quot;success&quot; as many businesses and media had followed suit. The authority stated that a summer survey showed &quot;strong support&quot; from locals and visitors for the name change. While some concerns were raised over misconceptions by some that the Welsh names were new and mispronunciations, the authority stated that the change resulted in the park being more associated with a Welsh identity, and more different from other UK national parks. The authority is set to make a pronunciation guide and publish a report on the change.

<text>Dorval (; ) is an on-island suburban city on the island of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. In 2016, the Canadian Census indicated that the population increased by 4.2% to 18,980. Although the city has the largest surface area in Montréal’s west side, it is among the least densely populated. Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport constitutes about 60% of the city&#x27;s land; consequently, all of Dorval&#x27;s population is concentrated in the southern part of the city.

Dorval is the oldest city in the west side of Montréal, having been founded in 1667, and one of the oldest in Canada and North America.

==History==
The history of Dorval dates back more than 350 years to 1665 when Sulpician priests established a mission on the outskirts of Ville-Marie, a French settlement which later became known as Montreal. Dorval was originally named Gentilly. It was later renamed La Présentation-de-la-Vierge-Marie. In 1691, the domain of La Présentation, originally owned by Pierre Le Gardeur de Repentigny, was acquired by Jean-Baptiste Bouchard dit d&#x27;Orval. &quot;d&#x27;Orval&quot; (French for &quot;of Orval&quot;) was added to Bouchard&#x27;s name by his father Claude in reference his birthplace Orval in Montigny-Lengrain, France. It was incorporated as a village in 1892, a town in 1903, and a city in 1956 (in French it was termed a &quot;cité&quot;, an Old French term from which the English legal term &quot;city&quot; originates).

As with many other settlements on the island of Montreal, the Grand Trunk Railway, which came to Dorval in 1855, was highly instrumental in attracting many wealthier families, mostly English-speaking, in search of a summer refuge in proximity to their downtown residence and place of work. Access to Dorval from Montreal was also facilitated by the extension of streetcar service to Dorval&#x27;s eastern city limits in the interwar period.

After the Second World War many middle-class families migrated to Dorval from the city of Montreal and from other parts of Canada. This migration was made possible by the widening of highway 20 and by the large-scale construction of new dwellings. This new housing consisted mostly of single family homes with some townhouses and low-rise apartment buildings, built on lands previously used for agriculture and recreational activities. The post-war period also saw the construction of Dorval Gardens shopping centre in 1954, one of Greater Montreal&#x27;s first mall-style shopping centres. Today the shopping centre remains the city&#x27;s principal centre of retail trade.

The island named Dorval Island, settled in 1860 and located less than one kilometre offshore from Dorval, constitutes the separate city of L&#x27;Île-Dorval despite being a summer cottage community with only five permanent residents as of the Canada 2011 Census. The island is connected to the city of Dorval by a private ferry service.

On 1 January 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, Dorval was merged into the city of Montreal, being combined with L&#x27;Île-Dorval to form the Dorval–L&#x27;Île-Dorval borough of Montreal. After a change of government and a 2004 referendum, Dorval was reconstituted as a city on 1 January 2006. Although Dorval had the legal status of &quot;cité&quot; prior to the merger, the reconstituted city has the status of &quot;ville&quot; (see Types of municipalities in Quebec). Nevertheless, the municipal government refers to itself as the &quot;Cité de Dorval&quot;.

== Demographics ==

<text>Lysistrata ( or ; Attic Greek: , &quot;Lysistrátē&quot;, ) is an ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes, originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC. It is a comic account of a woman&#x27;s mission to end the Peloponnesian War between Greek city states by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was said to be the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of the warring cities to engage in a sex strike as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace – a strategy that inflames the battle between the sexes.

The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Its structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author&#x27;s career. It was produced in the same year as the &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens&#x27;s defeat in the Sicilian Expedition.

==Plot==
The play begins with these lines spoken by the Athenian Lysistrata and her friend Calonice. Women, as represented by Calonice, are sly hedonists in need of firm guidance and direction. In contrast, Lysistrata is portrayed to be an extraordinary woman with a large sense of individual and social responsibility. She has convened a meeting of women from various Greek city-states that are at war with each other. Soon after she confides in her friend her concerns for the female sex, the women begin arriving.

With support from the Spartan Lampito, Lysistrata persuades the other women to withhold sexual privileges from their menfolk as a means of forcing them to conclude the Peloponnesian War. The women are reluctant, but the deal is sealed with a solemn oath around a wine bowl in which the women abjure all their sexual pleasures, including the &quot;lioness on the cheese-grater&quot;.

Soon after the oath is finished, a cry of triumph is heard from the nearby Acropolis—the old women of Athens have seized control of it at Lysistrata&#x27;s instigation, since it holds the state treasury, without which the men cannot long continue to fund their war. Lampito goes off to spread the word of revolt, and the other women retreat behind the barred gates of the Acropolis to await the men&#x27;s response.

A Chorus of Old Men arrives, planning on burning down the gate of the Acropolis if the women do not open up. They are still making preparations to assault the gate when a Chorus of Old Women arrives, bearing pitchers of water. The Old Women complain about the difficulty they had getting the water, but they are ready for a fight in defence of their younger comrades. Threats are exchanged, and the Old Men are defeated with the water.

The magistrate then arrives with some Scythian Archers (the Athenian version of police constables). He reflects on the nature of women, their devotion to wine, promiscuous sex, and exotic cults (such as to Sabazius and Adonis), but above all he blames men for poor supervision of their womenfolk. He has come for silver from the state treasury to buy oars for the fleet and he instructs his Scythians to begin levering open the gate. However, they are quickly overwhelmed by groups of women with long names.

Lysistrata restores order and allows the magistrate to question her. She explains the frustrations that women feel at a time of war when the men make decisions that affect everyone, and further complains that their wives&#x27; opinions are not listened to. She drapes her headdress over him, gives him a basket of wool and tells him that war will be a woman&#x27;s business from now on. She then explains the pity she feels for young, childless women, aging at home while the men are away on endless campaigns. When the magistrate points out that men also age, she reminds him that men can marry at any age whereas a woman has only a short time before she is considered too old. She then dresses the magistrate like a corpse for laying out, with a wreath and a fillet, and advises him that he&#x27;s dead. The magistrate storms off to report the incident to his colleagues, while Lysistrata returns to the Acropolis.

The debate is continued between the Chorus of Old Men and the Chorus of Old Women until Lysistrata returns to the stage with the news that her comrades are desperate for sex and they are beginning to desert on the silliest pretexts (for example, one woman says she has to go home to air her fabrics by spreading them on the bed). After rallying her comrades and restoring their discipline, Lysistrata again returns to the Acropolis to continue waiting for the men&#x27;s surrender.

A man suddenly appears, desperate for sex. It is Kinesias, the husband of Myrrhine. Lysistrata instructs her to torture him. Myrrhine informs Kinesias that she will have sex with him but only if he promises to end the war. He promptly agrees to these terms and the young couple prepares for sex on the spot. Myrrhine fetches a bed, a mattress, a pillow, a blanket, and a flask of oil, and after delaying the act for some time, locks herself in the Acropolis once more.

A Spartan herald then appears with a large burden (an erection) scarcely hidden inside his tunic and he requests to see the ruling council to arrange peace talks. The magistrate laughs at the herald&#x27;s situation, but agrees that peace talks should begin.

They go off to fetch the delegates. While they are gone, the Old Women make overtures to the Old Men. The two Choruses merge, singing and dancing in unison. Peace talks commence and Lysistrata introduces the Spartan and Athenian delegates to a woman called Reconciliation. The delegates cannot take their eyes off the woman; meanwhile, Lysistrata scolds both sides for past errors of judgment. The delegates briefly squabble over the peace terms, but with Reconciliation before them, they overcome their differences and retire to the Acropolis for celebrations. The war is ended.

==Historical background==
Some events that are significant for understanding the play:

* 424 BC: &quot;The Knights&quot; won first prize at the Lenaia. Its protagonist, a sausage-seller named Agoracritus, emerges at the end of the play as the improbable saviour of Athens (Lysistrata is its saviour thirteen years later).
* 421 BC: &quot;Peace&quot; was produced. Its protagonist, Trygaeus, emerges as the improbable champion of universal peace (Lysistrata&#x27;s role 10 years later). The Peace of Nicias was formalised this same year, ending the first half of the Peloponnesian War (referred to in &quot;Lysistrata&quot; as &quot;The Former War&quot;).
* 413 BC: The Athenians and their allies suffered a catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition, a turning-point in the long-running Peloponnesian War.
* 411 BC: Both &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; and &quot;Lysistrata&quot; were produced; an oligarchic revolution (one of the consequences of the Sicilian disaster) proved briefly successful.

Old Comedy was a topical genre and the playwright expected his audience to be familiar with local identities and issues. The following list of identities mentioned in the play gives some indication of the difficulty faced by any producer trying to stage &quot;Lysistrata&quot; for modern audiences:

* Korybantes: Devotees of the Asiatic goddess Cybele—Lysistrata says that Athenian men resemble them when they do their shopping in full armour, a habit she and the other women deplore.
* Hermokopidae: Vandals who mutilated the herms in Athens at the onset of the Sicilian Expedition. They are mentioned in the play as a reason why the peace delegates should not remove their cloaks, in case they too are vandalized.
* Hippias: An Athenian tyrant, he receives two mentions in the play, as a sample of the kind of tyranny that the Old Men can &quot;smell&quot; in the revolt by the women and secondly in connection with a good service that the Spartans once rendered Athens (they removed him from power by force)
* Aristogeiton: A famous tyrannicide, he is mentioned briefly here with approval by the Old Men.
* Cimon: An Athenian commander, mentioned here by Lysistrata in connection with the Spartan king &quot;Pericleides&quot; who had once requested and obtained Athenian help in putting down a revolt by helots.
* Myronides: An Athenian general in the 450s, he is mentioned by the Old Men as a good example of a hairy guy, together with Phormio, the Athenian admiral who swept the Spartans from the sea between 430 and 428 BC.
* Peisander: An Athenian aristocrat and oligarch, he is mentioned here by Lysistrata as typical of a corrupt politician exploiting the war for personal gain. He was previously mentioned in &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot;
* Demostratus: An Athenian who proposed and carried the motion in support of the Sicilian Expedition, he is mentioned briefly by the magistrate.
* Cleisthenes: A notoriously effete homosexual and the butt of many jokes in Old Comedy, he receives two mentions here, firstly as a suspected mediator between the Spartans and the Athenian women and secondly as someone that sex-starved Athenian men are beginning to consider a viable proposition.
* Theogenes: A &quot;nouveau riche&quot; politician, he is mentioned here as the husband of a woman who is expected to attend the meeting called by Lysistrata. He is lampooned earlier in &quot;The Wasps&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot;.
* Lycon: A minor politician who afterwards figured significantly in the trial of Socrates, he is mentioned here merely as the husband of a woman that the Old Men have a particular dislike for (he is mentioned also in &quot;The Wasps&quot;).
* Cleomenes I: A Spartan king, who is mentioned by the Old Men in connection with the heroism of ordinary Athenians in resisting Spartan interference in their politics.
* Leonidas: The famous Spartan king who led a Greek force against the Persians at Thermopylae, he is mentioned by the Spartan envoys in association with the Athenian victory against the Persian fleet at the Battle of Artemisium.
* Artemisia: A female ruler of Ionia, famous for her participation in the naval Battle of Salamis, she is mentioned by the Old Men with awe as a kind of Amazon.
* Homer: The epic poet is quoted in a circuitous manner when Lysistrata quotes her husband who quotes from a speech by Hector in the Iliad as he farewells his wife before going to battle: &quot;War will be men&#x27;s business.&quot;
* Aeschylus: The tragic poet is mentioned briefly as the source of a ferocious oath that Lysistrata proposes to her comrades, in which a shield is to be filled with blood; the oath is found in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;.
* Euripides: The dramatic poet receives two brief mentions here, in each case by the Old Men with approval as a misogynist.
* Pherecrates: A contemporary comic poet, he is quoted by Lysistrata as the author of the saying: &quot;to skin a flayed dog.&quot;
* Bupalus: A sculptor who is known to have made a caricature of the satirist Hipponax he is mentioned here briefly by the Old Men in reference to their own desire to assault rebellious women.
* Micon: An artist, he is mentioned briefly by the Old Men in reference to Amazons (because he depicted a battle between Theseus and Amazons on the Painted Stoa).
* Timon: The legendary misanthrope, he is mentioned here with approval by the Old Women in response to the Old Men&#x27;s favourable mention of Melanion, a legendary misogynist
* Orsilochus and Pellene: An Athenian pimp and a prostitute, mentioned briefly to illustrate sexual desire.
Pellene was also the name of a Peloponnesian town resisting Spartan pressure to contribute to naval operations against Athens at this time. It was mentioned earlier in the &quot;Birds&quot;.

==Writing conventions==
&quot;Lysistrata&quot; belongs to the middle period of Aristophanes&#x27;s career when he was beginning to diverge significantly from the conventions of Old Comedy. Such variations from convention include:

* The divided Chorus: The Chorus begins this play being divided (Old Men versus Old Women), and its unification later in the play is meant to exemplify reconciliation. A doubling of the role of the Chorus occurs in two other middle-period plays, &quot;The Frogs&quot; and &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, but in each of those plays the two Choruses appear consecutively rather than simultaneously. The nearest equivalent to &quot;Lysistrata&#x27;s&quot; divided Chorus is found in the earliest of the surviving plays, &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, where the Chorus very briefly divides into factions for and against the protagonist.
* Parabasis: In Classical Greek comedy, parabasis is &#x27;a speech in which the chorus comes forward and addresses the audience&#x27;. A parabasis is not featured in &quot;Lysistrata&quot;. Most plays have a second parabasis near the end, and a feature akin to a parabasis is used in this play as a replacement, however it comprises exclusively two songs (strophe and antistrophe) which are separated by an episodic scene of dialogue.
* Agon: The plays of Aristophanes contain formal disputes or agons that are constructed for rhetorical effect. Lysistrata&#x27;s debate with the proboulos (magistrate) is an unusual agon in that one character (Lysistrata) does a majority of the talking, while the antagonist&#x27;s dialogue (the magistrate) is reserved for questions or expressions of emotion. The informality of the agon draws attention to the absurdity of a classical woman engaging in public debate. Like most agons, it is structured symmetrically in two sections, each half comprising long verses of anapests that are introduced by a choral song and that end in a pnigos.

<text>A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program. A programming language can be classified as supporting one or more paradigms.

Paradigms are separated along and described by different dimensions of programming. Some paradigms are about implications of the execution model, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are about the way code is organized, such as grouping into units that include both state and behavior. Yet others are about syntax and grammar.

Some common programming paradigms include (shown in hierarchical relationship):
* Imperative code directly controls execution flow and state change, explicit statements that change a program state
** procedural organized as procedures that call each other
** object-oriented organized as objects that contain both data structure and associated behavior, uses data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions (objects) to design programs
*** Class-based – object-oriented programming in which inheritance is achieved by defining classes of objects, versus the objects themselves
*** Prototype-based – object-oriented programming that avoids classes and implements inheritance via cloning of instances
* Declarative code declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it, describes what computation should perform, without specifying detailed state changes
** functional a desired result is declared as the value of a series of function evaluations, uses evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data
** logic a desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules, uses explicit mathematical logic for programming
** reactive a desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change
*Concurrent programming – has language constructs for concurrency, these may involve multi-threading, support for distributed computing, message passing, shared resources (including shared memory), or futures
**Actor programming – concurrent computation with &quot;actors&quot; that make local decisions in response to the environment (capable of selfish or competitive behaviour)
*Constraint programming – relations between variables are expressed as constraints (or constraint networks), directing allowable solutions (uses constraint satisfaction or simplex algorithm)
*Dataflow programming – forced recalculation of formulas when data values change (e.g. spreadsheets)
*Distributed programming – has support for multiple autonomous computers that communicate via computer networks
*Generic programming – uses algorithms written in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated as needed for specific types provided as parameters
*Metaprogramming – writing programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime
**Template metaprogramming – metaprogramming methods in which a compiler uses templates to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled
**Reflective programming – metaprogramming methods in which a program modifies or extends itself
*Pipeline programming – a simple syntax change to add syntax to nest function calls to language originally designed with none
*Rule-based programming – a network of rules of thumb that comprise a knowledge base and can be used for expert systems and problem deduction &amp; resolution
*Visual programming – manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually (e.g. Simulink); also termed &quot;diagrammatic programming&quot;

== Overview ==
Programming paradigms come from computer science research into existing practices of software development. The findings allow for describing and comparing programming practices and the languages used to code programs. For perspective, other fields of research study 
software engineering processes and describe various methodologies to describe and compare them.

A programming language can be described in terms of paradigms. Some languages support only one paradigm. For example, Smalltalk supports object-oriented and Haskell supports functional. Most languages support multiple paradigms. For example, a program written in C++, Object Pascal, or PHP can be purely procedural, purely object-oriented, or can contain aspects of both paradigms, or others. 

When using a language that supports multiple paradigms, the developer chooses which paradigm elements to use. But, this choice may not involve considering paradigms per se. The developer often uses the features of a language as the language provides them and to the extent that the developer knows them. Categorizing the resulting code by paradigm is often an academic activity done in retrospect.

Languages categorized as imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code. The communication between the units of code is not explicit.

In contrast, languages in the declarative paradigm do not state the order in which to execute operations. Instead, they supply a number of available operations in the system, along with the conditions under which each is allowed to execute. The implementation of the language&#x27;s execution model tracks which operations are free to execute and chooses the order independently. More at Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages.

In object-oriented programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that is owned by and (usually) controlled by the code of the object. Most object-oriented languages are also imperative languages.

In object-oriented programming, programs are treated as a set of interacting objects. In functional programming, programs are treated as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, in process-oriented programming, programs are treated as sets of concurrent processes that act on a logical shared data structures.

Many programming paradigms are as well known for the techniques they &quot;forbid&quot; as for those they &quot;support&quot;. For instance, pure functional programming disallows side-effects, while structured programming disallows the goto construct. Partly for this reason, new paradigms are often regarded as doctrinaire or overly rigid by those accustomed to older ones. Yet, avoiding certain techniques can make it easier to understand program behavior, and to prove theorems about program correctness.

Programming paradigms can also be compared with &quot;programming models&quot;, which allows invoking an execution model by using only an API. Programming models can also be classified into paradigms based on features of the execution model.

For parallel computing, using a programming model instead of a language is common. The reason is that details of the parallel hardware leak into the abstractions used to program the hardware. This causes the programmer to have to map patterns in the algorithm onto patterns in the execution model (which have been inserted due to leakage of hardware into the abstraction). As a consequence, no one parallel programming language maps well to all computation problems. Thus, it is more convenient to use a base sequential language and insert API calls to parallel execution models via a programming model. Such parallel programming models can be classified according to abstractions that reflect the hardware, such as shared memory, distributed memory with message passing, notions of &quot;place&quot; visible in the code, and so forth. These can be considered flavors of programming paradigm that apply to only parallel languages and programming models.

== Criticism ==

Some programming language researchers criticise the notion of paradigms as a classification of programming languages, e.g. Harper, and Krishnamurthi. They argue that many programming languages cannot be strictly classified into one paradigm, but rather include features from several paradigms. See Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages.

== History ==

Different approaches to programming have developed over time. Classification of each approach was either described at the time the approach was first developed, but often not until some time later, retrospectively. An early approach consciously identified as such is structured programming, advocated since the mid 1960s. The concept of a &quot;programming paradigm&quot; as such dates at least to 1978, in the Turing Award lecture of Robert W. Floyd, entitled &quot;The Paradigms of Programming&quot;, which cites the notion of paradigm as used by Thomas Kuhn in his &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962). Early programming languages did not have clearly defined programming paradigms and sometimes programs made extensive use of goto statements. Liberal use of which lead to spaghetti code which is difficult to understand and maintain. This led to the development of structured programming paradigms that disallowed the use of goto statements; only allowing the use of more structured programming constructs.

== Languages and paradigms ==

=== Machine code ===

Machine code is the lowest-level of computer programming as it is machine instructions that define behavior at the lowest level of abstract possible for a computer. As it is the most prescriptive way to code it is classified as imperative.

It is sometimes called the first-generation programming language.

=== Assembly ===

Assembly language introduced mnemonics for machine instructions and memory addresses. Assembly is classified as imperative and is sometimes called the second-generation programming language.

In the 1960s, assembly languages were developed to support library COPY and quite sophisticated conditional macro generation and preprocessing abilities, CALL to subroutine, external variables and common sections (globals), enabling significant code re-use and isolation from hardware specifics via the use of logical operators such as READ/WRITE/GET/PUT. Assembly was, and still is, used for time-critical systems and often in embedded systems as it gives the most control of what the machine does.

=== Procedural languages ===

Procedural languages, also called the third-generation programming languages are the first described as high-level languages. They support vocabulary related to the problem being solved. For example,
* COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL) uses terms like file, move and copy.
* FORmula TRANslation (FORTRAN) using mathematical language terminology, it was developed mainly for scientific and engineering problems.
* ALGOrithmic Language (ALGOL) focused on being an appropriate language to define algorithms, while using mathematical language terminology, targeting scientific and engineering problems, just like FORTRAN.
* Programming Language One (PL/I) a hybrid commercial-scientific general purpose language supporting pointers.
* Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) it was developed to enable more people to write programs.
* C a general-purpose programming language, initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.

These languages are classified as procedural paradigm. They directly control the step by step process that a computer program follows. The efficacy and efficiency of such a program is therefore highly dependent on the programmer&#x27;s skill.

=== Object-oriented programming ===

In attempt to improve on procedural languages, object-oriented programming (OOP) languages were created, such as Simula, Smalltalk, C++, Eiffel, Python, PHP, Java, and C#. In these languages, data and methods to manipulate the data are in the same code unit called an object. This encapsulation ensures that the only way that an object can access data is via &quot;methods&quot; of the object that contains the data. Thus, an object&#x27;s inner workings may be changed without affecting code that uses the object. 

There is controversy raised by Alexander Stepanov, Richard Stallman and other programmers, concerning the efficacy of the OOP paradigm versus the procedural paradigm. The need for every object to have associative methods leads some skeptics to associate OOP with software bloat; an attempt to resolve this dilemma came through polymorphism.

Although most OOP languages are third-generation, it is possible to create an object-oriented assembler language. High Level Assembly (HLA) is an example of this that fully supports advanced data types and object-oriented assembly language programming despite its early origins. Thus, differing programming paradigms can be seen rather like &quot;motivational memes&quot; of their advocates, rather than necessarily representing progress from one level to the next. Precise comparisons of competing paradigms&#x27; efficacy are frequently made more difficult because of new and differing terminology applied to similar entities and processes together with numerous implementation distinctions across languages.

=== Declarative languages ===

A declarative programming program describes what the problem is, not how to solve it. The program is structured as a set of properties to find in the expected result, not as a procedure to follow. Given a database or a set of rules, the computer tries to find a solution matching all the desired properties. An archetype of a declarative language is the fourth generation language SQL, and the family of functional languages and logic programming.

Functional programming is a subset of declarative programming. Programs written using this paradigm use functions, blocks of code intended to behave like mathematical functions. Functional languages discourage changes in the value of variables through assignment, making a great deal of use of recursion instead.

The logic programming paradigm views computation as automated reasoning over a body of knowledge. Facts about the problem domain are expressed as logic formulas, and programs are executed by applying inference rules over them until an answer to the problem is found, or the set of formulas is proved inconsistent.

=== Other paradigms ===

Symbolic programming is a paradigm that describes programs able to manipulate formulas and program components as data. Programs can thus effectively modify themselves, and appear to &quot;learn&quot;, making them suited for applications such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural-language processing and computer games. Languages that support this paradigm include Lisp and Prolog.

Differentiable programming structures programs so that they can be differentiated throughout, usually via automatic differentiation.

Literate programming, as a form of imperative programming, structures programs as a human-centered web, as in a hypertext essay: documentation is integral to the program, and the program is structured following the logic of prose exposition, rather than compiler convenience.

Symbolic programming techniques such as reflective programming (reflection), which allow a program to refer to itself, might also be considered as a programming paradigm. However, this is compatible with the major paradigms and thus is not a real paradigm in its own right.

<doc id="189899" wikidata="Q528588" url="?curid=189899" title="Constraint programming">
<text>Constraint programming (CP) is a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, and operations research. In constraint programming, users declaratively state the constraints on the feasible solutions for a set of decision variables. Constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found. In addition to constraints, users also need to specify a method to solve these constraints. This typically draws upon standard methods like chronological backtracking and constraint propagation, but may use customized code like a problem-specific branching heuristic.

Constraint programming takes its root from and can be expressed in the form of constraint logic programming, which embeds constraints into a logic program. This variant of logic programming is due to Jaffar and Lassez, who extended in 1987 a specific class of constraints that were introduced in Prolog II. The first implementations of constraint logic programming were Prolog III, CLP(R), and CHIP.

Instead of logic programming, constraints can be mixed with functional programming, term rewriting, and imperative languages.
Programming languages with built-in support for constraints include Oz (functional programming) and Kaleidoscope (imperative programming). Mostly, constraints are implemented in imperative languages via &quot;constraint solving toolkits&quot;, which are separate libraries for an existing imperative language.

==Constraint logic programming==
Constraint programming is an embedding of constraints in a host language. The first host languages used were logic programming languages, so the field was initially called &quot;constraint logic programming&quot;. The two paradigms share many important features, like logical variables and backtracking. Today most Prolog implementations include one or more libraries for constraint logic programming.

The difference between the two is largely in their styles and approaches to modeling the world. Some problems are more natural (and thus, simpler) to write as logic programs, while some are more natural to write as constraint programs.

The constraint programming approach is to search for a state of the world in which a large number of constraints are satisfied at the same time. A problem is typically stated as a state of the world containing a number of unknown variables. The constraint program searches for values for all the variables.

Temporal concurrent constraint programming (TCC) and non-deterministic temporal concurrent constraint programming (MJV) are variants of constraint programming that can deal with time.

==Constraint satisfaction problem==
A constraint is a relation between multiple variables that limits the values these variables can take simultaneously.
Three categories of constraints exist:
* extensional constraints: constraints are defined by enumerating the set of values that would satisfy them;
* arithmetic constraints: constraints are defined by an arithmetic expression, i.e., using formula_1;
* logical constraints: constraints are defined with an explicit semantics, i.e., &quot;AllDifferent&quot;, &quot;AtMost&quot;,&quot;...&quot;

}, \mathcal{V_{\mathcal{A}}})&lt;/math&gt; where:
* formula_2 is a subset of variable;
* formula_3 is the tuple of the values taken by the assigned variables.

Assignment is the association of a variable to a value from its domain. A partial assignment is when a subset of the variables of the problem has been assigned. A total assignment is when all the variables of the problem have been assigned.

}, \mathcal{V_{\mathcal{A}}})&lt;/math&gt; an assignment (partial or total) of a CSP formula_4, and formula_5 a constraint of formula_6 such as formula_7, the assignment formula_8 satisfies the constraint formula_9 if and only if all the values formula_10 of the variables of the constraint formula_9 belongs to formula_12.

During the search of the solutions of a CSP, a user can wish for:

* finding a solution (satisfying all the constraints);
* finding all the solutions of the problem;
* proving the unsatisfiability of the problem.

== Constraint optimization problem ==

A constraint optimization problem (COP) is a constraint satisfaction problem associated to an objective function.

An &quot;optimal solution&quot; to a minimization (maximization) COP is a solution that minimizes (maximizes) the value of the &quot;objective function&quot;. 

During the search of the solutions of a COP, a user can wish for:

* finding a solution (satisfying all the constraints);

* finding the best solution with respect to the objective;
* proving the optimality of the best found solution;
* proving the unsatisfiability of the problem.

==Perturbation vs refinement models==
Languages for constraint-based programming follow one of two approaches:
* Refinement model: variables in the problem are initially unassigned, and each variable is assumed to be able to contain any value included in its range or domain. As computation progresses, values in the domain of a variable are pruned if they are shown to be incompatible with the possible values of other variables, until a single value is found for each variable.
* Perturbation model: variables in the problem are assigned a single initial value. At different times one or more variables receive perturbations (changes to their old value), and the system propagates the change trying to assign new values to other variables that are consistent with the perturbation.
Constraint propagation in constraint satisfaction problems is a typical example of a refinement model, and formula evaluation in spreadsheets are a typical example of a perturbation model.

The refinement model is more general, as it does not restrict variables to have a single value, it can lead to several solutions to the same problem. However, the perturbation model is more intuitive for programmers using mixed imperative constraint object-oriented languages.

==Domains==
The constraints used in constraint programming are typically over some specific domains. Some popular domains for constraint programming are:

* Boolean domains, where only true/false constraints apply (SAT problem)
* integer domains, rational domains
* interval domains, in particular for scheduling problems
* linear domains, where only linear functions are described and analyzed (although approaches to non-linear problems do exist)
* domains, where constraints are defined over finite sets
* mixed domains, involving two or more of the above

Finite domains is one of the most successful domains of constraint programming. In some areas (like operations research) constraint programming is often identified with constraint programming over finite domains.

== Constraint propagation ==

Local consistency conditions are properties of constraint satisfaction problems related to the consistency of subsets of variables or constraints. They can be used to reduce the search space and make the problem easier to solve. Various kinds of local consistency conditions are leveraged, including node consistency, arc consistency, and path consistency.

Every local consistency condition can be enforced by a transformation that changes the problem without changing its solutions. Such a transformation is called constraint propagation. Constraint propagation works by reducing domains of variables, strengthening constraints, or creating new ones. This leads to a reduction of the search space, making the problem easier to solve by some algorithms. Constraint propagation can also be used as an unsatisfiability checker, incomplete in general but complete in some particular cases.

== Constraint solving ==
There are three main algorithmic techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems: backtracking search, local search, and dynamic programming.

=== Backtracking search ===

Backtracking search is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (&quot;backtracks&quot;) as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

=== Local Search ===

Local search is an incomplete method for finding a solution to a problem. It is based on iteratively improving an assignment of the variables until all constraints are satisfied. In particular, local search algorithms typically modify the value of a variable in an assignment at each step. The new assignment is close to the previous one in the space of assignment, hence the name &quot;local search&quot;.

=== Dynamic programming ===

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. It refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.

== Example ==
The syntax for expressing constraints over finite domains depends on the host language. The following is a Prolog program that solves the classical alphametic puzzle SEND+MORE=MONEY in constraint logic programming:

% This code works in both YAP and SWI-Prolog using the environment-supplied
% CLPFD constraint solver library. It may require minor modifications to work
% in other Prolog environments or using other constraint solvers.
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).
sendmore(Digits) :-
 Digits = [S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y], % Create variables
 Digits ins 0..9, % Associate domains to variables
 S #\= 0, % Constraint: S must be different from 0
 M #\= 0,
 all_different(Digits), % all the elements must take different values
 1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D % Other constraints
 + 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E
 #= 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,
 label(Digits). % Start the search
The interpreter creates a variable for each letter in the puzzle. The operator codice_1 is used to specify the domains of these variables, so that they range over the set of values {0,1,2,3, ..., 9}. The constraints codice_2 and codice_3 means that these two variables cannot take the value zero. When the interpreter evaluates these constraints, it reduces the domains of these two variables by removing the value 0 from them. Then, the constraint codice_4 is considered; it does not reduce any domain, so it is simply stored. The last constraint specifies that the digits assigned to the letters must be such that &quot;SEND+MORE=MONEY&quot; holds when each letter is replaced by its corresponding digit. From this constraint, the solver infers that M=1. All stored constraints involving variable M are awakened: in this case, constraint propagation on the codice_5 constraint removes value 1 from the domain of all the remaining variables. Constraint propagation may solve the problem by reducing all domains to a single value, it may prove that the problem has no solution by reducing a domain to the empty set, but may also terminate without proving satisfiability or unsatisfiability. The label literals are used to actually perform search for a solution.

<doc id="189900" wikidata="Q139101" url="?curid=189900" title="Hampstead, Quebec">
<text>Hampstead is an on-island suburb of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is an independent municipality bordering the municipality of Côte Saint-Luc and the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal.

==History==

The Town of Hampstead was founded in 1914. It was designed to be an exclusive garden city. There are no retail shops within municipal boundaries. Houses were assigned relatively large lots to allow space for trees and shrubbery. The town&#x27;s roads were designed with curves in order to slow down traffic and to create an interesting and intimate landscape. Despite its rather flat topography—much of the territory was once a golf course—the town was named after another garden city, the London suburb of Hampstead Village. Like its namesake, Hampstead is the home of many affluent citizens, and competes with a few other suburbs for first place in the rankings of highest average household incomes in Canada.

===Merger and demerger===
On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–06 municipal reorganization of Montreal, it was merged with Côte-Saint-Luc and Montreal West and became the Côte-Saint-Luc–Hampstead–Montréal-Ouest borough of the City of Montreal. However, after a change of government and a 2004 referendum, all three were re-constituted as independent cities on January 1, 2006.

== Demographics ==
According to the Office québécois de la langue française, Hampstead has been officially recognized as a bilingual municipality since 2005-11-02.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hampstead had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


In terms of mother tongue, the 2006 census found that, including multiple responses, almost 63% of residents spoke English, and about 16% of residents spoke French. The next most commonly reported first languages learned were Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish and Romanian. 


The town is noted for having the highest percentage of Jewish residents of any city in Canada, and the third highest worldwide outside Israel.

==Local government==
In the November 6, 2005 municipal elections, William (Bill) Steinberg was elected mayor of Hampstead. Steinberg was the first new mayor after 4 years of civic control by Gérald Tremblay, when Hampstead was part of Montreal. Mayor Steinberg defeated Irving Adessky who had been mayor for 27 years (1974-2001) and former councillor Gerald Kestner. In his honour, the community centre has been renamed after him. Steinberg was re-elected on November 1, 2009 defeating former town councillor David Sternthal with 61% of the vote. On November 3, 2013 Mayor Steinberg was re-elected for a third term defeating former town councillor Bonnie Feigenbaum with 61.21% of the vote (voter turnout was 44.5%). In the 2017 Municipal Elections, Steinberg, Warren Budning, Harvey Shaffer, Jack Edery, and Michael Goldwax were acclaimed. Bill Steinberg served as Mayor for 16 years (2005-2021).

==Transportation==
Two major thoroughfares exist in Hampstead. One is Queen Mary Road and the other is Fleet Road. While it is difficult to drive quickly down Queen Mary (because of all the stop signs), Fleet Road is geared for automobile traffic, with synchronized traffic lights.

Hampstead is accessible by the following STM bus lines: 51 Édouard-Montpetit (Queen-Mary), 66 The Boulevard (Côte-Saint-Luc), 161 Van Horne (Fleet), 166 Queen Mary (Macdonald).

There were various stages of development for Hampstead. The newer areas tend to be to the north and to the west. The city is almost completely composed of single family residences, except for the apartment buildings on Côte-Saint-Luc Road, and the duplexes and triplexes along MacDonald, Cleve, Dufferin, Heath, Holtham, Harrow and Aldred Roads. There are no commercial properties in the city. There is only one school in the city, the Hampstead Elementary School, which is public.

At the beginning of each summer is Hampstead Day, which features a small carnival and fireworks, curated by the staff of the Hampstead Pool and of the Hampstead Day Camp.

<text>Print on demand (POD) is a printing technology and business process in which book copies (or other documents, packaging, or materials) are not printed until the company receives an order, allowing prints in single or small quantities. While other industries established the build-to-order business model, POD could only develop after the beginning of digital printing because it was not economical to print single copies using traditional printing technologies such as letterpress and offset printing.

Many traditional small presses have replaced their traditional printing equipment with POD equipment or contracted their printing to POD service providers. Many academic publishers, including university presses, use POD services to maintain large backlists (lists of older publications); some use POD for all of their publications. Larger publishers may use POD in special circumstances, such as reprinting older, out-of-print titles or for test marketing.

==Predecessors==
Before the introduction of digital printing technology, production of small numbers of publications had many limitations. Large print jobs were not a problem, but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine. These produced printed pages of inferior quality to a book, cheaply and reasonably fast. By about 1950, electrostatic copiers were available to make paper master plates for offset duplicating machines. From about 1960, copying onto plain paper became possible for photocopy machines to make multiple good-quality copies of a monochrome original.

In 1966, Frederik Pohl discussed in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; &quot;a proposal for high-speed facsimile machines which would produce a book to your order, anywhere in the world&quot;. As the magazine&#x27;s editor, he said that &quot;it, or something like it, is surely the shape of the publishing business some time in the future&quot;. As technology advanced, it became possible to store text in digital form paper tape, punched cards readable by digital computer, magnetic mass storage, etc. and to print on a teletypewriter, line printer or other computer printer, but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable.

== Book publishing ==
Print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy, regardless of the size of the order. While the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing, the average cost is lower for very small print jobs, because setup costs are much greater for offset printing.

POD has other business benefits besides lesser costs (for small jobs):
* Technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing.
* Large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock, reducing storage, handling costs, and inventory accounting costs.
* There is little or no waste from unsold products.
* Many publishers use POD for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof, catalogs and review copies. 
These advantages reduce the risks associated with publishing books and prints and can result in increased choice for consumers. However, the reduced risks for the publisher can also mean that quality control is less rigorous than usual.

== Other publishing ==

Digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters (often as a single copy) when they are needed. The introduction of ultraviolet-curable inks and media for large-format inkjet printers has allowed artists, photographers and owners of image collections to take advantage of print on demand.

For example, UK art retailer King and McGaw fulfills many of its art print orders by printing on-demand rather than pre-printing and storing them until they are sold, requiring less space and reducing overheads to the business. This was brought about after a fire destroyed £3 million worth of stock and damage to their warehouse.

== Service providers ==
The introduction of POD technologies and business models has created a range of new book creation and publishing opportunities. There are three main categories of offerings.

=== Self-publishing authors ===
POD creates a new category of publishing (or printing) company that offers services, usually for a fee, directly to authors who wish to self-publish. These services generally include printing and shipping each individual book ordered, handling royalties, and getting listings in online bookstores. The initial investment required for POD services is less than for offset printing. Other services may also be available, including formatting, proofreading, and editing, but such companies typically do not spend money for marketing, unlike conventional publishers. Such companies are suitable for authors prepared to design and promote their work themselves, with minimal assistance and at minimal cost. POD publishing gives authors editorial independence, speed to market, ability to revise content, and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers.

=== POD enablement ===
While amateur/professional writers are targeted as early adopters by some companies, there is an effort to make POD more mass-market. A class of companies have chosen to be &quot;author-agnostic&quot;, attempting to serve a broad mass-market of ordinary citizens who may want to express, record and print keepsake copies of memories and personal writing (diaries, travelogues, wedding journals, baby books, family reunion reports etc.). Instead of tailoring themselves to the classic book format (at least 100 pages, mostly text, complex rules for copyright and royalties), these companies strive to make POD more mass-market by creating programs by which a range of different text and picture items can be produced as finished books. The management of copyrights and royalties is often less important for this market, as the books themselves have a small clientele (close family and friends, for instance).

The major photo storage services have included the ability to produce picture books and calendars. However, they emphasize digital photography. Some companies apply this method to a greater volume of creative work (primarily text, as typed in personal weblogs) and include the capability to embed photographs and other media. Others assume the role of an infrastructure service provider, allowing any partner website to use its pre-designed payment and printing functions.

=== Publisher use ===
Print-on-demand services that offer printing and distributing services to publishing companies (instead of directly to self-publishing authors) are also growing in popularity within the industry. Many major publishers print on demand as a way to save money on inventory costs. Print on demand also allows texts to be revised and published more quickly. 

==== Maintaining availability ====
Among traditional publishers, POD services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out, but another has not yet become available. This maintains the availability of older works, the estimated future sales of which may not be great enough to justify a further conventional print job. This can be useful for publishers with large backlists, such that sales for individual works may be few, but cumulative sales may be significant.

==== Managing uncertainty ====
Print on demand can be used to reduce risk when dealing with &quot;surge&quot; publications that are expected to have large sales but a brief sales life (such as biographies of minor celebrities, or event tie-ins): these publications represent good profitability but also great risk owing to the danger of inadvertently printing many more copies than are necessary, and the associated costs of maintaining excess inventory or pulping. POD allows a publisher to use cheaper conventional printing to produce enough copies to satisfy a pessimistic forecast of the publication sales, and then rely on POD to make up the difference.

==== Variable formats ====
Print on demand also allows books to be printed in a variety of formats. This process, known as accessible publishing, allows books to be printed in a variety of larger type sizes and special formats for those with vision impairment or reading disabilities, as well as personalised typefaces and formats that suit an individual reader&#x27;s needs.

== Economics ==
Profits from print-on-demand publishing are on a per-sale basis, and royalties vary depending on the method by which the item is sold. Greatest profits are usually generated from sales direct from a print-on-demand service&#x27;s website or by the author buying copies from the service at a discount, as the publisher, and then selling them personally. Lesser royalties come from traditional bookshops and online retailers, both of which buy at high discount, although some POD companies allow the publisher or author to set their own discount level.

Because the per-unit cost is typically greater with POD than with a print job of thousands of copies, it is common for POD books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs.

Book stores order books through a wholesaler or distributor, usually at a discount of as much as 70%. Wholesalers obtain their books in two ways: either as a special order such that the book is ordered direct from a publisher when a book store requests a copy, or as stocked, which they keep in their own warehouse as part of their inventory. Stocked books are usually also available through &quot;sale or return&quot;, meaning that the book store can return unsold stock for full credit as much as one year after the initial sale.

POD books are rarely if ever available on such terms because for the publishing provider it is considered too much of a risk. However, wholesalers monitor what works are selling, and if authors promote their work successfully and achieve a reasonable number of orders from book stores or online retailers (who use the same wholesalers as the stores), then there is a reasonable chance of their work becoming available on such terms.

== Author&#x27;s Reversion Rights ==
In 1999, the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; carried an article entitled &quot;A Very Short Run&quot;, in which author Andrew Malcolm argued that under the rights-reversion clauses of older, pre-PoD contracts, copyrights would legally revert to their authors if their books were printed on demand rather than re-lithographed, and he envisaged a test case being successfully fought on this aspect. This claim was contradicted by an article entitled &quot;Eternal Life?&quot; in the Spring 2000 issue of &quot;The Author Magazine&quot; (the journal of the UK Society of Authors) by Cambridge University Press&#x27;s Business Development Director Michael Holdsworth, who argued that printing on demand keeps books &quot;permanently in print&quot;, thereby invalidating authors&#x27; reversion rights.

<text>Mount Royal ( , officially Town of Mount Royal, Ville Mont-Royal, abbreviated TMR, ) is an affluent on-island suburban town located on the northwest side of the eponymous Mount Royal, northwest of Downtown Montreal, on the Island of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is completely surrounded by the city of Montreal. The population was 20,953 as of the 2021 Canadian census. In 2008, most of the Town of Mount Royal was designated a National Historic Site of Canada, as a &quot;[remarkable] synthesis of urban renewal movements of the early 20th century, reflecting the influence of the City Beautiful, Garden City and Garden Suburb movements&quot;. The town celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012.

==History==
Town of Mount Royal, or TMR, was founded in 1912. It was created at the initiative of the Canadian Northern Railway as a means of generating funds for the tunnel to be built under the mountain, which would connect the railway to downtown Montreal. The town was designed by Frederick Todd, a planner who was heavily influenced by the likes of Sir Ebenezer Howard and incorporated many aspects of the Garden City Movement as well some elements of the earlier City Beautiful movement into his design. The plan was to build a model city at the foot of Mount Royal. The company bought of farmland, and then built a rail tunnel under Mount Royal connecting their land to downtown Montreal. The profits from the venture helped finance the development of Canadian Northern&#x27;s transcontinental railroad, which eventually became a significant constituent of the Canadian National Railway system. The town was designed by Canadian Northern&#x27;s chief engineer, Henry Wicksteed, based loosely on Washington, D.C.

The garden city&#x27;s coat of arms is composed of several significant elements:
* The royal crown, of French origin, is enclosed in the top panel and blazoned with fleurons.
* Two heraldic roses, of English origin, are stylized wild roses with two rows of five petals separated by pointed sepals.
* The stylized mountain refers to the Town&#x27;s geographic situation at the foot of Mount Royal.
* The outline of the shield ending in a point recalls the shape of the shields of ancient Greece and Rome.
* Inscribed on the scroll beneath the shield, the motto, Regium Donum, means “gift of the king.”
* Town of Mount Royal&#x27;s official signature includes the coat of arms as well as the Town&#x27;s name in French and English. The coat of arms has evolved over the years; the current version dates from 1993.

One notable feature of the town is the naming of some of its streets, and also its occasionally idiosyncratic numbering system. Some streets which pass through the town may thus bear two names (in whichever language). For example, Jean Talon Street, a large east–west thoroughfare crossing Montreal for kilometres (miles), goes a few hundred metres (yards) through TMR under the name of Dresden Avenue, only to recover its Montreal name on the other side of the town. This situation has been recently addressed by putting the two names on the street signs. On these few hundred metres (yards), TMR uses a house civic numbering totally different from that of Montreal on either side. This sort of change in the numbering system also occurs on smaller streets shared by both Montreal and TMR (for example, Trenton, Lockhart and Brookfield avenues, where the TMR numbering system decreases from East to West, only to jump from 2 to 2400 on the few metres (yards) of the street that still belong to Montreal.

In the beginning, the Town was a small farming community, known for its melons. The Daoust family farm grew the celebrated Montreal melon, also called the Montreal nutmeg melon. Green-fleshed and uniquely flavourful, the melons weighed up to 9 or 11 kg (20 or 25 lb). So special was the Montreal melon that it was exported to New York, Chicago and Boston, where, in 1921, people paid as much as $1.50 a slice to taste it. Farming was abandoned over the years, with the gradual urbanization of the Town.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, it was merged into Montreal and became a borough. However, after a change of government and a 2004 referendum, it was re-constituted as an independent town on January 1, 2006.

==Geography==

Two main thoroughfares, Laird Boulevard and Graham Boulevard, cut across the borough diagonally and meet at Connaught Park, a green space located in the centre. Mount Royal Train Station, a commuter train station on the Exo Deux-Montagnes line is located to the east of this park. This line is now undergoing construction to upgrade it for the new REM network. Trains going through the Mount Royal Tunnel link the station to downtown Montreal in eight minutes. Both boulevards end at Jean Talon Street and close to the highway.

TMR is surrounded on three sides by a highway, a fence and a rail line.

The highway is Metropolitan Boulevard, a major constituent of Autoroute 40. It was built as an elevated highway throughout, except when it passes through TMR (between Sainte Croix Avenue and L&#x27;Acadie Boulevard), since the Town council requested that it be built on the ground, in order to separate the town from the industrial area to the north.

A fence runs along the eastern border with Park Extension at L&#x27;Acadie Boulevard, a six lane thoroughfare. The stated purpose of the fence is to prevent children and house pets from running into the busy thoroughfare but some have contended that it was built to keep residents of the working-class Park Extension neighbourhood out of the town.

The rail line is the last portion of Canadian Pacific&#x27;s Adirondack subdivision. It originally ran through the northern part of the district of Côte-des-Neiges. However, when the town became part of Montreal on Jan 1, 2002, the part of Côte-des-Neiges north of rail line was incorporated into the Mount Royal borough. When the town demerged on Jan 1, 2006 this part, known as Glenmount, reverted to Côte-des-Neiges.

<doc id="189907" wikidata="Q1369534" url="?curid=189907" title="Australian Airlines">
<text>Australian Airlines was a full-service airline based in Australia, serving Australian and Asian destinations between 2002 and 2006. It was an all-economy, full-service international leisure carrier, and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas (although run independently of the mainline carrier). Its main hub was at Cairns Airport, with a secondary hub at Sydney Airport.

The airline ceased operations under its own livery on 30 June 2006, but continued to operate flights for Qantas under a wet lease agreement. This means Australian Airlines operated flights for Qantas using its own crew/cost base, but under the Qantas brand. Qantas decided to discontinue the public use of the Australian Airlines brand in favour of having Jetstar as its leisure, now low-cost carrier. Qantas and Jetstar are operating services to replace Australian Airlines&#x27; routes, with &quot;Jetstar International&quot; introduced in late 2006 to help expand the Qantas Group&#x27;s international presence.

==History==
The airline was established in 2001 and started operations on 27 October 2002, reusing the name Qantas gained when it acquired former Australian domestic carrier Australian Airlines in September 1992. Its initial network of flights concentrated on leisure tourism between Queensland and Japan. Subsequent expansion brought on other leisure destinations throughout Southeast Asia. On 12 April 2006 Geoff Dixon, CEO of the Qantas Group, announced that the group would be focusing on a two-brand strategy, the Qantas and Jetstar brands, and as such the Australian Airlines brand would cease to exist from July 2006.

The airline&#x27;s aircraft were re-painted back into the Qantas livery and returned to Qantas short-haul for use on their domestic and trans-Tasman routes. Alternative Boeing 767-300 aircraft (in Qantas two-class configuration) were supplied to Australian Airlines by Qantas, for them to operate under a wet lease agreement in the interim. Australian Airlines continued to operate under this agreement, servicing several routes to Japan including twice-daily flights to Tokyo-Narita Airport, and also flights to Manila-NAIA Airport in the Philippines.

During April 2006, Qantas confirmed that, to focus on its two-brand strategy of Qantas and Jetstar, the Group had decided that it would abandon Australian Airlines. On 30 June 2006, Australian Airlines ceased to exist, with the airline&#x27;s Boeing 767-300s and crew to still provide services from Cairns under the Qantas brand. The following day, the airline&#x27;s fleet was absorbed into Qantas&#x27;s mainline fleet. The parent company closed down the Australian Airlines operation completely at the end of August 2007.

==Destinations==

At the time before it ceased operations, Australian Airlines operated scheduled services to the following destinations:

<doc id="189908" wikidata="Q385362" url="?curid=189908" title="Edward Bruce">
<text>Edward Bruce, Earl of Carrick (Norman French: ; ; Modern Scottish Gaelic: or ; 1280 – 14 October 1318), was a younger brother of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots. He supported his brother in the 1306–1314 struggle for the Scottish crown, then pursued his own claims in Ireland. Proclaimed High King of Ireland in 1315 and crowned in 1316, he was eventually defeated and killed by Anglo-Irish forces of the Lordship of Ireland at the Battle of Faughart in County Louth in 1318.
==Early life==
Edward was one of five sons of Robert de Brus and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick, but the order is uncertain. Robert the Bruce was the eldest; in the past there was some dispute over whether Edward was second, or third behind Nigel, but one recent account has him fourth behind Nigel and Alexander. His date of birth is unknown, but it was probably not very long after Robert was born in 1274; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after. The Irish medievalist Seán Duffy suggests that he was probably fostered in Ireland as a child, likely by the O&#x27;Neills of Ulster, while Archie Duncan suggests some period of time spent with the Bissetts of the Glens of Antrim. This was a common Scottish and Irish cultural practice, and would tie in with, and perhaps explain, parts of his later life.

Edward fought alongside Robert throughout his struggle for the Scottish throne, including his desperate period on the run and as a guerrilla. The three younger Bruce brothers Nigel, Thomas and Alexander were all captured and executed by the English during this period, but Edward survived. As Marjorie the only child of Robert had also been captured by English, Edward was apparently heir to Robert.

==Campaigning against the Comyns==
After his defeat at the Battle of Barra in May 1308, King Robert&#x27;s men chased the forces of rival John Comyn, Earl of Buchan as far as Fyvie Castle. As this was a strong fortress, the pursuit ended there. Robert then commanded Edward to lay waste to the Earldom of Buchan, from end to end, including all the castles and strongholds, principally Slains Castle, Rattray Castle and Dundarg Castle as well as the castles that were in English hands such as Fyvie Castle and Aberdeen Castle. At some point after his defeat at Barra, John Comyn fled Scotland for England. 

Edward de Bruce proceeded for several months to harry Buchan and kill those who resisted King Robert&#x27;s rule, homesteads destroyed, livestock slaughtered, stores of grain destroyed, and reducing the castles. By destroying the Comyns&#x27; power base, King Robert prevented any possible chance of future violent hostility towards his rule. There is no trustworthy account of the Harrying of Buchan, but it was undoubtedly a prolonged and fiercely contested campaign.

==Later campaigns in Scotland==
Edward then played an important role in capturing and slighting English-held castles in southwest Scotland, including Rutherglen Castle which he successfully recaptured from the English in 1313. It was he who made a possibly ill-judged pact with the English governor of Stirling Castle, which led to the English sending a large army to relieve the castle. This led to the Battle of Bannockburn on 23–24 June 1314, where he commanded a Scottish schiltrom.

Some time between 1309 and 1313, Edward was created Earl of Carrick, a title previously held by his maternal grandfather Niall of Carrick, his mother and his elder brother.

==Family life==

In 1317 he was granted dispensation by the Pope to marry Isabella daughter of William, Earl of Ross, although it is doubtful that the marriage took place. He did have an illegitimate son, Alexander Bruce, who would later inherit his father&#x27;s earldom. Alexander&#x27;s mother was Isabella, daughter of John of Strathbogie, 9th Earl of Atholl.

==The invasion of Ireland==


===Historical background===
By the early 14th century, Ireland had not had a recognised High King since Ruaidrí mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (&quot;Rory O&#x27;Connor&quot;), who had been deposed by his son in 1186. The country was divided between Irish dynasties and Anglo-Irish lords, each ruling separate parts of Ireland. (In 1258 some of the dynasties and clans had elected Brian Ua Neill to the position of High King; however, he was defeated and killed by the Normans at the Battle of Downpatrick in 1260.)

As a descendant of Aoife MacMurrough (died 1188), Edward could also claim extensive royal Gaelic Irish ancestry that included Brian Boru (High King from 1002 to 1014) and Dermot MacMurrough (King of Leinster from 1126 to 1171); and also the Hiberno-Norse king Olaf Cuaran (died 980). (The Bruce brothers also descended from the kings/lords of Galloway, who were themselves a branch of the same kings of Mann and the Isles which produced Somerled (died 1164), progenitor of Clan Donald, Clan Dougall and Clan Ruari.)

Edward&#x27;s main mission in invading Ireland involved opening a second front in Scotland&#x27;s ongoing war against England and depriving the English of much-needed men, materials and finance by causing havoc in Ireland. This became critical when English-backed Scots recaptured the Isle of Man from King Robert&#x27;s control in January 1315, thereby threatening the south and south-west of Scotland and also reopening up a potential channel of aid to the English from the Anglo-Irish and native Irish.

In addition, Domhnall mac Briain Ó Néill, the king of Tír Eóghain in present-day Ulster, asked for assistance. Ó Néill had been troubled by Anglo-Irish incursions into Tír Eógain from the south-east (the de Verdons), the east (tenants of the earl of Ulster) and the west (also by the earl of Ulster). In order to retain his lands, he and some twelve of his vassals and allies jointly requested aid from Scotland. The Bruce brothers agreed, on condition of Irish support for Edward as King of Ireland—the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of Scotland and Ireland, while Robert would regain Man and Edward would possibly make an attack, with Welsh support, on English-controlled Wales. The brothers thus envisaged &quot;a grand Celtic alliance against the English&quot;, combining Scotland and Ireland—since both countries had a common Gaelic heritage.

Ó Néill approved of the conditions for himself and on behalf of his vassals, and preparations began. At about this point, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, received news from Irish sources that an invasion was about to take place, and made his way to Ireland where he held land, mainly in and around the castle and town of Trim. (He had previously fought against the Bruces at Bannockburn where he was taken prisoner and freed to return King Edward II&#x27;s royal seal, lost in the rout.)

On 26 April 1315 a Scottish parliament met at Ayr (just across the North Channel from Antrim). As King Robert did not yet have any legitimate male heir, Edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as King of Scotland and to all other titles in case of Robert&#x27;s death. Edward&#x27;s invasion fleet also mustered there, having received calls to assemble as early as the previous month.

===Arrival and the Campaign of 1315===
On 26 May 1315 Edward and his fleet (estimated at in excess of 6,000 men) landed on the Irish coast at points at and between Olderfleet Castle at Larne, and Glendrum. His brother had sailed from Tarbert for the Western Isles with his son-in-law, Walter Stewart, to subjugate them till &quot;all the isles, great and small, were brought to his will.&quot; Edward meanwhile was swiftly faced by an army led by vassals of the Earl of Ulster such as the de Mandevilles, Savages, Logans and Bissets of the Glens, and their Irish allies, led by Sir Thomas de Mandeville. However, they were defeated in battle by the Scots under Thomas Randolph. Subsequently, the Scots managed to take the town, though not the castle, of Carrickfergus.

In early June, Ó Néill and some twelve fellow northern kings and lords met Edward at Carrickfergus and swore fealty to him as King of Ireland. The Irish annals state that de Brus &quot;took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of Ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed King of Ireland and all the Gaels of Ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him King of Ireland.&quot; In fact, de Brus was never to receive anything more than purely nominal recognition from any of the more powerful Irish kings, and despite entreaties at various times over the next three years, was ignored by those whom he did not directly interest. He did, however, directly or indirectly rule much of eastern and mid-Ulster.

In late June, Edward proceeded with his army from Carrickfergus along Magh Line (Six Mile Water), burning Rathmore, near Antrim town, which was a holding of the Savages. He then went south by way of the Moiry Pass; called &quot;&quot;Innermallan&quot;/&quot;Enderwillane&quot;/Imberdiolan&quot;&quot; in contemporary accounts, between Newry and Dundalk. This ancient routeway had been for centuries the passage south out of Ulster into the Kingdom of Mide, Leinster and Munster but because of its narrowness Ulster armies had frequently ambushed and been ambushed at the pass. Here he was met by Mac Duilechain of Clanbrassil and Mac Artain of Iveagh, both of whom had submitted to him at Carrickfergus. Their attempted ambush ended in their defeat and the army pressed on, destroying de Verdon&#x27;s fortress of Castle Roche, and on 29 June attacked Dundalk. The town, another possession of the de Verdons, was almost totally destroyed with its population, both Anglo-Irish and Gaelic, massacred alike.

In July, two separate armies opposing Edward met and assembled at Sliabh Breagh, the high ground south of Ardee. One was led out of Connacht by Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and his ally, the king of Connacht, Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair. The second consisted of forces raised in Munster and Leinster by Justiciar, Sir Edmund Butler of Ormonde (father of James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond). The Scots-Irish army was located at Inniskeen, ten miles north. In between Sliabh Breagh and Inniskeen was the village of Louth. De Burgh moved his army north of Louth and set up camp while his cousin, William Liath de Burgh attempted to ambush Edward&#x27;s forces. While some skirmishing did result in a number of Scots deaths, Edward refused to give battle and instead, with the Ó Néill, retreated northwards to Coleraine via Armagh. Edward and Domhnall Ó Néill sacked and burned Coleraine, threw down the bridge over the river Bann and faced off de Burgh&#x27;s pursuing army on the opposite bank. While both sides now were experiencing shortages of food and supplies, de Brus and Ó Néill could at least draw support from local lords such as Ó Cathain and Ó Floinn. Mindful of this, de Burgh eventually withdrew back forty miles to Antrim, while Butler had to return to Ormond due to lack of supplies.

In addition to this, Edward sent separate messages both to King Felim and a rival dynast, Cathal Ua Conchobair, promising to support them if they withdrew. Cathal managed to return to Connacht and had himself proclaimed king, leaving Felim with no choice but to return to put down his rebellion. Worse was to follow: de Burgh found himself deprived of not two but three allies and their armies when his kinsman, Walter mac Walter Cattach Burke, deserted back to Connacht at the head of several hundred men, probably to guard his own estates from the upcoming conflict. Thus, when in August Edward and his men crossed the Bann in four ships supplied by Scots sea captain, Thomas Dun, de Burgh retreated still further to Connor, where on either the first or ninth of September a charge by the Scots-Irish led to his defeat. William Liath was captured and taken as hostage to Scotland by Moray who arrived there on 15 September 1315 to raise more troops, &quot;his ships filled with booty&quot;. De Burgh retreated back to Connacht, while other Anglo-Irish took refuge in Carrickfergus Castle.

Finally apprised of the seriousness of the situation, Edward II had on 1 September ordered an assembly of the leading Anglo-Irish, which met at Parliament in Dublin in late October, but no decisive action was taken. On 13 November 1315, Edward marched further south via Dundalk where, incredibly, &quot;some gave them the right hand&quot; (a fight), occupied Nobber on 30 November, and advanced to Kells, where he was met by Mortimer. Mortimer had managed to raise a large force consisting both of his Anglo-Irish and Gaelic vassals, in addition to forces of other magnates. At the same time, Edward was reinforced by Moray who had returned from Scotland with around five hundred fresh troops and supplies.

The Battle of Kells followed, with Mortimer being decisively defeated by Edward. Mortimer was forced to retreat to Dublin while his lieutenant, Walter Cusack, held out at Trim. He almost immediately set sail for England to urge Edward II for reinforcements. At the same time, Governor of Ireland (and Bishop of Ely) John Hotham began to take drastic action to defend Dublin from de Brus, such as leveling entire tenements and churches.

After sacking and burning Kells, Edward proceeded to do the same to Granard, Finnea, the Cistercian monastery of Abbeyleix and raided Angaile (Annaly), the lordship of Gaelic lord O Hanely. De Brus spent Christmas at de Verdon&#x27;s manor of Loughsewdy, consuming its supplies entirely and before leaving, razing it to the ground. The only manors left alone belonged to Irish lords intimidated to join him, or that of a junior branch of the de Lacy family who in an effort to gain lands voluntarily joined him.

===Famine===

At first the Irish/Scottish alliance seemed unstoppable as they won battle after battle. In less than a year they had most of Ireland in their control. However, by the beginning of 1317 famine had stricken most of the country making it difficult for Edward to provide food to most of his men. Shortly, King Robert returned to Scotland and management of his own kingdom, but promised more aid and more volunteers to help his brother. For almost a year the Anglo-Norman barons did little to retake any land since the famine made it difficult for either side to provide food to soldiers in the field.

===Irish kings&#x27; Remonstrance of 1317===
As rule over Ireland had been offered to the Plantagenets by the papal bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; in 1155, Edward&#x27;s allies, led by Donall O&#x27;Neill, sent a remonstrance to Pope John XXII in 1317. This asked for &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; to be revoked and informed the Pope that they had chosen Edward as their king:
The Papacy neither recognised Edward&#x27;s claim, nor agreed with the Remonstrance, and his rule remained &quot;de facto&quot; over parts of Ireland and never &quot;de jure&quot; over the whole island.

===Battle of Faughart===

Then in the late summer of 1318, Sir John de Bermingham with his army began a march against Edward. On 14 October 1318, the Scots-Irish army was badly defeated at the Battle of Faughart by de Bermingham&#x27;s forces. Edward was killed, his body being quartered and the parts sent to various towns in Ireland, and his head being delivered to King Edward II. In the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; (erroneously under the year 1315) the hostility towards Edward Bruce among both the Anglo-Irish and Irish alike is evident:&quot;Edward de Brus, the destroyer of Ireland in general, both Foreigners and Gaels, was killed by the Foreigners of Ireland by dint of fighting at Dun-Delgan. And there were killed in his company Mac Ruaidhri, king of Insi-Gall Hebrides and Mac Domhnaill, king of Argyll, together with slaughter of the Men of Scotland around him. And there was not done from the beginning of the world a deed that was better for the Men of Ireland than that deed. For there came death and loss of people during his time in all Ireland in general for the space of three years and a half and people undoubtedly used to eat each other throughout Ireland.&quot;

<doc id="189909" wikidata="Q7499869" url="?curid=189909" title="Shock jock">
<text>A shock jock is a radio broadcaster or DJ who entertains listeners and attracts attention using humor or melodramatic exaggeration that may offend some portion of the listening audience. The term is used pejoratively to describe provocative or irreverent broadcasters whose mannerisms, statements and actions are typically offensive to much of society. It is a popular term within the radio industry. A shock jock is the radio equivalent of the tabloid newspaper in that both consider entertaining their audience to be as important as—if not more important than—providing factual information. A radio station that relies primarily on shock jocks for programming has what is called a hot talk format.

The term is used in two broad, yet sometimes overlapping, contexts:

# The radio announcer who deliberately makes outrageous, controversial, or shocking statements, or does boundary-pushing stunts to improve ratings.
# The political radio announcer who has an emotional outburst in response to a controversial government policy decision.

==Background==
The idea of an entertainer who breaks taboos or who is deliberately offensive is not a new one: Blue comedians have existed throughout history; take, for example, offensive performers such as George Carlin, Petronius, Benny Bell, Le Pétomane, Redd Foxx and Lenny Bruce. Petey Greene, who started broadcasting in 1966, has been called the original radio shock jock by some, although the term was not used until 1986, two years after Greene&#x27;s death. Greene was an influence on Howard Stern, whose radio shows in the 1980s led to the first widespread use of the term &quot;shock jock&quot;.

Shock jocks also tend to push the envelope of decency in their market, and they may appear to show a lack of regard for communications regulations (e.g., FCC rules in the U.S.) regarding content. However, nearly all American broadcasters have strict policies against content that is likely to draw indecency forfeitures, and air personalities are often contractually obligated to avoid broadcasting such content.

Many shock jocks have been fired as a result of such punishments as regulatory fines, loss of advertisers, or simply social and political outrage. On the other hand, it is also not uncommon for such broadcasters to be quickly rehired by another station or network. Shock jocks in the United States have been censored under additional pressure from the United States government since the introduction of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005, which increased the fines on radio stations for violating decency guidelines by nearly 20 times.

==Notable examples==
===North America===
* 1990: Liz Randolph, a personality at WBZZ in Pittsburgh, successfully sued the station and its two morning hosts, Jim Quinn and Banana Don Jefferson, for a running gag sexually harassing her. Quinn remained in his position but over the next several years would gradually transition to a politically oriented format for his show.
* 1991: Rusty Humphries, then at KEGL, orchestrates a stunt attempting to sneak toy weapons onto a plane at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
* 1994: Mancow Muller of KYLD-FM orchestrates a stunt blocking off the westbound lanes of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge during rush hour while his on-air sidekick got a haircut, in response to (false) allegations then-President Bill Clinton would have caused delays at Los Angeles International Airport by getting his hair cut aboard Air Force One. Muller and the radio station both got sued.
* 1995: Howard Stern responds to the death of singer Selena with a comment on how &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul&quot; than Latin musicians and that &quot;Spanish people have the worst taste in music.&quot; Stern survived the resultant outrage from the Hispanic community, which extended so far as an arrest warrant from Harlingen, Texas, that the local justice of the peace left open for a year but, because Stern never entered Harlingen, went unenforced.
* 1998: Stern is banned from CHOM-FM in Montreal after remarking that &quot;there&#x27;s something about the (French) language that turns you into a pussy-assed jack-off.&quot; His only other Canadian affiliate, CILQ Toronto, sustained a barrage of complaints for three years afterward before dropping the show in 2001.
* February 24, 1999: Doug Tracht aka The Greaseman was fired from WARW (now WIAD) after he played a song by Grammy Award-winning rapper Lauryn Hill and made a derogatory remark about the lynching and dragging death of James Byrd Jr. at the hands of three white men in Jasper, Texas, which was ruled a hate crime. A day earlier, the ringleader John William King was found guilty of Byrd&#x27;s murder. King and his accomplice Lawrence Brewer have since been executed. The third man Shawn Berry is currently serving his life sentence at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice&#x27;s Ramsey Unit. It wasn&#x27;t the first time Tracht made insensitive remarks towards African Americans. On Martin Luther King Day in 1986 while working at DC101, Tracht made the following remark about Dr. King&#x27;s assassination, &quot;Kill four more and we can take a whole week off.&quot;
* June 12, 2001: A rumor that Britney Spears was dead was scotched by her publicists after the story was spread by two US radio DJs and a hoax website using the BBC logo. Dallas shock jocks Kramer and Twitch told listeners to their KEGL-FM evening show that pop singer Spears and her then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake had been involved in a car accident in Los Angeles. The hoax sparked panic among fans, who called police and fire departments in the hundreds. The story was then turned into a spoof version of a BBC News Online web page, and the link was sent around the world by e-mail. The BBC lodged a strong protest, and the spoof page was removed.
* August 16, 2002: Opie and Anthony sponsored a contest where the goal was to have sex in notable public places, called &quot;Sex For Sam&quot;. The contest went without a major outcry until &quot;Sex for Sam 3&quot; after a couple had sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. The resulting controversy, coupled with an earlier controversy stemming from a raunchy party in Buffalo, New York, led to Infinity Broadcasting cancelling the &quot;Opie and Anthony Show&quot;. Infinity was fined US$357,500 for the incident.
* 2003: Tom Leykis outs the name of the accuser in the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case. The woman&#x27;s name had been redacted from all other media reports about the case to date.
* January 2004: Bubba the Love Sponge receives a $755,000 fine from the FCC for a series of sketches that implied cartoon characters were having sex.
* April 8, 2004: Howard Stern&#x27;s show was dropped by Clear Channel Communications after they were fined US$495,000 for a number of statements made during a Stern show. Stern later used his remaining market share to criticize Clear Channel and the Bush administration, and left the public airwaves to move to satellite radio, which is not subject to the same FCC decency regulations.
* May 12, 2004: Portland Modern Rock station KNRK&#x27;s morning show &quot;The Marconi Show&quot; played an audio clip from the beheading of Nick Berg on repeat, adding their snide commentary to it. After the station was flooded with angry phone calls and emails from listeners, KNRK General Manager Mark Hamilton apologised and fired both hosts of the show and their producer, asking listeners to call or write in with their suggestions on how to shape the station for the future. The result was the elimination of shock jocks and most of the hard rock music that made up the station&#x27;s playlist at the time.
* December 2004: The Federal Communications Commission proposed fines totaling $220,000 against Entercom Communications for alleged indecency violations during multiple broadcasts in April and May 2002 of the Johnny Dare Morning Show on KQRC-FM in Kansas City, Kansas. The FCC claimed that the material included repeated graphic and explicit sexual descriptions that were pandering, titillating or used to shock the audience. As justification for proposing the maximum fine, the Commission noted &quot;the egregious nature of the violations and Entercom&#x27;s history of prior indecent broadcasts.&quot; 
* 2006: J. R. Gach described, on-air, an employee at a restaurant he was patronizing who had suffered serious burns, which later escalated into a series of insults. The subject of Gach&#x27;s discussion sued him over the comments, citing severe emotional distress and won a US$1,000,000 settlement in December 2007. The lawsuit effectively ended Gach&#x27;s career; he never again hosted a radio show before his 2015 death.
* April 2007: Don Imus is fired for referring to members of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights women&#x27;s basketball team as &quot;nappy-headed hos.&quot; Eight months later, another network hired Imus, who resumed the same format and would continue to host it until retiring in 2018; he died in 2019.
* March 2, 2012: Rush Limbaugh, a politically conservative shock jock, was criticized and faced with an advertiser exodus after making comments toward activist Sandra Fluke. Limbaugh was not disciplined for the remarks and survived the controversy, with only two small stations (out of nearly 600) dropping the program in the immediate aftermath of the controversy. The controversy had a much longer impact on talk radio as a whole as advertisers became much more reluctant to have their advertising heard on politically charged programs that were subject to being targeted by pressure groups. Limbaugh died in February 2021, still hosting his program to the end.
* December 2013: Canadian radio shock jock Dean Blundell was indefinitely suspended from CFNY-FM, following reports that he and cohost Derek Welsman had discussed on the air a jury trial in which Welsman was the foreman. The trial had concerned a sexual assault charge against a client of a gay bathhouse, and Blundell and Welsman&#x27;s commentary about it was criticized both for homophobia and for potentially causing a mistrial by publicly discussing the jury deliberations. The program&#x27;s cancellation was announced in January 2014.

===Great Britain===
* June 2005: Radio DJ Tim Shaw propositioned glamour model Jodie Marsh live on-air on his Kerrang! FM show by announcing he would leave his family for her. This enraged Shaw&#x27;s wife, who promptly sold his Lotus Esprit on eBay for 50p. Earlier that year he had been suspended for staging a mock burglary at the home of former programme director Andrew Jeffries, and in 2004, after being challenged by listeners, he phoned his sister-in-law live on-air to boast that he fantasized about her during sex with his wife.
* October 18, 2008: (UK) BBC Radio 2 host Russell Brand resigned after calling actor Andrew Sachs and leaving four answering machine messages claiming that he had had sex with his granddaughter with fellow Radio 2 DJ Jonathan Ross.

===Australia===
* July 29, 2009: On his morning breakfast radio show, Australian DJ Kyle Sandilands provoked outrage when his &quot;Lie Detector&quot; segment featured a 14-year-old girl who, when quizzed on her sexual history by her mother, broke down, revealing she had been raped at the age of 12. Kyle then said her mother meant any intercourse other than rape. The show was suspended for one week. Sandilands provoked further outrage three days after his suspension expired when he made a slur about Jenny Craig ambassador Magda Szubanski, saying she could have lost more weight in a concentration camp. Sandilands was suspended for ten days without pay, and after a review on September 18, had his suspension extended by three weeks. Sandilands returned to air on October 8, apologized for the incident, and was blessed by a priest at the start of the show.
* December 4, 2012. Australian DJs Mel Greig and Mike Christian made a prank call to a hospital in London where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for &quot;acute morning sickness&quot;, recording and playing the call later on air. After the nurse involved committed suicide the incident received international media coverage.
* June 13, 2013. A Perth radio host Howard Sattler was fired after he asked prime minister Julia Gillard if her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a male hairdresser.

<text>Outremont () is an affluent residential borough (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It consists entirely of the former city on the Island of Montreal in southwestern Quebec. The neighbourhood is inhabited largely by Francophones, and is also home to a Hasidic Jewish community. Since the 1950s, Outremont has been mostly residential, but some streets such as Van Horne, Bernard and Laurier have many commercial buildings.

The most important road in Outremont is Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road, where the borough hall is located. The neighborhood&#x27;s major commercial streets are Laurier Avenue, Bernard Avenue, and Van Horne Avenue.

==Geography==
A separate city until the 2000 municipal mergers, Outremont is located north of downtown, on the north-western side of Mount Royal – its name means &quot;beyond the mountain&quot; although it encompasses Murray Hill (colline d&#x27;Outremont), one of the three peaks that make up Mount Royal. It was named for the house – &quot;Outre-Mont&quot; – built c. 1830 for Louis-Tancrède Bouthillier, a former Sheriff of Montreal.

The borough is bounded to the northwest by Mount Royal, to the northeast by Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension and Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, to the east by Le Plateau-Mont-Royal and the Mile End district, to the south by Ville-Marie, and to the west by Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. The Mount Royal Cemetery is located in the south eastern tip of the borough.

==Toponymy==

The area was originally known as Côte Sainte-Catherine. The name Outremont came from how it was called at the time by travelers. Travelers who wished to travel north from downtown Montreal had to go &quot;through&quot; the mountain as in &quot;Outre-Mont&quot;.

In 1833, Louis-Tancrède Bouthillier built a country residence that he named &quot;Outre-Mont&quot;; it still exists today on Rue McDougall. The term Outremont gradually becomes the term used to designate the region.

==History==
In 1875, Louis Beaubien, a federal representative, gets a federal sanction for the village. To achieve the minimum amount of residence needed, Louis Beaubien counts barns and other farm buildings as residences. The town changes its name from Cote-Sainte-Catherine to Outremont. The village is home to only 300 souls.

In 1927, Outremont became the first place in the world to use a snow blower to clear its streets in the winter. It was the first production model of Canadian inventor Arthur Sicard&#x27;s Sicard Industries.

Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau was born and raised in Outremont.

==Features==

Outremont is served by the Outremont and Édouard-Montpetit stations on the Blue Line of the Montreal Metro. (Édouard-Montpetit station is actually located in Côte-des-Neiges, but right on the Outremont border).

Major thoroughfares include Avenue Van Horne and chemin de la Côte-Sainte-Catherine, with avenue Bernard and avenue Laurier as the principal shopping and dining areas. The area has a number of trendy restaurants, cafés and shops. Residents include a substantial percentage of expatriates from France. There is also a sizable Hassidic Jewish community, representing about 20% of Outremont&#x27;s population, which resides mainly in the eastern and northern portions of the borough. Many Jewish synagogues, schools and businesses can be found on avenues Van Horne, Bernard and St-Viateur.

Among the attractions in the mainly residential community are the Mount Royal Cemetery, the Salle Claude-Champagne, the Théâtre Outremont, the Saint-Grégoire-l&#x27;Illuminateur Armenian Cathedral and part of the Université de Montréal campus.

Outremont also has a rail yard along its northern border. The rail yard has been purchased by the Université de Montréal and is to be developed to house its hospital complex, its research faculties and the faculty of Health Sciences (Centre Hospitalier de l&#x27;Université de Montréal).

Outremont was twinned as a sister city with Oakwood, Ohio and Le Vésinet, France.

<doc id="189913" wikidata="Q282067" url="?curid=189913" title="John Molson">
<text>John Molson (28 December 1763 – 11 January 1836) was an English-born brewer and entrepreneur in colonial Quebec, which during his lifetime became Lower Canada. In addition to founding Molson Brewery, he was known for building the first steamship and the first public railway in Canada, was a president of the Bank of Montreal, and established a hospital, a hotel, and a theatre in Montreal. Molson was also the &quot;leader&quot; (provincial grand master) of the freemason&#x27;s lodge of Montreal up to three years before his death, from 1826 to 1833. The dynasty he founded, the Molson family, is still a wealthy and powerful force in Canada.

==Early life==
John Molson was born in 1763, in the parish of Moulton near Spalding, Lincolnshire, England. His father John Molson senior (1730–1770) had, in 1760, married Mary Elsdale (1739–1772), the eldest daughter of Samuel Elsdale (1704–1788), of Surfleet. Her brother, Robinson Elsdale (1744–1783), was a privateer, whose unpublished exploits formed the basis of the novel by Frederick Marryat, &quot;The Privateersman&quot; (1846). Before the marriage, John Molson senior inherited a property known as Snake Hall, in Moulton Eaugate which consisted of a house and various outbuildings associated with of land.

John Molson senior died on 4 June 1770. His will bequeathed properties to his wife and five surviving children. Under their marriage settlement, Snake Hall went to Mary, and was to then pass on to his eldest son, John, upon her death. She died on 21 September 1772, and thus John was orphaned when eight years old. John senior had named four guardians and trustees for the estate; the young John Molson&#x27;s financial affairs were overseen by his paternal uncle, Thomas Molson, but in September 1771 Thomas turned over the duties of trustee and guardian to Samuel Elsdale, possibly due to poor health, as he died the following spring. Under Samuel Elsdale&#x27;s oversight, Snake Hall was rented out to the benefit of their trusts. John went to live with a man named William Robinson, and at age 12 in 1776 was consigned to the care of a Mr Whitehead, who was paid for his board and education until 1780, when he turned 16. Writers have criticized Samuel Elsdale for his oversight but he seems to have performed his duties prudently, although John Molson plainly chafed under his guardianship.

In 1782, at the age of 18, Molson immigrated to Quebec, in a ship that was leaking so badly he switched ships mid-ocean. In 1783, Molson moved into the home of Thomas Loid just outside Montreal, who had begun brewing beer the previous year. Molson became a partner in the brewery and took over on 5 January 1785, eight days after he had turned twenty-one. In 1786, he returned briefly to England, and it was during that year that Molson picked up the book &quot;Theoretic Hints on an Improved Practice in Brewing&quot; by John Richardson. Molson returned to Quebec with more money and a new mindset. Many Loyalists were immigrating to Quebec from the United States and this influx increased the demand for beer. Molson worked hard, staying up long into the night. He hired an apprentice, Christopher Cook, and a loyalist housemaid, Sarah Insley Vaughan. He married her on 7 April 1801 at Christ Church in Montreal after she had borne him three children.

Sarah (1751–1829) was the daughter of Thomas Vaughan of Harnham Hall, Morpeth, Northumberland. She was the niece of Wilmot Vaughan, 1st Earl of Lisburne and through her mother&#x27;s family, the Aynsleys, a cousin of the Duke of Atholl. She emigrated to the American colonies with her first husband, David Tetchley, but ten years later left him, and reverting to her maiden name, she made her way to Montreal, penniless, until taken in by Molson.

Soon Molson&#x27;s beer was in such demand that according to one of his diary entries &quot;Cannot serve half my customers and they are increasing every day.&quot; One of the major reasons for this was the wide appeal of his beer to different classes of Montreal society. High British officers had been drinking imported London porters and the city merchants preferred Bristol. Yet Molson&#x27;s beer was special as it was &quot;universally liked&quot; (a quotation from Molson&#x27;s diary). It was at the Anglican church that he met many influential and wealthy businessmen like fur trader James McGill, Joseph Frobisher, founder of the North West Company, and Alexander Mackenzie.

==Career success and later life==

Between 1788 and 1800, Molson&#x27;s business grew quickly into one of the larger ones in Lower Canada. Already in 1791, he sold 30,000 gallons of beer. During these years Molson and his wife had four children, John junior, Thomas (who died shortly after birth), another Thomas, and William (Billy).

The year 1800 marks the first recorded use of (imported) bottles by Molson. About this time arrived &quot;The Philosophical Principles of the Science of Brewing&quot; by Richardson, which marks the introduction of the thermometer and the saccharometer to the English craft. By the start of the 19th Century, his small brewery had grown tenfold. Molson now had the money to improve his business by buying new technology.

===Steamship pioneer===
Molson toyed with the idea of buying a steamship after seeing Robert Fulton&#x27;s &quot;Clermont&quot; go down the Hudson.. However, there was also another steamship commissioned by a group of businessmen from Burlington, Vermont, in 1808 to be built by two brothers in Burlington, Vermont, named John and James Winans. This ship was quite unsurprisingly called the &quot;Vermont and&quot; went into service in 1809. The &quot;Vermont&quot; ran in modern Canada, along Lake Champlain and the Riviere Richelieu to Dorchester (modern day Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Quebec). Molson&#x27;s steamship would be the first in Canada. Molson teamed up with John Jackson and John Bruce who would build a ship for Molson in return for putting up the money and part ownership. Built in Montreal (with engines produced at Forges du Saint-Maurice in Trois-Rivières) in 1809, &quot;Accommodation&quot; became the first steamship to ride on the waters of the Saint Lawrence River. This was a great feat for Molson but, from a business viewpoint, it was a net loss, costing £4000 by 1810. Molson was determined to make money on his ships so he dismantled &quot;Accommodation&quot; and purchased in person two steamship engines from Boulton &amp; Watt in Birmingham, England. He combined the two engines and the remains of &quot;Accommodation&quot; to create &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, a magnificent ship that was a vision of elegance and speed, traversing the route at an average of seven miles an hour. &quot;Swiftsure&quot; measured 130 feet on the keel and had a beam of 24 feet. The steamship provided a ready cash business, while the government in London had suspended the transfer of specie from 1800 to 1817. Most other Canadian business was carried on with London bills of exchange, and the transfer of those bills from Montreal to Quebec earned the Molsons up to 20 per cent. And since brewing occupied the months when the steamboats were laid up, a harmonious concordance of activities resulted.

Molson would have three other steamships constructed and utilized close to the end of the War of 1812 (for the first ship) and following the end of the war (for the remaining two), these ships were called: the &quot;Malsham&quot; (an archaic form of Molson) built in 1814 (going into service in September immediately after construction), the &quot;Lady Sherbrooke&quot; in 1816, and the &quot;New Swiftsure&quot; in 1817.
During the time leading up to the War of 1812 and within the war itself, Molson&#x27;s business continued to grow and his sales were pushed even higher. &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was leased to the British Army and brought in a supplemental income. 

Molson himself would be involved in the war, albeit through a full-time militia and not a regular force; however, some troops in the militia that Molson was a part of were volunteers and some were still conscripted. Each volunteer or conscripted man was nonetheless required to serve for one year only. Molson was ranked a lieutenant in the 5th Battalion of the Select Embodied Militia. There were 8 different battalion units in this militia with all expect for the 6th seeing action in either the Montreal or Lake Champlain sectors of the war front. The 5th Battalion was the first battalion that was formed after the War of 1812 had been declared officially, with the first four having been formed already in 1812 before the war began. Seven of the eight battalions (all except the 3rd) would be perpetuated within the Canadian Army and assigned to a varying regiment within - the 5th Battalion of which Molson was in was assigned to the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada. Molson would eventually be promoted to captain on 25 March 1813. Molson would resign from this commissioned work within the same year, on 25 November 1813.

In 1815, Molson was elected to represent Montreal East in the legislative assembly on the platform of building a wharf. Molson Brewery is the second oldest company in all of Canada.

===Plutocrat and banker===
As Molson became more occupied by his multiple businesses and his seat in the assembly, his three sons began to take a much larger role in the companies. John Junior managed the steamships, Thomas was married in England and would frequently travel sending back tips and advice to his father, and William was in charge of the brewery. In 1816, the year he took his sons formally into partnership, Molson built Mansion House Hotel which coincided with the Assembly&#x27;s acceptance of the wharf. Molson&#x27;s hotel was only for those who could afford luxury. The hotel offered Montreal&#x27;s first library, boat rides on the river, well-furnished rooms and six-course dinners, famous throughout all of Montreal.

To the John Molsons and Sons partnership were leased at 6% per annum Molson&#x27;s accumulated capital assets; the term was seven years. The four partners divided equally, share and share alike, the profits and the losses. If any insoluble difference arose between the partners, two indifferent arbitrators were to be appointed. By December 1816, Molson had accumulated £63,550.

In 1817, John Richardson and George Moffatt created the Montreal Bank. Molson declined a partnership in it as the backers of this project had been involved with multiple failed banks in the United States and he felt it was a risky investment. Molson changed his mind not long afterwards and the bank became fully Canadian-owned when the U.S. partners sold their shares after the U.S. financial crisis in the fall of 1818. By 1822, the bank had received a charter from Britain and changed its name to the Bank of Montreal. Between 1826 and 1834, Molson presided over its affairs.

===Hospitaller===
In 1819, Molson had a short bout of sickness. It was during this time that he noticed the only hospital in the city, Hôtel Dieu, only held 30 beds. Molson proposed to the assembly that a new hospital be established that would contain 200 beds. Although the assembly denied his request, there was much private support and soon donations came pouring in. By May the new hospital, the Montreal General Hospital, was opened on Craig Street (now Saint Antoine Street).

===International beer and spirit merchant===
A crisis almost struck the Molsons in 1821 when the Mansion House Hotel caught fire; some of the books from the library were saved but not much more was salvageable. Molson was undaunted by this and had ideas to build an even grander hotel, a true testament to his character. While John junior and William took care of the businesses within Canada, Thomas was busy working in England. Thomas brought over 237 gallons of beer to London, England. The response was encouraging and Thomas brought another 1385 gallons on his next trip. Molson&#x27;s had its first international market.

The first Canadian distillery on an industrial scale was a Molson endeavour. It was in response to the economic collapse that occurred from 1817 to 1820, that Thomas convinced his partners to enter the distillery business, which was industrially a virgin land. From 1820 to 1866, one or another Molson partnership were the largest distillers in Canada. The trade in liquor was only wholesale in nature, because trade at the retail level had been forbidden the managers of a distillery under a law passed in 1794. The Molson company official historian maintains that until 1846, the single most substantial source of revenues were duties on alcoholic beverages. In those pioneer days, alcohol was the primary form by which was monetized grain, and in the absence of Scotch supply the British craved Canadian whiskey. One historian has concluded that, because the cost of transportation rises with volume shipped, Molson shipped concentrated alcohol to his British agents, Grayhurst &amp; Hewat, who then cut it down for retail.

In 1828, the temperance movement in Canada was begun, with Methodist preachers setting up shop first in the Niagara Peninsula, then in Montreal and at Bedford, Nova Scotia. Prohibitionists called for the elimination of import, manufacture and sale of strong liquor for beverage purposes.

===Theatre impresario===

By 1825, Molson&#x27;s hotel was completely rebuilt and renamed the British American Hotel. After the hotel was completed Molson built a theatre adjacent to it. By November, Molson&#x27;s Theatre Royal was completed, the first theatre in Montreal. It seated 1,000 guests, presenting Shakespeare and Restoration authors and was also used for circuses and concerts. Edmund Kean and Charles Dickens both performed there before it was demolished in 1844 to make way for the Bonsecours Market.

Never resting, Molson continued to build his empire by purchasing multiple steamships and creating the St Lawrence Steamboat Company. This fleet of ships was so big that it outnumbered all of those operating in the United States. In 1826 Molson decided to run against a young Louis-Joseph Papineau but resigned quickly after discovering the amount of support Papineau had from the French and the Irish.

On 18 March 1829, Molson&#x27;s wife Sarah Vaughan, died after treating her rheumatism with laudanum. Sarah became addicted to this opium-based painkiller and died from the effects. Molson sold the house they lived in together and moved on with his life. His four-year term as president of the Bank of Montreal (1826–1830) ended and Molson did not run for a second. Even at the age of 67 Molson did not contemplate retirement; one of his biggest projects still lay ahead.

===Railway entrepreneur===

Since 1825, Molson had followed reports of the first railways being built in England. Molson had told the head of this project, Jason Pierce, that he was interested. Pierce did not forget about Molson&#x27;s interest and in 1832 Molson&#x27;s request for a railroad was accepted by the Assembly. The Champlain and St Lawrence Railroad was to connect the St Lawrence to the Hudson River, making the trip from Montreal to New York much quicker. This was the first railway ever constructed in Canada. Molson became the Railroad&#x27;s largest shareholder, when a cholera epidemic that struck Canada in 1832 and 1834 added to echoes of the economic depression caused by the crisis closure of the Second Bank of the United States. This all caused the railroad project to lose much of its momentum. Many businesses closed in Montreal but the Molsons continued work as usual. Construction of the railroad was begun in 1835, and was completed on Thursday 21 July 1836 with great pomp and ceremony, but without the senior Molson.

After his multiple successful proposals, John Molson was appointed to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. He was considered part of the &quot;Chateau Clique&quot; as he was a rich English businessman. The people were losing their faith in English businessmen like Molson and were turning to men like Papineau and Robert Nelson, both members of the Patriote movement. In 1833 Molson&#x27;s hotel burned down again. This time though, Molson decided not to rebuild it.

===Freemason===

Molson was appointed Provincial Grand Master of the District Grand Lodge of Montreal (Freemasons) by the Duke of Sussex by Letters Patent dated 15 May 1826 and installed in office by Claude Dénéchau on 5 September 1826; Molson resigned in 1833.

==Death and legacy==
When things returned to normal after the second cholera epidemic, Molson&#x27;s railroad project began to gain speed. Unfortunately, he did not live long enough to see his last dream realized. Molson caught a high fever in December 1835. He wrote his will on 11 January 1836, and died that day. In his will, Molson named John Molson junior, Thomas Molson, William Molson, George Moffatt and Peter McGill executors. His remains now rest in a family mausoleum at Mount Royal Cemetery.

In 1955, a historian noted that of the many and myriad businesses started in 18th-century Montreal, only three remained to that date. The Molson Coors Brewing Company still has the dominant share of the beer industry in Canada.

<text>Daniel Albert Wyttenbach (7 August 1746, Bern17 January 1820, Oegstgeest) was a German Swiss classical scholar. A student of Hemsterhuis, Valckenaer and Ruhnken, he was an exponent of the methods of criticism which they established, and with them he laid the foundations of modern Greek scholarship.

==Early life==
He was born at Bern, of a noble family, and was extremely proud of his lineage, particularly his descent from Thomas Wyttenbach, professor of theology in Basel at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century, who had taught Huldrych Zwingli and other distinguished pupils. Wyttenbach&#x27;s own father was also a theological professor of considerable note, first at the University of Bern, and then at the University of Marburg. He moved to Marburg in 1756, partly because he had studied there under the famous Christian Wolff, and embodied the philosophical principles of his master in his own theological teaching.

Young Wyttenbach entered the University of Marburg at the age of fourteen, and studied there for four years. His parents intended him to be a Lutheran pastor. The first two years were given up to general education, principally to mathematics, &quot;philology&quot;, philosophy, and history. The professor of mathematics, August Gottlieb Spangenberg, greatly influenced young Wyttenbach. He is said to have taught his subject with great clearness, and with equal seriousness and piety, often referring to God as the supreme mathematician, who had constructed all things by number, measure and weight.

&quot;Philology&quot; in the German universities of that age meant Hebrew and Greek. These two languages were generally handled by the same professor, and were taught almost solely to theological students. Wyttenbach&#x27;s university course at Marburg was troubled about the middle of the time by mental unrest, due to the fascination exercised over him by John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. It was Spangenberg who helped him recover. The principal study of the third year was metaphysics, which took Wyttenbach entirely captive. The fourth and last year was to be devoted to theology and Christian dogma.

Up to that time, Wyttenbach had submitted passively to his father&#x27;s wishes concerning his career, but he now turned away from theological lectures, and devoted his leisure to the task of deepening and extending his knowledge of Greek literature. He possessed at the time, as he tells us, no more acquaintance with Greek than his own pupils at a later time could acquire from him during four months&#x27; study. He had access only to the bare texts of the authors. Wyttenbach was undaunted, and four years&#x27; persistent study gave him a knowledge of Greek such as few Germans of that time possessed. His love for philosophy carried him towards the Greek philosophers, especially Plato. During this period Ruhnken&#x27;s notes on the Platonic lexicon of Timaeus fell into his hands. David Ruhnken was for him almost a superhuman being, with whom he imagined himself conversing in the spirit.

At twenty-two, he determined to go elsewhere in search of the aids to study which Marburg could not afford. His father, realizing the strength of his son&#x27;s pure passion for scholarship, permitted and even advised him to seek Christian Gottlob Heine at the University of Göttingen. From Heine he received the utmost kindness and encouragement, and he was urged to dedicate to Ruhnken the first-fruits of his scholarships. Wyttenbach set to work on some notes to Julian, Eunapius and Aristaenetus, and Heine wrote to Ruhnken to obtain his favourable consideration for the work. Before it reached him, Ruhnken wrote a kind letter to Wyttenbach, which the recipient &quot;read, re-read and kissed,&quot; and another on receipt of the tract, in which the great scholar declared that he had not expected to find in Germany such knowledge of Greek, such power of criticism, and such mature judgment, especially in one so young. By Heine&#x27;s advice, he worked hard at Latin, which he knew less thoroughly than Greek, and Heine praised his progress in Latin style to Ruhnken and Valckenaer.

He then wrote to ask their advice about his scheme of coming to the Netherlands to follow the profession of a scholar. Ruhnken encouraged Wyttenbach to follow his own example, for he too had been designed by his parents for the Christian ministry in Germany, but had settled at Leiden on the invitation of Tiberius Hemsterhuis. Valckenaer agreed, but added that Wyttenbach&#x27;s letter would have been pleasanter to him had it been free from excessive compliments. These letters were forwarded to the elder Wyttenbach, with a strong recommendation from Heine. The old man had been in Leiden in his youth, and admired the scholarship of the Netherlands; so his consent was easily won.

==Academic career==
Wyttenbach reached Leiden in 1770. He spent a year learning the language of the people, attending the lectures of the great &quot;duumviri&quot; of Leiden, and collating manuscripts of Plutarch. At the end of 1771 a professor was wanted at Amsterdam for the college of the Remonstrants. On the recommendation of Ruhnken, Wyttenbach obtained the chair, which he held with great success for eight years. His lectures were wide-ranging. Those on Greek were repeated to the students of the university of Amsterdam (the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;). In 1775 a visit was made to Paris, which was fruitful both of new friendships and of progress in study.

About this time, on the advice of Ruhnken, Wyttenbach began issuing his &quot;Bibliotheca critica&quot;, which appeared at intervals for the next thirty years. The methods of criticism were in the main those established by Hemsterhuis, and carried on by Valckenaer and Ruhnken, and the publication was accepted by the learned all over Europe. In 1777 the younger Burmann (&quot;Burmannus Secundus&quot;) retired from his professorship at the Athenaeum, and Wyttenbach was disappointed not to be chosen to succeed him. Only his regard for Ruhnken and for Dutch freedom (in his own words &quot;Ruhnkeni et Batavae libertatis cogitatio&quot;) kept him in Holland. For fear of losing him, the authorities at Amsterdam nominated him professor of philosophy in 1779.

In 1785, Toll, Burmann&#x27;s successor, resigned, and Wyttenbach was appointed to succeed him. His full title was &quot;professor of history and eloquence and Greek and Latin literature.&quot; He had hardly got to work in his new office when Valckenaer died, and he received a call to Leiden. Greatly to Ruhnken&#x27;s disappointment, he declined to abandon the duties he had so recently undertaken. In 1787 began the internal commotions in Holland, afterwards to be aggravated by foreign interference. Scarcely during the remaining thirty-three years of Wyttenbach&#x27;s life was there a moment of peace in the land. About this time two requests were made to him for an edition of the &quot;Moralia&quot; of Plutarch, for which a recension of the tract &quot;De sera numinis vindicta&quot; had marked him out in the eyes of scholars. One request came from the famous &quot;Societas Bipontina&quot;, the other from the delegates of the Clarendon Press at Oxford, England. Wyttenbach, influenced at once by the reputation of the university, and by the liberality of the Oxonians in tendering him assistance of different kinds, declined the offer of the Bipontine Society — very fortunately, since their press was soon destroyed by the French.

The first portion of Wyttenbach&#x27;s work was safely conveyed to Oxford in 1794. Then war broke out between Holland and Britain. Randolph, Wyttenbach&#x27;s Oxford correspondent, advised that the next portion should be sent through the British ambassador at Hamburg, and the manuscript was duly consigned to him &quot;in a little chest well protected by pitch.&quot; After sending Randolph a number of letters without getting any answer, Wyttenbach in disgust put all thought of the edition from him, but at last the missing box was discovered in a forgotten corner at Hamburg, where it had lain for two years and a half. The work was finally completed in 1803.

Meanwhile, Wyttenbach received invitations from his native city, Bern, and from Leiden, where vacancies had been created by the refusal of professors to swear allegiance to the new Dutch republic set up in 1795, to which Wyttenbach had made submission. But he only left Amsterdam in 1799, when on Ruhnken&#x27;s death he succeeded him at Leiden as professor and 13th Librarian of Leiden University. Even then his chief object in moving was to facilitate an arrangement by which the necessities of his old master&#x27;s family might be relieved. His move came too late in life, and he was never so happy at Leiden as he had been at Amsterdam. Before long appeared the ever-delightful &quot;Life of David Ruhnken&quot;. Though written in Latin, this biography deserves to rank high in the modern literature of its class. Of Wyttenbach&#x27;s life at Leiden there is little to tell.

The continual changes in state affairs greatly disorganized the universities of Holland, and Wyttenbach had to work in face of much detraction; still, his success as a teacher was very great. In 1805 he narrowly escaped with his life from the great gunpowder explosion, which killed 150 people, among them the Greek scholar Jean Luzac, Wyttenbach&#x27;s colleague in the university. One of Wyttenbach&#x27;s letters gives a vivid account of the disaster. During the last years of his life he suffered severely from illness and became nearly blind. After the conclusion of his edition of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot; in 1805, the only important work he was able to publish was his well-known edition of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

Many honours were conferred upon him both at home and abroad, and in particular he was made a member of the French Institute. Shortly before his death, he obtained the licence of the king of Holland to marry his sister&#x27;s daughter, Johanna Gallien, who had for twenty years been his housekeeper, secretary and research assistant. The sole object of the marriage was to secure for her a better provision after her husband&#x27;s death, because as the widow of a professor she would be entitled to a pension. Gallien was a woman of remarkable culture and ability, and wrote works held in great repute at that time. On the festival of the tercentenary of the foundation of the university of Marburg, celebrated in 1827, the degree of doctor was conferred upon her. Wyttenbach died of apoplexy in 1820, and he was buried in the garden of his country house near Leiden, which stood, as he noted, within sight of the dwellings of Descartes and Boerhaave.

Wyttenbach&#x27;s biography was written in a somewhat dry and lifeless manner by Mahne, one of his pupils, who also published some of his letters. His &quot;Opuscula&quot;, other than those published in the &quot;Bibliotheca critica&quot;, were collected in two volumes (Leiden, 1823).

==Evaluation==
Although his work is not on the same level as that of Hemsterhuis, Valckenaer and Ruhnken, he was a very eminent exponent of the sound methods of criticism which they established. These four men, more than any others after Richard Bentley, laid the foundations of modern Greek scholarship. The precise study of grammar, syntax and style, and the careful criticism of texts by the light of the best manuscript evidence, were upheld by these scholars in the Netherlands when they were almost entirely neglected elsewhere on the Continent, and were only pursued with partial success in England. Wyttenbach may fairly be regarded as closing a great period in the history of scholarship. He lived indeed to see the new birth of German classical learning, but his work was done, and he was unaffected by it. Wyttenbach&#x27;s criticism was less rigorous, precise and masterly, but perhaps more sensitive and sympathetic, than that of his great predecessors in the Netherlands. In actual acquaintance with the philosophical writings of the ancients, he has probably never been surpassed. In character he was upright and simple-minded, but shy and retiring, and often failed to make himself appreciated. His life was not passed without strife, but his few friends were warmly attached to him, and his many pupils were for the most part his enthusiastic admirers.

<text>Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve (15 February 1612 – 9 September 1676) was a French military officer and the founder of Ville-Marie, now the city of Montreal. 
==Early life==
Maisonneuve was baptised on 15 February 1612 at Neuville-sur-Vannes in Champagne, France. He was the son of Louis de Chomedey, seigneur of Chavane, Germenoy-en-Brie, and his second wife Marie de Thomelin, the daughter of Jean de Thomelin, a king&#x27;s counsellor and a treasurer of France in the generality of Champagne, and of Ambroise d’Aulquoy.

Paul de Chomedey grew up in the manor-house at Neuville-sur-Vanne, not far from the Maisonneuve seigneury which his father had acquired in 1614. He had two sisters and one brother. He began his military career at 13 in Holland, where he also learned to play the lute.

Just before his 30th birthday, Maisonneuve was recruited by Jérome le Royer de la Dauversiere, who was head of the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal. The latter claimed to have experienced a vision that inspired him to sponsor a mission on Montreal Island in New France. Maisonneuve was hired to lead the colonists and ensure their safety in the new land.

==Governor of Montreal==

In 1642, Ville-Marie was founded on the southern shore of the Island of Montreal, where a chapel and a small settlement were built. A hospital, under the leadership of Jeanne Mance, was also established. Maisonneuve was the first governor of Montreal.

The settlers maintained peaceful relations with the Algonquin people, one of the indigenous tribes of the area. The first year of the colony&#x27;s existence was peaceful. In 1643 a flood threatened the city. Maisonneuve prayed to the Virgin Mary to stop the inundation and when it abated, he erected a cross atop Mount Royal. A cross has been maintained there to the current day.

Of the local First Nations tribes with whom these French settlers had contact with, the Mohawk, who were already trading with the Dutch and in New Amsterdam (modern New York City), resented French efforts to interrupt the trade. The Mohawk were based in present-day New York State, south of Montreal, and severely threatened the new colony. The Algonquin, in contrast, maintained peaceful relations with the newly arrived Europeans. Nevertheless, they were often at war with the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), who discovered the existence of the new French settlement of Montreal, whose defence Maisonneuve commanded using his military training, only in 1643.

Already familiar with the terrain, the Haudenosaunee would often observe and engage the French settlers from the safety of the woods. That devastating strategy was the beginning of a long conflict between the groups as they were competing with each other for game and other resources. On 30 March 1644, the situation came to a head. Warned by their guard dogs as to the nearby presence of their enemies, a band of 30 settlers went into the forest to face their foes. Once in the woods, the French encountered 250 Haudenosaunee people in ambush, waiting for them. Retreating in the face of such uneven odds, Maisonneuve remained last so that the others could make it safely back to the fort, resulting in him being set upon by a Haudenosaunee chief. In this decisive moment, Maisonneuve fired twice on the chief, thus &quot;killing him with his bare hands,&quot; as is sometimes quoted about the event, before returning to the safety of the fort amid much fanfare.

In 1645, Maisonneuve received news that his father had died, and he returned to France. There, he was offered the position of Governor of New France but turned it down, wanting to continue his leadership of Ville-Marie. Maisonneuve returned to Montreal in 1647, and the wars with the Iroquois continued. In 1649, Maisonneuve stood as godfather for the first white child baptized in the colony. She was Pauline Hébert, the daughter of the fur-trader Augustin Hébert and his wife Adrienne Du Vivier, who had come to Montreal in 1648 with Maisonneuve and their elder daughter Jeanne.

In the spring of 1651, the Haudenosaunee attacks became so frequent and so violent that Ville-Marie thought that its end had come. Maisonneuve made all the settlers take refuge in the fort. By 1652, the colony at Montreal had been so reduced that he was forced to return to France to raise 100 volunteers to go with him to the colony the following year. If the effort had failed, Montreal would have been abandoned and the survivors relocated downriver to Quebec City. When the 100 arrived in the fall of 1653, the population of Montreal was barely 50 people. They included Jacques Archambault, who dug the first well on the island in 1657, at the request of Maisonneuve.

Over time, the colony grew in size and eventually was large enough to be secure from the Haudenosaunee threat. Ownership of the colony was transferred from the missionary society to the Sulpicians in March 1663. As New France had been proclaimed a royal province in 1663, governance of Montreal was assumed by the Governor General and the Sovereign Council.

New France&#x27;s governor general, Augustin de Saffray de Mésy, officially appointed Maisonneuve as governor of Montreal in October 1663. Maisonneuve objected, arguing that since the Sulpicians held the seigneurial rights, only they could appoint a governor. For the same reason, Maisonneuve objected to the establishment of a royal court at Montreal.

In September 1665, Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy, the Lieutenant Général of the Americas, ordered Maisonneuve to return to France on indefinite leave. After 24 years as head of the colony, he left Montreal for good.

==Later life ==

Settling in Paris Maisonneuve lived in relative obscurity. In 1671, he welcomed Marguerite Bourgeoys at his home in Paris. With his encouragement she had established the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal in 1653, an order of teaching nuns that educated French and Indigenous children.

Maisonneuve died in Paris on 9 September 1676; at his bedside were his young friend, Philippe de Turmenys, and his devoted servant, Louis Fin. On September 10, his funeral and burial took place at the Church of the Fathers of the Christian Doctrine, near the abbey of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.

==Honours==
After his death, Rue Saint-Paul in Montreal was named after Maisonneuve, who had built his home in 1650 on the early street.

Nuns&#x27; Island was once called &quot;Île Saint-Paul&quot; in honour of the founder of Montreal. The current name of the island appears starting from the 19th century and was exclusively used from the 1950s on.

The Maisonneuve Monument was erected in 1895 on Place d&#x27;Armes in Old Montreal, to his memory. It is the work of Louis-Philippe Hébert (1850–1917). An imaginary model was used to represent Maisonneuve, as no authentic portrait exists of the first governor of Montreal.

De Maisonneuve Boulevard and Rue Chomedey in Downtown Montreal are named for him, as are Maisonneuve Park, the Collège de Maisonneuve, the neighbourhood of Chomedey in Laval, and the Maisonneuve pavilion, a dormitory at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean.
