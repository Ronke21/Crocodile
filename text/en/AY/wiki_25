<text>The Fosse Way was a Roman road built in Britain during the first and second centuries AD that linked Isca Dumnoniorum (Exeter) in the southwest and Lindum Colonia (Lincoln) to the northeast, via Lindinis (Ilchester), Aquae Sulis (Bath), Corinium (Cirencester), and Ratae Corieltauvorum (Leicester).

== Toponym ==
The word Fosse is derived from the Latin , meaning &#x27;ditch&#x27;. For the first few decades after the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD, the Fosse Way marked the western frontier of Roman rule in Iron Age Britain. It is possible that the road began as a defensive ditch that was later filled in and converted into a road, or possibly a defensive ditch ran alongside the road for at least some of its length.

==Route==
The road joined Akeman Street and Ermin Way at Cirencester, crossed Watling Street at &quot;Venonis&quot; (High Cross) south of Leicester, and joined Ermine Street at Lincoln.

The Antonine Itinerary (a 2nd-century Roman register of roads) includes the section between High Cross and Lincoln, and lists intermediate points at &quot;Verometo&quot; (Willoughby on the Wolds), &quot;Margiduno&quot; (Castle Hill near Bingham), &quot;Ad Pontem&quot; (East Stoke) and &quot;Crocolana&quot; (Brough).

From Lincoln to Ilchester in Somerset, a distance of , the route is never more than from a straight line.

== Preservation==

Many sections of the Fosse Way form parts of modern roads and lanes, and parish, district or county boundaries, but some parts are now only accessible on foot.

Several place names on the route have the suffix &quot;-cester&quot; or &quot;-chester&quot;, which is derived from Old English / (ultimately from Latin meaning &#x27;military camp&#x27;). Some settlements are named after the road itself, such as &quot;Fosse-&quot;, or &quot;-on-Fosse&quot;, while others have a more generic form, such as &quot;Street&quot;, &quot;Strete&quot;, &quot;-le-Street&quot;, &quot;Stratton&quot;, &quot;Stretton&quot;, &quot;Stratford&quot;, and &quot;Stretford&quot;, derived from Old English / (ultimately from Latin , meaning &#x27;paved road&#x27;). The route runs from in Exeter to in Lincoln.

=== Lincoln to Leicester ===

Between Lincoln and Leicester the A46 follows the route of the Fosse Way. The A46 deviates from Fosse Way at East Goscote, to follow the Leicester Western Bypass. The original alignment, which is still visible as an unclassified road called &quot;Fosse Way&quot;, passes through Syston, continuing as the minor road &quot;Melton Road&quot; through Thurmaston, before merging with the A607 (the old A46), continuing into the city centre on the old alignment, first as Melton Road then Belgrave Road and Belgrave Gate.

The alignment terminates at the Clock Tower, and picks up again at Narborough Road (the A5460), on the other side of the River Soar. A stretch of the road between Widmerpool &amp; Newark-on-Trent has been upgraded to a dual carriageway which was completed in 2012. The new route deviates in several sections from the historic road line.

=== Leicester to Cirencester ===

South of Leicester, the B4114 (originally the A46 but renumbered when the M69 was opened) follows the route. This is apart from a short deviation near Narborough, where the original course is no longer visible. A short distance north of the A5, the B4114 diverges from the line of the Fosse Way to pass through the village of Sharnford.

For the route of the Fosse Way is followed by a minor road, named Roman Road which, although single track, runs along a much wider and slightly domed strip of land with deep ditches either side (the &quot;agger&quot;). The modern road ends at a picnic site car park, and a further southwards can be explored on foot.

The junction of Fosse Way with Watling Street, now the A5, is at High Cross (Roman name ). Watling Street is the county boundary between Leicestershire and Warwickshire.

The Fosse Way follows the B4455 across Warwickshire, through Street Ashton, Stretton-under-Fosse, Brinklow, Bretford, Stretton-on-Dunsmore, Princethorpe and the site of a Roman town near Chesterton, until it joins the A429 near the boundary with Gloucestershire. The route then follows the A429 through Stretton-on-Fosse, Moreton-in-Marsh, Stow-on-the-Wold, Northleach and Fossebridge, to Cirencester, where it crosses Akeman Street and Ermin Way.

=== Cirencester to Bath ===
South of Cirencester the Fosse Way follows a short section of the A433, then goes cross country. The Fosse Way crosses the River Thames and under the first South Wales railway Golden Valley Line which was constructed via Gloucester. The road continues and later forming the county boundary between Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, across the old airfield at RAF Kemble, then becomes fragmented sections of country lanes; two sections on this stretch are byways rather than maintained roads, and at points on these routes it widens to as much as .

It passes near the Iron Age hill fort of Bury Camp and becomes another section of the county boundary, crossing second the South Wales railway which is the South Wales Main Line, next the site of an old chapel and spring at Fosse Lodge in Dunley, and then the M4. Thereafter it passes through The Shoe and Nettleton Shrub where remains of a posting-station have been found, and arrives at Batheaston. Thereupon it turns due west to follow the River Avon into Bath.

=== Bath to Ilchester ===

Between Bath and Shepton Mallet the line of the Fosse Way follows parts of the A367, through Clandown, Radstock, Westfield and Stratton-on-the-Fosse. It runs across open country and farm tracks parallel to the A37 north of Shepton Mallet, near the Iron Age hill fort of Maesbury. At Beacon Hill south of Oakhill, it crossed the Roman road along the Mendip ridgeway from Old Sarum to the lead and silver mines at Charterhouse. The Fosse Way passes through the eastern suburbs of Shepton Mallet on a short stretch of the A361 to Cannard&#x27;s Grave, where it picks up the A37.

The Fosse Way follows the A37 through Street-on-the-Fosse and Lydford-on-Fosse on a direct route to Ilchester. The route leaves the A37 north of the A303 junction just north of Ilchester, and follows a small track (previously part of the A37 from before the by-pass opened and broken by the present-day A372 and A303), before picking up the B3151 through the town. It leaves the B3151 onto Ilchester&#x27;s High Street, then follows West Street and Roman Road, a minor road that was formerly part of the A303, towards the present-day A303 west of town.

The Roman road from Ilchester to Dorchester, Dorset continues on the line of A37 through Yeovil to the south east. Other minor Roman roads lead from Ilchester and Lydford-on-Fosse towards Street and the A39 route along the Polden Hills, leading to Roman salt works on the Somerset Levels, and ports at Combwich, Crandon Bridge and Highbridge.

=== Ilchester to Exeter ===

After Ilchester the Fosse Way is followed by a section of the A303 under the ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort of Ham Hill, occupied by the Second Legion after the conquest of the Durotriges in Dorset.

The alignment leaves major roads after Petherton Bridge over the River Parrett, and follows country lanes to Over Stratton and Dinnington, where in 2002 members of the Channel 4 television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; uncovered a mosaic next to the road.

The route crosses a stream called Stretford Water, climbs the ridge, and follows a short section of the A30 at Windwhistle Hill. Then it turns on to the B3167 through the hamlets of Street and Perry Street, joins the A358, crosses the River Axe at what used to be called Stratford (now called Weycroft), and on to Axminster.

The location of the end of the Fosse Way is uncertain. There are further alignments on the A358 at Ball&#x27;s Farm and Musbury south of Axminster, which imply a Roman road did continue along the River Axe toward Axmouth and Seaton. These sections are labelled &quot;Fosse Way&quot; on Ordnance Survey maps.

The crossroads in Axminster was controlled by a Roman fort at Woodbury Farm, now on the southern edge of the town. The route to the west crosses the Rivers Axe and Yarty to Kilmington, continuing on segments of the A35 and minor local lanes to Honiton. From Honiton the route leads south-west along the old A30, to Strete Ralegh, where there is a short break, then a clear alignment along the former A30, now a minor road, towards Exeter.

<doc id="189714" wikidata="Q1648333" url="?curid=189714" title="William Warburton">
<text>William Warburton (24 December 16987 June 1779) was an English writer, literary critic and churchman, Bishop of Gloucester from 1759 until his death. He edited editions of the works of his friend Alexander Pope, and of William Shakespeare.

==Life==
Warburton was born on 24 December 1698 at Newark, Nottinghamshire, where his father, George Warburton was town clerk. He was educated at Oakham and Newark grammar schools, and in 1714, he was articled to Mr Kirke, an attorney, at East Markham. In 1719, after serving his articles he returned to Newark, where he began to practise as a solicitor, but, having studied Latin and Greek, changed his mind and was ordained deacon by the Archbishop of York in 1723. He was ordained as a priest in 1726, and in the same year began to associate with literary circles in London.

Sir Robert Sutton gave Warburton the small living of Greasley, in Nottinghamshire, exchanged next year for that of Brant Broughton in Lincolnshire. He was, in addition, rector of Firsby from 1730 until 1756, although he never lived in the village. In 1728, he was made an honorary M.A. of the University of Cambridge.

At Brant Broughton for 18 years he spent his time in study, the first result of which was his treatise on the &quot;Alliance between Church and State&quot; (1736). The book brought Warburton into favour at court, and he probably only missed immediate preferment by the death of Queen Caroline.

A series of articles defending the writings of Alexander Pope against charges of religious unorthodoxy, led to a friendship with the poet which contributed greatly to Warburton&#x27;s social advancement. Pope introduced him to both William Murray, later Lord Mansfield, who obtained for him the preachership of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1746, and to Ralph Allen, who, in Dr Johnson&#x27;s words, &quot;gave him his niece and his estate, and, by consequence, a bishopric.&quot; Warburton married Gertrude Tucker, in September 1745, and from that time lived at Allen&#x27;s estate at Prior Park, in Gloucestershire, which he eventually inherited in 1764.

He became prebendary of Gloucester in 1753, chaplain to the king in 1754, prebendary of Durham in 1755, Dean of Bristol in 1757, and Bishop of Gloucester in 1759.

==Literary works==
By 1727 Warburton had written the notes he contributed to Lewis Theobald&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare, published a &quot;Critical and Philosophical Enquiry into the Causes of Miracles&quot;, and contributed anonymously to a pamphlet on the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, &quot;The Legal Judicature in Chancery stated&quot; (1727). This was an answer to another anonymous pamphlet, written by Philip Yorke, later Lord Chancellor.

===The &quot;Divine Legation&quot;===
After &quot;Alliance between Church and State&quot;, his next and best-known work, &quot;Divine Legation of Moses demonstrated on the Principles of a Religious Deist&quot; (1738–41, in two volumes), preserves his name as the author of the most daring and ingenious of theological paradoxes. The deists had made the absence of any inculcation of the doctrine of a future life an objection to the divine authority of the Mosaic writings. Warburton boldly admitted the fact and turned it against the adversary by maintaining that no merely human legislator would have omitted such a sanction of morality. Warburton&#x27;s extraordinary power, learning and originality were acknowledged on all sides, though he excited censure and suspicion by his tenderness to the alleged heresies of Conyers Middleton. The book aroused much controversy. In a pamphlet of &quot;Remarks&quot; (1742), he replied to John Tillard, and &quot;Remarks on Several Occasional Reflections&quot; (1744–45) was an answer to Akenside, Conyers Middleton (who had been his friend), Richard Pococke, Nicholas Mann, Richard Grey, Henry Stebbing and other critics. As he characterised his opponents in general as the &quot;pestilent herd of libertine scribblers with which the island is overrun,&quot; it is no surprise that the publication of the book created many bitter enemies.

===Defence of Pope===
Either in quest of paradox, or unable to recognise the real tendencies of Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Man&quot;, Warburton defended it against the &quot;Examen&quot; of Jean Pierre de Crousaz through a series of articles he contributed to &quot;The Works of the Learned&quot; in 1738–9. Whether Pope had really understood the tendency of his own work has always been doubtful, but there is no question that he was glad of an apologist, and that in the long run Warburton&#x27;s &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot; helped Pope more than all his erudition. This led to a sincere friendship between the two men, with Pope fostering Warburton as a literary collaborator and editor. As part of this effort, in a 1743 edition of the &quot;Dunciad&quot; published under Warburton&#x27;s editorship, Pope persuaded Warburton to add a fourth book, and encouraged the substitution of Colley Cibber for Theobald as the &quot;hero&quot; of the poem. On his death in 1744, Pope&#x27;s will bequeathed half of his library to Warburton, as well as the copyright to all his printed works. Warburton would subsequently publish a full edition of Pope&#x27;s writings in 1751.

===Edition of Shakespeare=== 
In 1747 his edition of Shakespeare was published, incorporating material from Pope&#x27;s earlier edition. He had previously entrusted notes and emendations on Shakespeare to Sir Thomas Hanmer, whose unauthorised use of them led to a heated controversy. He also accused Lewis Theobald, with whom he had corresponded on Shakespearean subjects as early as 1727, of stealing his ideas, and denied his critical ability.

===Later works===
Warburton was further kept busy by replying to the attacks on his &quot;Divine Legation&quot; from all quarters, by a dispute with Bolingbroke respecting Pope&#x27;s behaviour in the affair of Bolingbroke&#x27;s &quot;Patriot King&quot;, and by a vindication in 1750 of the alleged miraculous interruption of the rebuilding of the temple of Jerusalem undertaken by Julian, in answer to Conyers Middleton. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Warburton&#x27;s manner of dealing with opponents was both insolent and rancorous, but it did him no disservice.&quot;

He continued to write for as long as the infirmities of age allowed, collecting and publishing his sermons, and attempting to complete the &quot;Divine Legation&quot;, further fragments of which were published with his posthumous &quot;Works&quot;. He wrote a defence of revealed religion in his &quot;View of Lord Bolingbroke&#x27;s Philosophy&quot; (1754), and Hume&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Religion&quot; called forth some &quot;Remarks ... by a gentleman of Cambridge&quot; (1757) from Warburton, in which his friend and biographer, Richard Hurd, had a share.

In 1762 he launched a vigorous attack on Methodism under the title of &quot;The Doctrine of Grace&quot;. He also engaged in a keen controversy with Robert Lowth, later bishop of London, on the book of Job, in which Lowth brought home charges of lack of scholarship and of insolence that admitted of no denial. His last important act was to found in 1768 the Warburtonian lecture at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, &quot;to prove the truth of revealed religion ... from the completion of the prophecies of the Old and New Testament which relate to the Christian Church, especially to the apostasy of Papal Rome.&quot;

==Death==
Warburton died at Gloucester on 7 June 1779. He left no children, his only son having predeceased him. In 1781 his widow, Gertrude, married the Rev. Martin Stafford Smith.

==Posthumous publications and biographies==
His works were edited in seven volumes (1788) by Richard Hurd with a biographical preface, and the correspondence between the two friends—an important contribution to the literary history of the period—was edited by Samuel Parr in 1808. Warburton&#x27;s life was also written by John Selby Watson in 1863, and Mark Pattison made him the subject of an essay in 1889.

<doc id="189716" wikidata="Q1381018" url="?curid=189716" title="William Stukeley">
<text>William Stukeley (7 November 1687 – 3 March 1765) was an English antiquarian, physician and Anglican clergyman. A significant influence on the later development of archaeology, he pioneered the scholarly investigation of the prehistoric monuments of Stonehenge and Avebury in Wiltshire. He published over twenty books on archaeology and other subjects during his lifetime. Born in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, as the son of a lawyer, Stukeley worked in his father&#x27;s law business before attending Saint Benet&#x27;s College, Cambridge (now Corpus Christi College). In 1709, he began studying medicine at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, Southwark, before working as a general practitioner in Boston, Lincolnshire. 

From 1710 until 1725, he embarked on annual tours of the countryside, seeking out archaeological monuments and other features that interested him; he wrote up and published several accounts of his travels. In 1717, he returned to London and established himself within the city&#x27;s antiquarian circles. In 1718, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and became the first secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1721, he became a Freemason and, in 1722, co-founded the Society of Roman Knights, an organisation devoted to the study of Roman Britain. In the early 1720s, Stukeley developed a particular interest in Stonehenge and Avebury, two prehistoric stone circles in Wiltshire. He visited them repeatedly, undertaking fieldwork to determine their dimensions.

In 1726, Stukeley relocated to Grantham, Lincolnshire, where he married. In 1729 he was ordained as a cleric in the Church of England and appointed vicar of All Saints&#x27; Church in Stamford, Lincolnshire. He was a friend of the Archbishop of Canterbury William Wake, who encouraged him to use his antiquarian studies to combat the growth of deism and freethought in Britain. To this end, Stukeley developed the belief that Britain&#x27;s ancient druids had followed a monotheistic religion inherited from the Biblical Patriarchs; he called this druidic religion &quot;Patriarchal Christianity&quot;. He further argued that the druids had erected the stone circles as part of serpentine monuments symbolising the Trinity. 

In 1747, he returned to London as rector of St George the Martyr, Holborn. In the last part of his life, he became instrumental in British scholarship&#x27;s acceptance of Charles Bertram&#x27;s forged &quot;Description of Britain&quot; and wrote one of the earliest biographies of Sir Isaac Newton. Stukeley&#x27;s ideas influenced various antiquaries throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in addition to artists like William Blake, although these had been largely rejected by archaeologists by the second half of the 19th century. Stukeley was the subject of multiple biographies and academic studies by scholars like Stuart Piggott, David Boyd Haycock and Ronald Hutton.

== Biography ==
===Childhood and university: 1687–1708===
Stukeley was born on 7 November 1669 at the family home in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, the eldest child in a family of four boys and one girl; it is possible that he was named after William of Orange, who soon after became King of England. 

His paternal grandfather, John Stukeley (1623–1675), was a country gentleman who possessed a small estate at Uffington, Lincolnshire and who accrued a large number of debts by the time of his death. John had two sons; the elder, Adlard, was apprenticed to the legal profession, while the younger, also called John, was initially trained as a farmer before joining Adlard in a family law firm. On 28 May 1686, John married the teenage daughter of Robert Bullen in Pinchbeck, Lincolnshire; their first child was miscarried, with William being their second.

In 1692, at the age of five, Stukeley began an education at Holbeach&#x27;s Free School, where he learned to read and write. By the age of thirteen, he was the top-rated pupil at his school. As a schoolchild, he began collecting Roman coins after a hoard was found nearby and also developed interests in botany and medicine. 

In 1700, he was taken out of school to work in his father&#x27;s legal business. With his father he travelled south to London on various occasions, where he purchased many books and scientific instruments. He was nevertheless bored by his law activities, and when he requested that he be allowed to study at university, his father agreed.

He began studying at Cambridge University in November 1703 as a pensioner at Benet College (now Corpus Christi College). Among the classes that he took during his studies were Classics, Ethics, Logic, Metaphysics, Divinity, Mathematics and Philosophy. In his spare time, he dissected animals and searched for fossils in the gravel pits outside the town; in 1708, he dissected a hanged man. 

Outside of term time, he travelled to London, there taking anatomy courses with George Rolf and becoming acquainted with the poet John Gay. In February 1706, his father died, with his uncle passing away three weeks later. He returned home to sort out the family&#x27;s financial affairs. In 1707, his mother died, leaving him in charge of his younger siblings; to pay off family debts, he sold off their furniture and let out their Holbeach home. He attracted notoriety for dissecting a local who had committed suicide. In January 1709, he returned to Cambridge to defend his thesis, on the title of &quot;Catamenia pendent a plethora&quot;. By this point he was taking a growing interest in architecture, producing careful pen-drawings of medieval buildings. He considered embarking on the fashionable Grand Tour of continental Europe to see the ancient ruins of Greece and Italy, but likely decided against it on financial grounds.

===Medical career: 1709–1716===
In August 1709, Stukeley moved to London to further pursue medicine under doctor Richard Mead at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. In March 1710, he left the city to practise medicine in the countryside, establishing a practice in Boston, Lincolnshire. He took with him a black servant, which would have been a status symbol at the time. Little is known of the time that he spent in the town, although, in 1713, he was accorded the Freedom of the Town. 

His brother, Adlard, moved in with him, and, in Boston, was apprenticed to a local apothecary. Stukeley also formed a local botanic society that went on weekly plant-collecting trips in the local area. In 1715, he produced a print of St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Boston, which he dedicated to the Marquis of Lindsey. Many of his travels around Lincolnshire were written up in what appears to be his first book, &quot;Iter Domesticum&quot;, although the year of its publication is not known.

From 1710 until 1725, Stukeley embarked on a horseback expedition through the countryside at least once a year, taking notes on the things that he observed. In 1710, for example, he first visited the prehistoric ceremonial complex, the Rollright Stones. At the time, his interests were not purely antiquarian, for he also took notes on landscape gardens and other more recent constructions that he encountered. 

In 1712, Stukeley embarked on an extensive tour of western Britain, taking in Wales before returning to England to visit Grantham, Derby, Buxton, Chatsworth and Manchester. He later published an account of these travels in Western Britain as &quot;Iter Cimbricum&quot;. 

Stukeley&#x27;s later biographer Stuart Piggott related that this book was &quot;not yet the characteristic product of a field archaeologist&quot; but rather &quot;differs little from that which could be written by any intelligent gentleman of the period&quot;.

Stukeley befriended the antiquary Maurice Johnson and joined Johnson&#x27;s learned society, the Spalding Gentlemen&#x27;s Society, which is still based in Spalding, Lincolnshire. A 1714 letter indicates that Johnson recommended several books on British history to Stukeley, apparently at the latter&#x27;s request; the suggested titles included Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, John Milton&#x27;s &quot;The History of Britain&quot;, Robert Brady&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to the Old English History&quot;, Peter Heylin&#x27;s &quot;Help to English History&quot;, and Richard Rowlands&#x27; &quot;A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities concerning the most noble and renowned English Nation&quot;. Another letter to Johnson, this time from May 1714, reveals that Stukeley was assembling a series of chronological tables of all British kings since Brutus of Troy; following the medieval historian Geoffrey of Monmouth, Stukeley believed that the legendary Brutus was a real historical figure. 

In September 1716, he wrote an account of Richborough Castle, a Roman Saxon Shore fort in Kent. That same year, he described having made a model of the Neolithic/Bronze Age stone circle of Stonehenge.

===Return to London: 1717–1725===
By May 1717, Stukeley had returned to London, living in Great Ormond Street. Once in the city he began to circulate within its antiquarian circles. At Mead&#x27;s nomination, in early 1718 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, then under the presidency of the scientist Isaac Newton. Stukeley befriended Newton and visited him at his home on several occasions; he was part of a coterie in the society who supported Newtonian philosophy. 

Stukeley lectured to the society on a &quot;fossil crocodile or porpoise&quot; in 1719 (a plesiosaur now on display in the Natural History Museum, London), arguing that it was evidence for the Genesis flood narrative; in February 1720, he lectured to the society on female human anatomy, illustrated with drawings of a cadaver he had autopsied. Following Edmond Halley&#x27;s resignation as society secretary, in November 1721, Stukeley put himself forward as a potential replacement; he unsuccessfully ran against Newton&#x27;s favoured candidate, James Jurin. This upset some of Stukeley&#x27;s friendships in the group and cooled his relationship with Newton for several years.

Also in 1718, Stukeley joined the newly founded Society of Antiquaries of London and became its first secretary. In 1721–22 he was partly instrumental in setting up the society&#x27;s committee on coins. He nevertheless appears to have taken little active part in the society&#x27;s business. He retained his interest in medical matters, and in June 1719 took a medical doctorate in Cambridge, enabling him to join the London College of Physicians in 1720. 

In October 1720, he was one of the physicians who conducted an autopsy of a deceased elephant in Hans Sloane&#x27;s Chelsea garden. In March 1722 he gave the Goulstonian Lecture at the Royal College theatre; his topic was the human spleen. He published his lectures as &quot;On the Spleen&quot; in 1722, appending to it his &quot;Essay Towards the Anatomy of the Elephant&quot;. According to Stukeley biographer David Boyd Haycock, &quot;On the Spleen&quot; was significant as &quot;his first major publication, and his only one in anatomy&quot;.

Stukeley developed a friendship with two brothers who shared many of his antiquarian interests, Roger and Samuel Gale. From his father, the former Dean of York Thomas Gale, Roger had inherited a copy of the &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;, a work produced by seventeenth-century antiquarian John Aubrey. He showed it to Stukeley, who produced a transcription of Aubrey&#x27;s document in either 1717 or 1718. Piggott suggested that it was Aubrey&#x27;s manuscript that first brought Avebury to Stukeley&#x27;s attention. Circa 1718, Stukeley first visited the site, accompanied by the Gale brothers. In 1719, he visited again, also taking in Stonehenge before traveling to Oxford to meet Thomas Hearne, an antiquarian who was highly critical of Stukeley. That summer, he spent time in Great Chesterford in Essex, where he identified a Romano-British temple from crop marks in a field.
Stukeley devoted much attention to Avebury during the 1720s. The records he produced of how the monument and its various features looked at the time has been important for later archaeologists for by the early twentieth century—when the earliest sustained archaeological investigation of the site took place—many of these features had been lost. He witnessed locals breaking up megaliths in the circle and although powerless to stop them it may have been this observation that led him to produce a detailed record of the site.

In January 1721, Stukeley was initiated as a Freemason. He suspected that Freemasonry was the &quot;remains of the mysterys of the antients [sic]&quot;. By 1723 he was the Master of the Masonic Lodge meeting at Fountain Tavern on London&#x27;s Strand. In July 1722, he and several friends formed the Society of Roman Knights, an organisation devoted to the study of Roman Britain. The group began with sixteen members before attracting new recruits over the following two years. In admitting women as well as men, the Society was unprecedented within British society at the time; the Society of Antiquaries for instance would not admit female members for another two centuries. Members of the Roman Knights each took a name from the Romano-British period; Stukeley&#x27;s was &quot;Chyndonax&quot;, the name of a priest listed in a Greek inscription reputedly found in a glass cinerary urn in 1598. Through the society he also became close friends with Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford and Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea; he encouraged the latter to carry out archaeological fieldwork, as at Julliberrie&#x27;s Grave in Kent.

In August 1721, Stukeley and Roger Gale set forth on another tour, visiting Avebury and Stonehenge before going to Gloucester, Hereford, Ludlow, Wolverhampton, Derby, and finally reaching Grantham in October. He wrote up his notes of the journey as &quot;Iter Sabrinum&quot;. 

He returned to Avebury in the summer of 1722 — this time with the artists Gerard Vandergucht and John Pine, who had both become Roman Knights that year — before proceeding to Stonehenge and Silchester. In September and October he embarked on another tour, this time taking in Cambridge, Boston, Lincoln, Dunstable, Leminster and Rochester, largely following Roman roads. He published a description of this tour as &quot;Iter Romanum&quot;. 

In 1723, he travelled from London to Newbury and Marlborough before visiting Stanton Drew stone circles, and then heading back east to Bath, Exeter and Dorchester. These tours were written up as &quot;Iter Dumnoniense&quot; and &quot;Iter Septimum Antonini Aug&quot;. He also wrote an account of Dorchester&#x27;s Maumbury Rings in October 1723 as &quot;Of the Roman Amphitheater at Dorchester&quot;.
It was while at Avebury in 1723 that he began a draft of the &quot;History of the Temples of the Ancient Celts&quot;. This work drew upon his fieldwork at both Avebury and Stonehenge as well as his field-notes from other prehistoric sites and information obtained from the &#x27;Templa Druidum&#x27; section of Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;. The work also cited Biblical and Classical texts. In the book, Stukeley discussed how prehistoric people might have erected such monuments using sledges, timber cradles, rollers and leavers. He devoted much space to refuting the suggestion, made by Inigo Jones and J. Webb, that Stonehenge had been erected by the Romans, instead attributing it to the prehistoric—or as he called it, &quot;Celtic&quot;—period. The druids are mentioned only briefly in the book, when Stukeley suggested that they might be possible creators of the stone circles.

In 1724, Stukeley returned to Avebury and Stonehenge, returning via Ringwood and Romsey before heading up to Lincoln and then back down to Kent later in the year. This was the final year in which he conducted fieldwork at Avebury. The Oxford English Dictionary lists that the first known use of the word &quot;relationship&quot; is from 1724, in his writings. In 1725, Stukeley engaged in the last of his great tours, this time with Roger Gale.

This took him from Dunstable up into the Midlands, where he visited Coventry, Birmingham, Derby and Buxton before heading west to Chester and then north for Liverpool and the Lake District; there he visited stone circles like Long Meg and Her Daughters and Castlerigg stone circle. From there, Stukeley and Gale travelled further north to Whitehaven and then Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, following it along to Newcastle before heading south back to London via Durham and Doncaster.

===Marriage and the clergy: 1726–46===
In 1726, Stukeley left London and relocated to Grantham in Lincolnshire. The reasons for his decision to do so are obscure. It may be that he left the city due to frustration that his antiquarian research was not being financially supported by wealthier benefactors. On his move to Grantham, Stukeley resigned as secretary of the Society of Antiquaries. Stukeley struggled to earn a living as a physician in Grantham; he also established a Freemasonic lodge in the town, although it never appeared on the roll of the Grand Lodge of England. In December 1727 he married Frances Williamson, daughter of a gentleman from Allington. The couple&#x27;s attempts to conceive children met with failure, and Williamson suffered two miscarriages. In October 1728, Stukeley buried the second of the two unborn infants in his garden, performing a funeral ceremony that drew upon his interest in ancient Roman practices. Frances subsequently bore Stukeley three further daughters.

Stukeley was friendly with the Archbishop of Canterbury William Wake, who shared his interest in antiquarianism. Stukeley asked his friend if he may become a cleric in the Church of England, a request which Wake granted in June 1729. Wake ordained him as a deacon in Croydon on 20 July 1729. Given his intellectual pursuits, Wake saw Stukeley as a welcome recruit in the Church of England&#x27;s conflict with Freethought. 

In October 1729, the Lord Chancellor Peter King granted Stukeley the living of All Saints in Stamford, Lincolnshire, taking up residence in the town in early 1730. He enjoyed the town&#x27;s medieval architecture, and began to write a history of the settlement in the form of a dialogue. He also enjoyed gardening while living in the town, in 1738 building a &quot;Hermitage&quot; in his garden, which featured niches, a stone arch and a fountain.

According to Piggott, Stukeley&#x27;s ordination was &quot;the essential turning-point in his whole life&quot;. His reasons for joining the clergy are not known for certain. One possibility is that he sought the steady income supplied by a Church of England living, having for a while complained about how little he earned as a doctor. Alternately, he may have believed that becoming a cleric would be a secure position from which he could pursue the unorthodox ideas he was developing. His decision to join the clergy concerned friends like Robert Gale. To Piggott, Stukeley sought to use his fieldwork &quot;as ammunition in a holy war against the Deists&quot;. Stukeley would write that his purpose in becoming a cleric was &quot;to combat the deists from an unexpected quarter&quot;, describing his &quot;resentment of that deluge of profaneness and infidelity that prevails so much at present, and threatens an utter subversion of religion in general&quot;.

In 1736, he co-founded a local antiquarian and literary society, The Brazen Nose, with six other founder-members (George Lynn being one of them). It held weekly meetings at which they discussed a varied range of subjects; the first meeting involved discussions of astronomy, lunar maps, a wasp&#x27;s nest, a medieval seal, and a bladder stone the size of a walnut that had been retrieved from a small dog. The society eventually lapsed, and Stukeley&#x27;s attempt to revive it in 1746 proved unsuccessful. He also remained interested in the local discovery of antiquities; he became aware of a large, silver Romano-British dish uncovered at Risley Park, Derbyshire in 1729 and read an account of it to the Society of Antiquaries in 1736. In October 1742, Stukeley was alerted to the discovery of the Royston Cave by local politician William Goodhall. He wrote about the site in his 1743 book, &quot;Palaeographia Britannica No. I&quot;&#x27;, in which he argued that the cave&#x27;s decorated chamber was established as a hermitage for a Lady Roisia de Vere circa 1170. A 1744 pamphlet was then issued by the Reverend Charles Parkin, arguing that the carvings were Anglo-Saxon in origin. Stukeley was affronted by the suggestion, and wrote his 1746 &quot;Origines Roystonianae II&quot; in response to it. In 1740, he was removed as a member of the Society of Antiquaries for not renewing his membership dues.

In 1740, he published &quot;Stonehenge&quot;, a book that he described as being devoted to the subject of &quot;Patriarchal Christianity&quot;. He believed that learned people would read the book to learn about stone circles and druids, and that in doing so they would encounter the ancient proto-Christian of Britain and thus recognise how similar it was to modern Anglicanism. In doing so, he believed, they would reject the ideas promoted by deism and the freethinkers.

In the winter of 1737, Stukeley&#x27;s wife died at the age of forty. By February 1737/38, he suggested to Samuel Gale that they live together, although this plan never came to fruition. In 1739, Stukeley married the Gale brothers&#x27; sister, bringing her to live with him at Stamford. Her marriage portion of £10,000 allowed Stukeley to maintain two houses from 1740 onward; summers were spent at Stamford while winters were spent in his home in Gloucester Street, London. Also in 1739, he went into business producing medicinal oils with the daughter of John Rogers, a recently deceased apothecary whose wares Stukeley had previously championed.

When in London, he regularly attended meetings of the Royal Society. In December 1741, he was appointed an associate member of the Egyptian Society, a group led by Lord Sandwich as its first president. Through the society, Stukeley became friends with the 2nd Duke of Montagu, regularly visiting the latter&#x27;s home at Boughton House, Northamptonshire. Inspired by the medieval Gothic buildings, he began designing various Gothic plans of his own. This included a Gothic bridge and a mausoleum designed for the Duke of Montagu&#x27;s estate, although neither were ever built.

In 1746, Stukeley drew up a very careful account of Charles I&#x27;s journey from Oxford to the Scottish army camp near Newark in 1646.

===Final years: 1747–1765===
In late 1747, Stukeley became the rector for St George the Martyr, Queen Square, a parish in Bloomsbury, London. He moved permanently to the city in February 1748. Stukeley was a friend of Isaac Newton and wrote a memoir of his life in 1752. This is one of the earliest sources for the story of the falling apple that inspired Newton&#x27;s formulation of the theory of gravitation. In the 1750s, he became a regular attendee at Royal Society events. However, within the group he found himself increasingly sidelined under the presidency of Martin Folkes; although the pair retained a cordial relationship, Stukeley felt that Folkes was responsible for a decline in the quality of the society and was likely upset by Folkes&#x27; mocking attitude towards Christianity.

Following Sloane&#x27;s death in 1753, Stukeley was selected as a trustee to help establish the British Museum, reflecting his standing in London antiquarian circles. He was also involved in the running of the Foundling Hospital, where he became acquainted with the illustrator William Hogarth. 

In 1753, a Late Bronze Age tool hoard was uncovered during landscaping at Kew Gardens; Stukeley was invited to come and inspect the discovery the following year, at which point he met with the Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, who had an interest in antiquarian matters. In 1754, he was re-admitted to the Society of Antiquaries. That same year, one of Stukeley&#x27;s parishioners died, leaving his book collection to the Bodleian Library and Lincoln College, Oxford. Stukeley was left as one of his executors, and, in May 1755, transported the book collection to Oxford. Following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, Stukeley developed an active interest in the subject, presenting papers on earthquakes to the Royal Society and, in 1750, publishing &quot;Philosophy of Earthquakes, Natural and Religious&quot;.

In June 1747, Stukeley had received a letter from Charles Bertram, an Englishman living in Denmark. In their ensuing correspondence, Bertram claimed to possess a copy of a manuscript allegedly produced by a 14th-century monk from Winchester known as Richard of Cirencester, which in turn contained an account and map of Roman Britain. Stukeley expressed caution regarding Bertram&#x27;s claims, asking for detailed information regarding the original manuscript&#x27;s provenance, with Bertram responding that he could not provide any because he had been sworn to secrecy by the man who supplied him with it. Stukeley unsuccessfully attempted to buy the manuscript from Bertram, stating that he would deposit it in the library of the British Museum. In March and again in April 1756, Stukeley read papers on Bertram&#x27;s manuscript to the Society of Antiquaries of London. He published these in 1757 as &quot;An Account of Richard of Cirencester, Monk of Westminster, and of his Works&quot;, which reproduced the map but not the text of the original manuscript, instead consisting of Stukeley&#x27;s own commentary. At the time, many antiquarians regarded it as a genuine text, although a few had suspicions; in 1795, Thomas Reynolds declared that Bertram&#x27;s document was a forgery, although this would be widely recognised only in the 19th century. This discovery damaged Stukeley&#x27;s reputation among later scholars, bolstering his reputation for credulity. Stukeley had similarly been taken in by another forgery, James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot; poems, writing to Macpherson in praise of his alleged discovery.

Stukeley also displayed a growing interest in the Roman Emperor Carausius and his coinage. In 1750, he and John Kennedy saw a sketch of a silver coin that had been discovered at Silchester and donated to the King of France. Both of them misread the legend on the reverse of the coin, believing that it read &quot;ORIVNA&quot;; it had actually read &quot;FORTVNA&quot;, but with the &quot;F&quot; largely eroded. In 1751, Kennedy published his &quot;Dissertation on Oriuna&quot;, in which he claimed that Oriuna was the guardian goddess of Carausius. Stukeley disagreed, believing that Oriuna was Carausius&#x27; wife; he published this argument as &quot;Palaeographia Britannica No. III&quot; in 1752.

The last decade of Stukeley&#x27;s life was — according to Piggott 
— &quot;relatively uneventful&quot;. He had re-joined the Society of Antiquaries but the papers presented there were increasingly treated un-seriously, while at the Royal Society, his papers were turned down and not published in its &quot;Transactions&quot;. He retained his concern with the destruction of ancient monuments, in particular the pillaging of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall for stone, imploring Princess Augusta to intervene and raising the issue in a November 1757 report for the Society of Antiquaries. He also raised concerns about the sturdiness of the Eleanor cross at Waltham Cross and ensured it was renovated.

In 1757, Stukeley&#x27;s second wife died. In 1759, Stukeley purchased a cottage in the (then largely rural) area of Kentish Town, to the north of London. In 1763, he published &quot;Paleographia Sacra, or Discourses on Sacred Subject&quot; as a collection of some of his Sunday sermons. 

In early 1765, Stukeley suffered a stroke, fell into a coma and remained in this state for three days before dying in his bed on 3 March, aged 77. He was buried without a monument in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church, East Ham, which he is said to have selected as his resting-place on a visit there during his lifetime.

==Ideas==
Hutton noted that Stukeley &quot;always had a strong streak of mysticism and interpreted ancient remains in accordance with set notions concerning the nature of primeval religion.&quot; He had a strong belief in immanent or inherent divinity. His belief in an immanent and interconnected divinity led him to adopt ideas from Pythagoreanism and Neoplatonism: from the former he adopted the belief that music and numbers expressed the divine order, while from the latter he adopted the notion of hidden correspondences between various parts of the natural world.

Few of Stukeley&#x27;s ideas were wholly original, being based on earlier sources. His general framework for understanding Britain&#x27;s prehistoric past derived from his belief in the literal truth of Biblical mythology, including the Creation of the world in 4004 BC and events like the Genesis flood narrative. There is no evidence that when he started investigating Avebury and Stonehenge in 1719, he regarded them as having been erected by the druids. At the time, many antiquarians believed that they had been created in more recent periods; Inigo Jones believed Stonehenge had been built by Romans, Walter Charleton by Danish invaders in the Anglo-Saxon period, while Edmund Bolton attributed it to the ancient British but not specifically the druids. In adopting the idea that the druids had erected these monuments, he was following the ideas of Aubrey, which he had read in unpublished manuscript form.

Stukeley believed that the druids were part of &quot;an oriental colony&quot; of Phoenicians who had settled in Britain between the end of Noah&#x27;s flood and the time of Abraham. He stated that the druids were &quot;of Abraham&#x27;s religion intirely [sic]&quot; and that, although never having encountered divine revelation, had concluded through their own reasoning that God existed as a Trinity. He also stated that their religion was &quot;so extremely like Christianity, that in effect in differ&#x27;d from it only in this; they believed in a Messiah who was to come into this world, as we believe in him that is come.&quot;

He believed that the leader of the Phoenician druids had been Hercules, who had landed in western Britain and created the Boscawen-Un circle in Cornwall. The idea that Hercules had arrived in south-west Britain was not original to Stukeley, having been adopted from Aylett Sammes&#x27; &quot;Britannia Antiqua Illustrata&quot; from 1676. Stukeley also believed that, because of Britain&#x27;s isolated location, the druids had preserved the ancient monotheistic religion and that &quot;the true religion has chiefly, since the repeopling of mankind after the flood, subsisted in our land&quot;.

His idea that the druids once formed a monotheistic priesthood akin to those of modern Christians also owed an influence from older sources. Michael Drayton&#x27;s 1612 poem &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; had for instance portrayed them as wise, monotheistic sages and philosophers.

By the time he became a cleric, he had come to believe that the ancient Egyptians, Plato and the druids all accepted the existence of the Trinity. By June 1730, he was claiming that Avebury was a symbolic depiction of the Trinity. He believed that ancient humans had venerated the components of the cosmos, such as the heavenly bodies and the four elements, and that they recognised the numbers and musical harmonies from which the cosmos had been created.

The idea that Britain was God&#x27;s chosen nation was a recurrent idea in Stukeley&#x27;s thought. He thought that Britons should emulate the ancient Romans. Stukeley believed that God had created the Roman Empire to prepare for the arrival of Jesus and to assist in the spread of Christianity throughout Europe. In this, he believed that the ancient Romans had replaced the Jews as God&#x27;s chosen people. In his view, the Roman Empire collapsed because its inhabitants had corrupted Christianity with what he called &quot;superstitious fopperys&quot; and that this perverted mixture survived as the Roman Catholic Church. Like many English people of his time, he believed that the Church of England, which had split from the Roman Catholic Church during the 16th-century English Reformation, had gained special favour from God; in Stukeley&#x27;s words, it represented &quot;the main support of religion now upon the face of the earth&quot;. Haycock noted that &quot;a leading theme in Stukeley&#x27;s antiquarian work&quot; was &quot;the resurrection of British history as an archetype for world history, and of Britain as a country historically fit to lead the world into the future&quot;. He criticised Britons who favoured archaeological remains encountered abroad during the Grand Tour, claiming that they were neglecting their own national heritage and adopting continental habits and vices such as effeminacy.

===Fieldwork===
Stukeley placed an emphasis on measuring and recording historical sites and encouraged his various correspondents to do the same. He engaged in excavation by digging in and around archaeological sites, relating that doing so was &quot;like an anatomical dissection&quot;. He recognised the principle of stratigraphy, that different layers of soil reflected different periods in the development of a site.

From the 1720s, he believed that the prehistoric complex at Avebury was laid out to represent a snake with its head and tail. By 1724, he was arguing that the snake was a symbol of Christ, with its shedding of skin echoing the resurrection and the circle or head representing the unity and wholeness of God. Using Halley&#x27;s arguments about the gradual shift in the compass over time, Stukeley calculated that Stonehenge was built in 460 BC and Avebury in 1860 BC.

==Personal life==
Piggott described Stukeley as &quot;a gregarious creature&quot; who enjoyed conversation and being flattered. Haycock referred to Stukeley&#x27;s &quot;amiable personality&quot;, while Piggott also highlighted &quot;an immensely likeable quality&quot; to Stukeley&#x27;s personality, as evidence highlighting that when the reverend was laid up in bed in Queens Square on one occasion, over 120 friends and parishioners either visited him or sent him a message of sympathy. He also regarded the antiquary as displaying a &quot;charm and pleasant oddness&quot; as well as a &quot;cheerfulness and disarming ingenuousness&quot;. Piggott also noted that in later life, Stukeley became &quot;self-opinionated&quot; and &quot;dogmatic&quot;.

After the antiquarian&#x27;s death, Bishop Warburton stated that in Stukeley displayed &quot;a mixture of simplicity, drollery, absurdity, ingenuity, superstition and antiquarianism, that he afforded me that kind of well-seasoned repast, which the French call an &quot;Ambigu&quot;, I suppose from a compound of things never meant to meet together.&quot;

According to Hutton, Stukeley had &quot;a profound and lifelong love of structure, form and design&quot; that was reflected in his interest in the medieval profession as well as antiquities. He had an enthusiasm for gardening, and was fond of both city and countryside, enjoying the ability of traveling between the two. Fond of pets, he reported feeling great grief following the death of his cat, Tit, in the 1740s. While living in Boston, he aligned himself with the Tories. He suffered from gout, having his first attack of the disease in 1709.

Stukeley&#x27;s decision, in 1722, to adopt the pseudonym of Chyndonax reflected his inclinations towards identifying with the druids in a personal capacity. This was bolstered by the tendency of friends in the Society of Roman Knights to refer to him, both in conversation and correspondence, as &quot;the Druid&quot;.

By 1740, he was beginning to depict the stone circles at Avebury—which are perfectly circular—as ovals in his illustrations so that they better fitted the shape of a serpent&#x27;s head, which he believed they symbolised.

==Reception and legacy==
Haycock noted that Stukeley&#x27;s books &quot;Stonehenge&quot; and &quot;Abury&quot; were well received, and that scholars &quot;should not lose sight of his achievements behind the screen of his failings.&quot; He noted that Stukeley was &quot;not a lone figure hypothesising wildly in his study&quot; but &quot;participating in a philosophical debate&quot; that attracted the attention of various Enlightenment figures, including Newton, adding that Stukeley had established himself in &quot;a firm position in London&#x27;s intellectual society&quot;. By the early 1720s, Stukeley had a growing reputation as the country&#x27;s main authority on druids and ancient monuments, having no obvious competitor given the comparative novelty of studying stone circles. However, by the 1750s, some of Stukeley&#x27;s contemporaries were criticising the accuracy of some of his plans, and some were also accusing his interpretations of being speculative.

Haycock observed that Stukeley&#x27;s &quot;influence upon antiquarian studies for the century or so after his death&quot; was &quot;profound&quot;. For instance, in his 1796 book &quot;Indian Antiquities&quot;, Thomas Maurice drew upon Stukeley&#x27;s publications as part of his argument that the druids were a group of Indian brahmins who had travelled west. According to Haycock, he &quot;most famous propagator of Stukelian ideas in the early nineteenth century&quot; was the artist and poet William Blake, who had read both &quot;Abury&quot; and &quot;Stonehenge&quot; and been influenced by them. In the nineteenth century, many of Stukeley&#x27;s interpretations were being adopted and expanded by several antiquarian clergymen, including William Lisle Bowles, D. James and John Bathurst Deane. The Wiltshire archaeologist Richard Colt Hoare gave Stukeley&#x27;s work some additional respectability when praising his use of fieldwork; Hoare concurred with Stukeley that sites like Stonehenge and Avebury were likely &quot;Celtic&quot; but did not endorse the idea that they were built by druids, believing that such information was unknowable.

By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the tide had turned against Stukeley&#x27;s ideas in British archaeological circles. In 1889, Augustus Pitt Rivers noted, in his presidential address to the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, that Stukeley&#x27;s name &quot;has been handed down to us chiefly as an example of what to avoid in archaeology&quot;.
According to his biographer, Stuart Piggott, Stukeley was the &quot;central figure of early eighteenth-century archaeology&quot;. The historian Ronald Hutton called him &quot;perhaps the most important forefather of the discipline of archaeology&quot;, while the archaeologist Paul Ashbee referred to Stukeley as &quot;a pioneer unmatched in the history of archaeology&quot;.

The first edition of Piggott&#x27;s biography of Stukeley was published in 1950, with a revised edition released in 1985.
Piggott thought him &quot;one of the most curious and complex of the English eccentrics, pathetic, charming, admirable, and laughable by turns.&quot; Piggott believed that Stukeley&#x27;s folios of Avebury and Stonehenge were his &quot;most important contributions to archaeology&quot;. He noted that the antiquarian&#x27;s plan of Avebury, &quot;though failing by modern standards of accuracy, was nevertheless a very much better achievement than anything that had been produced before&quot;. Piggott&#x27;s ultimate assessment was that Stukeley &quot;was not a good scholar: he was uncritical of his literary sources and his reading was discursive rather than profound. His value to archaeology in his own day and now lies in his capacity to observe and record facts in the open air.&quot; He situated Stukeley&#x27;s intellectual failings within the wider context of British intellectual decline in the years following 1730.

Piggott referred to the &quot;varying quality&quot; of Stukeley&#x27;s work, believing there to have been a &quot;lamentable decline in his later life&quot;. He believed that Stukeley had moved from a &quot;neutral empiricism to an often wildly speculative religious interpretation&quot; of prehistoric archaeology.
In 2005, Hutton noted that there had been &quot;a considerable change of attitude&quot; to Stukeley among scholars over the previous few years, as they had rejected the division into two halves of his life which Piggott had constructed.

Stukeley was the first person to identify the Stonehenge Avenue and Stonehenge Cursus, giving these features the names by which they are now known.

Piggott noted that Stukeley&#x27;s speculations on druids, &quot;which seem to us so childishly fantastic&quot;, shaped the literary mood of the romantic revival. Haycock noted that, along with Macpherson and Thomas Gray, Stukeley &quot;helped create the principal historical and literary foundations for the &#x27;Druidical revival&#x27; that flourished in the last decades of the eighteenth century&quot;.

<text>Thomas Birch (23 November 17059 January 1766) was an English historian.

==Life==
He was the son of Joseph Birch, a coffee-mill maker, and was born at Clerkenwell.

He preferred study to business but, as his parents were Quakers, he did not go to the university. Notwithstanding this circumstance, he was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1730 and priest in 1731. As a strong supporter of the Whigs, he gained the favour of Philip Yorke, afterwards Lord Chancellor and first Earl of Hardwicke, and his subsequent preferments were largely due to this friendship. He held successively a number of benefices in different counties, and finally in London.

He was noted as a keen fisherman during the course of his lifetime, and devised an unusual method of disguising his intentions. Dressed as a tree, he stood by the side of a stream in an outfit designed to make his arms seem like branches and the rod and line a spray of blossom. Any movement, he argued, would be taken by a fish to be the consequences of a mild breeze.

In 1735 he became a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, of which he was secretary from 1752 to 1765. In 1728 he had married Hannah Cox, who died in the following year. Birch was killed on 9 January 1766 by a fall from his horse, and was buried in the church of St Margaret Pattens, London, of which he was then rector. He died, according to his will, &quot;in a full confidence in the Mercy and Goodness of almighty God and with a firm persuasion of a blessed Immortality discoverable by the Light of Nature and confirmed for us Christians by that of Revelation&quot;, leaving his books and manuscripts to the British Museum, and a sum of about £500 to increase the salaries of the three assistant librarians.

==Writings==

Birch was prolific, even if Horace Walpole questioned his &quot;parts, taste and judgment.&quot; He corresponded with prominent men of his time. Samuel Johnson wrote: &quot;Tom Birch is as brisk as a bee in conversation; but no sooner does he take a pen in his hand, than it becomes a torpedo to him, and benumbs all his faculties&quot;. Boswell observed &quot;That the literature of this country is much indebted to Birch’s activity and diligence must certainly be acknowledged. We have seen that Johnson honoured him with a Greek Epigram; and his correspondence with him, during many years, proves that he had no mean opinion of him.&quot;

Birch often collaborated with the greatly successful London bookseller, Andrew Millar, who helped publish some of Birch&#x27;s most highly profitable publications. These included &quot;The Works of the Honourable Robert Boyle,&quot; co-written by Reverend Henry Miles (in 5 volumes folio, 1744), and &quot;A Complete Collection of the Historical, Political, and Miscellaneous Works of John Milton&quot; (in 2 volumes folio, 1738, followed in 2 volumes quarto, 1753).

Birch wrote most of the English lives in the &quot;General Dictionary, Historical and Critical&quot;, 10 vols. (London, 1734–1741), assisted in the composition of the &quot;Athenian Letters&quot; (London, 1741–43), edited the &quot;State Papers of John Thurloe&quot; (London, 1742) and the &quot;State Papers of W. Murdin&quot; (London, 1759). He also wrote:

*&quot;Inquiry&quot; into the share which King Charles I had in the transactions of the Earl of Glamorgan for bringing over a body of Irish rebels (published by Millar in London, 1756);
*&quot;Historical view of Negotiations between the Courts of England, France and Brussels 1592-1617&quot; (London, 1749); 
*&quot;Life of Archbishop Tillotson&quot; (London, 1753);
*&quot;History of the Royal Society of London&quot; (London, 1756–1757); 
*&quot;Life of Henry, Prince of Wales&quot; (London, 1760), and other works.
*&quot;The heads of illustrious persons of Great Britain, in 108 copper plates, engraved by Mr. Houbraken and Mr. Vertue, with their lives and characters&quot;, by Thomas Birch, D.D. Secretary of the Royal Society, London, 1761
Among the papers left at his death were some which were published in 1848 as the &quot;Court and Times of James I&quot; and the &quot;Court and Times of Charles I&quot;.

===Copies of Franklin letters===
Recently discovered by American researcher Alan Houston at the British Library is a file entitled &quot;Copies of&quot; [Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s] &quot;Letters relating to the March of General Braddock&quot;. Birch was said to have obsessively copied any documents of historical importance he could get his hands on. He was a friend of Franklin, and they were both members of the Royal Society. In his autobiography, Franklin refers to his &quot;Quire Book&quot;, which has never been found, but which contained letters and papers concerning his efforts to support the British Government at that pre-revolutionary time. They speak of his 1755 efforts to help British Redcoats led by Braddock in their march to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne (in today&#x27;s Pittsburgh). Braddock desperately needed transportation for his troops, and Franklin rounded up horses and wagons for him using his persuasive powers as Pennsylvania&#x27;s leading politician. Incidentally, Braddock and most of his men (who included George Washington) were defeated by the French and their Indian allies.

<text>Tatar ( ; or ) is a Turkic language spoken by the Volga Tatars mainly located in modern Tatarstan (European Russia), as well as Siberia. It should not be confused with Crimean Tatar or Siberian Tatar, which are closely related but belong to different subgroups of the Kipchak languages.

== Geographic distribution ==
The Tatar language is spoken in Russia by about 5.3 million people, and also by communities in Azerbaijan, China, Finland, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, the US, Uzbekistan, and several other countries. Globally, there are more than 7 million speakers of Tatar.

Tatar is also the mother tongue for several thousand Mari, a Finnic people; Mordva&#x27;s Qaratay group also speak a variant of Kazan Tatar.

In the 2010 census, 69% of Russian Tatars claimed at least some knowledge of the Tatar language. In Tatarstan, 93% of Tatars and 3.6% of Russians claimed to have at least some knowledge of the Tatar language. In neighbouring Bashkortostan, 67% of Tatars, 27% of Bashkirs, and 1.3% of Russians claimed to understand basic Tatar language.

=== Official status ===


Tatar, along with Russian, is the official language of the Republic of Tatarstan. The official script of Tatar language is based on the Cyrillic script with some additional letters. The Republic of Tatarstan passed a law in 1999, which came into force in 2001, establishing an official Tatar Latin alphabet. A Russian federal law overrode it in 2002, making Cyrillic the sole official script in Tatarstan since. Unofficially, other scripts are used as well, mostly Latin and Arabic. All official sources in Tatarstan must use Cyrillic on their websites and in publishing. In other cases, where Tatar has no official status, the use of a specific alphabet depends on the preference of the author.

The Tatar language was made a &quot;de facto&quot; official language in Russia in 1917, but only within the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Tatar is also considered to have been the official language in the short-lived Idel-Ural State, briefly formed during the Russian Civil War.

The usage of Tatar declined during the 20th century. By the 1980s, the study and teaching of Tatar in the public education system was limited to rural schools. However, Tatar-speaking pupils had little chance of entering university because higher education was available in Russian almost exclusively.

As of 2001, Tatar was considered a potentially endangered language while Siberian Tatar received &quot;endangered&quot; and &quot;seriously endangered&quot; statuses, respectively. Higher education in Tatar can only be found in Tatarstan, and is restricted to the humanities. In other regions Tatar is primarily a spoken language and the number of speakers as well as their proficiency tends to decrease. Tatar is popular as a written language only in Tatar-speaking areas where schools with Tatar language lessons are situated. On the other hand, Tatar is the only language in use in rural districts of Tatarstan.

Since 2017, Tatar language classes are no longer mandatory in the schools of Tatarstan. According to the opponents of this change, it will further endanger the Tatar language and is a violation of the Tatarstan Constitution which stipulates the equality of Russian and Tatar languages in the republic.

== Dialects ==
There are two main dialects of Tatar:
* Central or Middle (Kazan; &quot;Qazan&quot;)
* Western (Mishar; &quot;Mişər&quot;)

All of these dialects also have subdivisions. Significant contributions to the study of the Tatar language and its dialects, were made by a scientist Gabdulkhay Akhatov (Ğabdelxəy Əxətov), who is considered to be the founder of the modern Tatar dialectological school.

Spoken idioms of Siberian Tatars, which differ significantly from the above two, are often considered as the third dialect group of Tatar by some, but as an independent language on its own by others.

=== Central or Middle ===
The Central or Middle dialectal group is spoken in Kazan and most of Tatarstan and is the basis of the standard literary Tatar language. Middle Tatar includes the Nagaibak dialect.

=== Mishar ===

The Western (Mishar) dialect is distinguished from the Central dialect most clearly by the absence of the uvular &quot;q&quot; and &quot;ğ&quot; and the rounded &quot;å&quot; of the first syllable. Letters &quot;ç&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are pronounced as affricates. Regional differences exist also.

Mishar Dialect, and especially its regional variant in Sergachsky district (Nizhny Novgorod), is said to be &quot;faithfully close&quot; to the ancient Kipchak language. Some linguists, such as Radlov, Samoylovich, think that Mishar traditionally belongs to the Kipchak-Cuman group of languages, rather than to the Kipchak-Bulgar group.

Mishar is the dialect spoken by the Tatar minority of Finland.

=== Siberian Tatar ===

Two main isoglosses that characterize Siberian Tatar are &quot;ç&quot; as and &quot;c&quot; as , corresponding to standard and . There are also grammatical differences within the dialect, scattered across Siberia.

Many linguists claim the origins of Siberian Tatar dialects are actually independent of Volga–Ural Tatar; these dialects are quite remote both from Standard Tatar and from each other, often preventing mutual comprehension. The claim that this language is part of the modern Tatar language is typically supported by linguists in Kazan, Moscow and by Siberian Tatar linguists and denounced by some Russian and Tatar ethnographs.

Over time, some of these dialects were given distinct names and recognized as separate languages (e.g. the Chulym language) after detailed linguistic study. However, the Chulym language was never classified as a dialect of Tatar language. Confusion arose because of the endoethnonym &quot;Tatars&quot; used by the Chulyms. The question of classifying the Chulym language as a dialect of the Khakass language was debatable. A brief linguistic analysis shows that many of these dialects exhibit features which are quite different from the Volga–Ural Tatar varieties, and should be classified as Turkic varieties belonging to several sub-groups of the Turkic languages, distinct from Kipchak languages to which Volga–Ural Tatar belongs.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===

There exist several interpretations of the Tatar vowel phonemic inventory. In total Tatar has nine or ten native vowels, and three or four loaned vowels (mainly in Russian loanwords).

According to Baskakov (1988) Tatar has only two vowel heights, high and low. There are two low vowels, front and back, while there are eight high vowels: front and back, round (R+) and unround (R−), normal and short (or reduced).
Poppe (1963) proposed a similar yet slightly different scheme with a third, higher mid, height, and with nine vowels.

According to Makhmutova (1969) Tatar has three vowel heights: high, mid and low, and four tongue positions: front, front-central, back-central and back (as they are named when cited).
The mid back unrounded vowel &quot;&quot;ë&quot; is usually transcribed as &quot;ı&quot;, though it differs from the corresponding Turkish vowel.

The tenth vowel &quot;ï&quot; is realized as the diphthong &quot;ëy&quot; (), which only occurs word-finally, but it has been argued to be an independent phoneme.

Phonetically, the native vowels are approximately thus (with the Cyrillic letters and the usual Latin romanization in angle brackets):
In polysyllabic words, the front-back distinction is lost in reduced vowels: all become mid-central. The mid reduced vowels in an unstressed position are frequently elided, as in кеше &quot;keşe&quot; &gt; &#x27;person&#x27;, or кышы &quot;qışı&quot; &gt; &#x27;(his) winter&#x27;. Low back is rounded in the first syllable and after , but not in the last, as in бала &quot;bala&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;, балаларга &quot;balalarğa&quot; &#x27;to children&#x27;. In Russian loans there are also , , , and , written the same as the native vowels: ы, е/э, о, а respectively.

==== Historical shifts ====
Historically, the Old Turkic mid vowels have raised from mid to high, whereas the Old Turkic high vowels have become the Tatar reduced mid series. (The same shifts have also happened in Bashkir.)

=== Consonants ===

;Notes:
: The phonemes , , , , , are only found in loanwords. occurs more commonly in loanwords, but is also found in native words, e.g. &quot;yafraq&quot; &#x27;leaf&#x27;. , , , may be substituted with the corresponding native consonants , , , by some Tatars.
: and are the dialectal Western (Mişär) pronunciations of җ⟨c⟩ and ч⟨ç⟩, the latter are in the literary standard and in the Central (Kazan) dialect. is the variant of ч⟨ç⟩ as pronounced in the Eastern (Siberian) dialects and some Western (Mişär) dialects. Both and are also used in Russian loanwords (the latter written ц).
: and are usually considered allophones of and in the environment of back vowels, so they are never written in the Tatar Cyrillic orthography in native words, and only rarely in loanwords with къ and гъ. However, and also appear before front in Perso-Arabic loanwords which may indicate the phonemic status of these uvular consonants.

==== Palatalization ====
Tatar consonants usually undergo slight palatalization before front vowels. However, this allophony is not significant and does not constitute a phonemic status. This differs from Russian where palatalized consonants are not allophones but phonemes on their own. There are a number of Russian loanwords which have palatalized consonants in Russian and are thus written the same in Tatar (often with the &quot;soft sign&quot; ь). The Tatar standard pronunciation also requires palatalization in such loanwords; however, some Tatar may pronounce them non-palatalized.

=== Syllables ===
In native words there are six types of syllables (Consonant, Vowel, Sonorant):
* V (ı-lıs, u-ra, ö-rä)
* VC (at-law, el-geç, ir-kä)
* CV (qa-la, ki-ä, su-la)
* CVC (bar-sa, sız-law, köç-le, qoş-çıq)
* VSC (ant-lar, äyt-te, ilt-kän)
* CVSC (tört-te, qart-lar, qayt-qan)

Loanwords allow other types: CSV (gra-mota), CSVC (käs-trül), etc.

=== Prosody ===
Stress is usually on the final syllable. However, some suffixes cannot be stressed, so the stress shifts to the syllable before that suffix, even if the stressed syllable is the third or fourth from the end. A number of Tatar words and grammatical forms have the natural stress on the first syllable. Loanwords, mainly from Russian, usually preserve their original stress (unless the original stress is on the last syllable, in such a case the stress in Tatar shifts to suffixes as usual, e.g. &quot;sovét&quot; &gt; &quot;sovetlár&quot; &gt; &quot;sovetlarğá&quot;).

=== Phonetic alterations ===
Tatar phonotactics dictate many pronunciation changes which are not reflected in the orthography.

* Unrounded vowels &quot;ı&quot; and &quot;e&quot; become rounded after &quot;o&quot; or &quot;ö&quot;:
::коры/&quot;qorı&quot; &gt; [qoro]
::борын/&quot;borın&quot; &gt; [boron]
::көзге/&quot;közge&quot; &gt; [közgö]
::соры/&quot;sorı&quot; &gt; [soro]

* Nasals are assimilated to the following stops:
::унбер/&quot;unber&quot; &gt; [umber]
::менгеч/&quot;mengeç&quot; &gt; [meñgeç]

* Stops are assimilated to the preceding nasals (this is reflected in writing):
::урманнар/&quot;urmannar&quot; ( &lt; &quot;urman&quot; + &quot;lar&quot;)
::комнар/&quot;komnar&quot; ( &lt; &quot;kom&quot; + &quot;lar&quot;)

* Voicing may also undergo assimilation:
::күзсез/&quot;küzsez&quot; &gt; [küssez]

* Unstressed vowels may be syncopated or reduced:
::урыны/&quot;urını&quot;&gt; [urnı]
::килене/&quot;kilene&quot; &gt; [kilne]

* Vowels may also be elided:
::кара урман/&quot;qara urman&quot; &gt; [qarurman]
::килә иде/&quot;kilä ide&quot; &gt; [kiläyde]
::туры урам/&quot;turı uram&quot; &gt; [tururam]
::була алмыйм/&quot;bula almıym&quot; &gt; [bulalmıym]

* In consonant clusters longer than two phones, ı or e (whichever is dictated by vowel harmony) is inserted into speech as an epenthetic vowel.
::банк/&quot;bank&quot; &gt; [bañqı]

* Final consonant clusters are simplified:
::артист/&quot;artist&quot; &gt; [artis]

* Final devoicing is also frequent:
::табиб/&quot;tabib&quot; &gt; [tabip]

== Grammar ==
Like other Turkic languages, Tatar is an agglutinative language.

=== Nouns ===
Tatar nouns are inflected for cases and numbers. Case suffixes change depending on the last consonants of the noun, while nouns ending in п/к are voiced to б/г (китабым) when a possessive suffix was added. Suffixes below are in back vowel, with front variant can be seen at #Phonology section.

The declension of possessive suffixes is even more irregular, with the dative suffix -а used in 1st singular and 2nd singular suffixes, and the accusative, dative, locative, and ablative endings -н, -на, -нда, -ннан is used after 3rd person possessive suffix. Nouns ending in -и, -у, or -ү, although phonologically vowels, take consonantic endings.

=== Declension of pronouns ===
The declension of personal and demonstrative pronouns tends to be irregular. Irregular forms are in bold.


=== Verbs ===

The distribution of present tense suffixes is complicated, with the former (also with vowel harmony) is used with verb stems ending in consonants, and the latter is used with verb stem ending in vowels (with the last vowel being deleted, – эшли, compare Turkish &quot;işlemek&quot; – continuous &quot;işliyor&quot;). The distribution of indefinite future tense is more complicated in consonant-ending stems, it is resolved by -арга/-ырга infinitives (язарга – язар). However, because some have verb citation forms in verbal noun (-у), this rule becomes somewhat unpredictable.

Tenses are negated with -ма, however in the indefinite future tense and the verbal participle they become -мас and -мыйча instead, respectively. Alongside vowel-ending stems, the suffix also becomes -мый when negates the present tense. To form interrogatives, the suffix -мы is used.

Definite past and conditional tenses use type II personal inflections instead. When in the case of present tense, short ending (-м) is used. After vowels, the first person imperative forms deletes the last vowel, similar to the present tense does ( – эшлим). Like plurals of nouns, the suffix -лар change depending the preceding consonants (-алар, but -ганнар).

==== Anomalous verbs ====
Some verbs, however, fall into this category. Dozens of them have irregular stems with a final mid vowel, but obscured on the infinitive ( – укы, укый, – төзе, төзи). The verbs кору &quot;to build&quot;, тану &quot;to disclaim&quot;, ташу &quot;to spill&quot; have contrastive meanings with verbs with their final vowelled counterparts, meaning &quot;to dry&quot;, &quot;to know&quot;, &quot;to carry&quot;.

The verb &quot;to say&quot; is significantly more irregular than any other verbs: its 2nd person singular imperative is диген, while its expected regular form is repurposed as the present tense forms (дим, диң, ди...).

=== Predicatives ===
These predicative suffixes have now fallen into disuse, or rarely used.

== Writing system ==

During its history, Tatar has been written in Arabic, Latin and Cyrillic scripts.

Before 1928, Tatar was mostly written in Arabic script (Иске имля/İske imlâ, &quot;Old orthography&quot;, to 1920; Яңа имла/Yaña imlâ, &quot;New orthography&quot;, 1920–1928).

During the 19th century, Russian Christian missionary Nikolay Ilminsky devised the first Cyrillic alphabet for Tatar. This alphabet is still used by Christian Tatars (Kryashens).

In the Soviet Union after 1928, Tatar was written with a Latin alphabet called Jaꞑalif.

In 1939, in Tatarstan and all other parts of the Soviet Union, a Cyrillic script was adopted and is still used to write Tatar. It is also used in Kazakhstan.

The Republic of Tatarstan passed a law in 1999 that came into force in 2001 establishing an official Tatar Latin alphabet. A Russian federal law overrode it in 2002, making Cyrillic the sole official script in Tatarstan since. In 2004, an attempt to introduce a Latin-based alphabet for Tatar was further abandoned when the Constitutional Court ruled that the federal law of 15 November 2002 mandating the use of Cyrillic for the state languages of the republics of the Russian Federation does not contradict the Russian constitution. In accordance with this Constitutional Court ruling, on 28 December 2004, the Tatar Supreme Court overturned the Tatarstani law that made the Latin alphabet official.

In 2012 the Tatarstan government adopted a new Latin alphabet but with limited usage (mostly for Romanization).

* Tatar Perso-Arabic alphabet (before 1928):
* Tatar Old Latin (Jaꞑalif) alphabet (1928 to 1940):
* Tatar Old Cyrillic alphabet (by Nikolay Ilminsky, 1861; the letters in parentheses are not used in modern publications):
* Tatar Cyrillic alphabet (1939; the letter order adopted in 1997):
* 1999 Tatar Latin alphabet, made official by a law adopted by Tatarstani authorities but annulled by the Tatar Supreme Court in 2004:
* 2012 Tatar Latin alphabet
=== Common Turkic Alphabet 2024 ===
In 2024, the modified Common Turkic Alphabet replaced letter ä with ə, which was already in use in Azerbaijani, as well as among Tatar activists using the Latin alphabet.

== History ==

The ancestors of Tatar are the extinct Turkic Bulgar and Kipchak languages.

The literary Tatar language is based on the Middle Tatar (Kazan) dialect and on the Old Tatar language (&quot;İske Tatar Tele&quot;), also known as &quot;Türki&quot; (ترکی). Both are members of the Volga-Ural subgroup of the Kipchak group of Turkic languages, although they also partly derive from the ancient Volga Bulgar language.

Crimean Tatar, although similar by name, belongs to another subgroup of the Kipchak languages. Unlike Kazan Tatar, Crimean Tatar is heavily influenced by Turkish (mostly its Ottoman variety with Arabic and Persian influences) and Nogai languages.

=== Influences in Tatar ===
Most of the Uralic languages in the Volga River area have strongly influenced the Tatar language, as have the Arabic, Persian and Russian languages.

==== Arabic and Persian ====
The Arabic and Persian influence on Tatar can be seen most clearly in loan words but also in specific sounds. For example, Tatar ğ / г is the Arabic ghayn غ. However, in Arabic words and names where there’s an ayin ع, Tatar adds the ghayn instead (عبد الله, ’Abdullah&quot;;&quot; Tatar: &quot;Ğabdulla&quot; / Габдулла; Yaña imlâ: غابدوللا /ʁabdulla/). In the Mishar Tatar Dialect, ğ is not pronounced, and thus, a word like &quot;şiğır&quot; (شعر, шигыр, &quot;poem&quot;) is &quot;şigır&quot; or &quot;şiyır&quot; for Mishars (who in Finland use the Latin alphabet).

When it comes to Arabic and Persian loanwords, in the Tatar Latin script, alif is realised as the letter a, and when there’s no alif, it is ä (ə) (عيسى, Ğəysə; آزاد, Azat). When the alif has hamza on top (أ), it is also ä (ə), but Tatar İske imlâ spells it without (امين / أمين, Əmin). Vowel harmony as well is a deciding factor (عبد الله, Ğabdulla; عبد الرشيد, Ğəbderrəşit). Similarly with ö/o (عمر, Ğömər; عثمان, Ğosman). However, this rule is often inconsistent when transliterating from Cyrillic to Latin.

During the Golden Horde (1242–1502), the ancestors of modern Tatars used Persian in addition to their Turkic language to a relatively significant extent, especially in poetry and even after the Golden Horde. For example, the long-serving Khan of the Kazan Khanate (1438–1552), Möxəmməd-Əmin, wrote poetry in Persian. In religious and legal matters Arabic was used. Many Persian and Arabic works are considered part of Tatar literature today.

== Tatar online learning ==

A common complaint among those curious about the Tatar language outside of Russia has been its lack of non-Russian Latin alphabet sources. For this, a young Germany-based Tatar architect Aygul Ahmetcan (Aygöl Əxmətcan), with the help of linguistics student Bulat Shaymi (Bulat Şəymi), has created a Telegram channel &quot;Learn Tatar&quot;, which offers Tatar language teaching in English. It has gained thousands of viewers in few months after its creation in August 2023. Shaymi himself has a Youtube channel dedicated to Tatar content.

Since then, a website &quot;learntatar.com&quot; has also been established.

Among other helpful sources is the Finnish Tatar website &quot;Aybagar&quot; (&quot;Sunflower&quot;), which &quot;publishes scientific works and original materials about Tatars, the Tatar language and Tatar culture, focusing especially on the Tatar diaspora worldwide&quot;. Tatar pronunciations can be found in Forvo and &quot;Corpus of Written Tatar&quot;.

&quot;Modern Tatar Identity&quot; is a podcast that has &quot;conversations with people who have dedicated a part of their life to Tatar and Tatar language research&quot;.

<text>Conyers Middleton (27 December 1683 – 28 July 1750) was an English clergyman. Though mired in controversy and disputes, he was also considered one of the best stylists in English of his time.

==Early life==
Middleton was born at Richmond, North Yorkshire, in 1683. His mother, Barbara Place (d. 1700), was the second wife of William Middleton (c.1646–1714), the rector of Hinderwell. Conyers Middleton had two brothers and a half-brother.

Middleton was educated at St Peter&#x27;s School, York, before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in March 1699. He graduated with a BA in 1703. He was elected a fellow of the college in 1705 and took his MA in 1706 In 1707 he was ordained a deacon, and a priest in 1708.

In 1710 Dr. Middleton married Sarah Morris, the daughter of Thomas Morris (died 1717) of Mount Morris, Monks Horton, Hythe, Kent, and widow of Councillor and recorder Robert Drake of Cambridge (died 1702), of the family Drake of Ash. In due course Elizabeth Montagu (1718-1800) became a step-grand-daughter.

==Dispute with Bentley==
Middleton was one of the thirty fellows of Trinity College who on 6 February 1710 petitioned the Bishop of Ely, as visitor of the college, to take steps against Richard Bentley the Master, at odds with the fellowship. In 1717, he became involved in a dispute with Bentley over the awarding of degrees. George I visited the university, and the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on 32 people, including Middleton. Bentley, as regius professor of divinity, demanded a fee of four guineas from each of the new doctors in addition to the established complimentary &quot;&quot;. Middleton, after some dispute, consented to pay, taking Bentley&#x27;s written promise to return the money if the claim should be finally disallowed. He was then created doctor. Having vainly applied for a return of the fee, he sued for it as a debt in the vice-chancellor&#x27;s court. After various delays and attempts to make up the quarrel, the vice-chancellor issued a decree (23 September 1718) for Bentley&#x27;s arrest. Bentley&#x27;s refusal to submit to this decree led to further proceedings, and to his degradation from all his degrees by a grace of the senate on 18 October.

The matter was then pursued in a pamphlet war and Bentley brought an action against the publisher of the anonymous &quot;On the Present State of Trinity College&quot; (1719), which was the work of Middleton with John Colbatch. Middleton claimed (9 February 1720) the pamphlet as his own; Bentley continued to prosecute the bookseller, until Middleton made a declaration of his authorship before witnesses. Bentley then laid an information against him in the King&#x27;s Bench, based on a passage in the pamphlet about the impossibility of obtaining redress in &quot;any proper court of justice in the kingdom&quot;. The proceedings were slow, and meanwhile Middleton took advantage of Bentley&#x27;s proposals for an edition of the New Testament to attack him in a sharp pamphlet. Bentley replied, using terms of gross abuse directed mainly against Colbatch, to whom he chose to attribute the authorship. Bentley&#x27;s reply was condemned by the Cambridge heads of houses. Colbatch brought an action against him, and Middleton wrote a longer and more temperate rejoinder (possibly helped by Charles Ashton).

When Middleton&#x27;s case was heard in the court of king&#x27;s bench (Trinity term 1721), he was found guilty of libel. Sentence was delayed. Friends subscribed towards his expenses, and he obtained the intercession of a highly placed person for a lenient sentence. The chief justice John Pratt advised the two doctors to avoid scandal by a compromise, and Bentley finally accepted an apology. Middleton, however, had to pay his own costs, and expenses of his opponent.

The dispute flared up again, to end on a note of bathos. Middleton&#x27;s supporters (14 December 1721), passed a vote through the university Senate making him a librarian—a salaried &quot;Protobibliothecarius&quot; of the university library—a new post, on the pretext of the king&#x27;s recent donation of Bishop John Moore&#x27;s library. Middleton in 1723 published a plan for the future arrangement of the books; but with swipes at Bentley for retaining some manuscripts (the priceless &quot;Codex Bezae&quot; among them) in his own house, and on the court of king&#x27;s bench. Bentley appealed to the court, and on 20 June 1723 Middleton was fined, and ordered to provide securities for good behaviour for a year. Middleton went off to Italy. On his return he renewed his old suit for the four guineas. Bentley did not oppose him, and in February 1726 Middleton at last got back his fee, together with 12&quot;s&quot;. costs.

==Later life==
Middleton stayed in Rome during a great part of 1724 and 1725. Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine, a fellow collector, was his companion on this journey. Middleton made a collection of antiquities, of which he later published a description; he sold it to Horace Walpole in 1744.

His first wife, Sarah Morris, died on 19 February 1731. In 1731 Middleton was appointed first Woodwardian Professor of Geology, and delivered an inaugural address in Latin, pointing out the benefits which might be expected from a study of fossils in confirming the history of Noah&#x27;s Flood. He resigned the chair in 1734, on his second marriage.

Middleton&#x27;s sceptical tendency became clearer, and Zachary Pearce accused him of covert infidelity. He was threatened with a loss of his Cambridge degrees. Middleton replied in two pamphlets, making such explanations as he could. In 1733, however, an anonymous pamphlet (by Philip Williams the public orator) declared that his books ought to be burnt and he should be banished from the university, unless he made a recantation. Middleton made an explanation in a final pamphlet, but for some time remained silent on theological topics. His relationship with Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford, was damaged.

Middleton&#x27;s major work, his &quot;Life of Cicero&quot; (1741), was a success. He was attacked by Samuel Parr in 1787, however, for knowing plagiarism: Parr claimed it was based on &quot;De tribus luminibus Romanorum&quot;, a scarce work by William Bellenden. Middleton&#x27;s second wife Mary died in 1745, and he returned to controversial theology in 1747. He looked for ecclesiastical preferment, but was unpopular with the bishops.
Middleton lived at Hildersham, near Cambridge, and married again shortly before he died, on 28 July 1750.

==Works==
A modern opinion is that

Middleton stood out as an especially lethal species of the polemical divine. At best sarcastic and withering, at worst poisonous and unfair, Middleton justly deserved his reputation [...].

On the other hand, Alexander Pope thought he and Nathaniel Hooke were the only prose writers of the day who deserved to be cited as authorities on the language. Samuel Parr, while exposing Middleton&#x27;s plagiarisms, praised his style. An edition of his works, containing several posthumous tracts, but not including the &quot;Life of Cicero&quot;, appeared in four volumes in 1752, and in five volumes in 1755.

===Early works===
The pamphlets from the struggle with Bentley were:

*&quot;A full and impartial Account of all the late Proceedings … against Dr. Bentley&quot;, 1719.
*&quot;Second Part&quot; of the above, 1719. 
*&quot;Some Remarks upon a Pamphlet entitled “The Case of Dr. Bentley further stated and vindicated” …&quot;, 1719. 
*&quot;A True Account of the Present State of Trinity College in Cambridge under the oppressive rule of their Master, Richard Bentley, late D.D.&quot;, 1720. 
*&quot;Remarks, paragraph by paragraph, upon the Proposals lately published by Richard Bentley for a new Edition of the Greek Testament and Latin Version&quot;, 1721.
*&quot;Some further Remarks … containing a full Answer to the Editor&#x27;s late Defence …&quot;, 1721. 
*&quot;Bibliothecæ Cantabrigiensis ordinandæ Methodus quædam …&quot;, 1723.

Middleton visited Italy, and drew conclusions on the pagan origin of Christian church ceremonies and beliefs; he subsequently published these in his &quot;Letter from Rome, showing an Exact Conformity between Popery and Paganism&quot; (1729). This work led to an attack from the Catholic side by Richard Challoner, in the preface to &quot;The Catholic Christian instructed in the Sacraments, Sacrifice and Ceremonies of the Church&quot; (1737); Challoner in particular accused Middleton of misrepresenting the articles of the Tridentine Creed that applied to saints and images. Middleton retaliated through the legal system, and Challoner in 1738 left for Douai. Thomas Seward wrote further on the subject in a 1746 &quot;sequel&quot; to Middleton and Henry Mower (i.e. More).

===Controversy with the medical profession===
In 1726, prompted by the Harveian Oration by Richard Mead, with an appendix by Edmund Chishull, Middleton offended the medical profession with a dissertation contending that the healing art among the ancients was exercised only by slaves or freedmen. He was answered by John Ward, Joseph Letherland, and others, to whom Middleton replied. Middleton let the matter drop after meeting Mead socially; but two related works, an &quot;Appendix seu Definitiones, pars secunda&quot; and a letter from Middleton to another opponent, Charles La Motte, were later published in 1761 by William Heberden the elder.

===Deistic controversy===
Middleton had remonstrated with Daniel Waterland when the latter replied to Matthew Tindal&#x27;s &quot;Christianity as Old as the Creation&quot;. Middleton took a line which exposed him to the reproach of infidelity. In professing to indicate a short and easy method of confuting Tindal, he laid emphasis on the indispensableness of Christianity as a mainstay of social order. This brought him into conflict with those who held the same views as Waterland. Middleton was attacked from many quarters, and produced several apologetic pamphlets. His letter to Waterland from Rome, however, hinted that Middleton himself was active in Deism. Middleton wrote &quot;Deity can be conceived to interpose himself; the universal good and salvation of man.&quot;

===Classical scholarship===

His &quot;Life of Cicero&quot; (1741) was largely told in the words of the writings of Cicero. Middleton&#x27;s reputation was enhanced by this work; but, as was later pointed out, he drew largely from a rare book by William Bellenden, &quot;De tribus luminibus Romanorum&quot;. The work was undertaken at the request of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey; from their correspondence came the idea for &quot;The Roman Senate&quot;, published in 1747.

===Middletonian controversy on miraculous powers===
The years 1747–8 produced Middleton&#x27;s most significant theological writings. The &quot;Introductory Discourse and the Free Inquiry&quot; addressed &quot;the miraculous powers which are supposed to have subsisted in the church from the earliest ages.&quot; Middleton suggested two propositions: that ecclesiastical miracles must be accepted or rejected in the mass; and that there is a distinction between the authority due to the early Church Fathers&#x27; testimony to the beliefs and practices of their times, and their credibility as witnesses to matters of fact. In 1750, he attacked Thomas Sherlock&#x27;s notions of antediluvian prophecy, which had been published 25 years before. Among those who answered, or defended Sherlock, were: Thomas Ashton; Julius Bate; Anselm Bayly; Zachary Brooke; Thomas Church; Joseph Clarke; William Cooke; William Dodwell; Ralph Heathcote; John Jackson; Laurence Jackson; John Rotheram; Thomas Rutherforth; and Thomas Secker. Methodist founder John Wesley wrote an extensive response to Middleton recording his disagreement with him in January 1749.

&quot;Reflections on the variations, or inconsistencies, which are found among the four Evangelists&quot; was posthumous, published in 1752.

==Family==
Although Middleton died childless, he married three times.

*firstly, in 1710, to Sarah Drake, the widow of Counsellor Drake of Cambridge, and daughter of Mr. Morris of Oak Morris in Kent;
*secondly, in 1734, to his cousin Mary, daughter of the Rev. Conyers Place of Dorchester, who died 26 April 1745, aged 38;
*thirdly, at the end of his life, to Anne, daughter of John Powell of Boughrood, in Radnorshire, who had lived as a companion to Mrs. Trenchard, widow of John Trenchard, later married to Thomas Gordon.

Elizabeth Montagu was a granddaughter of Sarah Drake, and she spent much time as a child with the Middletons in Cambridge, as did her sister Sarah Scott.

<text>Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, Inc. (S&amp;W) is an American firearm manufacturer headquartered in Maryville, Tennessee, United States.

Smith &amp; Wesson was founded by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson as the &quot;Smith &amp; Wesson Revolver Company&quot; in 1856, after their previous company, also called the &quot;Smith &amp; Wesson Company&quot; and later renamed as &quot;Volcanic Repeating Arms&quot;, was sold to Oliver Winchester and became the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The modern Smith &amp; Wesson had been previously owned by Bangor Punta and Tomkins plc before being acquired by Saf-T-Hammer Corporation in 2001. Smith &amp; Wesson was a unit of American Outdoor Brands Corporation from 2016 to 2020 until the company was spun out in 2020.

==History==
===Volcanic Repeating Arms===

Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith &amp; Wesson Company in Norwich, Connecticut in 1852 to develop the Volcanic rifle. Smith developed a new Volcanic Cartridge, which he patented in 1854. The Smith &amp; Wesson Company was renamed Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1855 and was purchased by Oliver Winchester. Smith left the company and returned to his native Springfield, Massachusetts, while Wesson stayed as plant manager with Volcanic Repeating Arms for eight months. Volcanic Repeating Arms was insolvent in late 1856, after which it was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company in April 1857, and eventually as the Winchester Repeating Arms Company by 1866.

===Smith &amp; Wesson Revolver Company===
As Samuel Colt&#x27;s patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Wesson began developing a prototype for a cartridge revolver. His research pointed out that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a &quot;bored-through&quot; cylinder, a component he would need for his invention. Wesson reconnected with Smith, and the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination. After Wesson left Volcanic Repeating Arms in 1856, he rejoined Smith to form the Smith &amp; Wesson Revolver Company, which would become the modern Smith &amp; Wesson company.

Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith &amp; Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every revolver they made. This arrangement left White responsible for defending his patent, which eventually led to his financial ruin, while it was very advantageous for Smith &amp; Wesson.

===19th century===
Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s revolvers came into popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War, as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense.

The orders for the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory&#x27;s production capabilities. In 1860, demand volume exceeded the production capacity, so Smith &amp; Wesson expanded into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short that it had been using.

At the same time, the company&#x27;s design was being infringed upon by other manufacturers, which led to numerous lawsuits filed by Rollin White. In many of these instances, part of the restitution came in the form of the offender being forced to stamp &quot;Manufactured for Smith &amp; Wesson&quot; on the revolvers in question.

White&#x27;s vigorous defense of his patent caused a problem for arms makers in the United States at the time, as they could not manufacture cartridge revolvers. At the war&#x27;s end, the U.S. Government charged White with causing the retardation of arms development in America.

Demand for revolvers declined at the close of the Civil War, so Smith &amp; Wesson focused on developing arms suitable for use on the American frontier. In 1870, the company switched focus from pocket-sized revolvers to a large frame revolver in heavier calibers (.44 S&amp;W American). The U.S. Army adopted this new design, known as the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3, as the first cartridge-firing revolver in U.S. service.

In 1899, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced its most widely used revolver, the .38 Military &amp; Police (also known as the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10). With over 6 million produced, it became the standard sidearm of American police officers for much of the 20th century. An additional 1 million of these guns were made for the U.S. Military during World War II.

===20th century===
The post-war periods in the 20th century were times of great innovation for the company. In 1935, Smith &amp; Wesson released the .357 Registered Magnum, which was the first revolver chambered for .357 Magnum. It was designed as a more powerful handgun for law enforcement officers. The Registered Magnum started the &quot;Magnum Era&quot; of handguns. In 1957, when S&amp;W started issuing model numbers to its revolvers, the revolver that had started as the Registered (and later the postwar .357 Magnum) became the Model 27. The high point was in 1955, when the company created the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 chambered in .44 Magnum, after the round&#x27;s creator Elmer Keith had encouraged Smith &amp; Wesson to develop a revolver for his new ammunition. The Dirty Harry movies made this gun a cultural icon two decades later.

In 1965, the Wesson family sold its controlling interest in Smith &amp; Wesson to Bangor Punta, a prominent American conglomerate. Over the next decade, Bangor Punta diversified the company&#x27;s civilian sales to include related gun products (such as holsters), as well as offering additional police equipment (such as handcuffs and breathalyzers). By the late 1970s, these profitable moves made Smith &amp; Wesson &quot;the envy of the industry&quot; according to Business Week.

Despite these advantages, Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s market share began declining in the 1980s. As the war on drugs intensified in the United States, police departments all across the country replaced their Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers with European semiautomatics (such as Glock, SIG Sauer, and Beretta). From 1982 to 1986, profits at the company declined by 41 percent

In June 1987, Tomkins plc paid $112.5 million to purchase Smith &amp; Wesson. Tomkins modernized the production equipment and instituted additional testing, which significantly increased product quality. However, new gun sales in the United States lagged in the 1990s, some of which were attributed to the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. There were also numerous city and state lawsuits against Smith &amp; Wesson. After the success of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, municipalities thought they might be able to succeed through tort law against the gun industry as well.

===21st century===
====Clinton agreement====
On March 17, 2000, Smith &amp; Wesson made an agreement with U.S. President Bill Clinton, under which it would implement changes in the design and distribution of its firearms, in return for &quot;preferred buying program&quot; to offset the loss of revenue as a result of the anticipated consumer boycott. The agreement stated all authorized dealers and distributors of Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s products had to abide by a &quot;code of conduct&quot; to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, and dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 (without an adult present) access to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.

In response, the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) organized a campaign over the issue of smart guns. Thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith &amp; Wesson. CEO Ed Schultz, who negotiated the deal, was forced out in September of that year. By December 2000, the company&#x27;s stock price was 19 cents per share. Smith &amp; Wesson dropped its smart gun plans after nearly being driven out of business.

====Acquisition====
On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith &amp; Wesson Corp. from Tomkins plc for US$15 million, a fraction of the US$112 million originally paid by Tomkins. Saf-T-Hammer assumed US$30 million in debt, bringing the total purchase price to US$45 million. Saf-T-Hammer, a manufacturer of firearms locks and other safety products, purchased the company with the intention of incorporating its line of security products into all Smith &amp; Wesson firearms in compliance with the 2000 agreement.

The acquisition of Smith &amp; Wesson was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott, who had left Smith &amp; Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins&#x27; policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith &amp; Wesson to guide the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.

On February 15, 2002, the name of the newly formed entity was changed to Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corporation.

====Post-acquisition====
In 2006, Smith &amp; Wesson refocused its marketing on big box retailers, according to Smith &amp; Wesson CEO Mike Golden in a 2008 conference call with investors.

On November 7, 2016, Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corporation changed its name to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. The next years saw increased scrutiny by some due to the use of its firearms in mass shootings such as the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, in which a Smith &amp; Wesson AR-15 style rifle, the semi-automatic M&amp;P15 was used. The same weapon was used in the 2015 San Bernardino attack, as well as the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting. 

In 2017, Smith &amp; Wesson saw a severe contraction in its sales as units shipped to distributors and retailers declined 38.3%. The company was forced to lay off one-fourth of its manufacturing workforce.

On August 24, 2020, American Outdoor Brands was spun-off from Smith &amp; Wesson, with S&amp;W retaining the stock ticker SWBI and American Outdoor Brands becoming a new publicly traded company on the NASDAQ as American Outdoor Brands, Inc.

, SWBI had a market value of around $880 million, with revenues a little over US$1 billion

=== Early handguns and revolvers ===

Smith &amp; Wesson has produced revolvers over the years in several standard frame sizes. &quot;M&quot; refers to the small early Ladysmith frame, &quot;I&quot; to the small .32 frame, &quot;J&quot; to the small .38 frame, &quot;K&quot; to the medium .38 frame, &quot;L&quot; to the medium large .38 and .44 Magnum frame, and &quot;N&quot; to the largest .44 Magnum type frame. In 2003, the even larger &quot;X&quot; frame was introduced for the .500 S&amp;W Magnum.

Most Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers have been equipped with an internal locking mechanism since the acquisition by Saf-T-Hammer. The mechanism is relatively unobtrusive, is activated with a special key, and renders the firearm inoperable. Most gun enthusiasts prefer to keep their gun unlocked.

=== Semi-automatic pistols ===

In 1953 the U.S. Army was looking for a pistol to replace the Colt 1911A1. To obtain a bid from the U.S. Government, Smith &amp; Wesson began working on a design similar to the German Walther P38. A year later the Army dropped its search and Smith &amp; Wesson introduced its pistol to the civilian shooting market as the Model 39.

The Model 39 would come to be known as a first-generation pistol. Since the Model 39 debuted, Smith &amp; Wesson continuously developed this design into its third-generation pistols, which have now been discontinued. The first-generation models use a 2-digit model number, the second generation use 3 digits, and third-generation models use 4 digits.

* Smith &amp; Wesson Model 4006
* Smith &amp; Wesson Model 4506 third-generation large frame semi-auto in .45 ACP 
* Smith &amp; Wesson Model 5906

Along with the myriad smaller configurations, the mid-sized 4516, 457, the Chiefs Special CS45, and the decocker equipped, 4546, 4566 and 4576, and the 45 TSW, the 4553, still being issued to the West Virginia State Troopers.

For many of the second-generation models, the first digit identified the material used in the frame; thus the first digit of 4 indicated an alloy, the first digit of 5 indicated blued steel, and the first digit of 6 indicated stainless steel. For most of the third-generation models, the first two digits identified the caliber (except for 59/69 for 9mm), the last two digits were for the action style and the material, respectively. Action style numbers were typically 0 for the standard double/single-action and 4 for double-action-only. Material numbers were commonly 3 for aluminium, 4 for blued steel, and 6 for stainless steel.

==== Sigma series ====
Smith &amp; Wesson introduced the Sigma series of recoil-operated, locked-breech semi-auto pistols in 1994 with the Sigma SW40F, followed by the Sigma SW9F 9 mm, which included a 17-shot magazine. Glock initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Smith &amp; Wesson. The latter paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case and for the right to continue producing models in the Sigma line. The gun frame is manufactured from polymer, while the slide and barrel use either stainless steel or carbon steel. In 1996, Smith &amp; Wesson updated the Sigma by adding a compact model with a shortened barrel (from 4 to 4 inches) and again, in 1999, modified the series by changing the grip by adding checkering and adding an integral accessory rail for lights and laser targeting devices.

==== SW99 Series ====

S&amp;W reached an agreement with Walther to produce variations of the P99 line of pistols. Branded as the SW99, the pistol is available in several calibers, including 9 mm, .40 S&amp;W, and .45 ACP, and in both full size and compact variations. Under the terms of the agreement, Walther produced the frames, and Smith &amp; Wesson produced the slide and barrel. The pistol has several cosmetic differences from the original Walther design and strongly resembles a hybrid between the P99 and the Sigma series.

==== M&amp;P Series ====

In 2005, Smith &amp; Wesson debuted a new polymer-framed pistol intended for the law enforcement market. Dubbed the M&amp;P (for Military and Police), its name was meant to evoke S&amp;W&#x27;s history as the firearm of choice for law enforcement agencies through its previous lineup of M&amp;P revolvers. The M&amp;P is a completely new design with no parts interchangeable with any other pistol including the Sigma. The new design not only looks completely different from the Sigma but feels completely different with 3 different backstraps supplied with each M&amp;P. Many of the ergonomic study elements that had been incorporated into the Sigma and the SW99 were brought over to the M&amp;P. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method (not requiring a dry pull of the trigger) were meant to set the M&amp;P apart from both the Sigma and the popular Glock pistols.

The M&amp;P is available in 9×19mm, .40 S&amp;W, 5.7x28mm, .22 WMR, and .357 SIG. Also, a .22 LR M&amp;P was developed with Carl Walther and is made in Germany. A .45 ACP model was released in early 2007, after making its debut at the SHOT Show. In addition, compact versions are available in .22LR, 9×19mm, .40 S&amp;W, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP. The .22LR Compact is made by Smith &amp; Wesson in the United States. Subcompact versions are available in 9×19mm, .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP.

====SD VE Series====

Smith &amp; Wesson introduced the SD VE series in 2012 to remake and improve the canceled Smith &amp; Wesson SD. The SD VE design has an improved self-defense trigger and a comfortable, ergonomic, textured grip. The SD VE also features an improved stainless steel barrel and slide that the S.D. did not include. The Smith &amp; Wesson SD VE is available in 9×19mm and .40 S&amp;W calibers in either a standard-capacity version (16+1-round capacity for SD9 VE and 14+1 for SD40 VE) or the low-capacity version (10+1-round capacity for both calibers.)

==== SW1911 Series ====
In 2003, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced their variation of the classic M1911 .45 ACP semi-automatic handgun, the SW1911. This firearm retains the M1911&#x27;s well-known dimensions, operation, and feel while adding a variety of modern touches. Updates to the design include serration at the front of the slide for easier operation and disassembly, a high &quot;beaver-tail&quot; grip safety, external extractor, lighter weight hammer and trigger, as well as updated internal safeties to prevent accidental discharges if dropped. S&amp;W 1911s are available with black finished carbon steel slides and frames or bead blasted stainless slides and frames. They are available with aluminium frames alloyed with scandium in either natural or black finishes. These updates have resulted in a firearm that is true to the M1911 design, with additions that would normally be considered &quot;custom&quot;, with a price similar to equivalent designs from other manufacturers.

Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s Performance Center produces the top-of-the-line hand fitted competition version knowns as the P.C. 1911. While most 1911s run around , the PC 1911 is heavier, at approximately . The full-length guide rod adds some weight, and so does the add-on magazine well.

=== Rifles and carbines ===
During the early years of WW2, Smith &amp; Wesson manufactured batches of the Model 1940 Light Rifle under request from the British Government. It turned out to be a spectacular failure.

In January 2006, Smith &amp; Wesson reentered the rifle market with its M&amp;P15 series of rifles based on the AR-15. Unveiled at SHOT Show 2006, the rifle debuted in two varieties: the M&amp;P15 and the M&amp;P15T. The two are basically the same rifle, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with the T model featuring folding sights and a four-sided accessories rail. These rifles were first produced by Stag Arms but marketed under the Smith &amp; Wesson name. Currently Smith &amp; Wesson makes the lower receiver in-house while the barrel is supplied by Thompson/Center, a S&amp;W company.

In May 2008, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced its first AR-variant rifle in a caliber other than 5.56 NATO. The M&amp;P15R is a standard AR-15 rifle chambered for the 5.45×39mm cartridge. In 2009, it released the M&amp;P15-22, chambered for .22 Long Rifle.

Smith &amp; Wesson manufactured a line of bolt-action rifles called the i-Bolt. These synthetic-stock rifles were available in .25-06, .270 Win, or .30-06 caliber.

In February 2023, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced the M&amp;P FPC carbine in 9mm.

In January 2024, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced the Model 1854 lever-action rifle, the first lever-action firearm created by Smith &amp; Wesson in 170 years (since the Volcanic rifle &amp; pistol were patented in 1854).

=== Submachine gun ===
In 1967 Smith &amp; Wesson produced a 9mm submachine gun, hoping to capitalize on U.S. sales of the Israeli Uzi and H.K. MP5. It borrowed the magazine of the Carl Gustaf M/45 submachine gun (&quot;Kulsprutepistol&quot; m/45 or &quot;Kpist&quot; m/45, which had been popular with the U.S. forces in Vietnam as the &quot;Swedish K&quot;) and made a similar side-folding stock. But the rest of the straight blowback weapon had no parts in common with the earlier Swedish gun. The S&amp;W Model 76 submachine gun was made in limited numbers and was primarily used as a police weapon. Because all of them were made before 1986, many of them made it into civilian hands in the United States and are commonly used in submachine gun competition.

=== Shotguns ===

Smith &amp; Wesson bought patents and tooling for a pump-action shotgun design from Noble Manufacturing Co. in 1972 and produced it as the Model 916. The guns were plagued by a variety of quality issues, including a recall due to a safety issue with barrels of the 916T (takedown) version rupturing. The Model 916 was succeeded by the pump-action Model 3000 and the semi-automatic Model 1000; both were produced by Howa Machinery in Japan. However, with the sale of the company to Tomkins plc, Smith &amp; Wesson exited the shotgun market in the mid-1980s to return to their core market of handguns.

During the 1980s, the company released the Smith &amp; Wesson AS, an assault shotgun which had a fully automatic capability.

In November 2006, Smith &amp; Wesson announced that it would reenter the shotgun market with two new lines of shotguns, the break-open Elite Series and the semi-automatic 1000 Series, unveiled at the 2007 SHOT Show. Both series were manufactured in Turkey. Along with the new shotguns, the company debuted the Heirloom Warranty program, a first of its kind in the firearms industry. The warranty provides both the original buyer and the buyer&#x27;s chosen heir with a lifetime warranty on all Elite Series shotguns. The 1000 Series and Elite Series were both discontinued circa 2010.

In August 2021, S&amp;W announced the first shotgun in its M&amp;P line with the M&amp;P12, a bullpup-style pump-action 12-gauge shotgun. The gun is chambered for 3-inch magnum shells and feeds through two independent magazine tubes. The tubes accept not only 3-inch shells, but also standard 2-inch shells and mini-shells.

=== Other products ===

Smith &amp; Wesson is also a manufacturer of restraints (handcuffs, leg irons, belly chains, prisoner transport chains). Smith &amp; Wesson first manufactured handcuffs for the Peerless handcuff company which obtained the right to produce the first swinging-bow handcuffs patented by George A. Carney in 1912. Peerless did not have the facilities necessary for production so they contracted Smith &amp; Wesson to manufacture the handcuffs for them. When Peerless set up its own production plant, Smith &amp; Wesson continued to produce Peerless-type handcuffs under their own brand.

Smith &amp; Wesson markets firearm accessories, safes, apparel, watches, collectables, knives, axes, tools, air guns, emergency light bars, and other products under its brand name.

John Wilson and Roy G. Jinks designed the Smith &amp; Wesson model 6010 Bowie knife in 1971 and the 1973 Texas Ranger Bowie knife. Blackie Collins designed the subsequent model 6020 and 6060 Survival knife from 1974 to 1979. All of these limited-production and custom knives were made at the Springfield, Massachusetts, United States factory.

In October 2002, Smith &amp; Wesson announced it had entered into a licensing agreement with Cycle Source Group to produce a line of bicycles designed by and for law enforcement. These bicycles had custom configurations and silent hubs.

Smith &amp; Wesson flashlights are available to the general public. They are designed and produced by PowerTech, Inc, in Collierville, Tennessee.

Smith &amp; Wesson has a line of wood pellet grills named after various pistol cartridges, such as .22 Magnum, .38 Special, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum, and .500 Magnum.

Smith &amp; Wesson has entered into a licensing agreement with North Carolina–based Wellco Enterprises to design and distribute a full line of tactical law enforcement footwear.

<text>Richard Hurd (13 January 1720 – 28 May 1808) was an English divine and writer, and bishop of Worcester.

==Life==

He was born at Congreve, in the parish of Penkridge, Staffordshire, where his father was a farmer. He was educated at Brewood Grammar School and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He took his B.A. degree in 1739, and in 1742 he proceeded M.A. and became a fellow of his college. In the same year he was ordained deacon, and given charge of the parish of Reymerston, Norfolk, but he returned to Cambridge early in 1743. He was ordained priest in 1744. In 1748 he published some &quot;Remarks on an Enquiry into the Rejection of Christian Miracles by the Heathens&quot; (1746), by William Weston, a fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

He prepared editions, which won the praise of Edward Gibbon, of the &quot;Ars poetica&quot; and &quot;Epistola ad Pisones&quot; (1749), and the &quot;Epistola ad Augustum&quot; (1751) of Horace. A compliment in the preface to the edition of 1749 was the starting-point of a lasting friendship with William Warburton, through whose influence he was appointed one of the preachers at Whitehall in 1750. In 1765 he was appointed preacher at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and in 1767 he became archdeacon of Gloucester.

In 1768, he proceeded D.D. at Cambridge, and delivered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn the first Warburton lectures, which were published later (1772) as &quot;An Introduction to the Study of the Prophecies concerning the Christian Church&quot;. He became bishop of Lichfield and Coventry in 1774, and two years later was selected to be tutor to the prince of Wales and the duke of York. In 1781 he was translated to the see of Worcester and made Clerk of the Closet, holding both positions until his death. He lived chiefly at Hartlebury Castle, where he built a fine library, to which he transferred Alexander Pope&#x27;s and Warburton&#x27;s books, purchased on the latter&#x27;s death.

He was extremely popular at court, and in 1783, on the death of Archbishop Cornwallis, the king pressed him to accept the primacy, but Hurd, who was known, says Madame d&#x27;Arblay, as &quot;The Beauty of Holiness,&quot; declined it as a charge not suited to his temper and talents, and much too heavy for him to sustain. He died, unmarried, on 28 May 1808. His memorial in Worcester Cathedral was sculpted by William Humphries Stephens.

He bequeathed his library to his successors as bishop, and it remains at Hartlebury Castle, but its fate remains uncertain, now that the castle has ceased to be used as the bishop&#x27;s residence.

==Works==

Hurd&#x27;s &quot;Letters on Chivalry and Romance&quot; (1762) retain a certain interest for their importance in the history of the romantic movement, which they did something to stimulate. They were written in continuation of a dialogue on the age of Queen Elizabeth included in his &quot;Moral and Political Dialogues&quot; (1759) Two later dialogues &quot;On the Uses of Foreign Travel&quot; were printed in 1763. Hurd wrote two acrimonious defences of Warburton &quot;On the Delicacy of Friendship&quot; (1755), in answer to John Jortin and a &quot;Letter&quot; (1764) to Dr Thomas Leland, who had criticised Warburton&#x27;s Doctrine of Grace. He edited the &quot;Works of William Warburton&quot;, the &quot;Select Works&quot; (1772) of Abraham Cowley, and left materials for an edition (6 vols., 1811) of Addison. His own works appeared in a collected edition in 8 vols. 1811.

<text>Java APIs for Integrated Networks (JAIN) is an activity within the Java Community Process, developing APIs for the creation of telephony (voice and data) services. Originally, JAIN stood for &quot;Java APIs for Intelligent Network&quot;. The name was later changed to &quot;Java APIs for Integrated Networks&quot; to reflect the widening scope of the project. The JAIN activity consists of a number of &quot;Expert Groups&quot;, each developing a single API specification.

==Trend==
JAIN is part of a general trend to open up service creation in the telephony network so that, by analogy with the Internet, openness should result in a growing number of participants creating services, in turn creating more demand and better, more targeted services.

==Goal==
A goal of the JAIN APIs is to abstract the underlying network, so that services can be developed independent of network technology, be it traditional PSTN or Next Generation Network.

==API==
The JAIN effort has produced around 20 APIs, in various stages of standardization, ranging from Java APIs for specific network protocols, such as SIP and TCAP, to more abstract APIs such as for call control and charging, and even including a non-Java effort for describing telephony services in XML.

==Parlay X==
There is overlap between JAIN and Parlay/OSA because both address similar problem spaces. However, as originally conceived, JAIN focused on APIs that would make it easier for network operators to develop their own services within the framework of Intelligent Network (IN) protocols. As a consequence, the first JAIN APIs focused on methods for building and interpreting SS7 messages and it was only later that JAIN turned its attention to higher-level methods for call control. Meanwhile, at about the same time JAIN was getting off the ground, work on Parlay began with a focus on APIs to enable development of network services by non-operator third parties. 

==Standardized APIs==
From around 2001 to 2003, there was an effort to harmonize the not yet standardized JAIN APIs for call control with the comparable and by then standardized Parlay APIs. A number of difficulties were encountered, but perhaps the most serious was not technical but procedural. The Java Community Process requires that a reference implementation be built for every standardized Java API. Parlay does not have this requirement. Not surprisingly, given the effort that would have been needed to build a reference implementation of JAIN call control, the standards community decided, implicitly if not explicitly, that the Parlay call control APIs were adequate and work on JAIN call control faded off. Nonetheless, the work on JAIN call control did have an important impact on Parlay since it helped to drive the definition of an agreed-upon mapping of Parlay to the Java language.

<text>Lilies or the Revival of a Romantic Drama () is a play written by Quebec playwright Michel Marc Bouchard, which premiered in 1987.

The play concerns the confession of an aging prisoner to a bishop. Through the confession, and the staged scenes acted out by the male prisoners in the prison chapel, we learn that the bishop and the prisoner were part of a gay love triangle, and that the bishop was responsible for the death of a young man many years ago. 

The play&#x27;s English translation by Linda Gaboriau was published in 1990 by Playwrights Canada Press and staged by Théâtre Passe-Muraille in 1991, winning Dora Mavor Moore Awards for Outstanding New Play and for Outstanding Production.

The play was also made into the 1996 film &quot;Lilies&quot;, which was directed by John Greyson.

The play was later adapted as a French-language opera, &quot;Les Feluettes&quot;, with music by Kevin March and libretto by Bouchard. Co-commissioned by Opéra de Montréal and Pacific Opera Victoria, &quot;Les Feluettes&quot; premiered in Montreal in May 2016. The opera was staged in Victoria in April 2017 and at Edmonton Opera in October 2017.

<text>Julien Josephson (October 24, 1881 – April 14, 1959) was an American motion picture screenwriter. His career spanned between 1914 and 1943. He was a native of Roseburg, Oregon.

==Career==
Josephson was well known for his early silent movie adaptions of theatrical works such as Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1925) and Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood&#x27;s &quot;The Bat&quot; (1926). He was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on George Arliss&#x27; &quot;Disraeli&quot; (1929). He later wrote or co-wrote many popular films, including the Shirley Temple vehicles &quot;Heidi&quot; and &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot; (both 1937), &quot;Suez&quot; (1938) and &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; (1939).

<text>Juan Sebastián Elcano (Elkano in modern Basque; sometimes given as &quot;del Cano&quot;; 1486/1487 – 4 August 1526) was a Basque navigator, ship-owner and explorer from Getaria, part of the Crown of Castile when he was born, best known for having completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth in the Spanish ship &quot;Victoria&quot; on the Magellan expedition to the Spice Islands. He received recognition for his achievement by Charles I of Spain with a coat of arms bearing a globe and the Latin motto &quot;Primus circumdedisti me&quot; (You were the first to circumnavigate me).

Despite his achievements, information on Elcano is scarce and he is the subject of great historiographical controversy, because of the scarcity of original sources which illuminate his private life and personality. Even in Spain, for example, the first biographies about him were written in the second half of the 19th century, after three centuries of neglect by historians.

Following his success, the king entrusted him with another large expedition to the Spice Islands, headed by the nobleman García Jofre de Loaisa, which was not completed. Elcano died of scurvy in the Pacific Ocean during this venture.

== Name ==
Elcano&#x27;s name has been written in different ways by historians. Although today in the Basque language the form &quot;Elkano&quot; is used, his signature seems to read Delcano, or possibly Del Cano, although it is difficult to be sure: Enrique Santamaría shows that his lack of dexterity when signing his name leads him to leave gaps between the letters, so sometimes he signed &quot;del ca no&quot;. In Spanish historiography it most commonly has been interpreted as &quot;Del Cano&quot; (or de Cano), but also as simply &quot;Cano&quot;.

However, near Getaria (today between Zarautz and Aia) is the neighborhood of Elkano, where the surname is &quot;Elkano&quot; or &quot;Elcano&quot;. For this reason, &quot;Elcano&quot; has been used as a surname in Spanish and &quot;Elkano&quot; in Basque to indicate that it was from the Elkano lineage.

Mitxelena, in his book &quot;Apellidos vascos&quot;, interprets the surname Elkano from Basque. Between the suffixes &quot;-ano&quot; and &quot;-no&quot;, he provides arguments for the latter, the diminutive suffix. He proposes that the first part of the surname is &quot;elge&quot;. Mitxelena reconstructs the previous form of this &quot;elge&quot;, and argues that the surname Elkano developed from the association of these two morphemes and that it is also a toponym. It exists in different areas of the Basque Country as a minor place name, but also as the name of a village in Navarre.

== Family ==

Juan Sebastián Elcano&#x27;s mother was Catalina del Puerto or Catalina Portu, and his father was Domingo Sebastián Elcano. The Portu or Puerto were a powerful family of clergy and scribes. Elcano&#x27;s grandmother, Catalina&#x27;s mother, was Domenja Olazabal. Formerly it was believed that she belonged to a noble family of the Tolosa area. It is known that Catalina, who was alive at the time of Elcano&#x27;s death, asked the king upon her arrival in Getaria 10 years later for the pension that had been promised to Elcano, legally due her according to his will.

Domingo Sebastián Elcano and Catalina Portu had eight children, their first son being born in 1481, and Juan Sebastián being the fourth born son. Next came Domingo Elcano, who was given the name of his father and became a priest in Getaria. The four other sons in the family were Martín Pérez, Antón Martín, Juan Martín, and Ochoa Martín. Martín Pérez, Antón Martín and Ochoa Martín were also mariners, and sailed with Juan Sebastián Elcano in the second expedition to the Moluccas. The daughters, i.e., Juan Sebastián&#x27;s sisters, were Sebastiana de Elcano and Inés de Elcano. Apparently Elcano also had a half-sister, María, Domingo&#x27;s illegitimate daughter.

Elcano had two children: a son, Domingo Elcano, with María Hernández de Hernialde in Getaria, and a daughter, María, with a woman called María Bidaurreta in Valladolid. In his will, he bequeathed 100 ducats to his son&#x27;s mother, María Hernández de Hernialde. To his daughter he left 40 ducats, conditional on her coming to live in Getaria before she was 4 years old.

=== Family social position and economic status ===

A number of historians have said that the Elcanos were a family of maritime transporters who operated in the Mediterranean. Their ownership of a vessel is suggested by the amount of taxes the family paid the Crown in 1500.

Some 19th century sources say that the Elcano family belonged to the nobility, but this is questionable. Elcano asked the king for the right to bear arms, a privilege of the nobles, and for his brothers to accompany him on his next expedition, indicating that the Elcano brothers, on their father&#x27;s side at least, were neither nobles nor hidalgos, and that the Portus, on their mother&#x27;s side, were probably not nobles either. However, the Olazabal family on his grandmother&#x27;s side may have been hidalgos, but since nobility was not inherited in the matrilineal line, the Portus, through Catalina the daughter of Domenja, would not be hidalgos nor would be the Elcanos, the grandchildren of Domenja.

Fernandez de Navarrete states that, in addition to being a fisherman and a mariner, Elcano acted as a smuggler on board a French ship, but no original sources are given to confirm this. On the other hand, some biographies point out that the Elcano family experienced economic hardship because Elcano&#x27;s father died young and his mother had to support eight siblings, but this assertion is unfounded.

As attested in documentation, in 1500, when Elcano was about 14 years old, a large tax was levied in Getaria, with his father Domingo Elcano appearing in the thirteenth position on the tax rolls, having paid 23½ maravedís. It seems, therefore, that they were quite solvent, since they are named among the richest families of the town. Additionally, the royal document later granting him a pardon states that when Elcano was young and acting as a merchant in the Mediterranean, he was the owner of a 200-ton vessel. This would also indicate that his family had been financially solvent.

Elcano got rich from the circumnavigation voyage, earning 613,250 maravedis. This was an immense fortune, an amount equivalent to the salary of a sea pilot for 20 years, as compared to the 23½ maravedis paid by his father in municipal taxes. Of that fortune, 104,526 maravedis was his shipmaster&#x27;s and captain&#x27;s wage, while the rest was earned by selling the cloves imported from the Moluccas.

== Biography ==
=== Birth ===

The date of Elcano&#x27;s birth is unknown, but it can be inferred with a fair amount of certainty that his year of birth was 1486 or 1487. Spanish historiographers have written that he was 42 years old when he sailed with Magellan in 1518, which would place his birth year in 1476. However, before setting sail Elcano himself had confirmed that he was &quot;approximately&quot; 32 years old, as recorded in a document of August 1519; therefore, it is reasonable to believe that he was born in 1486 or 1487.

There is little doubt about Elcano&#x27;s place of birth because in his will, drawn by Elcano himself, he mentions that his birthplace is Getaria. It is usually said that he was born in the house located in San Roque Street in the municipality of Getaria, today called the &quot;Birthplace of Juan Sebastián Elcano&quot;. There is a plaque commemorating the event next to the house. Even if he was born there, the house did not belong to the Elcano family, but to his maternal grandfather&#x27;s family, the Portus.

In the chronicles of the time, Elcano is also presented as a &quot;Getarian&quot;. In 1601, the chronicler Juan de Mariana, after writing that Elcano was from Getaria, adds: &quot;from Biscay by nationality or Guipuscoan&quot;. At that time the Basques were called &#x27;Vizcaínos&#x27; or &#x27;Biscayans&#x27;. It has been deduced from indirect information that the Basque language was his mother tongue, but it is unequivocable that he also communicated in Spanish, as can be seen in the letters he wrote to the king, and in the interrogations he underwent in Seville and in Valladolid. It appears that he could read Latin as well, because the two books referred to in his will were written in that language.

=== Early life ===
Little is known about Elcano&#x27;s youth. As a young man he owned a large ship and sailed in the Mediterranean. He sold the ship to the Savoyards to resolve legal problems he had incurred because the king had not paid him a salary for &#x27;services rendered&#x27; on the kings&#x27;s orders. It is often repeated, for example, that in 1509 he participated in the conquest of Oran, in the Mediterranean, under the direction of Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, commanding his own his two-hundred-ton ship. However, in the register of ships participating in the conquest of Oran, no captain Elcano, or anything similar, is recorded. According to Spanish historiography, Elcano participated with his ship in the Italian wars under the leadership of Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, known as The Great Captain (&quot;El Gran Capitán&quot;) (1495–1504). This is also doubtful because there are no primary sources to prove it, and, above all because Elcano was then 8 years old (17 according to the Spanish historiography), and it is impossible that an 8-year-old boy was already a ship owner or fought in the war.

The certificate of pardon that the king issued to Elcano has been preserved. It mentions that he acted in the service of the king &quot;in the Levante and Africa&quot;, but these actions are not further specified. It also states that since the king did not pay him the promised salaries, he had been forced to sell his ship to the House of Savoy. Presumably when he had asked for money from the merchants of Savoy he had to offer them the ship as a guarantee. Therefore, in the case of his participating in a military campaign in the Mediterranean &#x27;in the service of the king&#x27;, perhaps the events of the catastrophe of Gelves (1510) was a factor, since that military defeat would explain Elcano&#x27;s debt. Forced to pay for the ship and the crew&#x27;s wages, but with no war prizes, this could have been the cause of his getting into debt. At the age of twenty-three, unable to pay off his financial obligation and still on board the ship in Italy, he had to hand it over to the Savoyards to satisfy the debt. Another hypothesis is that Elcano performed the &#x27;royal services&#x27; in the autumn of 1516, during the battle to take Algiers, also a military defeat, and that he then had to relinquish his ship.

It is known that in the summer of 1515 Elcano joined the local militia. The Royal Corregidor asked 500 Gipuzkoans to go to Hondarribia and San Sebastian to face the threat of the French. Elcano went there, along with 11 compatriots, charging 30 maravedís per day. It would appear that if he had to enroll in the local militia in 1515 and he did not own a ship at the time, his engaging in the battle to take Algiers is unlikely. Being in his twenties during the 1510s, it is unusual that Elcano already owned a ship of 200 tons, and for such a young man to have this responsibility, but it is clear that Elcano was a precocious sailor who rose very quickly as a professional mariner. Nonetheless, he committed a serious infraction by selling his ship to the Savoyards, an illegal action at a time when wars were fought with ships. This infringement would cause him numerous problems in the following years.

After returning from the Mediterranean campaign, as he had legal problems it is likely that he remained in the Mediterranean, in Catalonia or in the Valencian Country, or perhaps also in Alicante. (In his will he left 24 ducats to the Alicante church of Santa Veronica.) However, at the end of June 1517 he appeared again in Getaria, as is known since he signed as a witness to the debt letter of a compatriot. It is possible his son with the young Getarian María Hernández Hernialde was conceived at that time, between 1517 and 1518, although they were not married, probably because Elcano did not have a stable residence. At the end of 1518 Elcano left Getaria and traveled to Seville to join Magellan&#x27;s expedition. However, after returning from the expedition, at the age of 35 or 36, the king would forgive him that legal debt on February 13, 1523, and he was able to stabilize his situation in Valladolid.

==Voyage of circumnavigation==

The Magellan-Elcano expedition (1519 - 1522), which completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth, started with 5 ships (&quot;Trinidad&quot;, &quot;San Antonio&quot;, &quot;Concepción&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Santiago&quot;) along with 234 crewmen (some sources raise the number of sailors to 247.) Although Elcano had departed Spain aboard the &quot;Concepción&quot;, the return voyage from the Moluccas to Seville was made by the single surviving ship, &quot;Victoria&quot;, captained by Elcano. Having sailed under extreme conditions, only 21 people arrived in Seville, the 18 Europeans and 3 Moluccans.

To complete the round-the-world voyage, they had to sail After three years of rough passages, most of the sailors had died. A few made it back alive, but 147 men lost their lives, three-fifths of those who had set sail from Seville. This figure is a reflection of the number of unforeseen events, difficulties and vicissitudes they encountered during the voyage. Fifty-five of those who sailed on the return voyage were deserters coming from South America on the first part of the voyage aboard the &quot;San Antonio&quot;. They had not circumnavigated the world because they decided to retreat to the Strait of Magellan. Others who returned would spend some time in Asia or Cape Verde, although they later managed to get to Europe; thus they also could claim, once they disembarked in Spain, that they had sailed around the world. In other words, in addition to the 17 sailors who arrived in Seville along with Elcano, more sailors would sail around the world, albeit later, and not in the same vessels.

In addition to Elcano, the expedition included 34 other Basques, the largest representation after the Andalusians, along with 28 Portuguese, 19 Genoese and 21 Castilians. Nine of the Basques were with Elcano aboard the &quot;Concepción&quot; – Elcano and Juan de Acurio, Antonio Bermejo&#x27;s boatswain, wanted trustworthy people around them.

=== Spice Island ===
Elcano participated in a fierce mutiny against Ferdinand Magellan before the convoy discovered the Strait of Magellan, the passage between mainland South America and Tierra del Fuego. His life was spared by Magellan and after five months of hard labour in chains he was made captain of the carrack. &quot;Santiago&quot; was later destroyed in a storm. The fleet sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern coast of Brazil and into what is now Puerto San Julián in Argentina. Several months later they discovered a passage now known as the Strait of Magellan located in the southern tip of South America and sailed through the strait. The crew of &quot;San Antonio&quot; mutinied and returned to Spain. On 28 November 1520, three ships set sail for the Pacific Ocean and about 19 men died before they reached Guam on 6 March 1521. Conflicts with the nearby island of Rota prevented Magellan and Elcano from resupplying their ships with food and water. They eventually gathered enough supplies and continued their journey to the Philippines and remained there for several weeks. Close relationships developed between the islanders and the Spaniards, who began to evangelize and convert the Cebuano tribes to Christianity; they also became involved in tribal warfare between rival Filipino groups on Mactan Island. 

On 27 April 1521, Magellan was killed and the Spaniards defeated by natives in the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines. The surviving members of the expedition could not decide who should succeed Magellan. The men finally chose a joint command with the leadership divided between Duarte Barbosa and João Serrão. Within four days these two were also dead, killed after being betrayed by the host at a feast given by Rajah Humabon. The mission was now teetering on the edge of disaster, and João Lopes de Carvalho took command of the fleet, leading it on a meandering journey through the Philippine archipelago.

During the six-month listless journey after Magellan died, and before reaching the Moluccas, Elcano&#x27;s stature grew as the men became disillusioned with the weak leadership of Carvalho. The two ships, &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Trinidad&quot;, finally reached their destination, the Moluccas, on 6 November. The men rested and reprovisioned the ships in this haven, then filled their holds with the precious cargo of cloves and nutmeg. On 18 December, the ships were ready to leave, but &quot;Trinidad&quot; sprang a leak, and could not be repaired. Carvalho stayed with the ship along with 52 others hoping to return later.

&quot;Victoria&quot;, commanded by Elcano along with 17 other European survivors of the 240-man expedition and 4 survivors out of 13 of the Timorese men, continued its westward voyage to Spain traversing the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. They reached Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 6 September 1522.

Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian scholar, was a crew member of the Magellan and Elcano expedition, and later wrote several documents concerning its events. According to Pigafetta the voyage covered 14,460 leagues – about .

=== Elcano under Magellan&#x27;s leadership ===
Ferdinand Magellan was the expedition leader, its captain-general (&quot;capitán-general&quot;). Being Portuguese, he had traveled in his youth through South Asia with the Portuguese army, getting to know those islands, finding safe harbors and places to stay and establishing his mastery of the maritime routes for trade. As a result of those experiences, Magellan knew the exact location of the Moluccas islands, then called the &quot;Spice Islands&quot;, or at least he made King Charles V believe this. He claimed, wrongly, that they were in the Castilian hemisphere, following the Treaty of Tordesillas. He was appointed captain-general because he had this information, and this is also the reason he was responsible for planning the expedition&#x27;s route to the East Indies. The relationship between Magellan and Elcano quickly became strained, precisely because Magellan did not want to show anyone the route and did not want to reveal exactly where the Moluccas were. Magellan condemned Elcano in San Julian (Patagonia) for his participation in the San Julian revolt.

Elcano confessed his part in the mutinies against Magellan during his interrogation at Valladolid after the circumnavigation, adding that he had not written anything while Magellan was alive because he feared him. Magellan had been killed in the Philippines on April 27, 1521, by warriors from the island of Mactan.

Although the objective set by the king was to open the route to the Spice Islands, when they reached Asia, Magellan began to pursue his personal objectives as a captain. The king had promised to make him governor of those islands in the Castilian hemisphere and that he should enjoy commercial rights to the trade of the two main islands. This is probably why the expedition did not sail directly to the Moluccas islands to acquire spices, but further north. They also traveled widely in the region, getting involved in the internal conflicts of the resident peoples of the various islands.

=== Voyage after Magellan&#x27;s death ===

After Magellan&#x27;s death, the Portuguese Duarte Barbosa, a relative of Magellan, was appointed captain-general, but he was also killed in Cebu together with Captain João Serrão of the &quot;Trinidad&quot;, in an ambush at a dinner organized by the leader of the island, the rajah called Humabon. In that ambush on May 1 in Mactan, about 35 sailors lost their lives. In this situation, on May 2, 1521, it was decided to burn the ship &quot;Concepción&quot; because there were not enough sailors, only 116 or 117, to crew three ships. Thus the expedition was reduced from five to two vessels.

Now the expedition had only two vessels to return to Seville, &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Trinidad&quot;. However, Elcano was not immediately appointed captain. First another Portuguese, Juan Lopez de Carvalho, was appointed in May 1521. Disagreeing with Carvalho&#x27;s manner of command, the sailors dismissed Carvalho and elected Elcano as captain of the ship on September 17, 1521. Clarifying what happened between May and September is complicated because there are several versions of the events. How and why the unusual decision was made to remove Carvalho and place Elcano in command has not yet been determined, but it is certain that Elcano was chosen as captain by the crew to replace Carvalho.

After arriving in the Moluccas and loading the cargo of cloves, once in South Asia Captain Elcano changed his original plan. He proposed to continue westward returning to Europe around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, without turning back or rounding Cape Horn in South America. This change of plans would culminate with the first round-the-world voyage.

=== From Tidore to Cape Verde ===
The expedition finally reached Tidore in the Molucca Islands, in what is now Indonesia. There they found the precious spice they were looking for, i.e., cloves. They made an agreement with the local rajah, whom they called the &quot;Almansur&quot; of Tidore Island, and who brought them tons of cloves. (The &quot;Victoria&quot; returned to Seville with 27 tons of cloves.) As there were not so many cloves on Tidore Island, the rajah brought some from the neighboring islands as well. In the meantime, the &quot;Trinidad&quot; was disabled. Having heard of the approach of the Portuguese, and with the danger of tarrying, they decided to return alone on the &quot;Victoria&quot;, with Elcano as captain. They had specific orders from the Crown to return by the route they had gone, but they did not comply with them, and took the westward course with the aim of sailing around the world. Elcano proposed to do this because, as he wrote, &quot;They were going to do what could be narrated&quot;, indicating that he was aware of the historical import of their voyage, as is clear in the letter he wrote to the newly enthroned king:

 Elcano allowed the sailors to choose their ship, since they were to circumnavigate in waters belonging to Portugal. Forty seven sailors chose to return with Elcano aboard the &quot;Victoria&quot;, and 13 members decided to stay in the Moluccas. At that time there were twelve Basques left in the expedition, of whom eight decided to return with Elcano, the other three remaining aboard the Trinidad. The ship Victoria left Tidore Island on December 21, 1521, bound for Seville. They sailed into a strong storm which damaged the ship. On the nearby island of Mallua (today called Pulau Wetar) they had to remain fifteen days for repairs. From Tidore they sailed to the island of Timor, and after spending a few days there, they set sail on February 7, 1522. From that day until July 9, when they reached Cape Verde, they would not set foot on land again. The expedition planned to sail from Timor to Seville, a distance of kilometers, without a stopover, to avoid meeting the Portuguese on the way. They did not succeed, because after sailing over , their supplies, health and the condition of &quot;Victoria&quot; had become impossible; the sailors decided by vote to stop and recover at Cape Verde.

From Timor, the &quot;Victoria&quot; traveled west, on a line around 10° 32&#x27; South – probably within of the Australian mainland and passing close to Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands – before heading southwest, to avoid Portuguese India, and crossing the equator into the southern hemisphere. By going so far south, they also managed to avoid the opposing monsoon winds blowing from Africa that time of year. On March 18, the crew sighted an island that Elcano named &quot;Desesperanza&quot; (&quot;Despair&quot;; later known as Ile Amsterdam), because he was unable to find a safe place to land, and his crew was desperate for fresh water, 40 days out from Timor.

While they were still in the Indian Ocean, the crew of &quot;Victoria&quot; began to run out of food. They had only rice cooked in seawater left to eat, and scurvy began to make the sailors seriously ill. Under these circumstances, the idea of making landfall in Mozambique spread on the ship. It was dangerous to land there, however, where the Portuguese might capture them. Elcano consulted the crew, who decided by vote to continue sailing, without stopping in Mozambique.

Rounding the perilous Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa was very difficult for them. The Portuguese called it the &quot;Cape of Storms&quot;. At first they headed south to take advantage of the wind, but the ship could not continue because of bad weather, usual in those parts. For nine weeks they stayed there, freezing, with their sails lowered. At last Elcano made the sailors a dangerous proposition: to round the cape close to the coast. On the one hand there was the danger that the storms would drive them into the shore, and on the other, if they avoided that fate, that they might encounter the Portuguese on the eastern side of the cape. They pressed on, sailing westward in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast, and at last managed to round the cape and head northward off the continent&#x27;s western coast.

=== Landing in Cape Verde ===

The expedition could not sail directly to Seville because the situation on board was unsustainable, and they needed to land somewhere. In desperation, and in search of food, they first reconnoitered the African coast off what is now Guinea Bissau and Senegal, but could not find a suitable place to land. They decided by vote to call at Cape Verde where they could obtain food and repair the ship, although the Portuguese were in charge in Cape Verde. This was the final leg of the voyage, and Elcano&#x27;s men had not made landfall for months, suffering two or three deaths a week. Seawater was entering the vessel&#x27;s wooden hull, due to naval shipworms tunneling into and damaging it, and as the crew were weak from hunger, they did not have the strength to pump the water out of the bilges, and there were fewer and fewer of them left alive.

To make matters worse, they had no money and no goods except cloves to exchange for provisions. Acknowledging that they had cloves would reveal that the expedition was returning from Asia rather than the Americas, and the Portuguese would come out against them. By unknown means they were able to pay for the first two loads of food, but they used part of their cargo of cloves to pay for the third and thus revealed their identity to the Portuguese. (This assumption has been dismissed by scholars like Enrique Santamaría, who argues that such &quot;errors&quot; were impossible). Consequently, they were pursued by the Portuguese and forced to flee, leaving 13 sailors prisoners of the Portuguese in Cape Verde.

It is not entirely clear whether their third risky purchase at Cape Verde was to obtain provisions or slaves. Most of the original accounts, including Elcano&#x27;s, speak only of food, but Bustamante, the doctor-barber on board, says that they went down to look for slaves because of the imperative need for labor to pump out the water filling the bilges. This is a possibility, as the African slave trade was common and legal in Portugal.

=== Arrival ===
The ship didn&#x27;t make the passage from Cape Verde to Seville in a straight line because the wind was driving them off course. They turned around by &#x27;Volta do mar largo&#x27;, taking a wide course to the west, sailing almost as far northward as Galicia and from there southward to return to Seville. They landed at Sanlúcar de Barrameda on September 6, 1522, and two days later, they entered Seville on September 8, after almost three years of voyaging. Of the 234 (or 247) sailors who set sail, only 18 arrived.

As soon as the ship &quot;Victoria&quot; arrived in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Elcano began writing a 700-word letter addressed to Charles V, in which he never mentions himself, emphasising that the expedition had achieved its goal of bringing back the desired spices, had &quot;brought peace&quot; to those islands, and had obtained the friendship of their kings and lords, attested by their signatures on documents. He went on to highlight the extreme hardships undergone during the expedition. Elcano did not forget the members of the crew captured in Cabo Verde by the Portuguese, begging the king to initiate all necessary actions leading to their release. He ends the letter with commentary about their discoveries, the roundness of the world, setting sail to the west and coming back from the east.

==After the voyage==

=== Court of Valladolid ===
Once the voyage was over, upon arriving in Seville, Elcano and a few selected men took the road to Valladolid, which at the time was the residence of Charles V and his court. The king wanted Elcano to personally tell him about the expedition. In his letter of invitation, the king offered him horses to make the trip, although the road from Seville to Valladolid was traveled more often by carriage than on horseback. The invitation was intended only for Elcano and two others, &#x27;Those who have better sense&#x27;, but Elcano brought more crew members with him. The little group arrived in Valladolid, including the three sailors from the Moluccas who wanted to meet the king.
King Charles V soon received Elcano, at the latest one month after the circumnavigation. Elcano appeared at the court in Valladolid, and spoke in the presence of the king, giving his account of the voyage, possibly in three conversations: first with the king, perhaps in private; then with the court experts, to clarify technical and financial matters and also to describe the events of the voyage, including the mutiny and deaths that occurred; and finally, with a group of humanist learned men more interested in the various cultures that the expedition encountered. It is not known exactly how these meetings went. He would spend three years in Valladolid, near the Court. There he joined María Bidaurreta (in some sources De Vida Urreta) and had another daughter.

Charles V granted Elcano an augmentation of his coat of arms featuring a world globe with the words &quot;Primus circumdedisti me&quot; (Latin: &quot;You first encircled me&quot;). However, this augmentation has been contested, as Elcano was not previously a member of the nobility. Elcano claimed three gifts from the king as a reward for his achievement, namely an annual pension of 500 ducats which he never received, two armed men to escort him and an official statement pardoning him for the sale of his ship to the Savoyard bankers. Following Elcano&#x27;s death and after lengthy lawsuits, his mother Catalina del Puerto never managed to obtain any of his pension. By 1567, after she too had died, Elcano&#x27;s heirs and other relatives continued to demand that the pension be honored. His male heirs were given the hereditary title of Marquis of Buglas, i.e., Negros Island in the Philippines. In the modern era, the country with the most people surnamed &quot;Elcano&quot; is currently the Philippines.

=== Relations with Portugal ===
The king of Portugal, John III, filed a piracy complaint against Elcano for theft of the cargo of cloves from the Moluccas, as they were part of his domains, and for his escape from Cape Verde with the precious cargo. He petitioned the King of Castile to return the cloves and to arrest and punish Elcano. King Charles V disregarded the request and protected Elcano.

Portugal and Castile both claimed the Moluccas Islands. The need to revise the Treaty of Tordesillas was not easy to resolve. Without knowing the exact size of the world, it was difficult to place those islands in a certain area. The key was to fix the location of the anti-meridian relative to the meridian established in the Treaty of Tordesillas, the two meridians forming a great circle that divides the earth into two hemispheres, to determine on which side of the antimeridian the Moluccas Islands were located. Meetings to resolve the matter were held in 1524 in the towns of Elvas and Badajoz along the border between Spain and Portugal. Five of the six Basques who circumnavigated the world participated in these assemblies.

To accurately establish this antimeridian, each of the Crowns assembled the best cosmographers of the time. Each delegation appointed three astronomers or cartographers, three sea pilots and three mathematicians. The Spanish delegation also appointed Fernando Colón, son of Christopher Columbus, with the objective of determining the location of the Moluccas. The negotiating team included Sebastian Cabot (Sebastián Caboto), Juan Vespucio, Diogo Ribeiro, Estêvão Gomezs, Simón Alcazaba and Diego López de Sigueiro.

In the Badajoz-Elvas assemblies, the most authoritative voice of the Castilian delegation was Elcano himself, who devoted himself to his work as a cosmographer. He brought to these meetings a sphere of the world he made himself, on which some accounts say he had marked the trajectory of the round-the-world voyage. These meetings were unsuccessful because the attendant parties were unable to agree on the exact location of the Moluccas Islands, as it could not be deduced from the ships&#x27; logs, and in any case the Portuguese did not recognize Elcano&#x27;s authority. It is not known exactly why, but suddenly Elcano and the pilot Estêvão Gomes were absent from those meetings on March 15, 1524. Shortly thereafter, on May 20, 1524, the king pronounced his support of Elcano, as it was said that there were those who wanted to harm him (the royal charter speaks of &quot;wounded, dead or crippled&quot;), and three days later, on May 23, 1524, the assembly met again in Badajoz, but without Elcano. The conjecture is that he was threatened by the Portuguese in the case of the alleged piracy in the Moluccas. By October 1524 Elcano was in the Basque Country preparing for a second expedition to the Moluccas. Two years later, in 1529, John III of Portugal and Charles V of Castile signed the Treaty of Zaragoza, Castile recognizing the Moluccas as being on the Portuguese side of the antimeridian of the line of demarcation previously specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.

==Last expedition==
In 1525, Elcano was back at sea as a member of the Loaísa expedition to the Moluccas with García Jofre de Loaísa, who had been appointed by Charles V as captain-general of a fleet composed of seven ships. Loaísa was in command of the carrack (Spanish: &quot;nao&quot;) &quot;Santa María de la Victoria&quot;, the fleet&#x27;s flagship, while Elcano was named pilot-major of the expedition, in command of &quot;Sancti Spiritus&quot;, with his brother Martín Pérez serving as its pilot. They were sent by Charles V to claim the Indies in his name, a venture that was irksome to Portugal.
The expedition, financed by German international banking and merchant families, the Fuggers and the Welsers, sailed from A Coruña in July 1525. It consisted of four carracks, two caravels and a patache, with 450 sailors to crew them. Its purpose was securing a military foothold in the Maluccas, and forming alliances with the native rulers to gain control of the local spice trade with the establishment of a base for the Spanish Crown&#x27;s mercantile and colonial agents.
Although Elcano had more experience, the king chose García Jofre de Loaísa as commander of the expedition because he was a nobleman, his status in line with the royal objective of establishing a Castilian authority in the Moluccas. Elcano was accompanied by his brothers Martín Pérez, Ochoa Martín and Antón Martín, his nephew Esteban Mutio, and his brother-in-law Santiago de Guevara, captain of &quot;Santiago&quot;.
Elcano&#x27;s influence was evident in the preparations for the expedition. Of the seven ships, four had been built in Basque territory and the number of natives of the Gipuzkoan coast in the crew had increased considerably, including those in positions of responsibility, compared to the first expedition. Many of them were close to Elcano.
The expedition faced numerous misfortunes. Before reaching the strait, two vessels were lost because they couldn&#x27;t find its entrance. The &quot;Sancti Spiritus&quot;, piloted by Elcano, ran aground in a storm and was abandoned, with its men being distributed among the other ships, and the &quot;San Gabriel&quot; deserted the expedition, returning to Castile after sailing up the Brazilian coast. The remaining ships completed their passage through the Strait of Magellan on 26 May 1526, and set out for the Pacific crossing. A storm scattered the ships on June 2 and only one, &quot;Victoria&quot;, remained. Another of the ships ended up in Zihuatanejo, Mexico.

=== Death ===
The ship continued to the Moluccas in poor condition, and the crew suffered the ravages of scurvy. The accountant Alonso de Tejada, the pilot Antonio Bermejo and thirty-two other crew members died. Finally, General Loaisa himself died on 30 July. Elcano then took command of the navigation, and was named captain-general, a position he had been promised by the king from the beginning. After a short time he died of scurvy, probably on 6 August 1526. All his relatives who accompanied him also died, except, perhaps, his brother Ochoa Martín, who may have been aboard the ship that landed at Zihuatanejo. In one of the documents that appeared later in Laurgain, dated January 29, 1529, the king calls &quot;Johan Ochoa Martínez del Cano&quot; to go on the expedition of Simón de Alcazaba to the Moluccas. If this referred to Elcano&#x27;s brother, then he was still alive in 1529. Before dying, Juan Sebastián had made a will – one of those signing as a witness was Andrés de Urdaneta.

On August 7, Elcano&#x27;s body was wrapped in a shroud and tied to a board with ropes. Afterwards, it was placed on the deck of the ship while the surviving men recited the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (Hail Mary). When they finished, a weight was tied to the shroud, and Alonso de Salazar, the new captain general of the Army, nodded his head. The four sailors tilted the plank over the gunwale until the weight of the corpse caused it to drop into the sea.

== Writings by Elcano ==
Two letters addressed to King Charles V and a will are the only documents in Elcano&#x27;s own handwriting known to have survived to the present day. In the interrogations at Seville before the expedition and at Valladolid after its completion, the answers given by Elcano were also recorded in writing and have also survived. Elcano&#x27;s voice can be heard in them.

While Magellan was alive Elcano wrote nothing because he feared his wrath, he addressed this point in the Valladolid interrogations. After Magellan&#x27;s death, however, following Elcano&#x27;s appointment as captain, he began to write down (as he himself said in the Valladolid investigation) what had happened and what he had seen. This chronicle of the first world circumnavigation, written by his own hand, has been lost. Along with Elcano&#x27;s account, the other important written chronicles of the voyage, including Magellan&#x27;s or Pigaffeta&#x27;s originals, are also lost. In the case of Magellan and Elcano a hypothesis has been proposed that both their writings could be translated in the Latin chronicle of the royal secretary Maximilianus Transylvanus, and that the main passages of the chronicle written by Elcano have survived in the contemporary chronicles rewritten by Maximilianus Transylvanus and Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo.

=== First Letter to Charles V ===

The first letter was written in Sanlúcar de Barrameda to let the king know that he has returned from his circumnavigation. The text is precise and correct, as merchants, unlike diplomats, usually write. He promises the king documents, letters of submission from the monarchs of the remote island and samples of spices to account for the success of the voyage. He also brings with him five parrots, which were appreciated at the Court. He explains in 10 lines what happened up to the death of Magellan and, subsequently, what happened in his charge in the other 40–45. It is at that point that he asks the king to make an effort to free the 13 who have been detained in Cape Verde. He asks for a financial reward from Charles V, but mentions that the feat was accomplished by collective decision.

=== Second Letter to Charles V ===
The purpose of the second letter was to ask for bonuses. Approximately 40 days after returning from the voyage around the world, Elcano arrived at the Court of Valladolid where the king received his request to name him captain-general. In it he also asked the king for the commercial rights of trade in the Moluccas or the habit of the Order of Santiago, which were entrusted by the king to Magellan. The king&#x27;s secretary (Francisco de los Cobos) denied all of these requests. Apparently he was not accorded respect at the Court of Castile, and they did not want to give Elcano the orders that had been promised to Magellan. Santamaría argues that this animadversion was caused by Elcano&#x27;s lack of noble status. It took him months to obtain the other three bonuses he had been promised – a pension, a pardon and the right to an armed guard – probably as a result of the rapprochement with the Court.

=== Elcano&#x27;s will ===

The will is also a source of information about Elcano&#x27;s personal life. In addition to citing all his claimed assets in great detail, it speaks of his family. It shows that although he never married, he had sexual relationships with at least two women, both of them Basque or of Basque origin, and each of whom bore his child. His son Domingo was born before the world circumnavigation and his daughter María afterwards.

The will was drawn up on July 26, 1526, and opened by the president of the Council of the Indies upon his arrival in Seville, ten years after it was made. All seven witnesses to the will were Basques, which is surprising, given the situation and the location in the middle of the Pacific, a clear indication of trust and solidarity among them. The witnesses were Martín García Karkizano, Andrés Gorostiaga, Hernando Gebara, Andrés Urdaneta, Juanes Zabala, Martín Uriarte and Andrés Aletxe.

In his will Elcano left money to churches such as San Salvador de Getaria, Itziar, Sasiola (Deba), Our Lady of Arantzazu, San Pelayo in Zarautz and Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe in Hondarribia. However, he stipulated that these bequests should be paid out of the money owed him by the king according to the terms of their agreement, funds which he never received. This leaving of money to the church only if he were paid by the King has been used by Santamaría to dismiss the idea of Elcano being a very religious man.

He also left portions of those funds to his heirs, but if they died, as happened, his mother would receive the benefit of his properties. He treated the four of them generously in the distribution of goods: one hundred ducats of gold to Domingo&#x27;s mother (37,500 maravedís), and another 40 ducats (15,000 maravedís) to the daughter, if she married, as a dowry. On the other hand, he requested that his daughter be taken from Valladolid to Getaria when she turned 4 years old, because Getaria was closer to his heart than the Court of Valladolid.

Thanks to the will, it is known that Elcano owned two books written in Latin, indicating that he knew how to read that language. Both books refer to astronomy, one being the &quot;Almanac&quot; of Regiomontanus, which allowed navigators to determine longitude at sea with observations of the moon. These two books were left to Andres San Martin, his pilot cosmographer who disappeared on the circumnavigation, if he should be found alive. This suggests that in the second expedition Elcano was still hoping to find a companion lost in the first expedition.

In 1533, seven years after Elcano&#x27;s death, his mother was still in court with the royal treasury seeking the salaries corresponding to the rank of captain due to her son and the other payments he never received, and his pension of 500 ducats per year. The will also shows that Elcano did not own slaves, otherwise he would have had to cite them.

=== Transylvanus&#x27; text ===

The humanist Maximilianus Transylvanus was present at the royal court, listening to Elcano. From what he heard he wrote his own chronicle of the voyage, in the form of a letter, which he sent to his patron, Matteo Lang von Wellenburg. The book was printed in Cologne in January 1523 and in November of that year another printing was made in Rome by Gian Matteo Giberti, assistant to Pope Clement VII. Giovanni Battista Ramusio years later assembled a collection of travels and introduced the text of Transylvanus. The text was written in Latin, for political purposes and according to the tastes of Chancellor Gattinara. It is possible that this text by Transylvanus is a compilation of collected testimonies: the account of Magellan&#x27;s part of the voyage is very different from that of Elcano&#x27;s part, as if they had two different authors. Another chronicler of the time who read these two texts, Fernandez de Oviedo, alluded to the parity between the texts of Elcano and Transylvanus: &quot;It is almost him&quot;, he wrote.

If the second part of the Transylvanus text is a direct translation of Elcano&#x27;s report, he appears as an exponent of the humanist and utopian intellectual movements then current in Europe, and the text, which says that the societies of the Moluccas were peaceful, treated their neighbors well and were hospitable to foreigners can be seen as one of the first explications of the myth of the noble savage and a critique of the corruption of European civilization:
Basque philosopher Ekai Txapartegi defends the proposition that Transylvanus&#x27;s text was written by Elcano, asserting that its description of the island of Borneo as a utopia and its depiction of the customs of the inhabitants reveals the humanist aspect of his political thought, as well as his opposition to the expansionist ambitions of empire and warlike kings, and the imposition of the Christian faith on peaceful pagan societies. Not much is said in the text about the events that transpired when the expedition was in Borneo, only that they talked to the local king, made some exchanges and moved on. What they were doing there is not explained in the passage, although it is known that Borneo was the scene of conflict for the travelers, indicating that the writer is speaking more of his personal utopian vision than of a literal description of Borneo.

== Historiography ==
Elcano&#x27;s achievement has been eclipsed in traditional historiography by that of Magellan, who planned and led the famous expedition until he died before it reached the Spice Islands. More recently, Portugal&#x27;s solo candidacy to UNESCO to get Magellan&#x27;s expedition and the resulting circumnavigation (without mentioning Elcano) recognised as a Portuguese Intangible World Heritage has provoked a major controversy with Spain, thereafter seemingly settled by the submission by said countries of a new joint application to honour the circumnavigation route. According to the Basque historian Xabier Alberdi Lonbide, Elcano was relegated to a secondary role in French and Spanish historiography of the 19th century and there remains a minor figure. Lonbide writes that the maritime heritage of the Basque Country generally has been consigned to oblivion in British, French, and Spanish historiography, and that Basque historiography has not managed to overcome this situation, although in the Basque Country Elcano is regarded as the most universal representative of Basque culture, and he has greater stature.

=== Elcano, deleted from History ===

Throughout the world Elcano has been a marginal character because he was almost forgotten for three centuries. In the first accounts of the voyage, the cold reception that the successful circumnavigation of the world got at the Court of Castile is noticeable; in the long seventeen-page account written by Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera, for example, Elcano was not mentioned even once. The reason for this neglect is perhaps that those who sailed around the world were not hidalgos, but common sailors, a fact that contravened late medieval social attitudes among the upper classes.

Nor did the book, &quot;Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo&quot;, by Antonio Pigafetta, the Venetian scholar who sailed with Magellan and who was among the 18 men that survived the expedition and returned to Spain, mention Elcano. In its received form, his chronicle exaggerates his own role, perhaps explaining why in Italian historiography Elcano disappears and &quot;Capitano Pigafetta&quot; himself appears as an important character.

In recent years, however, another point of view has spread: Pigafetta quoted Elcano, but as the works of Pigafetta that have survived to modern times were modified in transmission, perhaps mentions of Elcano were suppressed. The original Pigafetta chronicle is lost, and the account in its present form would be a retranslation of a translation made in France, written later, and suppressing or modifying many sections. The hypothesis is that, since France was at war with Castile, the French eliminated all the &quot;Spaniards&quot; that Pigafetta had praised in his telling of the voyage. This &#x27;eliminatory&#x27; view was further extended when it was written by Philip II&#x27;s chronicler, embellishing the roles of the hidalgos Magellan and Pigafetta and minimising that of the plebeians. Spanish historiography transformed Magellan into a leader who favored the unity of Portugal and Spain, although he had betrayed Portugal by becoming Castilian. Thus, he became a hero for the Castilians whose political position was consequently enhanced.

It was in the interest of Castile to elevate Magellan, and to push Elcano aside, but also of the Catholic Church. The tug of war between the empire of Charles V and the Roman Catholic Church was constant. The Holy Roman Empire presented itself as a Catholic Empire, but at the same time it did not control the center of religion, that is, Rome. The Church did not want Charles V to have too much power. Therefore, the Church wanted to mark a contrast between the bloody evangelisation that Spain carried out in the Americas and the supposedly peaceful evangelisation that Portugal carried out in Asia. Since it was convenient for it to emphasize that Spain&#x27;s attempt at evangelisation had been drenched with blood, while Portugal&#x27;s was a builder of civilization, the Church found it advantageous to praise Magellan. Thus, Magellan was praised by Rome and England, who were allied with Portugal against Spain. Magellan was taken as a model of civilization, and Francis Drake as the executor of his dream.

Although many technical and economic documents have survived, most of the originals have disappeared; their existence is known because these documents are cited by those who received the records of the times. Neither the actual text of the chronicle of Elcano&#x27;s voyage, records of the proceedings of the trial of Carvalho, the documentation provided by Elcano at the Badajoz-Elvas meetings, nor the ship&#x27;s logbook have been found. The Trinidad ship&#x27;s book has also been lost, although it was taken by Portugal. Historian Enrique Santamaría believes these documents have been destroyed, probably in the 19th century; he finds it difficult to credit that they were lost, they being of immense historical value, and observes that documents with many other details of the voyage have survived.

=== Navarrete&#x27;s account ===

In the context of the Napoleonic Wars, feelings of nationalism arose in most European countries. In Spain this sentiment had a conservative component supported by the monarchy, that in its retrospective view, held that the Spanish people needed to construct a new national historiography; this task fell to Martín Fernández de Navarrete, director of the Royal Academy of History. In 1825 Fernández de Navarrete wrote a modern &#x27;official&#x27; account of the first circumnavigation of the earth, &quot;Colección de los viajes y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles&quot;, in which Magellan is praised, and the figure of Elcano passed down by tradition was remade.

At a time when Spain was experiencing the decolonization of America, the Spanish government desired to present a national historical narrative that legitimized the power of the ruling elites, a message that inevitably would diminish the position of the lower classes. In Navarrete&#x27;s telling Magellan became an exemplar of those elevated persons who must struggle against the incapacity of common men to understand the complexities of governance, portraying him as of noble character, an upholder of the Christian faith, and a leader in the advancement of civilization. In contrast to these virtuous qualities he attributed to Magellan, Elcano was a man in the habit of deciding important matters democratically by vote, one who had never conquered another race of people that could be evangelized and civilized, nor had he ever even tried. Thus, in Navarrete&#x27;s account, crediting Elcano with the completion of the first circumnavigation is understood as an injustice to the memory of Magellan&#x27;s achievements, and Navarette&#x27;s history is an attempt to rectify this error. The historical conception of a Spanish nation as presented by Navarrete has subsequently been propagated by historians of other nationalities, and remained a dominant view internationally for many years.

=== Later constructions ===
In 1861 the soldier Juan Cotarelo Garastazu, a field marshal (&quot;mariscal de campo&quot;) of the Spanish army, wrote the first biography of Elcano. He writes that Elcano was &quot;humble and obedient&quot; and that he had managed to sail around the world in obedience to his king, submitting as proof that in the rigorous Valladolid inquiry concerning the circumnavigation, Elcano responded in a humble, modest way to the thirteen questions he was asked.

Eustaquio Fernández de Navarrete, grandson of Martín Fernández de Navarrete, wrote a more complete biography of Elcano in 1872. This biography has a more neutral, analytical approach to its subject and has been the main reference for historians. As it was problematic for some people that Elcano lacked a noble pedigree, in order to vindicate his reputation, Eustaquio Fernández de Navarrete suggested, without providing any proof, that Elcano had taken part in the Siege of Oran and in the Italian wars.

=== From Cánovas to the Francoism ===

Elcano was a posthumous victim of political machinations in the 19th century when Antonio Cánovas del Castillo faced the creation of peripheral Basque nationalist movements and &quot;fuerismo&quot; concerning the laws (fueros) of the different provinces of the Basque region; this occurred in a chaotic scenario after the overthrow of the First Spanish Republic. The so-called foral laws set up a legal framework in which authority was shared between the monarchy, whose agencies governed local affairs of interest to the Crown, and provincial institutions, which managed their own affairs concerning local traditions and customs. Cánovas believed that the foralists used a distorted history to defend their politics and, for this reason he wanted to minimize the role of the Basques and the Navarrese in Iberian history. Thus, he tried to disappear not only Elcano, but also Blas de Lezo, Churruca, Andrés de Urdaneta, and Legazpi from this history, establishing a damnatio memoriae. To eradicate Elcano&#x27;s place as a heroic figure, Cánovas reinforced the use of the Portuguese Magellan as a symbol of the political unity of the Iberian Peninsula, averring that Elcano was no more than the &quot;humble master&quot; (&quot;modesto maestre&quot;) of the ship &quot;Victoria&quot; that completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth.

Prime Minister of Spain Primo de Rivera, however, wanted to restore Elcano&#x27;s reputation and named a training ship of the Spanish Navy, &quot;Juan Sebastián de Elcano&quot; (A-71), after him. Franco&#x27;s regime tried to make Elcano a national mythical figure, using the narrative written by Eustaquio Fernández de Navarrete (1872).

Amado Melón Ruiz de Gordejuela in his book &quot;Magallanes o la Primera Vuelta al Mundo&quot;, published in 1940 in the collection &quot;La España Imperial&quot;, affirmed that Elcano participated in the siege of Oran and was an assistant to &quot;The Great Captain&quot;, Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova, who campaigned in Italy between 1495 and 1504. Melón Ruiz wanted to place Elcano in Oran, and added 10 years to his age (otherwise he would have been only 8 years old), and promulgated the fiction that Elcano was born in 1476 rather than 1487. With the acceptance of this fabricated birth date by historians, the false information that Elcano participated in the Oran campaign has been widely published in history books.

=== 500th anniversary ===
The 500th anniversary of the first circumnavigation was celebrated in Spain on September 6, 2022. In view of this, several initiatives such as the Elkano Foundation have arisen, both to complete the history and perpetuate its memory and to plan the celebration of the event.

As part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the first circumnavigation of the Earth on September 6, 1522, the Basque Maritime Museum, with the support of the Elkano Foundation, has published a new book: &quot;Elcano y el País Vasco. Cómo se hizo posible la primera vuelta al mundo&quot; (June 2022).

== Elcano in art ==
There is no description or contemporary artwork depicting Elcano, and all artworks depicting him were made centuries later, often with ahistorical elements in their composition and featuring anachronistic clothing.

=== Paintings ===
=== Banknotes ===
=== Sculptures ===
=== Cinema ===
In 2019 an animated movie was made in the Basque language by Ángel Alonso with the title &quot;Elkano, lehen mundu bira&quot;. In 2020 another animation movie by Manuel H. Martin called &quot;El viaje más largo&quot; was presented in Sevilla. In 2022 Amazon Prime broadcast the series &quot;Boundless&quot;, with Álvaro Morte as Elcano.
In 2022 the movie &quot;Uncharted&quot; mentioned him. The movie is based on his journey with the &quot;Magellan Expedition&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, transfinite numbers or infinite numbers are numbers that are &quot;infinite&quot; in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers. These include the transfinite cardinals, which are cardinal numbers used to quantify the size of infinite sets, and the transfinite ordinals, which are ordinal numbers used to provide an ordering of infinite sets. The term &quot;transfinite&quot; was coined in 1895 by Georg Cantor, who wished to avoid some of the implications of the word &quot;infinite&quot; in connection with these objects, which were, nevertheless, not &quot;finite&quot;. Few contemporary writers share these qualms; it is now accepted usage to refer to transfinite cardinals and ordinals as &quot;infinite numbers&quot;. Nevertheless, the term &quot;transfinite&quot; also remains in use.

Notable work on transfinite numbers was done by Wacław Sierpiński: &quot;Leçons sur les nombres transfinis&quot; (1928 book) much expanded into &quot;Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers&quot; (1958, 2nd ed. 1965).

==Definition==
Any finite natural number can be used in at least two ways: as an ordinal and as a cardinal. Cardinal numbers specify the size of sets (e.g., a bag of marbles), whereas ordinal numbers specify the order of a member within an ordered set (e.g., &quot;the man from the left&quot; or &quot;the day of January&quot;). When extended to transfinite numbers, these two concepts are no longer in one-to-one correspondence. A transfinite cardinal number is used to describe the size of an infinitely large set, while a transfinite ordinal is used to describe the location within an infinitely large set that is ordered. The most notable ordinal and cardinal numbers are, respectively:

*formula_1 (Omega): the lowest transfinite ordinal number. It is also the order type of the natural numbers under their usual linear ordering.
*formula_2 (Aleph-null): the first transfinite cardinal number. It is also the cardinality of the natural numbers. If the axiom of choice holds, the next higher cardinal number is aleph-one, formula_3 If not, there may be other cardinals which are incomparable with aleph-one and larger than aleph-null. Either way, there are no cardinals between aleph-null and aleph-one.

The continuum hypothesis is the proposition that there are no intermediate cardinal numbers between formula_4 and the cardinality of the continuum (the cardinality of the set of real numbers): or equivalently that formula_5 is the cardinality of the set of real numbers. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, neither the continuum hypothesis nor its negation can be proved.

Some authors, including P. Suppes and J. Rubin, use the term &quot;transfinite cardinal&quot; to refer to the cardinality of a Dedekind-infinite set in contexts where this may not be equivalent to &quot;infinite cardinal&quot;; that is, in contexts where the axiom of countable choice is not assumed or is not known to hold. Given this definition, the following are all equivalent:
* formula_6 is a transfinite cardinal. That is, there is a Dedekind infinite set formula_7 such that the cardinality of &quot;formula_7&quot; is formula_9
* formula_10
* formula_11
* There is a cardinal formula_12 such that formula_13

Although transfinite ordinals and cardinals both generalize only the natural numbers, other systems of numbers, including the hyperreal numbers and surreal numbers, provide generalizations of the real numbers.

==Examples==
In Cantor&#x27;s theory of ordinal numbers, every integer number must have a successor. The next integer after all the regular ones, that is the first infinite integer, is named formula_1. In this context, formula_15 is larger than formula_1, and formula_17, formula_18 and formula_19 are larger still. Arithmetic expressions containing formula_1 specify an ordinal number, and can be thought of as the set of all integers up to that number. A given number generally has multiple expressions that represent it, however, there is a unique Cantor normal form that represents it, essentially a finite sequence of digits that give coefficients of descending powers of formula_1.

Not all infinite integers can be represented by a Cantor normal form however, and the first one that cannot is given by the limit formula_22 and is termed formula_23. formula_23 is the smallest solution to formula_25, and the following solutions formula_26 give larger ordinals still, and can be followed until one reaches the limit formula_27, which is the first solution to formula_28. This means that in order to be able to specify all transfinite integers, one must think up an infinite sequence of names: because if one were to specify a single largest integer, one would then always be able to mention its larger successor. But as noted by Cantor, even this only allows one to reach the lowest class of transfinite numbers: those whose size of sets correspond to the cardinal number formula_29.

<doc id="189738" wikidata="Q573484" url="?curid=189738" title="Rocksteady">
<text>Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was the dominant style of music in Jamaica for nearly two years, performed by many of the artists who helped establish reggae, including harmony groups such as the Techniques, the Paragons, the Heptones and the Gaylads; soulful singers such as Alton Ellis, Delroy Wilson, Bob Andy, Ken Boothe and Phyllis Dillon; musicians such as Jackie Mittoo, Lynn Taitt and Tommy McCook. The term &quot;rocksteady&quot; comes from a popular (slower) dance style mentioned in the Alton Ellis song &quot;Rocksteady&quot;, that matched the new sound. Some rocksteady songs became hits outside Jamaica, as with ska, helping to secure the international base reggae music has today.

==Characteristics==

The Jamaican musicians and producers who developed rocksteady had grown up learning and playing jazz and had played through ska. In a similar way to what happened at Motown, the musicians responsible for playing this new sound would go to a jazz club after work.

Other influences were: most notably, American rhythm and blues - Fats Domino, Louis Jordan and many others - mento, Calypso music and African Drumming feature, too. By the time rocksteady came around American Soul music was strong and that had an influence as well. 

The tempo became slower with the development of rocksteady than it had been in ska. The guitar and piano players began to experiment with occasional accents around the basic offbeat pattern.

The slowing that occurred with rocksteady allowed bass players to explore more fat, dark, loose, slow tones than ska bass. The slower tempo and smaller band-sizes in turn led to a much larger focus on the bass line in general, which eventually became one of the recognizable characteristics of Jamaican music. In rocksteady, the lead guitar often doubles the bass line, in the muted picking style created by Lynn Taitt (as on &quot;Run for Cover&quot; by Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry).

==Lyrics==
Due in part to the heavy borrowing from US soul songs, many rocksteady songs are love songs; e.g. &quot;Sharing You&quot; by Prince Buster, which is a cover of a soul singer Mitty Collier&#x27;s original, and &quot;Queen Majesty&quot; by the Techniques, which is a cover of &quot;Minstrel and Queen&quot; by the Impressions.

There are rocksteady songs about religion and the Rastafari movement, though not to the same extent as in reggae. Rocksteady coincided with the rise of rude boys and some rocksteady songs reflect this (usually negatively) such as &quot;Rude Boy Gone A Jail&quot; by the Clarendonians and, most famously, &quot;Judge Dread&quot; by Prince Buster.

Alton Ellis was anti-rudie, and Alton Ellis and the Flames&#x27; &quot;Cry Tough&quot;, released before the term rocksteady was in vogue, urged Jamaicans in the ghettos to stay tough through the hard times.

==History==
As a popular musical style, rocksteady was short-lived - the genre&#x27;s heyday only lasted about two years, from around summer 1966 until spring 1968. However, its influence can still be heard in rhythms used today.

Also, in the middle to later part of the decade, as ska began to fade in popularity and the optimism that accompanied Independence in 1962 dwindled, young people from the Jamaican countryside were flooding into the urban ghettos of Kingston—in neighborhoods such as Riverton City, Greenwich Town and Trenchtown. Many of them became delinquents who exuded a certain coolness and style. These unruly youths became known as rude boys.

Alton Ellis is sometimes said to be the father of rocksteady for his hit &quot;Rocksteady&quot;; however, other candidates for the first rocksteady single include &quot;Take It Easy&quot; by Hopeton Lewis, &quot;Tougher Than Tough&quot; by Derrick Morgan and &quot;Hold Them&quot; by Roy Shirley. 

One account of rocksteady&#x27;s inception comes from the film &quot;Studio One Drummie and the history of rocksteady music&quot;: rock steady music started at Studio One in 1966 because when Joe Isaacs at age 15 replaced Skatalites drummer Lloyd Knibbs, Isaacs could not play drums fast enough to keep up with the pace of ska - music director Jackie Mittoo (The Mozart of Jamaica), slowed down the tempo. 

Another account comes from a Jamaican radio interview, pianist Gladstone Anderson said that bandleader Lynn Taitt made a suggestion to slow the music down whilst recording &quot;Take It Easy&quot;. Taitt backed this up in a 2002 interview, stating: &quot;I told &#x27;Gladdy to slow the tempo and that&#x27;s how Take It Easy and rocksteady came about. Rocksteady is really slow ska.&quot;

Rocksteady&#x27;s dominance meant that all record labels of the time released music in the genre; Studio One, Treasure Isle, Bunny Lee and Prince Buster were predominant. 

The record producer Duke Reid released Alton Ellis&#x27; &quot;Girl I&#x27;ve Got a Date&quot; on his Treasure Isle label, as well as recordings by the Techniques, the Silvertones, the Jamaicans and the Paragons. Reid&#x27;s work with these groups helped establish the vocal sound of rocksteady. Some would consider the rocksteady years to be Treasure Isle&#x27;s best. 

Notable solo artists include Delroy Wilson, Ken Boothe and Phyllis Dillon (known as the &quot;Queen of Rocksteady&quot;). Other musicians who were crucial in creating rocksteady included keyboard player Jackie Mittoo, drummers Joe Isaacs and Winston Grennan, bassist Jackie Jackson and saxophonist Tommy McCook. When ska band the Skatalites disbanded (64/65—accounts vary) McCook went to work at the Treasure Isle label and Jackie Mittoo went to the Studio One label—these two artists/arrangers became instrumental in the way these two labels became dominant and helped to form the sound of Rocksteady.

Despite its short lifespan, rocksteady&#x27;s influence is great. Many reggae artists began in rocksteady (and/or ska)—most commonly reggae singers grew out of rocksteady groups, e.g., Junior Byles came from the Versatiles, John Holt was in the Paragons, both Pat Kelly and Slim Smith sang with the Techniques (Pat Kelly sings lead on &quot;You Don&#x27;t Care&quot;) and Ronnie Davis was in the Tennors while Winston Jarrett was in the Righteous Flames. The Wailing Wailers were similarly a vocal harmony trio (modelled on the Impressions) who came from ska, through rocksteady and became a reggae band with just the one main vocalist.

Derrick Harriott noted, &quot;Ask any Jamaican musician and they&#x27;ll tell you the rocksteady days were the best days of Jamaican music.&quot;

==Transformation into reggae==
Several factors contributed to the evolution of rocksteady into reggae in the late 1960s. The emigration to Canada of key musical arrangers Jackie Mittoo and Lynn Taitt—and the upgrading of Jamaican studio technology—had a marked effect on the sound and style of the recordings. Bass patterns became more complex and increasingly dominated the arrangements, and the piano gave way to the electric organ. Other developments included horns fading farther into the background; the introduction of a scratchier, more percussive rhythm guitar; the addition of African-style hand drumming, and a more precise, intricate and aggressive drumming style.

Also around this time (1969–70) the use of a vocal-free or lead instrument-free dub or B-side &quot;version&quot; became popular in Jamaica; at the beginning this involved the use of rocksteady tracks, most notably with U-Roy deejaying over Treasure Isle rhythms (made by a young Osbourne Ruddock, later known as King Tubby, beginning with &quot;Wake the Town&quot;). Indeed, this collaboration provided rocksteady with an afterlife as U-Roy rocksteady-based songs rode high in the charts (1970–71), even as reggae began to establish itself as the new sound.

By the late 1960s, the Rastafari movement became more popular in Jamaica and rocksteady became less popular. Many reggae songs became focused less on romance and more on black consciousness, politics and protest. The release of the 1972 film &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; and the rise of Jamaican superstar Bob Marley brought reggae to an international level that rocksteady never reached.

Although rocksteady was a short-lived phase of Jamaican popular music, its influence on what came after: reggae, dub and dancehall is significant. Many bass lines originally created for rocksteady songs continue to be used in contemporary Jamaican music. Such as the rhythm from &quot;Never Let Go&quot; by Slim Smith (sometimes known as the &#x27;answer rhythm&#x27;) and &quot;Real Rock&quot; both from the Studio One label; &quot;My Conversation&quot; also sung by Slim Smith, produced by Bunny Lee; &quot;Queen Majesty&quot; sung by the Techniques and &quot;Lonely Street&quot; by the Conquerors, both for Treasure Isle label.

<text>Kardecist spiritism, also known as Spiritism or Kardecism, is a reincarnationist and spiritualist doctrine established in France in the mid-19th century by writer and educator Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (known by his pen name Allan Kardec). Kardec considered his doctrine to derive from a Christian perspective. He described a cycle by which a spirit supposedly returns to material existence after the death of the body in which it had dwelled, as well as the evolution it undergoes during this process. Kardecism emerged as a new religious movement in tandem with spiritualism. The notions and practices associated with spiritual communication have been disseminated throughout North America and Europe since the 1850s.

Kardec coined the term &quot;spiritism&quot; in 1857 and defined it as &quot;the doctrine founded on the existence, manifestations, and teachings of spirits&quot;. Kardec claimed that spiritism combines scientific, philosophical, and religious aspects of the tangible universe and what he described as the universe beyond transcendence. After observing table-turning, a kind of seance, he was intrigued that the tables seemed to move despite lacking muscles and that the tables seemed to provide answers without having a brain, the spiritualist claims being &quot;It is not the table that thinks! It is us, the souls of the men who have lived on Earth.&quot; Kardec also focused his attention on a variety of other paranormal claims such as &quot;incorporation&quot; and mediumship.

Kardecist doctrine is based on five basic works, known together as the Spiritist Codification, published between 1857 and 1868. The codification consists of &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot;, &quot;The Mediums&#x27; Book&quot;, &quot;The Gospel According to Spiritism&quot;, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, and &quot;The Genesis&quot;. Additionally, there are the so-called complementary works, such as &quot;What is Spiritism?&quot;, &quot;Spiritist Review&quot;, and &quot;Posthumous Works&quot;. Its followers consider spiritism a doctrine focused on the moral improvement of humanity and believe in the existence of a single God, the possibility of useful communication with spirits through mediums, and reincarnation as a process of spiritual growth and divine justice.

According to the International Spiritist Council, spiritism is present in 36 countries, with over 13 million followers, being most widespread in Brazil, where it has approximately 3.8 million followers, according to the data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, and over 30 million sympathizers, according to the Brazilian Spiritist Federation. Spiritists are also known for influencing and promoting a movement of social assistance and philanthropy. The doctrine was influenced by utopian socialism, mesmerism and positivism and had a strong influence on various other religious currents, such as Santería, Umbanda, and the New Age movements.

== Allan Kardec ==

Kardec studied with Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi at Yverdon Castle. 

== Definition ==
The term &quot;spiritisme&quot; was created by the French educator Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (known as Allan Kardec) to refer to his ideas in &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot; (1857).
However, the use of the term, whose root is common to various Western nations of Latin origin or Anglo-Saxon, quickly led to its incorporation into everyday usage to designate everything related to the alleged communication with spirits. Thus, today the term &quot;spiritism&quot; refers to various religious and philosophical doctrines that assert the survival of spirits after the death of the body, and primarily in the possibility of communicating with them, either casually or deliberately, through evocations or spontaneously.

The term &quot;Kardecism&quot; is criticized by some followers of the doctrine who reserve the word &quot;spiritism&quot; solely for the doctrine as codified by Kardec, affirming that there are no different branches within &quot;spiritism&quot;, and they refer to believers of various currents as &quot;spiritualists&quot;. These followers believe that spiritism, as a doctrinal body, is singular, making the use of the term &quot;Kardecist spiritism&quot; redundant. Thus, those who adhere to the teachings codified by Kardec in the basic works (with varying degrees of tolerance for concepts that are not strictly doctrinal, such as apometry) simply identify themselves as &quot;spiritists&quot;, without the addition of &quot;Kardecist&quot;. However, another portion of followers considers the use of the term &quot;Kardecism&quot; appropriate.

The term &quot;Kardecist spiritism&quot; emerged from the need of some to distinguish spiritism (as originally defined by Kardec) from Afro-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda. The latter, discriminated against and persecuted at various times in Brazilian history, began to identify themselves as spiritists (at one point with the support of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation), in an effort to legitimize and consolidate the religious movement, due to the existing proximity between certain concepts and practices of it and Kardec&#x27;s spiritism.

There is no consensus among Spiritists as to whether Spiritism is a religion or not, despite the doctrine being classified as a religion in demographic surveys. This is due to the triple aspect of Spiritism, which allows it to be classified as a doctrine that aligns &quot;science-philosophy-religion&quot;. In the preamble of the book &quot;O Que É o Espiritismo?&quot; (What is Spiritism?), Kardec states that &quot;Spiritism is, at the same time, a science of observation and a philosophical doctrine. As a practical science, it consists of the relations established between us and the Spirits; as a philosophy, it encompasses all the moral consequences that emanate from these same relations.&quot; Some still contest the religious aspect of Spiritism; however, in the book published by its codifier, titled &quot;O Espiritismo na sua mais simples expressão&quot; (Spiritism in its simplest expression), he clearly asserts: &quot;From a religious point of view, Spiritism is based on the fundamental truths of all religions: God, the soul, immortality, rewards and punishments in the afterlife, but it is independent of any particular cult. Its goal is to prove to those who deny or doubt that the soul exists, that it survives the body, and that it experiences, after death, the consequences of the good and evil deeds committed during corporeal life: the goal of all religions.&quot; Kardec also clarifies that Spiritism is a religion in the Opening Address of the Annual Commemorative Session of the Day of the Dead (Society of Paris, November 1, 1868), where he states:

At the International Spiritist Congress held in Paris in 1925, there was a proposal to remove the religious aspect from Spiritism, but the important French Spiritist philosopher Léon Denis opposed it with tenacity, even in his already weak physical condition of health. According to Denis, Spiritism was not the &quot;religion of the future&quot; but rather the &quot;future of religions&quot;.

On the other hand, the Spiritist Doctrine affirms respect for all religions and doctrines, values all efforts for the practice of good, and claims to work for fraternity and peace among all peoples and all men, although it firmly rejects, it must be reiterated, fundamental dogmas of other monotheistic religions. In the case of Christianity, the fundamental dogmas that stand out are the divinity of Christ, the Holy Trinity, salvation or justification by grace (more than by individual works or efforts), and the existence and importance of the Church as a spiritual entity, not just human.

Kardec&#x27;s main intention as a Spiritist was to provide some support to human spirituality at a time when science was advancing rapidly and religions were losing followers. Kardec believed he had found a new way of thinking about reality that would bring together, in a balanced way, the rising science and the declining religion. He analyzed accounts of numerous mediumistic occurrences spread throughout Europe and the United States, unifying the information he interpreted in order to codify this type of practice and the teachings transmitted.

== History ==
=== Early observations ===
Followers of the Spiritist doctrine believe that mediumistic phenomena is universal and has always existed. Spiritists cite biblical mediumistic examples, such as Moses&#x27; prohibition of &quot;consulting the dead&quot; as evidence of the Jewish belief in this possibility; the consultation of Saul with the Witch of Endor, who sees and hears the disembodied spirit of Samuel; and the communication of Jesus with Moses and Elijah on Mount Tabor in the Transfiguration of Jesus ().

During the 19th century, there was increased attention towards manifestations of mediumship in the United States and Europe. These manifestations consisted mainly of strange noises, knocks on furniture, and objects that moved or floated without any apparent cause, as in the case of &quot;table-turning&quot;. The supposed case of the Fox sisters in the United States stood out in the late 1840s. Many Spiritists mark March 31, 1848 (the beginning of the mediumistic events at the residence of the Fox sisters in Hydesville, US) as the initial milestone of modern mediumistic manifestations, allegedly more ostensive and frequent than ever before, which led to greater interest in mediumistic phenomena.

=== Table-turning ===

The first manifestations of table-turning observed by Kardec involved tables lifting and knocking, using one of their legs, a determined number of knocks to respond &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; as agreed upon, to a proposed question. Kardec felt skeptics would believe table turning to be caused by electricity, whose properties were little known to the science of that time. He thus employed methods to obtain more elaborate responses through the letters of the alphabet: the table knocking a certain number of times would correspond to the sequential number of each letter, thus forming words and sentences in response to the proposed questions, as he believed that the precision of the answers and their correlation with the questions could not be attributed to chance. The mysterious being who responded in this way, when questioned about its nature, declared that it was a &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;genius&quot;, gave its name, and provided information about itself. Eventually, the phenomenon decreased in popularity and became anecdotal. 

Kardec questioned the possibility of a muscular hypothesis (such as the ideomotor effect) being the cause of all the alleged movements and messages of the table-turning or other mechanical productions. However, Michael Faraday&#x27;s scientific experiments, published in 1853, showed that the movements involved in table-turning were caused by the ideomotor effect. The ideomotor effect also causes the movements observed in the so-called ouija board and the &quot;cup game&quot;, in which participants involuntarily move markers over letters and numbers and also attribute the movements to supposed &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;geniuses&quot;. 

Victor Hugo, during his exile on the island of Jersey (1851–1855), participated in numerous table-turning sessions with his friend Auguste Vacquerie and came to believe that he had made contact with deceased spirits, including his late daughter Léopoldine and great writers such as Shakespeare, Dante, Racine, and Molière. Hugo converted to spiritualism, and in 1867 called for science to pay attention to and take seriously the phenomena of table-turning.

== Beliefs ==

=== Principles ===
Founded on April 18, 1857, with the publication of &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot;, Spiritism was structured based on alleged dialogues established with disembodied spirits that, by manifesting through mediums, expounded on scientific, religious, and philosophical topics from the perspective of Christian morality, that is, with the principle of love for one&#x27;s neighbor, bringing to light new perspectives on various subjects of great philosophical and theological relevance. Thus, one of the basic precepts of Spiritism was established, which is the importance of charity, (Motto: &quot;Outside of charity, there is no salvation&quot;), understood as benevolence towards all, indulgence towards the imperfections of others, and forgiveness of offenses.

The Spiritist doctrine aims to establish a dialogue between science, philosophy, and religion, with the goal of obtaining an original form that is both more comprehensive and profound, in order to better understand reality. Kardec synthesizes the concept with the famous phrase: &quot;Unshakable faith is only the one that can confront reason face to face in all epochs of humanity.&quot;

According to the Spiritist philosopher Herculano Pires, &quot;Spiritist Philosophy, as Kardec said, generically belongs to what we usually call Spiritualist Philosophy because its view of the Universe is not limited to Matter but extends to Spirit, which it considers as the cause of everything we perceive in the material plane. Embracing in its cosmological interpretation Spiritist Science and resulting in Spiritist Religion, Spiritist Philosophy encompasses the entire doctrine.&quot;

==== Foundational principles ====

The Spiritist doctrine, in general, is based on the following principles:
* Existence and unity of God, rejecting the dogma of the Holy Trinity (As stated in the first question of &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot; - &quot;God is the supreme intelligence, the primary cause of all things.&quot;);
* The universe is God&#x27;s creation, including all rational beings (Jesus, for example) and irrational, animated and inanimate, material and immaterial, which, in turn, are all destined for the law of progress;
* Existence and immortality of the spirit, understood as an intelligent individuality of divine creation that acts on matter through a &quot;semimaterial&quot; connection called perispirit, and, like the spirit, is indestructible;
* Spirit&#x27;s return to matter (reincarnation), as many times as necessary, as the natural mechanism to achieve material and moral improvement. However, for the doctrine, the perfection that humanity is capable of achieving is relative, as only God possesses absolute perfection, infinite in all things. Spiritists reject belief in &quot;metempsychosis&quot;;
* Concept of the &quot;equal creation&quot; of all spirits, &quot;simple and ignorant&quot; in their origin, and invariably destined for perfection, with identical aptitudes for good or evil, given free will;
* Possibility of communication between incarnate (living) spirits and discarnate (dead) spirits, through mediumship (also known as communicability of spirits). This communication is carried out with the assistance of individuals with certain abilities - mediums - for example, via automatic writing (psychography);
* Law of cause and effect, understood as a mechanism of universal ethical retribution for all spirits, according to which one&#x27;s current condition is the result of one&#x27;s past actions, and one&#x27;s thoughts, words, and actions construct one&#x27;s future on a daily basis (&quot;One who sows good reaps good. One who sows evil reaps evil&quot;);
* Plurality of inhabited material worlds: Earth is not the only planet with intelligent life in the universe, and reincarnation on other planets is possible;
* Jesus, created by God, is the guide and model for all of humanity. According to Spiritism, Christian morality contained in the canonical gospels is the greatest ethical-moral guide that mankind possesses, and its practice is the solution to all human problems and the objective to be attained by humanity.
* Outside of charity, there is no salvation. According to Spiritism, charity consists of benevolence towards all, indulgence towards the imperfections of others, and forgiveness of offenses.

Additionally, secondary characteristics can be mentioned:
* The notion of individual responsibility&#x27;s continuity throughout the spirit&#x27;s existence;
* Progressiveness of the spiritual principle within the evolutionary process at all levels of nature;
* Total absence of a priestly hierarchy;
* Selflessness in the practice of good, meaning that one should not demand payment for charitable acts, nor should one do them with ulterior motives. All Spiritist practice is free, as guided by the moral principle of the gospel: &quot;Freely you have received; freely give&quot;;
* Use of specific terminology and concepts, such as perispirit, mediumship, and Spiritist center;
* Complete absence of exorcism, formulas, sacramental words, horoscopes, cartomancy, pyramids, crystals, amulets, talismans, worship or offering to images or altars, dances, processions, or similar acts, vestments, andors, alcoholic or hallucinogenic beverages, incense, and smoke, external practices, or any material signs;
* Absence of institutionalized rituals, such as baptism, worship, or ceremony to officiate marriage;
* Encouragement of respect for all religions and opinions;
* Having reasoned faith, rejecting blind faith that does not employ logical reasoning in its beliefs.

=== Symbolism ===
Spiritism does not have an official symbol and prioritizes a denotative language. However, the vine branch depicted in &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot; – the only engraving used by Kardec in the Spiritist Codification – is considered by the doctrine as the perfect metaphorical image of the relationship between the spirit and the human body, due to this passage:

=== Works ===

==== Basic works ====

&quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot; was published in 1857 and contains the fundamental principles of Spiritist Doctrine. &quot;The Mediums&#x27; Book&quot;, or &quot;Guide for Mediums and Invokers&quot;, was published in 1861 and discusses the experimental and investigative nature of Spiritism, seen as a theoretical and methodological tool to understand a &quot;new order of phenomena&quot; that had never been considered by scientific knowledge: the so-called spiritist or mediumistic phenomena, which were believed to be caused by the intervention of spirits in physical reality.

&quot;The Gospel According to Spiritism&quot;, published in 1864, evaluates the canonical gospels from the perspective of Spiritist Doctrine, addressing the application of Christian moral principles and religious matters such as the practice of worship, prayer, and charity with special attention.

&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, or &quot;Divine Justice According to Spiritism&quot;, was published in 1865 and consists of two parts: in the first part, Kardec critically examines philosophical contradictions and inconsistencies with scientific knowledge, which he believes can be overcome through Spiritist paradigm of reasoned faith. Topics covered include: causes of the fear of death, why Spiritists do not fear death, heaven, the Christian hell imitated from the pagan one, limbo, purgatory, doctrine of eternal punishments, penal code of the afterlife, angels, the origin of the belief in demons. The second part contains dozens of dialogues that purportedly took place between Kardec and various spirits, in which they recount their impressions from the afterlife.

&quot;The Genesis According to Spiritism&quot;, published in 1868, addresses various philosophical and scientific questions, such as the creation of the universe, the formation of worlds, the emergence of the spirit, and the nature of so-called miracles, according to the Spiritist paradigm of understanding reality.

==== Complementary works ====

&quot;What Is Spiritism?&quot;, published in 1859, is an introductory and didactic work on Spiritism.

The periodical &quot;Revue Spirite&quot; (&quot;Spiritist Review&quot;), was founded by Kardec in January 1858 and directed by him until his death in 1869. It is published quarterly by the International Spiritist Council and is translated into multiple languages.

In January 1890, the directors of the Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies released Kardec&#x27;s unpublished works as &quot;Posthumous Works.&quot;

&quot;Sic Cogito&quot; (1892) by B.P. Hașdeu is a theoretical work about spiritism as a philosophy.

== Spiritism and science ==
===Qualification of Spiritism as a science===
Alexander Moreira de Almeida still attempts this legitimation, even calling Kardec&#x27;s approach &quot;revolutionary.&quot; However, the current scientific consensus considers parapsychology a pseudoscience, disregarding the alleged paranormal phenomena that underpin spiritism, such as mediumship, reincarnation, obsession, table-turning, séances, automatic writing, spiritualist art, and typology. Critics of pseudoscience even define parapsychology as a &quot;perversion&quot;, as parapsychologists claim that science cannot be the only privileged field that is exempt from the explanations they defend. Animal magnetism (mesmerism) is also present in spiritist teachings, with constant references to mesmeric concepts such as magnetic fluids. According to this hypothesis, some people could perform healings through &quot;fluids&quot;. However, the animal magnetism hypothesis is considered pseudoscientific, as scientists have known since the second half of the 18th century that the alleged healings were purely psychosomatic, achieved through hypnosis, without any involvement of &quot;fluids&quot; or animal magnetism.

According to Joseph McCabe, citing the claims of Arthur Conan Doyle about scientists confirming the alleged spiritual phenomena for 30 years, the mediums deceived the researchers. He considers that these deceptions led to the arrogant language of spiritualist literature.

An article published in the British skeptical magazine &quot;The Skeptic&quot; also criticizes Spiritism for its association with ufology, parapsychology, animal magnetism, and other pseudosciences.

=== Scientific method and &quot;spiritual science&quot; ===
The scientific investigation of the facts and causes of alleged mediumistic phenomena is the subject of intense study, mainly within the pseudoscience of parapsychology. Scientific investigations on mediumship and other &quot;spiritual phenomena&quot; advocated by Spiritism have taken place even within the academic setting. Although many scientists have claimed to have provided evidence for the existence of such phenomena in their research through the scientific method, the existence of spirits is neither established nor proven.

Mediumship has been studied by scientists and scholars for more than a century. Many scientists and intellectuals have dedicated themselves to investigations of mediumship and its implications for the mind–body relationship, including: Kardec, Alfred Russel Wallace,B.P. Hașdeu, Alexandre Aksakof, Cesare Lombroso, Camille Flammarion, Carl Jung, Charles Richet, Gabriel Delanne, Frederic Myers, Hans Eysenck, Henri Bergson, Ian Stevenson, J. J. Thomson, J. B. Rhine, James H. Hyslop, Johann K. F. Zöllner, Lord Rayleigh, Marie Curie, Oliver Lodge, Pierre Curie, Pierre Janet, Théodore Flournoy, William Crookes, William James, and William McDougall.

=== Medicine ===

The relationship between Spiritism itself and medicine is profound, as evidenced by its presence in many spiritist books and the existence of the International Spiritist Medical Association, which brings together medical-spiritist associations from various countries. Spiritism constitutes a vast international movement of charity and healthcare institutions, as evidenced mainly by the existence of such associations, numerous hospitals and spiritist centers, and a notable promotion of psychiatry and homeopathy.

Dr. Adolfo Bezerra de Menezes, a spiritist and physician, wrote the classic book &quot;A Loucura sob Novo Prisma&quot; (Insanity from a New Perspective), seeking to relate the issue of mental disorders to Spiritism and promote the application of more effective treatment methods in the field of mental health.

Currently, psychiatrist and parapsychologist Alexander Moreira-Almeida, coordinator of the &quot;Section on Spirituality, Religiosity, and Psychiatry&quot; of the World Psychiatric Association, is one of the leading figures in the scientific study of the relationship between health and spiritual experiences, especially mediumship.

== Spiriticism and other religions ==
=== Qualification of Spiritism as Christian ===
Kardec taught that &quot;the teaching of the Spirits is eminently Christian.&quot; In &quot;Posthumous Works&quot;, it is stated that Spiritism is &quot;the only truly Christian tradition.&quot; Spiritist writers such as José Reis Chaves and Severino Celestino da Silva also claim that reincarnation was part of early Christianity until it was condemned by the Second Council of Constantinople. This controversial thesis was popularized even earlier by Leslie Weatherhead but has also been questioned based on statements from the Church Fathers and the lack of references to reincarnation during that Council. Agnostic scholar Bart D. Ehrman claims that evidence that early Christians believed in reincarnation is scant. Christian theologian Norman Geisler claims that there is no evidence of reincarnation in the Bible. According to him, the text in John 9:2–3 reflects the rabbinic belief in prenatal sins, according to which a fetus could commit sin before birth, but not in a previous incarnation. He also dismisses other texts generally cited in support of reincarnation.

The qualification of Spiritism itself as Christian has also generated controversy. Dr. Antônio Flávio Pierucci, professor at the Department of Sociology at the University of São Paulo (USP) and scholar of Brazilian religiosity, is one of those who affirm that Spiritism is &quot;not a Christian religion.&quot; There are no historical Christian doctrines within Spiritism, present in its main branches, such as the Trinity, the physical resurrection of Jesus, the inspiration of the Bible, and redemption. Due to these differences, many scholars consider it a form of neo-Christianity. However, Spiritist writers argue that Spiritism is Christian because it promotes the teaching of loving one&#x27;s neighbor.

=== Christianity ===


The Spiritist doctrine adopts Christian morality despite its differentiated theological conceptions. According to Spiritists, the name given to the followers of Spiritism, Jesus Christ is the most elevated spirit to have ever incarnated on Earth.

Spiritists (a widely used translation during the early decades of the 20th century for the French neologism &quot;spirite&quot;) consider themselves Christians and attribute to Spiritist doctrine the character of a Christian doctrine since they consider themselves followers of the moral teachings of Jesus. Spiritists base their defense of the Christian character of Spiritist doctrine on the fact that Allan Kardec argued that Christian morality, free from the dogmas of faith associated with it, would be the closest thing to a divine and rational code of ethics that humans possess. Spiritists argue that the dogmas were elaborated over the centuries by the Catholic Church and therefore it is not necessary to follow them to be a Christian. Furthermore, item 625 of &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot; states that Jesus is the greatest moral example available to humanity, although Spiritism denies any genuinely divine nature to him.

==== Sermon on the Mount ====
The Beatitudes are nine teachings that Jesus delivered in the Sermon on the Mount, according to the New Testament (). For Spiritism, these teachings are of great importance, and they will now be presented from the Spiritist perspective.

. According to Spiritism, Jesus promises the kingdom of heaven to the simple and humble, referring to the moral qualities of the individual.

. According to Spiritism, only in the afterlife can the compensations that Jesus promises to the afflicted on Earth be fulfilled. Faith in the future can console and instill patience in the spirit that endures the various terrestrial anomalies with calmness and resignation. However, it does not justify the causes of the diversity of evils, inequalities between vice and virtue, deformities, and natural disasters. The vicissitudes of life can be divided into two parts according to the Spiritist perspective: some have their explanations in the present life, while others are found outside of this life. This latter cause, in the Spiritist view, is explained by the plurality of existences in which the incarnated spirit pays for the evils it has committed in previous lives.

The purity of the heart resembles the principle of simplicity and humility, excluding all ideas of pride and selfishness. According to Spiritism, the emblem of purity that Jesus takes in relation to children should not be taken literally, &quot;Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, &#x27;Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it&#x27;&quot; (Mark 10:13-15). The spirit of the child, not yet able to manifest its tendencies towards evil, represents momentarily the image of innocence and purity resembling pure spirits. However, the actions [good or bad] taken by the spirit before incarnating gradually reflect in its behavior as an incarnated spirit. Therefore, as the incarnated spirit develops its physical structure, it also develops its psychic structure, which exhibits behavioral characteristics corresponding to the real conduct of the spirit itself.

. According to Spiritism, Jesus makes meekness, moderation, gentleness, affability, and patience a law.

Mercy consists of forgiving offenses, and for Spiritism, the sacrifice that pleases God the most is reconciliation with adversaries, as stated in Matthew 5:23-24.

According to Spiritism, all Christian morality is summarized in this axiom:

== Organizations ==
=== Brazilian Spiritist Federation ===
The Brazilian Spiritist Federation is a public utility entity founded on January 2, 1884, in Rio de Janeiro. It is a civil, religious, educational, cultural, and philanthropic society whose purpose is the study, practice, and dissemination of Spiritism in all its aspects, based on the works of Allan Kardec&#x27;s Codification and the canonical Gospels.

=== International Spiritist Council ===

The International Spiritist Council (ISC) is an organization resulting from the union of representative associations of national Spiritist movements and currently has 35 associated countries. It was constituted on November 28, 1992, in Madrid, Spain. Its objectives are the promotion of fraternal union among Spiritist institutions in all countries and the unification of the worldwide Spiritist movement; the promotion of the study and dissemination of Spiritist Doctrine in its three basic aspects: scientific, philosophical, and religious; and the promotion of the practice of material and moral charity as taught by Spiritist Doctrine. The main event organized by the ISC is the World Spiritist Congress, held every three years.

=== Pan-American Spiritist Confederation ===

The Pan-American Spiritist Confederation, founded on October 5, 1946, in Argentina, is an international institution that mainly brings together Spiritists from Latin America. CEPA has adherent and affiliated institutions in various countries and defends a secular view of Spiritism. The organization takes controversial positions among Spiritists, such as the dissociation between the doctrine and Christianity and the need to update Spiritism in light of science. Since October 13, 2000, the headquarters of CEPA has been in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. CEPA&#x27;s activities in Brazil are primarily carried out through events promoted by adherent institutions, such as the Forum of Free Thinking Spiritists and the Brazilian Symposium on Spiritist Thought.

== Demographics ==
From 1857, the year of the release of &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot;, to 1869, the year of Kardec&#x27;s death, Spiritism gained 7 million followers. According to data from 2005, Spiritism has about 13 million followers worldwide, and according to data from 2010, Brazil – the country with the most followers – has about 3.8 million Spiritists. The International Spiritist Council (CEI) has 36 member countries. Another international Spiritist organization, the Pan American Spiritist Confederation, brings together Spiritist institutions and delegates from 13 countries.

=== Brazil ===

Spiritism arrived in Brazil in 1865 according to the Brazilian Spiritist Federation (FEB), although there are differing opinions on this matter. as reported below:

Through Bezerra de Menezes and Chico Xavier, Spiritism had the opportunity to become popular throughout the country, spreading its teachings across a large part of the Brazilian territory. Brazil is the country with the largest number of Spiritists worldwide. However, in the 19th century, the penal code of 1890 even banned the practice of Spiritism in Brazil and punished those who practiced the &quot;crime&quot; with up to 6 months in prison. Although socially tolerated, especially after the actions of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation (FEB) in the first decades of the 20th century, the practice ceased to be officially prohibited only with the promulgation of the penal code of 1940. The FEB congregates approximately ten thousand Spiritist institutions, spread across all regions of the country. There are also several Brazilian Spiritist associations for specific professions, such as the Brazilian Medical-Spiritist Association, Brazilian Association of Spiritist Psychologists, Brazilian Association of Spiritist Judges, Brazilian Association of Spiritist Artists, and Crusade of Spiritist Military.

According to the Brazilian Census of 2010, Brazil had about 3.8 million Spiritists. The state capitals with the highest percentage of Spiritists are Florianópolis (7.3%), Porto Alegre (7.1%), Rio de Janeiro (5.9%), São Paulo (4.7%), Goiânia (4.3%), Belo Horizonte (4.0%), Campo Grande (3.6%), Recife (3.6%), Brasília (3.5%), and Cuiabá (3.5%). The IBGE considers the terms &quot;kardecism&quot; and &quot;Spiritism&quot; as equivalents in its census classification.

As the third-largest religious group in Brazil, Spiritists also have the highest income and education levels among social segments, according to data from the same Census. Spiritists are strongly associated with acts of charity. They maintain asylums, orphanages, schools for the underprivileged, daycares, and other institutions for assistance and social promotion in all Brazilian states. Allan Kardec is a well-known and respected figure in Brazil. He is the most read French author in the country, with his books selling more than 25 million copies throughout the Brazilian territory. If we count other Spiritist books, all derived from the works of Kardec, the Brazilian Spiritist publishing market surpasses 4,000 titles already published and over 100 million copies sold. The Spiritist theme constitutes the most successful literary market in Brazil, with Spiritist books leading the bestseller lists in the country&#x27;s main bookstores. According to the 2010 census, Spiritism experienced significant growth from 2000 to 2010, with an increase of over 60% in followers, going from 2.3 million to 3.8 million followers, with the majority of them being between 50 and 59 years old (3.1%) and having the highest literacy rate (98.6%), the highest percentage of individuals with a completed university education (31.5%), and income above 5 minimum wages (19.7%), as well as the lowest percentage of individuals with no education (1.8%) and with incomplete primary education (15.0%).

=== Cuba ===
After the legalization of religion in Cuba, there was a revival of Spiritism, which had been present in the Caribbean country since the 19th century. According to data from the Ministry of Religions, in 2011, there were 400 Spiritist centers in Cuba, with an additional 200 being registered, making Cuba the second most Spiritist country in the world in terms of the number of centers. The Cuban Medical-Spiritist Association has the highest number of activists in the International Medical-Spiritist Association.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, one of the great pioneers of Spiritism was Luis Francisco Benítez de Lugo y Benítez de Lugo, VIII Marquis of Flórida and X Lord of Algarrobo y Bormujos, who presented a bill for the official teaching of Spiritism, reading it on August 26, 1873.

===Romania===
In Romania and Eastern Europe, one of the great pioneers of Spiritism was B.P. Hașdeu, who wrote Sic Congito in 1892. After the loss of his 18 years old daughter, Iulia Hașdeu he practiced Spiritism to communicate with her in Câmpina at Iulia Hașdeu Castle.

=== Mexico ===
In the decades of 1850–1860, Spiritism reached Mexico, attracting the intellectual elite with its proposals of modernism, anticlerical reform, and liberalism of free thought. General Refugio Indalecio González translated works by Kardec, publishing &quot;El Evangelio Según el Espiritismo&quot; in Spanish in 1872 in Mexico and, under the direction of the Sociedad Espírita Central de la República Mexicana, circulated spiritist magazines. Among others, there was also the initial dissemination by utopian socialist Nicolás Pizarro Suárez. In 1875, attention to Spiritism became heated in Mexico City when, in a positivist reaction after publications in the press, a debate was held between materialist and spiritualist students at the Liceo Hidalgo and Teatro del Conservatorio, considered by Zenia Yébenes Escardó as &quot;the first philosophical controversy that was considered as such in Mexico.&quot; In addition to its academic presence, popular Spiritism emerged, incorporating indigenous practices and local cults, with a strongly present folkloric imagery in the figure of Teresa Urrea, a spiritual healer who was supported by the spiritist Lauro Aguirre. The feminist Laureana Wright, an already renowned writer, converted to Spiritism in 1889 to promote the debate of thought and women&#x27;s equality, inspired by examples of female emancipation that she observed in other countries, and started holding sessions attended by various public figures, later becoming the president of the Sociedad Espírita Central. Spiritist groups emerged in various locations, and after a brief decline at the end of the 19th century, attention on Spiritism intensified in the early 20th century through press coverage after Francisco Madero, who promoted it through works he distributed, organized congresses, and, inspired by allegedly psychographed letters, published a book that promoted the Mexican Revolution, becoming the president of Mexico for a short period until he was assassinated.

== Dissensions ==
=== Roustainguism ===
Since the 19th century, particularly in France and Brazil, there have been conflicts of opinion among Spiritists, mistakenly referred to as &quot;Kardecists,&quot; and the so-called &quot;Roustainguists,&quot; regarding the acceptance or rejection of the postulates of the work &quot;The Four Gospels or Revelation of Revelation&quot;, coordinated by Jean-Baptiste Roustaing, especially concerning the genesis of Jesus&#x27; body and the spiritual fall, which would cause the first incarnation of the spirits that failed. For Spiritists who accept the Kardec-Roustaing duo, Jesus had a &quot;fluidic&quot; body on Earth due to being a pure spirit, and thus, the genesis of that body was by His psychomagnetic will, characterizing Him as an agene.

On the other hand, Spiritists who do not accept the work &quot;The Four Gospels&quot;, coordinated by Roustaing, believe that Jesus had a material body like any other incarnated human being, and its genesis was also similar, through the fusion of sperm and ovum.

Furthermore, Roustaing&#x27;s &quot;The Four Gospels&quot; explains that the spirits who failed due to atheism, pride, and selfishness incarnated in primitive worlds as &quot;fleshy cryptogams&quot; (creeping animals resembling slugs), which represents the doctrine of metempsychosis, not accepted by Spiritism since the doctrine of reincarnation states that the Spirit only reincarnates in the human kingdom (Humanity).

=== Christian rationalism ===
In the Brazilian city of Santos, a dissenting movement within the Spiritist movement emerged in 1910, which called itself &quot;Rational and Scientific Christian Spiritism&quot; and later became known as Christian rationalism, systematized by Luís de Matos and Luís Alves Tomás.

=== Ramatism ===
In Brazil, since the second half of the 1950s, some Spiritist centers have followed the doctrine allegedly dictated by the spirit Ramatis (mainly embodied in the works psychographed by Hercílio Maes). They differ from traditional Spiritist centers due to a greater emphasis on universalism (common origin of religions) and the comparative study of Western and Eastern spiritualist religions and philosophies. It is also notable for a stronger influence of Eastern thought currents (such as Buddhism and Hinduism) and its proximity to the cosmogony of universalist spiritualism.

=== Conscientiology ===
After ending the partnership with medium Chico Xavier in 1968, medium Waldo Vieira began his own research on the phenomenon called &quot;consciential projection&quot; (referred to as &quot;spiritual unfolding&quot; in Spiritism). Consequently, in 1987, he systematized the parascientific movement called &quot;Conscientiology&quot;.

=== Christian Renewal ===
Emerging in Brazil as a dissent within the Spiritist movement since September 2002. While still following Spiritist Doctrine, it claims to do so with greater seriousness than the Brazilian movement itself, which is an argument used for its separation.

== Criticism ==
Kardec&#x27;s introductory book on Spiritism, &quot;What is Spiritism?&quot;, published only two years after &quot;The Spirits&#x27; Book&quot;, includes a hypothetical discussion between him and three idealized critics, &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;The Skeptic&quot;, and &quot;The Priest&quot;, summing up much of the criticism Spiritism has received. The broad areas of criticism relate to charlatanism, pseudoscience, heresy, witchcraft, and Satanism. Until his death, Kardec addressed these issues in various books and his periodical, the &quot;Revue Spirite&quot;.

Later, the Theosophical Society, a competing new religion, saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even naïve.

René Guénon&#x27;s influential book &quot;The Spiritist Fallacy&quot; criticized both the more general concepts of Spiritualism, which he considered to be a superficial mix of moralism and spiritual materialism, as well as Spiritism&#x27;s specific contributions, such as its belief in what he saw as a post-Cartesian, modernist concept of reincarnation distinct from and opposed to its two western predecessors, metempsychosis and transmigration.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraph 2117) states that &quot;&quot;Spiritism&quot; often implies divination or magical practices; the Church, for her part, warns the faithful against it&quot;.

In Brazil, Catholic priests Carlos Kloppenburg and Óscar González-Quevedo, among others, have written extensively against Spiritism from both a doctrinal and parapsychological perspective. Quevedo, in particular, has sought to show that Spiritism&#x27;s claims of being a science are invalid. In addition to writing books on the subject, he has also hosted television programs debunking supposed paranormal phenomena, most recently in a series that ran in 2000 on Globo&#x27;s news program &quot;Fantástico&quot;. Brazilian Spiritist Hernani Guimarães Andrade has, in turn, written rebuttals to these criticisms. 

== In popular culture ==
Spiritism has been the subject of various non-literary works.

=== Soap operas ===
The Brazilian soap opera &quot;Somos Todos Irmãos&quot; (1966), produced by the extinct TV Tupi, was inspired by the spiritist novel &quot;A Vingança do Judeu&quot; psychographed by the Russian medium Vera Kryzhanovskaia. The soap opera &quot;A Viagem&quot; (1975), produced by TV Tupi, was inspired by the spiritist novels &quot;Nosso Lar&quot; and &quot;E a Vida Continua...&quot; psychographed by Chico Xavier, developing a complex plot addressing concepts such as mediumship, death, spiritual obsession, reincarnation, and others. Rede Globo conceived a remake of it in 1994. The soap opera &quot;O Profeta&quot; (1977), produced by the extinct TV Tupi and also with a remake conceived in 2006 by Rede Globo, portrays the main character as a medium capable of predicting the future.

More recently, the productions &quot;Alma Gêmea&quot;, &quot;Escrito nas Estrelas&quot;, &quot;Amor Eterno Amor&quot;, &quot;Além do Tempo&quot;, and &quot;Espelho da Vida&quot; also told stories related to Spiritism.

=== Films ===
The Brazilian film &quot;Joelma 23º Andar&quot; (1979) was based on the work &quot;Somos Seis&quot; psychographed by Chico Xavier and is the first in the country with a spiritist theme, portraying the Joelma Fire tragedy, which left 179 dead and over 300 injured (February 1, 1974). Several other films followed, such as &quot;Bezerra de Menezes - O Diário de um Espírito&quot; (2006, seen by over 500,000 viewers), &quot;Chico Xavier&quot; (2010, seen by about 3.5 million viewers in theaters), &quot;Nosso Lar&quot; (also in 2010, seen by over 4 million viewers in theaters), among others.

<text>Brad J. Cox (May 2, 1944 – January 2, 2021) was an American computer scientist who was known mostly for creating the Objective-C programming language with his business partner Tom Love and for his work in software engineering (specifically software reuse) and software componentry.

==Biography==
Cox received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Organic Chemistry and Mathematics from Furman University,
and his Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematical Biology at the University of Chicago.
Among his first known software projects, he wrote a PDP-8 program for simulating clusters of neurons.
He worked at the National Institutes of Health and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute before moving into the software profession.

Although Cox invented his own programming language, Objective-C, which he used in his early career, he stated in an interview for the &quot;Masterminds of Programming&quot; book that he wasn&#x27;t interested in programming languages but rather in software components, and he regarded languages as mere tools for building and combining parts of software.

Cox was also an entrepreneur, having founded the Stepstone company together with Tom Love, established to release the first Objective-C implementation. Stepstone folded in 1994 and in April 1995, NeXT acquired the Objective-C trademark and rights from Stepstone. At the same time, Stepstone licensed back from NeXT the right to continue selling their Objective-C based products. As Apple Computer acquired NeXT a year later, they now hold the rights to Objective-C. Stepstone appears to have gone out of business in the early 2000s.

<text>Malcolm Douglas McIlroy (born 1932) is an American mathematician, engineer, and programmer. As of 2019 he is an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College.
McIlroy is best known for having originally proposed Unix pipelines and developed several Unix tools, such as echo, spell, diff, sort, join, graph, speak, and tr. He was also one of the pioneering researchers of macro processors and programming language extensibility. He participated in the design of multiple influential programming languages, particularly PL/I, SNOBOL, ALTRAN, TMG and C++.

His seminal work on software componentization and code reuse makes him a pioneer of component-based software engineering and software product line engineering.

==Biography==
McIlroy earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering physics from Cornell University, and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from MIT in 1959 for his thesis &quot;On the Solution of the Differential Equations of Conical Shells&quot; (advisor Eric Reissner).
He taught at MIT from 1954 to 1958.

McIlroy joined Bell Laboratories in 1958; from 1965 to 1986 was head of its Computing Techniques Research Department (the birthplace of the Unix operating system), and thereafter was Distinguished Member of Technical Staff.

From 1967 to 1968, McIlroy also served as a visiting lecturer at Oxford University.

In 1997, McIlroy retired from Bell Labs, and took a position as an adjunct professor in the Dartmouth College Computer Science Department.

He has previously served the Association for Computing Machinery as national lecturer, Turing Award chairman, member of the publications planning committee, and associate editor for the &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;, the &quot;Journal of the ACM&quot;, and &quot;ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems&quot;. He also served on the executive committee of CSNET.

== Research and contributions ==
=== Macro processors ===
McIlroy is considered to be a pioneer of macro processors. In 1959, together with Douglas E. Eastwood of Bell Labs, he introduced conditional and recursive macros into popular SAP assembler, creating what is known as Macro SAP. His 1960 paper was also seminal in the area of extending any (including high-level) programming languages through macro processors. These contributions started the macro-language tradition at Bell Labs (&quot;everything from L6 and AMBIT to C&quot;). McIlroy&#x27;s macro processing ideas were also the main inspiration for TRAC macro processor.

He also coauthored M6 macro processor in FORTRAN IV, which was used in ALTRAN and later was ported to and included into early versions of Unix.

=== Contributions to Unix ===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s McIlroy contributed programs for Multics (such as RUNOFF) and Unix operating systems (such as &quot;diff&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;join&quot; and &quot;look&quot;), versions of which are widespread to this day through adoption of the POSIX standard and Unix-like operating systems. He introduced the idea of Unix pipelines. He also implemented TMG compiler-compiler in PDP-7 and PDP-11 assembly, which became the first high-level programming language running on Unix, prompting development and influencing Ken Thompson&#x27;s B programming language and Stephen Johnson&#x27;s Yacc parser-generator.

McIlroy also took over from Dennis Ritchie compilation of the Unix manual &quot;as a labor of love&quot;. Particularly, he edited volume 1 of the manual pages for Version 7 Unix. According to Sandy Fraser: &quot;The fact that there was a manual, that he [McIlroy] insisted on a high standard for the manual, meant that he insisted on a high standard for every one of the programs that was documented&quot;.

=== Computer language design ===
McIlroy influenced the design and implementation of SNOBOL programming language. His string manipulation macros were used extensively in the initial SNOBOL implementation of 1962, and figured prominently in subsequent work, eventually leading to its machine-independent implementation language SIL. The table type (associative array) was added to SNOBOL4 on McIlroy&#x27;s insistence in 1969.

In 1960s, he participated in the design of PL/I programming language. He was a member of the IBM–SHARE committee that designed the language and, together with Robert Morris, wrote the Early PL/I (EPL) compiler in TMG for the Multics project.

Around 1965, McIlroy, together with W. Stanley Brown, implemented the original version of ALTRAN programming language for IBM 7094 computers.

McIlroy has also made a significant influence on design of the programming language C++ (e.g., he proposed the stream output operator codice_1).

=== Algorithms ===
In the 1990s, McIlroy worked on improving sorting techniques, particularly he co-authored an optimized qsort with Jon Bentley.

In 1969, he contributed an efficient algorithm to generate all spanning trees in a graph (first discovered by George J. Minty in 1965).

==Awards and recognition==
In 1995, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2004, he won both the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award (&quot;The Flame&quot;) and its Software Tools User Group (STUG) award. In 2006, he was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

==Views on computing==
McIlroy is attributed the quote &quot;The real hero of programming is the one who writes negative code,&quot; where the meaning of &quot;negative code&quot; is taken to be similar to the famous Apple developer, Bill Atkinson, team anecdote (i.e., when a change in a program source makes the number of lines of code decrease (&#x27;negative&#x27; code), while its overall quality, readability or speed improves).

<text>Omne datum optimum (Latin for &quot;Every perfect gift&quot;, a quotation from the Epistle of James 1:17) was a papal bull issued by Pope Innocent II on 29 March 1139 that endorsed the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (Knights Templar), in which the Templar Rule was officially approved, and papal protection given.

==Background==
By the end of the 1130s, the Templars had prospered as a complete military order with a stratified structure, due to the efforts of Grand Master Robert de Craon. Already facing ecclesiastical criticism for receiving tithes and alms, Robert de Craon reasoned that the Order could only flourish with papal support. It was during one of Robert&#x27;s visits to France and Italy that Innocent II issued the bull &quot;Omne datum optimum&quot; on 29 March 1139.

==Contents==
The contents of &quot;Omne datum optimum&quot;:
* promised all spoils from Muslim conquest to the Order
* allowed the Order to build churches, cemeteries, and houses
* permitted a chaplain in every house
* leaders of the Order could expel unworthy members
* allowed chapels for members and burials
* forbid the election of an outsider as Master of the Order
* no homage or tithes were to be extracted from the Order

Included in the contents of the bull was the creation of a group of chaplain brothers for the Order. They were capable of hearing confessions and giving absolution, to all members of the Orders. The &quot;Omne datum optimum&quot; gave the Order the papal sanction it needed to operate independently of ecclesiastical and secular authorities.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Omne datum optimum&quot; was followed by Pope Celestine II&#x27;s &quot;Milites Templi&quot; in 1144 and Pope Eugene III&#x27;s &quot;Militia Dei&quot; in 1145, which together gave the Templars an extraordinary range of rights and privileges.

<text>An automaton (; : automata or automatons) is a relatively self-operating machine, or control mechanism designed to automatically follow a sequence of operations, or respond to predetermined instructions. Some automata, such as bellstrikers in mechanical clocks, are designed to give the illusion to the casual observer that they are operating under their own power or will, like a mechanical robot. The term has long been commonly associated with automated puppets that resemble moving humans or animals, built to impress and/or to entertain people.

Animatronics are a modern type of automata with electronics, often used for the portrayal of characters or creatures in films and in theme park attractions.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is the latinization of the Ancient Greek (), which means &quot;acting of one&#x27;s own will&quot;. It was first used by Homer to describe an automatic door opening, or automatic movement of wheeled tripods. It is more often used to describe non-electronic moving machines, especially those that have been made to resemble human or animal actions, such as the jacks on old public striking clocks, or the cuckoo and any other animated figures on a cuckoo clock.

==History==
===Ancient===

There are many examples of automata in Greek mythology: Hephaestus created automata for his workshop; Talos was an artificial man of bronze; King Alkinous of the Phaiakians employed gold and silver watchdogs. According to Aristotle, Daedalus used quicksilver to make his wooden statue of Aphrodite move. In other Greek legends he used quicksilver to install voice in his moving statues.

The automata in the Hellenistic world were intended as tools, toys, religious spectacles, or prototypes for demonstrating basic scientific principles. Numerous water-powered automata were built by Ktesibios, a Greek inventor and the first head of the Great Library of Alexandria; for example, he &quot;&quot;used water to sound a whistle and make a model owl move. He had invented the world&#x27;s first &#x27;cuckoo clock&quot;. This tradition continued in Alexandria with inventors such as the Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria (sometimes known as Heron), whose writings on hydraulics, pneumatics, and mechanics described siphons, a fire engine, a water organ, the aeolipile, and a programmable cart. Philo of Byzantium was famous for his inventions.
Complex mechanical devices are known to have existed in Hellenistic Greece, though the only surviving example is the Antikythera mechanism, the earliest known analog computer. The clockwork is thought to have come originally from Rhodes, where there was apparently a tradition of mechanical engineering; the island was renowned for its automata; to quote Pindar&#x27;s seventh Olympic Ode:

:The animated figures stand
:Adorning every public street
:And seem to breathe in stone, or
:move their marble feet.

However, the information gleaned from recent scans of the fragments indicate that it may have come from the colonies of Corinth in Sicily and implies a connection with Archimedes.

According to Jewish legend, King Solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it; upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head, and a dove would bring him a Torah scroll. It is also said that when King Solomon stepped upon the throne, a mechanism was set in motion. As soon as he stepped upon the first step, a golden ox and a golden lion each stretched out one foot to support him and help him rise to the next step. On each side, the animals helped the King up until he was comfortably seated upon the throne.

In ancient China, a curious account of automata is found in the Lie Zi text, believed to have originated around 400 BCE and compiled around the fourth century CE. Within it there is a description of a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou (1023–957 BCE) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an &#x27;artificer&#x27;. The latter proudly presented the king with a very realistic and detailed life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork:

Other notable examples of automata include Archytas&#x27; dove, mentioned by Aulus Gellius. Similar Chinese accounts of flying automata are written of the 5th century BC Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban, who made artificial wooden birds () that could successfully fly according to the and other texts.

===Medieval===

The manufacturing tradition of automata continued in the Greek world well into the Middle Ages. On his visit to Constantinople in 949 ambassador Liutprand of Cremona described automata in the emperor Theophilos&#x27; palace, including 
Similar automata in the throne room (singing birds, roaring and moving lions) were described by Luitprand&#x27;s contemporary the Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in his book &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot; (Perì tês Basileíou Tákseōs).

In the mid-8th century, the first wind powered automata were built: &quot;statues that turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the Round City of Baghdad&quot;. The &quot;public spectacle of wind-powered statues had its private counterpart in the &#x27;Abbasid palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed.&quot; Also in the 8th century, the Muslim alchemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber), included recipes for constructing artificial snakes, scorpions, and humans that would be subject to their creator&#x27;s control in his coded &quot;Book of Stones&quot;. In 827, Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun had a silver and golden tree in his palace in Baghdad, which had the features of an automatic machine. There were metal birds that sang automatically on the swinging branches of this tree built by Muslim inventors and engineers. The Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir also had a silver and golden tree in his palace in Baghdad in 917, with birds on it flapping their wings and singing. In the 9th century, the Banū Mūsā brothers invented a programmable automatic flute player and which they described in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;.

Al-Jazari described complex programmable humanoid automata amongst other machines he designed and constructed in the &quot;Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot; in 1206. His automaton was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operate the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.

Al-Jazari constructed a hand washing automaton first employing the flush mechanism now used in modern toilets. It features a female automaton standing by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the automaton refills the basin. His &quot;peacock fountain&quot; was another more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants who offer soap and towels. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows: &quot;Pulling a plug on the peacock&#x27;s tail releases water out of the beak; as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap. When more water is used, a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure—with a towel!&quot;

Al-Jazari thus appears to have been the first inventor to display an interest in creating human-like machines for practical purposes such as manipulating the environment for human comfort. Lamia Balafrej has also pointed out the prevalence of the figure of the automated slave in al-Jazari&#x27;s treatise. Automated slaves were a frequent motif in ancient and medieval literature but it was not so common to find them described in a technical book. Balafrej has also written about automated female slaves, which appeared in timekeepers and as liquid-serving devices in medieval Arabic sources, thus suggesting a link between feminized forms of labor like housekeeping, medieval slavery, and the imaginary of automation.

In 1066, the Chinese inventor Su Song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours.

&quot;Samarangana Sutradhara&quot;, a Sanskrit treatise by Bhoja (11th century), includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances (automata), including mechanical bees and birds, fountains shaped like humans and animals, and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps, danced, played instruments, and re-enacted scenes from Hindu mythology. 

Villard de Honnecourt, in his 1230s sketchbook, depicted an early escapement mechanism in a drawing titled &quot;How to make an angel keep pointing his finger toward the Sun&quot; with an angel that would perpetually turn to face the sun. He also drew an automaton of a bird with jointed wings, which led to their design implementation in clocks.

At the end of the thirteenth century, Robert II, Count of Artois, built a pleasure garden at his castle at Hesdin that incorporated several automata as entertainment in the walled park. The work was conducted by local workmen and overseen by the Italian knight Renaud Coignet. It included monkey marionettes, a sundial supported by lions and &quot;wild men&quot;, mechanized birds, mechanized fountains and a bellows-operated organ. The park was famed for its automata well into the fifteenth century before it was destroyed by English soldiers in the sixteenth century.

The Chinese author Xiao Xun wrote that when the Ming dynasty founder Hongwu (r. 1368–1398) was destroying the palaces of Khanbaliq belonging to the previous Yuan dynasty, there were—among many other mechanical devices—automata found that were in the shape of tigers.

===Renaissance and early modern===
The Renaissance witnessed a considerable revival of interest in automata. Hero&#x27;s treatises were edited and translated into Latin and Italian. Hydraulic and pneumatic automata, similar to those described by Hero, were created for garden grottoes.

Giovanni Fontana, a Paduan engineer in 1420, developed &quot;Bellicorum instrumentorum liber&quot; which includes a puppet of a camelid driven by a clothed primate twice the height of a human being and an automaton of Mary Magdalene. He also created mechanical devils and rocket-propelled animal automata.
While functional, early clocks were also often designed as novelties and spectacles which integrated features of automata. Many big and complex clocks with automated figures were built as public spectacles in European town centres. One of the earliest of these large clocks was the Strasbourg astronomical clock, built in the 14th century which takes up the entire side of a cathedral wall. It contained an astronomical calendar, automata depicting animals, saints and the life of Christ. The mechanical rooster of Strasbourg clock was active from 1352 to 1789. The clock still functions to this day, but has undergone several restorations since its initial construction. The Prague astronomical clock was built in 1410, animated figures were added from the 17th century onwards. Numerous clockwork automata were manufactured in the 16th century, principally by the goldsmiths of the Free Imperial Cities of central Europe. These wondrous devices found a home in the cabinet of curiosities or &quot;Wunderkammern&quot; of the princely courts of Europe.

In 1454, Duke Philip created an entertainment show named &quot;The extravagant Feast of the Pheasant&quot;, which was intended to influence the Duke&#x27;s peers to participate in a crusade against the Ottomans but ended up being a grand display of automata, giants, and dwarves.

A banquet in Camilla of Aragon&#x27;s honor in Italy, 1475, featured a lifelike automated camel. The spectacle was a part of a larger parade which continued over days.

Leonardo da Vinci sketched a complex mechanical knight, which he may have built and exhibited at a celebration hosted by Ludovico Sforza at the court of Milan around 1495. The design of Leonardo&#x27;s robot was not rediscovered until the 1950s. A functional replica was later built that could move its arms, twist its head, and sit up.

Da Vinci is frequently credited with constructing a mechanical lion, which he presented to King Francois I in Lyon in 1515. Although no record of the device&#x27;s original designs remain, a recreation of this piece is housed at the Château du Clos Lucé.

The Smithsonian Institution has in its collection a clockwork monk, about high, possibly dating as early as 1560. The monk is driven by a key-wound spring and walks the path of a square, striking his chest with his right arm, while raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand, turning and nodding his head, rolling his eyes, and mouthing silent obsequies. From time to time, he brings the cross to his lips and kisses it. It is believed that the monk was manufactured by Juanelo Turriano, mechanician to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

The first description of a modern cuckoo clock was by the Augsburg nobleman Philipp Hainhofer in 1629. The clock belonged to Prince Elector August von Sachsen. By 1650, the workings of mechanical cuckoos were understood and were widely disseminated in Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s handbook on music, &quot;Musurgia Universalis&quot;. In what is the first documented description of how a mechanical cuckoo works, a mechanical organ with several automated figures is described. In 18th-century Germany, clockmakers began making cuckoo clocks for sale. Clock shops selling cuckoo clocks became commonplace in the Black Forest region by the middle of the 18th century.
Japan adopted clockwork automata in the early 17th century as &quot;karakuri&quot; puppets. In 1662, Takeda Omi completed his first &quot;butai karakuri&quot; and then built several of these large puppets for theatrical exhibitions. Karakuri puppets went through a golden age during the Edo period (1603–1867).

A new attitude towards automata is to be found in René Descartes when he suggested that the bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines – the bones, muscles and organs could be replaced with cogs, pistons, and cams. Thus mechanism became the standard to which Nature and the organism was compared. France in the 17th century was the birthplace of those ingenious mechanical toys that were to become prototypes for the engines of the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1649, when Louis XIV was still a child, François-Joseph de Camus designed for him a miniature coach, complete with horses and footmen, a page, and a lady within the coach; all these figures exhibited a perfect movement. According to Labat, General de Gennes constructed, in 1688, in addition to machines for gunnery and navigation, a peacock that walked and ate. Athanasius Kircher produced many automata to create Jesuit shows, including a statue which spoke and listened via a speaking tube.
The world&#x27;s first successfully-built biomechanical automaton is considered to be &quot;The Flute Player&quot;, which could play twelve songs, created by the French engineer Jacques de Vaucanson in 1737. He also constructed &quot;The Tambourine Player&quot; and the &quot;Digesting Duck&quot;, a mechanical duck that – apart from quacking and flapping its wings – gave the false illusion of eating and defecating, seeming to endorse Cartesian ideas that animals are no more than machines of flesh.

In 1769, a chess-playing machine called the Turk, created by Wolfgang von Kempelen, made the rounds of the courts of Europe purporting to be an automaton. The Turk beat Benjamin Franklin in a game of chess when Franklin was ambassador to France. The Turk was actually operated from inside by a hidden human director, and was not a true automaton.

Other 18th century automaton makers include the prolific Swiss Pierre Jaquet-Droz (see Jaquet-Droz automata) and his son Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz, and his contemporary Henri Maillardet. Maillardet, a Swiss mechanic, created an automaton capable of drawing four pictures and writing three poems. Maillardet&#x27;s Automaton is now part of the collections at the Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia. Belgian-born John Joseph Merlin created the mechanism of the Silver Swan automaton, now at Bowes Museum. A musical elephant made by the French clockmaker Hubert Martinet in 1774 is one of the highlights of Waddesdon Manor. Tipu&#x27;s Tiger is another late-18th century example of automata, made for Tipu Sultan, featuring a European soldier being mauled by a tiger. Catherine the Great of Russia was gifted a very large and elaborate Peacock Clock created by James Cox in 1781 now on display in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

According to philosopher Michel Foucault, Frederick the Great, king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, was &quot;obsessed&quot; with automata. According to Manuel de Landa, &quot;he put together his armies as a well-oiled clockwork mechanism whose components were robot-like warriors&quot;.

In 1801, Joseph Jacquard built his loom automaton that was controlled autonomously with punched cards.

Automata, particularly watches and clocks, were popular in China during the 18th and 19th centuries, and items were produced for the Chinese market. Strong interest by Chinese collectors in the 21st century brought many interesting items to market where they have had dramatic realizations.

===Modern===

The famous magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin (1805–1871) was known for creating automata for his stage shows. Automata that acted according to a set of preset instructions were popular with magicians during this time.
In 1840, Italian inventor Innocenzo Manzetti constructed a flute-playing automaton, in the shape of a man, life-size, seated on a chair. Hidden inside the chair were levers, connecting rods and compressed air tubes, which made the automaton&#x27;s lips and fingers move on the flute according to a program recorded on a cylinder similar to those used in player pianos. The automaton was powered by clockwork and could perform 12 different arias. As part of the performance, it would rise from the chair, bow its head, and roll its eyes.
 
The period between 1860 and 1910 is known as &quot;The Golden Age of Automata&quot;. Mechanical coin-operated fortune tellers were introduced to boardwalks in Britain and America. In Paris during this period, many small family based companies of automata makers thrived. From their workshops they exported thousands of clockwork automata and mechanical singing birds around the world. Although now rare and expensive, these French automata attract collectors worldwide. The main French makers were Bontems, Lambert, Phalibois, Renou, Roullet &amp; Decamps, Theroude and Vichy.

Abstract automata theory started in mid-20th century with finite automata; it is applied in branches of formal and natural science including computer science, physics, biology, as well as linguistics.

Contemporary automata continue this tradition with an emphasis on art, rather than technological sophistication. Contemporary automata are represented by the works of Cabaret Mechanical Theatre in the United Kingdom, Thomas Kuntz, Arthur Ganson, Joe Jones and Le Défenseur du Temps by French artist Jacques Monestier.

Since 1990 Dutch artist Theo Jansen has been building large automated PVC structures called &quot;strandbeest&quot; (beach animal) that can walk on wind power or compressed air. Jansen claims that he intends them to automatically evolve and develop artificial intelligence, with herds roaming freely over the beach.

British sculptor Sam Smith (1908–1983) was a well-known maker of automata.

===Proposals===
In 2016, the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program studied a rover, the Automaton Rover for Extreme Environments, designed to survive for an extended time in Venus&#x27; environmental conditions. Unlike other modern automata, AREE is an automaton instead of a robot for practical reasons—Venus&#x27;s harsh conditions, particularly its surface temperature of , make operating electronics there for any significant time impossible. It would be controlled by a mechanical computer and driven by wind power.

==Clocks==
Automaton clocks are clocks which feature automatons within or around the housing and typically activate around the beginning of each hour, at each half hour, or at each quarter hour. They were largely produced from the 1st century BC to the end of the Victorian times in Europe. Older clocks typically featured religious characters or other mythical characters such as Death or Father Time. As time progressed, however, automaton clocks began to feature influential characters at the time of creation, such as kings, famous composers, or industrialists. Examples of automaton clocks include chariot clocks and cuckoo clocks. The Cuckooland Museum exhibits autonomous clocks. While automaton clocks are largely perceived to have been in use during medieval times in Europe, they are largely produced in Japan today.

In Automata theory, clocks are regarded as timed automatons, a type of finite automaton. Automaton clocks being finite essentially means that automaton clocks have a certain number of states in which they can exist. The exact number is the number of combinations possible on a clock with the hour, minute, and second hand: 43,200. The title of timed automaton declares that the automaton changes states at a set rate, which for clocks is 1 state change every second. Clock automata only takes as input the time displayed by the previous state. The automata uses this input to produce the next state, a display of time 1 second later than the previous. Clock automata often also use the previous state&#x27;s input to &#x27;decide&#x27; whether or not the next state requires merely changing the hands on the clock, or if a special function is required, such as a mechanical bird popping out of a house like in cuckoo clocks. This choice is evaluated through the position of complex gears, cams, axles, and other mechanical devices within the automaton.

== In art and popular culture throughout history ==

<text>The CAC Boomerang is a fighter aircraft designed and manufactured in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation between 1942 and 1945. Approved for production shortly following the Empire of Japan&#x27;s entry into the Second World War, the Boomerang was rapidly designed as to meet the urgent demands for fighter aircraft to equip the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It was the first combat aircraft designed and constructed in Australia.

Different variants of the Boomerang were manufactured under a series of corresponding production contract numbers CA-12, CA-13, CA-14 and CA-19, the aircraft supplied under each subsequent contract would incorporate various modifications, typically aimed at improving the aircraft&#x27;s performance. The Boomerang was handicapped by the available engine variant, which gave low power at altitude and resulted in the aircraft proving to be slower than contemporary fighter aircraft. The Boomerang rarely engaged in aerial combat. During early wartime operations, the Boomerang was mainly dispatched to equip home-based squadrons, freeing up other fighters for use overseas. In later service, the Boomerang would commonly be used for ground support duties, cooperating with Allied army units, in addition to secondary roles such as aerial reconnaissance and air sea rescue.
==Development==

===Background===
During the mid 1930s, some political leaders observed that both the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany appeared to be preparing for war, which in turn led to several other countries commencing their own preparations.

In Australia, the nation&#x27;s small domestic aircraft industry required substantial expansion and reorganization to produce modern combat aircraft in sufficient numbers. While Tugan Aircraft had built eight examples of a small twin engine transport to their own design, as an organization they were too small to be reasonably expected to expand into the role of producing large numbers of modern combat aircraft in a timely manner. An additional hurdle was the lack of experience in Australia outside of light private and small commercial aircraft, as all military aircraft had been procured from overseas manufacturers, mainly in the United Kingdom. On 17 October 1936, with the encouragement of the Government of Australia, three companies formed a joint venture, registered as the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC), which had the goal of developing a self-sufficient aircraft industry. Other companies would in turn join them, and Tugan Aircraft would be taken over by CAC.

CAC planned both engine and aircraft manufacturing and testing facilities at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne, purchasing tooling and equipment from manufacturers in both Britain and the United States. While the company initially pursued the development and production of the CAC Wirraway, a single-engine armed advanced trainer aircraft which was a licence-built version of the North American NA-16, the firm later received substantial orders for large numbers of military aircraft, in particular fighters, to equip the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). In July 1940, when the United Kingdom was the sole European nation still fighting against Germany, the Australian Government issued a statement advising that &quot;from this date onward Australia can rely on England for no further supplies of any aircraft materials or equipment of any kind.

On 7 December 1941, the Pacific War began with a series of unanticipated near-simultaneous attacks by Japanese forces against Pearl Harbor, Thailand, Malaya and the Philippines. With Japan gaining control over vast areas of the Pacific and South East Asia within just a few months, Australia was in a precarious position. Two Australian squadrons were stationed in Europe, along with a further four squadrons in Malaya. Two of the Malayan squadrons were equipped with Lockheed Hudson medium bombers, one with Wirraways as general purpose aircraft, and another with the lacklustre Brewster Buffalo fighter. There was a distinct need of a strong Australian fighter force at that time.

While most RAAF aircraft came from the UK, by 1942, the British aircraft industry was hard-pressed to even meet the needs of its own country. Meanwhile, companies in the United States possessed enormous aircraft manufacturing capacity, but their output was at this point being monopolized by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and United States Navy (USN), which were also at war with Japan. Even where capacity could be found for new aircraft to be built overseas, their delivery would require them to be shipped considerable distances in wartime conditions, with consequent delays and at the risk of considerable losses, in particular due to German U-boats and Japanese submarines. While USAAF fighters such as the Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk and Bell P-39 Airacobra that were being used in the region that were damaged during service could be rebuilt by Australian workshops and even loaned to RAAF units, they were not available in sufficient numbers.

===Origins===
In late 1941, Lawrence Wackett, Manager and Chief Designer of CAC, began examining the possibility of designing and building a new domestically-designed fighter aircraft. The main challenge to this ambition was the fact that fighter aircraft had never been manufactured before in Australia; according to aviation author Rene J. Francillon, many experts considered that the licensed manufacture of a complete fighter aircraft would be beyond the capabilities of Australia&#x27;s industry at that time. Wackett quickly decided to use elements of aircraft which were already being produced in Australia. Only two military aircraft were in production at the time: the CAC Wirraway, based on the North American NA-16, and the Bristol Beaufort bomber.

Overseas, the NA-16 had already become the basis of the North American NA-50 fighter (also known as the P-64), which had been used by the Peruvian Air Force in the 1941 Ecuadorian–Peruvian War. Crucially, CAC&#x27;s licence to manufacture the Wirraway already contained a clause allowing the design to be modified. Accordingly, Wackett decided to use the airframe of the Wirraway as a starting point for the design of the new domestic fighter; this choice had the advantages of requiring little additional tooling, and of speeding up design and establishing manufacturing.

Although British designers had reworked the twin-engined Beaufort into a successful attack aircraft, the Beaufighter, this was not a suitable basis for the sought-after single-engine interceptor aircraft. However, Australian-made Beauforts used 1,200 horsepower (890 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines, which were made under licence at the CAC plant in Lidcombe, Sydney. Another factor in favour of the engine was that it was already in use to power the Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of the United States Navy, which helped make the Twin Wasp a logical choice to power the domestic fighter design.

Wackett promptly recruited designer Fred David, an Austrian Jew who had recently arrived in Australia as a refugee. As David was technically an enemy alien, he had been interned by Australian immigration officials. He was well-suited to the CAC project, since he had previously worked for Heinkel in pre-Nazi Germany, and for Mitsubishi and Aichi in Japan. As a result of this past, David possessed an excellent understanding of advanced fighter designs, including the Mitsubishi A6M (&quot;Zero&quot;) (used by the Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service) and the Heinkel He 112 (a contemporary of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 used in small numbers by Axis air forces in Europe).

In December 1941, the management of CAC issued its authorisation to proceed with the detailed design of the new fighter aircraft. The aircraft, which had received the internal designation of &quot;CA-12&quot;, used the wing, tail assembly, undercarriage, and center section of the Wirraway in combination with a new forward fuselage, which housed the larger Twin Wasp engine. It had a new single-seat cockpit with a sliding hood, and carried an armament of two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannons along with four .303 machine guns. The proposal was presented to the Australian Government, which promptly gave its approval, viewing the CA-12 as appropriate insurance against the delay or cancellation of its order for US-built P-40 fighters, as well as a desire to maintain work at CAC; the ready availability of usable Wirraway components for the CA-12, which would greatly speed up any manufacturing program, was also viewed favourably.

Accordingly, on 18 February 1942, the Australian War Cabinet authorised an order for 105 &quot;CA-12&quot; aircraft; shortly thereafter, the name &quot;Boomerang&quot; was selected for the aircraft. The ordering of production aircraft had been made in advance of any prototype being produced or maiden flight performed: the Boomerang had been effectively ordered &#x27;off the drawing board&#x27;.

===Prototypes and early production===
On 29 May 1942, the prototype Boomerang, &quot;A46-1&quot;, conducted its maiden flight from Fishermans Bend, flown by CAC pilot Ken Frewin. This initial prototype had been completed within only three months of having received the order to proceed, which was a considerably rare accomplishment for the era. A46-1 was quickly put to use for a series of test flights, being flown either by Frewin or by RAAF pilot John Harper; these tests reportedly went smoothly, with the prototype proving to be easy to handle and quite manoeuvrable. An issue with engine cooling was encountered, which led to a revision of the oil cooler intake and the addition of a spinner to the propeller upon &quot;A46-3&quot; onwards. On 15 July, No. 1 Aircraft Depot (1 AD) of the RAAF formally received A46-1 (bu. no. &quot;824&quot;) from CAC.

Comparison flight tests were undertaken by 1 AD, pitting the CA-12 against a Brewster Buffalo (&quot;A51-6&quot;) that had been lightened and re-weighted to approximate the flight characteristics of a Zero, as well as a Curtiss P-40E/Kittyhawk Mk I (&quot;A29-129&quot;) and a Bell P-400/Airacobra Mk Ia (&quot;BW127&quot;). It was found that the Boomerang was faster in level flight than the Buffalo, although the Buffalo out-manoeuvred it. The Boomerang was superior in armament, with two 20 mm cannon and four .303 calibre (7.7 mm) machine guns, all mounted in the short, thick wings. Its pilots were better protected, with generous armour plating, than Japanese fighter pilots. While the CA-12 was lively at low level, its performance fell away rapidly above altitudes of 15,000 ft (4,600 m), and its maximum speed of 265 knots (490 km/h) was not sufficient to make it an effective counter to Japanese fighters like the Zero and the Japanese Army&#x27;s Nakajima Ki 43 (&quot;Oscar&quot;). Similarly, the best European fighters were reaching almost 350 knots (650 km/h), and even relatively sluggish contemporary fighters – like the Grumman F4F Wildcat and the Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk I – were substantially faster than the Boomerang.

From March 1942, there was less pressure to place the CA-12 into production as multiple USAAF units, operating a mixture of P-40 and P-39 fighters, were being deployed in strength to northern Australia; the RAAF had also begun to receive new Kittyhawk fighters as well. In June 1943, manufacturing work upon the original order for 105 CA-12s was completed. During production of this batch, several modifications and improvements were incorporated onto the CA-12, these included the strengthening of the spinner back plates and belly tank locating pins, the installation of underwing night flying identification lights, and a revised electrical starter system; many of these modifications would be retrofitted onto early production models at operational bases as well.

In the face of difficulties experienced by CAC on the development of the CAC Woomera, a twin-engine bomber aircraft which was ultimately cancelled in September 1944, the Australian government elected to extend the production arrangement for the Boomerang, extending its orders from 105 to 250 aircraft. These additional 145 aircraft were manufactured in four distinct versions, the &quot;CA-13&quot;, the &quot;CA-14&quot;, &quot;CA-14A&quot; and &quot;CA-19&quot;. 95 &quot;CA-13&quot;s and 49 &quot;CA-19&quot;s, were completed, while only one prototype of the supercharged Boomerang &quot;CA-14&quot; and its modified &quot;CA-14A&quot; form would be produced. In February 1945, the final Boomerang to be manufactured, &quot;A46-249&quot;, a CA-19 model, was completed. 

===Further development===
During the flight testing phase of development work upon the initial CA-12 model, CAC commenced work upon a new variant which featured performance improvements in terms of speed, climb and ceiling. Designated &quot;CA-14&quot;, this aircraft was designed around an order for 145 U.S.-built, 1,700 hp (1,268 kW) Wright Cyclone R-2600 engines. The Wright engines ordered were not delivered as scheduled, and in mid-1942 Wackett authorised use of the 1,850 hp (1,380 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800, which was available from the CAC factory in Lidcombe. Due to the layout of the Boomerang&#x27;s compact fuselage, the supercharger for the engine was installed in the rear fuselage, while a new three-bladed variable pitch Curtiss-built propeller was also initially adopted.

Unfortunately, the significantly greater weight of this powerplant made undercarriage failure a significant risk. (The R-2800 engine was later intended to be used on the Boomerang&#x27;s successor, the CAC CA-15 &quot;Kangaroo&quot;.) CAC eventually returned to the Twin Wasp, to which it added a General Electric B-2 turbo-supercharger mounted inside the rear part of the fuselage, new propeller gear, a geared cooling fan (influenced by intelligence reports from Europe regarding captured German BMW 801 twin-row radial engines, which were used by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A) and a larger, squared-off tailfin and rudder.

By July 1943, the significantly re-worked CA-14 prototype, now known as the CA-14A, had a top speed 25–30% faster than the CA-12, and an operational ceiling 4,000 ft (1,200 m) higher. Testing of the later Boomerang variants found that they compared favourably, under some conditions, with the Spitfire Mk V, as well as early variants of the Republic Thunderbolt (P-47) and North American Mustang (P-51). By that time, however, the Spitfire had filled the interceptor role, and CAC was on the verge of commencing the manufacture of Mustangs under licence to fill the bomber escort, air superiority and close air support roles; the CA-14 never entered production.

==Design==

The Boomerang was a small single-engine monoplane fighter aircraft, designed with an emphasis on high manoeuvrability. It had a stubby appearance, due to the smaller Wirraway airframe being paired with the considerably larger 1,200 horsepower (890 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial engine, which drove a three-bladed Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propeller, license-built by de Havilland. The engine was closely cowled, with an air scoop fixed to the upper side for the carburetor, and another fitted to the lower side for the oil cooler. Fuel was divided between one fuselage-housed self-sealing fuel tank and a pair of tanks within the center section of the wing.

Although the original intention during development had been to use as many Wirraway components as possible, the final design of the Boomerang differed substantially, with shorter wings, a shorter, wood-sheathed, aluminium-framed fuselage, strengthened to withstand combat stresses, and an original centre section. The low-mounted cantilever wing consisted of five sections: a central section, a pair of outer sections, and two detachable wing tips; the outer sections had a swept-back leading edge along with a straight trailing edge. The wing used a single spar and a stressed skin construction, along with fabric-covered ailerons, aluminium trim tabs and split trailing edge flaps. The main undercarriage hydraulically retracted into wheelwells forward of the main spar.

The Boomerang had a new single-seat cockpit directly over the centre of the wing, which was furnished with a sliding canopy with bulletproof glass and armor protection. Common to many of the latest fighters at the time, the Boomerang was equipped with automatic cannons; as no such weapons had previously been manufactured in Australia, a pair of British-made Hispano-Suiza 20 mm were used. Allegedly, an example which an Australian airman had collected as a souvenir in the Middle East was reverse-engineered. Other armament fitted included four Browning .303 machine guns, with provision for up to four 20 lb smoke bombs; all of these were mounted within the wings.

==Operational history==
On 19 October 1942, CA-12 &quot;A46-6&quot; (bu. no. &quot;829&quot;) became the first Boomerang to reach a training/conversion unit, it was immediately put to use training pilots when it was transferred to No. 2 OTU, from 1 AD. In the training role, while generally being considered to be a success according to Rene, pilots without previous operational experience had difficulty transitioning from the Wirraway to the Boomerang due to its poor forward visibility; the reflector gun sight was subsequently relocated to improve pilot vision.

No. 83 Squadron became the first fighter unit to receive Boomerangs, when several were delivered to replace Airacobras at Strathpine Airfield in Strathpine, Queensland on 10 April 1943. A few weeks later, CA-12s were also received by a frontline air defence unit, No. 84 Squadron which was stationed on Horn Island Airfield, in Torres Strait. The third Boomerang fighter unit, No. 85 Squadron, like No. 83 Squadron, was performing home defence duties, at RAAF Guildford (later Perth Airport); the Boomerangs replaced the squadron&#x27;s Buffaloes.

On 16 May 1943, the first encounter between the Boomerang and Japanese aircraft occurred; while on aerial patrol duties a pair of Boomerangs, flown by Flying Officer Johnstone and Sergeant Stammer, spotted three Mitsubishi G4M &#x27;Betty&#x27; bombers and opened fire upon them at 250 yards, resulting in little apparent damage and the enemy&#x27;s withdrawal. On the evening of 20 May 1943, Flight Lieutenant Roy Goon became the first Boomerang pilot to scramble on the Australian mainland against Japanese bombers. Goon, part of a No. 85 Squadron detachment at RAAF Learmonth, near Exmouth, Western Australia, undertaking air defence of the Allied naval base at Exmouth Gulf (codenamed &quot;Potshot&quot;), took off to intercept Japanese bombers. After Goon had sighted them, the bombers dropped their payloads wide of their target and left the area. The majority of standing patrols were uneventful.
No. 84 Squadron had been deployed to a US Army Air Forces bomber base on Horn Island off the coast of Northern Australia in a measure to address Japanese air raids and the continuing shortage of fighters in this area, which were required for an intended small scale offensive in New Guinea. The squadron was only modestly successful in this role, however. The Boomerang&#x27;s low top speed and poor high altitude performance meant that No. 84 could drive off enemy attacks, but could rarely get close enough to Japanese aircraft to attack thembring their guns to bear. There were not many air raids in this area, and after using Boomerangs for eight months, No. 84 Squadron upgraded to the Kittyhawk. In addition to its air defence operations, No. 84 also provided cover for all shipping in the area during this time, including within 20 miles of Merauke, Papua Province.

While the Boomerang was never recorded by the RAAF as having destroyed any enemy aircraft, the type proved to be more useful as a light ground attack aircraft used by Army co-operation squadrons, often replacing the lightly armed Wirraway in this role. In this vital mission, the Boomerang directly contributed to the extensive ground war in the jungles of the South West Pacific theatre, which was often characterised by widely dispersed, small unit actions, which typically fought at close quarters and with uncertain front lines. In addition to strafing Japanese ground forces with cannon and machine gun fire, Boomerangs often dropped smoke bombs to mark targets for other units to attack. The aircraft was also used for artillery spotting, aerial supply drops, tactical reconnaissance, and anti-malarial spraying.

The aircraft proved to be ideal in the ground attack role: it had the range to go wherever it was needed when it was based close to ground operations, had heavy armament, was agile and easy to fly so that pilots could get close to ground targets and avoid ground fire and rough terrain, and had extensive armour-plating and a wood and aluminium airframe that could withstand significant battle damage. Some of the aircraft were shot down, including two from friendly fire by US forces, and many were damaged during accidents while landing, often because the Boomerang was prone to ground looping.
No. 4 Squadron and No. 5 Squadron flew Boomerangs in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands Campaign and Borneo Campaign, also in the close support role, with marked success. Flying in pairs (one to observe the ground, the other to observe the air around them), their tasks included bombing, strafing, close infantry support and artillery spotting. When attacking larger enemy formations, Boomerangs often operated in conjunction with larger aircraft. In this role, the Boomerang would get in close to confirm the identity of the target and mark it with a 20 lb (9 kg) smoke bomb, with the bomber then delivering the major ordnance from a safer distance. A partnership between No. 5 Squadron Boomerangs and Royal New Zealand Air Force Corsair fighter-bombers during the Bougainville Campaign was said to be particularly effective.

On 15 August 1945 Japan surrendered; on 14 August the wartime role of the Boomerang had ended when the suspension of all offensive operations against land targets, except for direct support of Allied ground forces in contact with the enemy, was issued.

No. 8 Communications Unit operated a number of Boomerangs to assist with air-sea rescue operations in New Guinea.

The sole CA-14A was used for research by No. 1 Aircraft Performance Unit RAAF, and was also seconded to the Bureau of Meteorology for a period after the war ended.

<text>WTTW (channel 11) is a PBS member television station in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Owned by not-for-profit broadcaster Window to the World Communications, Inc., it is sister to commercial classical music radio station WFMT (98.7 FM). The two stations share studios in the Renée Crown Public Media Center, located at 5400 North Saint Louis Avenue (adjacent to the main campus of Northeastern Illinois University) in the city&#x27;s North Park neighborhood; its transmitter facility is atop the Willis Tower on South Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop. WTTW also owns and operates The Chicago Production Center, a video production and editing facility that is operated alongside the two stations.

WTTW is one of two PBS member stations serving the Chicago market, alongside Gary, Indiana–licensed WYIN (channel 56). WTTW, along with PBS Wisconsin flagship station WHA-TV in Madison, Wisconsin, serve as default PBS member stations for Rockford as that market does not have a PBS station of its own; both stations are available in that market on local cable and satellite providers.

==History==
WTTW first signed on the air on September 6, 1955, as a member station of National Educational Television (NET). The station was founded by a group of civic-minded Chicagoans, led by Inland Steel executive Edward R. Ryerson. Channel 11 came to life during the first year of the inaugural term of Mayor Richard J. Daley; Daley, Ryerson and businessman Irving B. Harris were responsible for creating WTTW, which began its life with studios and offices in Chicago&#x27;s Banker&#x27;s Building. It also had a &#x27;working exhibit&#x27; facility at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago&#x27;s Jackson Park. The call letters WTTW were chosen as the founders wanted the station to be Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Window To The World&quot;. The station&#x27;s transmitter was given to WTTW by the staff and management of the defunct KS2XBS, a pay television station operated by Zenith Radio Corporation on VHF channel 2 that was forced to shut down as a result of CBS owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV&#x27;s relocation to that channel in July 1953.

Ryerson recruited a young communications lawyer, Newton N. Minow, to join the station&#x27;s board; Minow would serve as both chairman of the WTTW board and as Commissioner of the FCC under the administration of President John F. Kennedy. Irving B. Harris, Henry W. &quot;Brick&quot; Meers, John W. McCarter Jr., Martin J. &quot;Mike&quot; Koldyke and Sandra P. Guthman have served as chairman of the board for the public broadcaster in subsequent decades. Guthman, a member of the Polk Brothers family of Chicago, is the current chairman of the board, having served in that post since October 2003.

Minow stated that the only really important decision that he made during his tenure as chair of WTTW was the recruitment of William J. McCarter Jr. as president and chief executive officer, a post which he held for 27 years. Having run public station WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., McCarter—a decorated Korean War hero and a veteran television pioneer—got his start in the broadcasting industry as a cameraman for &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and then as a part of the Army-McCarthy hearings on Capitol Hill. McCarter developed the concept of the political roundtable that is now a staple of television news. In non-commercial television circles, McCarter is referred to as the &quot;architect&quot; of public television (his friends know him as the man who kicked Bob Dylan—who was set to tape an episode of &quot;SoundStage&quot; and was found by McCarter asleep on the couch in the room—out of his office, waking the bearded Dylan up and ushering him out of the office after McCarter returned from a meeting).
During the 1960s, WTTW aired educational programming during the daytime hours, showing programs produced under the auspices of Chicago Area Schools Television (CAST). Programs from &quot;TV College&quot;, covering college subjects, were also shown on weekdays. Other afternoon shows included a locally produced series titled &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, which featured a children&#x27;s story presented weekdays at 5:30 p.m., and was sponsored by the locally based Marshall Field &amp; Company department store chain. 

In 1962, WTTW&#x27;s owner, then known as the Chicago Educational Television Association (CETA) began efforts for a second educational station. to air additional classroom instructional courses, especially those displaced as more and more of its own broadcast day was filled first with programming from National Educational Television (NET). 
On September 20, 1965, sister station WXXW signed on as Chicago&#x27;s second UHF television station on channel 20.

On October 5, 1970, WTTW became a charter member station of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

WTTW did not air shows on Saturdays until the summer of 1972. At first, it only had a limited schedule until 2 p.m. Then, in 1974, it expanded to a full day. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, WTTW was used to test stereo sound for TV broadcasts overnight. 

WTTW&#x27;s sister station WXXW quietly went dark in 1974 when the transmitter broke down. It had been one of the last in Chicago to transmit in black-and-white and by then its schedule was filled with what former WTTW station manager Edward Morris called &quot;talking heads and a blackboard&quot;. In 1977, WTTW sold the long-dark WXXW license a to consortium led by City Colleges of Chicago; the station ultimately became WYCC. 

In 1981, the Chicago Educational Television Association created &quot;Chicago&quot; magazine as WTTW and WFMT&#x27;s program guide. It was sold for $17 million in 1986 to a joint venture between Metropolitan Detroit Magazine and Adams Communications.

On August 7, 1984, WTTW became the first U.S. TV station to broadcast its entire schedule in stereo. 

On November 22, 1987, WTTW&#x27;s signal was hijacked by an unknown person wearing a Max Headroom mask—the second such signal interruption incident to occur in the Chicago area that night, with the first taking place during the 9 p.m. newscast on independent station WGN-TV (channel 9) two hours prior to the hacker&#x27;s intrusion of the WTTW signal. While WGN-TV&#x27;s analog transmitter was located atop the John Hancock Center at the time, allowing for engineers to almost immediately thwart the video hacker by changing the studio-to-transmitter frequency, WTTW&#x27;s transmitter was located atop the Sears Tower (now the Willis Tower), which made it harder to stop the hacker before the interruption voluntarily concluded after almost two minutes.

On June 4, 2010, Window to the World Communications announced that it would lay off around 12% of WTTW and WFMT&#x27;s employee base and extend a salary freeze instituted in 2009 for one additional year, in an effort to cut $3 million in operating costs due to declining revenue, effects from the economic downturn and the loss of $1.25 million in grant money from the Illinois General Assembly. Among the employees exiting WTTW in that layoff were Randy Chandler, Amy Christenson, Andy Fontana, Marc Glick, Susan Godfrey, Andrea Guthmann, Kari Hurley, Andre Jones, Shaunese Teamer, Sarah Warner and Tom Wuellner.

In 2012, WTTW eliminated the position of 16-year company veteran Joanie Bayhack, who had been senior vice president of communications and corporate partnerships. In 2014, WTTW eliminated the position of Holly Gilson, a 13-year veteran of the company who most recently had been director of strategic partnerships and special projects.

On April 15, 2014, Window to the World Communications renamed the broadcasting facilities for WTTW and WFMT-FM as the Renée Crown Public Media Center, following a monetary gift of an undisclosed amount by the family of Renée Crown (wife of Lester), who has served as a trustee for Window to the World since 1981).

In September 2017, WTTW offered former fellow PBS member station WYCC (the descendant of former sister station WXXW) with a channel-sharing agreement to stay on the air after an announcement that WYCC would shut down October 25, 2017. 
(WYCC had sold its spectrum in the April 2017 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction.) 

On December 7, 2017, Window to the World Communications announced its intent to purchase the WYCC license outright, reuniting the stations under one organization. An application to the FCC in January 2018 disclosed that WTTW would acquire the WYCC license from the City Colleges of Chicago for $100,000, with the two stations sharing WTTW&#x27;s frequency allocation. The sale was approved by the FCC on March 13, 2018, and was completed on April 20. 

Window to the World Communications relinquished the WYCC license, effective June 1, 2022, advising viewers the same shows were available on its multiplexed channels and the PBS app. 

==Technical achievements==
WTTW has been recognized as a pioneer in technical aspects of television broadcasting, particularly in broadcast audio transmission. The station, in particular, participated in the trend of pop music-focused programs on television during the early 1970s (a few of which were also simulcast on local FM radio stations). When WTTW began production on &quot;Made in Chicago&quot;, the station made the decision to transition from monaural audio to stereo for the FM broadcasts. However, stereo recording equipment for television production did not exist at that time. Because of this, WTTW engineers chose to modify existing Ampex quadruplex recorders to provide a stereo medium in sync with the video portion of the program. This innovation earned the station&#x27;s staff a local Technical Emmy Award in 1973.

Further refinements to this system resulted in improvements to both frequency response and noise reduction, and eventually led to the ability to edit stereo audio as the video was being edited electronically. Dolby Laboratories noise reduction technology (Type C, and then Type A) was introduced as the staff was driven to make improvements in the audio specifications. WTTW began syndicating &quot;Made in Chicago&quot; to other public television stations under the new title &quot;Soundstage&quot;, with the first official taping of that program in June 1974 featuring previously filmed concert footage of folk singer Jim Croce prior to his death in a plane crash in September 1973. The station was broadcast in simulcast FM stereo—with WXRT (93.1 FM) and WBBM-FM (96.3) as participating stations—in the manner of its predecessor.

In 1975, WTTW management was approached by a startup company called Telesonics with an idea to develop an audio system for television broadcasts that used a mono-compatible, stereo audio channel. Around this time, the Sears Tower had been completed and WTTW became one of the first broadcasters to move its transmitter facilities atop the new building; WTTW had broadcast from a temporary antenna as the now familiar twin towers that adorn the top of the building had not yet been completed.

==Programming==
WTTW carries programs distributed by PBS, American Public Television and other sources, along with airing several locally produced programs. WTTW also distributes several programs to public television stations independently of PBS, such as via American Public Television. In addition, WTTW is one of the few public television stations that regularly produce or present national public television programming. Its most prominent productions include political discussion program &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; and the music program &quot;Soundstage&quot;. WTTW has produced over 110 &quot;SoundStage&quot; episodes from its Chicago studios, the first of which featured Chicago blues legend Muddy Waters surrounded by his young proteges: Dr. John, Junior Wells, Michael Bloomfield, Koko Taylor, Rollo Radford, Buddy Guy, Nick Gravenites, Buddy Miles and his long-time collaborator, pianist Otis Spann among others.

WTTW also produced the popular cooking series &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot; during the 1980s. Other popular programs produced by WTTW for public television syndication have included the early art-video show &quot;Image Union&quot;; &quot;CEO Exchange&quot;; locally produced restaurant review show &quot;Check, Please!&quot; cooking show &quot;&quot;; travel show &quot;The Travel Detective&quot;; children&#x27;s programs &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot;, &quot;Kidsongs&quot;, &quot;WordWorld&quot; and &quot;Nature Cat&quot;; and the irreverent magazine series &quot;Wild Chicago&quot;.

The most well-known program ever to have been originated by WTTW was &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, the first movie review show to air on television. It began in 1975 with film critics Roger Ebert (then a critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;) and Gene Siskel (then with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;) as its hosts and was later hosted by Michael Medved, Neal Gabler, and Jeffrey Lyons when Siskel and Ebert moved into syndication (starting the show &quot;At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert&quot; and later &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;); &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; was canceled in 1996. In January 2011, WTTW produced a new movie review program created by Ebert, &quot;Ebert Presents: At the Movies&quot;, which was hosted by Christy Lemire and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, with Ebert himself hosting a segment called &quot;Roger&#x27;s Office&quot;; the program lasted one season, before being canceled due to funding constraints and the subsequent death of Ebert.

Among its local programs, WTTW also produces the newsmagazine and analysis program &quot;Chicago Tonight&quot;, hosted by Paris Schutz and Brandis Friedman. The program began in 1984 as a half-hour panel interview program with local broadcast journalist John Callaway, but was later expanded to an hour-long show with the addition of various feature segments including arts and restaurant reviews. The show is accompanied by two pre-recorded programs highlighting issues affecting Black and Latino communities, &quot;Chicago Tonight: Black Voices&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tonight: Latino Voices&quot;.

The station has produced hundreds of significant arts programs, highlighting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Ravinia Festival. In addition, WTTW features documentaries hosted by Geoffrey Baer, spotlighting the history and culture of various parts of the Chicago area. These programs&#x27; popularity has often resulted in a high volume of monetary pledges to the station. It also produces &quot;The Artsiders&quot;, an arts-focused program produced by Kai Harding, Inc. and created by former Big Idea director Chris Olsen.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
In May 2015, WTTW downgraded the resolution of its main channel from 1080i to 720p, which the station had previously transmitted its high definition content in prior to September 2009, during which time it downconverted HD content provided by PBS from their native 1080i format.

====WTTW-DT2====
From the sign-on of its digital signal in 2002 until 2008, WTTW branded its main digital channel on 11.1 as &quot;WTTW-Digital&quot;, featuring a full schedule of programs available in high definition, while digital subchannel 11.2 rebroadcast the main programming schedule of analog channel 11. In September 2008, digital channel 11.1 was converted into a simulcast of the analog signal&#x27;s programming, resulting in it carrying the same programming schedule as 11.2. On March 30, 2009, 11.2 was relaunched with a separate schedule as &quot;WTTW Prime&quot;, which features a mix of PBS prime time programs and WTTW&#x27;s locally produced programming—particularly during the period from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., when children&#x27;s programming airs on the main channel. WTTW Prime carries some PBS programs in their traditional timeslots (most notably, a block of the service&#x27;s public affairs programs that run on Friday evenings and a daily airing of the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; at 5:30 p.m.) WTTW Prime is also available on Comcast digital channel 370.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTTW shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 47, using virtual channel 11.

<text>WGN-TV (channel 9) is a television station in Chicago, Illinois, United States, serving as the local outlet for The CW. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s majority owner, Nexstar Media Group, and is sister to the company&#x27;s sole radio property, news/talk/sports station WGN (720 AM). WGN-TV&#x27;s studios are located on West Bradley Place in Chicago&#x27;s North Center community; as such, it is the only major commercial television station in Chicago which bases its main studio outside the Loop. Its transmitter is located atop the Willis Tower in the Loop.

The broadcast station signed on in 1948, under the ownership of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper. WGN-TV later became a pioneering superstation; on November 9, 1978, it became the second U.S. television station to be made available via satellite transmission to cable and direct-broadcast satellite subscribers nationwide. Later renamed WGN America, the former superstation feed was converted into a conventional basic cable network in December 2014, enabling it to be added to local cable providers, and later soft re-launched as NewsNation in September 2020. A charter affiliate of both The WB and of successor network The CW, WGN-TV reverted to being an independent station in 2016 before returning to the network in 2024.

WGN-TV, WGN radio and the now-defunct regional cable news channel Chicagoland Television (CLTV) were the three flagship properties of Tribune Broadcasting, itself part of the Tribune Media conglomerate (formerly known as the Tribune Company until August 2014), until the company&#x27;s purchase by Nexstar was completed in September 2019.

==History==
===Early years (1948–1956)===
The Chicago Tribune Company, headed by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editor and publisher Robert R. McCormick and the owner of WGN and WGNB submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on September 13, 1946, and under the &quot;WGN Incorporated&quot; subsidiary, to build a television station on VHF channel 9. After the FCC awarded the permit on November 8, the group originally requested to assign WGNA as the station&#x27;s call sign. By January 1948, however, the company decided to call its new television property WGN-TV after WGN, which had been owned by the &quot;Tribune&quot; since 1924. The three-letter base call sign served as an initialism for &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot;, a tagline and slogan used by the &quot;Tribune&quot; since 1909.
WGN-TV began test broadcasts on February 1, 1948, then informally signed on the air on March 6 to broadcast the 1948 Golden Gloves boxing finals from the Chicago Stadium. Regular programming commenced on April 5, 1948, at 7:45 p.m. with a two-hour-long special, &quot;WGN-TV Salute to Chicago&quot;. Originating from WGN Radio&#x27;s studios at the Tribune Tower&#x27;s Centennial Building annex in the Magnificent Mile district, the inaugural broadcast included dedicatory speeches from McCormick, Chicago Mayor Martin Kennelly, U.S. Senator Charles W. Brooks and Governor Dwight Green. Performances were led by, among others, musician Dick &quot;Two Ton&quot; Baker, comedian George Gobel, and bandleader Robert Trendler and the WGN Orchestra (WGN&#x27;s in-house band). Afterwards, a film previewed WGN-TV&#x27;s initial program offerings. At the time it signed on, there were only 1,700 operational television sets in Chicago; that number would jump dramatically to around 100,000 sets by April 1949.

WGN-TV was the second commercial television station in both Chicago and Illinois to sign on, as WBKB (channel 4) launched on September 6, 1946, but had operated on an experimental basis since 1940 as W9XBK. Two other stations joined WBKB and WGN-TV later in 1948: ABC&#x27;s WENR-TV (channel 7) on September 17 and NBC&#x27;s WNBQ (channel 5) on October 8. The &quot;Tribune&quot; quickly followed up WGN-TV&#x27;s launch with WPIX in New York City on June 15, 1948. Initially, WGN television and radio operated from the Chicago Daily News Building on West Madison and North Canal Streets, occupying space previously used by WMAQ radio from 1929 until relocating to the Merchandise Mart in 1935; WGN-TV also based its transmission tower atop the building. Originally broadcasting for hours per day from 2 to 6 p.m. and from 7:30 to 10 p.m. seven days a week, Channel 9 started out as an independent station, then began carrying programming from DuMont on September 26, 1948, and also CBS on December 1.

On January 11, 1949, WGN-TV—along with WNBQ and WENR-TV—began transmitting network programming over a live coaxial feed originating from New York City; this allowed Channel 9 to be able to carry a regular schedule of CBS and DuMont programs that could be transmitted as they aired in the Eastern Time Zone. WBKB-TV assumed primary rights to CBS programming on September 5, 1949; as such, WGN began dropping many CBS shows from its schedule but continued to carry certain network programs that channel 4 declined to broadcast (eventually being reduced strictly to CBS&#x27;s weekday morning soap opera block by 1952). During its tenure with DuMont, WGN-TV became one of that network&#x27;s strongest affiliates, as well as one of its major production centers. Several DuMont programs were produced from the station&#x27;s facilities during the late 1940s and the first half of the 1950s, including &quot;The Al Morgan Show&quot;, &quot;Chicago Symphony&quot;, &quot;Chicagoland Mystery Players&quot;, &quot;Music From Chicago&quot;, &quot;The Music Show&quot;, &quot;They Stand Accused&quot; (the first televised courtroom drama program), &quot;This is Music&quot;, &quot;Windy City Jamboree&quot; and &quot;Down You Go&quot;. WGN-TV had also telecast performances of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, beginning in 1953, during Fritz Reiner&#x27;s tenure as the orchestra&#x27;s music director.

On January 25, 1950, the WGN stations relocated their operations to the Centennial Building. Renovated to accommodate production and office facilities for WGN-TV, the facility included one master (which was situated on inflated rubber bags to eliminate outside noise and vibrations) and two auxiliary studios as well as a sub-basement studio situated below street level that could allow WGN-TV-AM and WGNB to continue broadcasts in the event of an atom bomb attack on Chicago. As part of United Paramount Theatres (UPT)&#x27;s merger with ABC, on February 6, 1953, CBS assumed ownership of WBKB-TV through a $6.75-million acquisition designed to allow UPT to acquire ABC-owned WENR-TV (which subsequently assumed the WBKB call letters and management staff that previously belonged to channel 4), in compliance with FCC regulations that then forbade common ownership of two television stations within the same market. As a consequence of the deal, CBS moved the remainder of its programming to the rechristened WBBM-TV on April 1; this left Channel 9 exclusively affiliated with the faltering DuMont. (WBBM would move from VHF channel 4 to VHF channel 2 on July 5, 1953, in accordance with allocation realignments dictated by the FCC-issued &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot;.) By 1954, WGN-TV expanded its broadcast schedule to 18 hours per day (running from 6 a.m. to midnight).

After McCormick succumbed from pneumonia-related complications on April 1, 1955, ownership of WGN-TV-AM, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the News Syndicate Company properties would transfer to the McCormick-Patterson Trust, assigned to the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation in the names of the non-familial heirs of McCormick (whose two marriages never produced any children) and familial heirs of Patterson. (The trust was dissolved in January 1975, with a majority of the trust&#x27;s former beneficiaries, including descendants of the McCormick and Patterson families, owning stock in the restructured Tribune Company entity—which assumed oversight of all properties previously overseen by the trust—afterward.)

===Independence (1956–1995)===
The station disaffiliated from DuMont when the network ceased operations on August 6, 1956, amid various issues stemming from its relations with Paramount Pictures that hamstrung DuMont from expansion. Because the three remaining commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) had each owned television stations in Chicago by this time, WGN-TV became an independent station by default. Under executive vice president and general manager Ward L. Quaal (whose stewardship of the station and programming efforts earned him the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences [NATAS]&#x27;s Governors&#x27; Award in 1966 and 1987), the station adopted a general entertainment format that would become typical of other major market independents up through the early 1990s, carrying a mix of sitcoms and drama series, feature films, cartoons and religious programs as well as locally produced news, public affairs, music and children&#x27;s programs. WGN-TV also became more reliant on sports programming, led by its broadcasts of Chicago Cubs baseball games as well as other regional collegiate and professional teams. This helped Channel 9 establish itself as a programming alternative to the market&#x27;s three network-owned stations and as the market&#x27;s leading independent for much of the next 39 years. After initial struggles due to its carriage of programs that could not accrue viewership sufficient to attract national advertisers, WGN began turning profitable by October 1957. On January 15, 1956, the station moved its transmitter facilities to a antenna on the roof of the Prudential Building on East Randolph Street and Michigan Avenue, and increased its effective radiated power from 120 kW to the maximum of 316 kW.

In March 1957, WGN began carrying programming from the NTA Film Network; the station served as the programming service&#x27;s primary Chicago affiliate, offering the majority of NTA&#x27;s program offerings. (The remaining, limited number of NTA shows not carried by WGN were split between ABC-owned WBKB-TV and NBC-owned WNBQ.) This relationship lasted until National Telefilm Associates discontinued the service in November 1961. On November 8, 1957, after conducting internal tests since the fall of 1956, WGN-TV—which had ordered RCA color television equipment in the fall of 1952—began broadcasting select programs in color, consisting primarily of syndicated programs available in the format. In January 1958, WGN became the second Chicago television station (after WNBQ, which began televising programs in the format in January 1954) to begin transmitting local programming in color; along with other color telecasting upgrades to its production and master control facilities, WGN was also the first television station in the world to use equipment (provided by Ampex) capable of videotape recording and playback of color telecasts. The first live program on the station to be broadcast in the format was &quot;Ding Dong School&quot;, a music-focused children&#x27;s program hosted by Jackie Van (which WGN picked up in 1957, following its cancellation by WNBQ). In 1958, WGN-TV earned a Peabody Award—the only local television station to earn the accolade—for its short-lived children&#x27;s program &quot;The Blue Fairy&quot; (which was hosted by Brigid Bazlen in the title role, and, along with &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot;, was one of the first two children&#x27;s programs produced by the station to be broadcast in color).

On June 27, 1961, the operations of WGN-TV and WGN radio were relocated to the WGN Mid-America Broadcast Center (later renamed the WGN Continental Broadcast Center and now simply referred to as WGN Studios), a two-story, complex on West Bradley Place in Chicago&#x27;s North Center community. The Broadcast Center, which began housing some local program production on January 16 of that year, was developed for color broadcasting—allowing the station to televise live studio shows as well as Chicago Cubs and White Sox baseball games in the format—and with civil defense concerns in mind to provide a safe location to conduct broadcasts in the event of a hostile attack (such as a bombing by a nuclear weapon) targeting downtown Chicago. It houses three main production soundstages as well as two additional soundstages that were originally used as sound recording studios for WGN Radio. The Tribune Company repurposed the former Centennial Building facility for the &quot;Chicago American&quot; (retitled &quot;Chicago Today&quot; in 1969), where the newspaper maintained office and publishing operations until it ceased publication in 1974; the space is occupied by a Dylan&#x27;s Candy Bar location. An adjacent , single-story building that housed certain non-production-related operations for the WGN stations was annexed into the facility (expanding the complex to ) in 1966.

In subsequent years, the Tribune Company gradually expanded its broadcasting unit, of which WGN-TV-AM served as its flagship stations, a tie forged in January 1966, when the subsidiary (sans the WPIX television and radio stations, which continued to be controlled by the Tribune-managed News Syndicate Co. before being fully integrated into the company&#x27;s main station group following its 1991 sale of the &quot;Daily News&quot;) was renamed the WGN Continental Broadcasting Company. In 1964, the company started Mid-America Video Tape Productions, which had eventually become WGN Continental Productions (later Tribune Entertainment). The group became known as the Tribune Broadcasting Company in January 1981, but retained the WGN Continental moniker as its &quot;de facto&quot; business name until 1984 and as the licensee for WGN-TV and WGN Radio thereafter. The company gained its third television and second radio station in 1960, when it purchased KDAL-TV (now KDLH) and KDAL in Duluth, Minnesota from the estate of the late Dalton LeMasurier (Tribune sold KDAL-TV in 1978 and KDAL radio in 1981); the company would later purchase KCTO (subsequently re-called KWGN-TV) in Denver from J. Elroy McCaw in 1966. Tribune&#x27;s later television purchases included those of WANX-TV (subsequently re-called WGNX, now WANF) in Atlanta (in 1983); KTLA in Los Angeles (in 1985); WPHL-TV in Philadelphia (in 1992); WLVI-TV in Boston (owned from 1994 to 2006); KHTV (now KIAH) in Houston (in 1995); KTTY (now KSWB-TV) in San Diego (in 1996); KCPQ and KTWB-TV (now KZJO) in Seattle (in 1998 and 1999, respectively); and WBDC-TV (now WDCW) in Washington, D.C. (in 1999). Six other stations—including KDAF in Dallas–Fort Worth and WDZL (now WSFL-TV) in Miami—were added through its purchase of Renaissance Broadcasting in July 1996, and two more were added through its November 1999 acquisition of the Quincy Jones- and Tribune-owned consortium Qwest Broadcasting (forcing the sale of WGNX to the Meredith Corporation in order to acquire Qwest&#x27;s Atlanta property, WATL). Finally in December 2013, Tribune purchased Local TV&#x27;s 19 television stations, giving WGN new sister stations in nearby markets—ABC affiliate WQAD-TV in Davenport, Iowa (serving the Quad Cities region that encompasses parts of northwestern Illinois and southeastern Iowa) and Fox affiliate WITI in Milwaukee—all three of which had pooled their local news reports as part of an existing content and broadcast management agreement formed between Local TV and Tribune in 2008.

WGN-TV was Chicago&#x27;s leading independent station during the 1960s and into the 1970s, even as it gained its first four competitors on UHF, one of which would not last more than a year. Locally based Weigel Broadcasting signed on WCIU-TV (channel 26) on February 6, 1964, with a multi-ethnic programming format. On January 4, 1966, New Television Chicago—a joint venture between Field Communications (which, through parent Field Enterprises, was a sister property to the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s main newspaper rivals, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, at the time) and local advertising firm Froelich &amp; Friedland—signed on WFLD (channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station), which would grow to become WGN&#x27;s strongest independent competitor in the area. On May 18, 1969, Aurora-based WLXT-TV (channel 60) signed on with a mix of sporting events and a limited schedule of syndicated programs and local newscasts, operating part-time on weekday evenings and on weekends. (WLXT would cease operations on July 17, 1970.) A fourth competitor arrived on April 5, 1970, when Essaness Television Corporation signed on WSNS-TV (channel 44, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station). WFLD and WSNS went head to head for supremacy as Chicago&#x27;s second strongest independent station, and were the only independents in the market besides WGN that were able to turn a reasonable profit; in contrast, WCIU and all of the other competitors that came afterward lagged behind in terms of both ratings and revenue. (WSNS would bow out of the competition in 1982, when, after two years of carrying the over-the-air subscription service only at night on weekdays and for most of the daytime and evening hours on weekends, it converted into a full-time outlet of ONTV.) WGN-TV served as the Chicago affiliate of the United Network for its one month of existence from May to June 1967, when financial issues forced the shuttering of the fledgling network.

In May 1969, the station relocated its transmitter facilities to the -tall west antenna tower of the John Hancock Center on North Michigan Avenue. The original Prudential Building transmitter remained in use as an auxiliary facility until the transmitter dish was disassembled in 1984. WGN also served as a charter member of the Operation Prime Time syndication service, which was launched in 1976 as a consortium founded by Al Masini and a committee of executives with 18 independent stations (including WGN-TV, which was represented by then-station manager and WGN Continental Broadcasting Vice President Sheldon Cooper) represented by Masini&#x27;s advertising sales firm TeleRep, offering a mix of miniseries as well as first-run syndicated programs that would be featured on the partner stations (including &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Star Search&quot; and &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, all of which aired on Channel 9 during the 1980s and early 1990s).

Movies became a more integral part of WGN&#x27;s schedule during the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, depending on whether sports events or specials were scheduled, Channel 9 usually aired four daily features—one in the morning, and two to three films per night—Monday through Friday, and between three and six films per day on Saturdays and Sundays. Among its regular film showcases were &quot;WGN [Television] Presents&quot; (which aired during the late access slot weeknights from 1948 to 1995, on Saturdays until 1979 and on Sundays until 1997) and &quot;Action Theater&quot; (a showcase of action and adventure films that ran on midday Sundays from 1952 to 1956 and, later, in Saturday late access from 1979 to 2001). In February 1977, the station also began carrying a nightly prime time feature at 8 p.m., replacing syndicated dramas that had been airing in the timeslot. (The prime time films were pushed to 7 p.m. in March 1980, in accordance with the shift of its late-evening newscast into prime time). By January 1980, when WGN became the market&#x27;s second television station to offer a 24-hour schedule (after WBBM-TV, which adopted such a schedule in 1976), the station began to regularly feature an overnight presentation of older black-and-white and some more recent theatrical and made-for-TV movies at 1 a.m. (later 3 a.m. by September 1983), along with a few recent first-run syndicated and older off-network syndicated programs.

===WGN goes national (1978–1995)===
WGN-TV began to extend its reach outside of the Chicago area beginning in the mid-1970s, when its signal began to be transmitted via microwave relay to cable television providers in areas of the central Midwestern United States that lacked access to an entertainment-based independent station. By the fall of 1978, the Channel 9 signal was transmitted to 574 cable systems—covering most of Western, Central and Southern Illinois as well as large swaths of Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Michigan—reaching an estimated 8.6 million subscribers. On November 9, 1978, Tulsa, Oklahoma–based satellite carrier United Video Inc. uplinked the WGN-TV signal to a Satcom-3 transponder for distribution to cable and C-band satellite subscribers throughout the United States. (United Video uplinked the station&#x27;s signal without WGN Continental Broadcasting&#x27;s consent, using a legal exemption in the 1976 Copyright Act&#x27;s compulsory license statute allowing &quot;passive&quot; carriers to retransmit broadcast signals without first seeking the licensee&#x27;s express permission.) This resulted in WGN-TV joining the ranks of Atlanta independent station WTCG (later WTBS and now WPCH-TV) to become America&#x27;s second national &quot;superstation&quot;, independent stations distributed via satellite to cable providers within their respective regions, or throughout the country.

Within a week of attaining national status, WGN-TV added approximately 200 cable systems in various parts of the United States (reaching an estimated one million subscribers) to its total distribution. That cable reach would grow over the next several years: the first heaviest concentrations of availability outside the Midwest developed in the Central U.S. (where WGN&#x27;s telecasts of Chicago Cubs baseball, Chicago Bulls basketball and &quot;The Bozo Show&quot; became highly popular) and gradually expanded to encompass most of the nation. Tribune and station management treated WGN-TV as a &quot;passive&quot; superstation, asserting a neutral position over United Video relaying its signal to a national audience and leaving United to handle national promotion of the WGN signal, instead of handling those responsibilities directly; this allowed the station to continue paying for syndicated programming and advertising at local rates rather than those comparable to other national networks. (Until Tribune began relaying the Chicago feed to the firm directly in 1985, the company was also not compensated directly by United Video for their retransmission or promotion of WGN&#x27;s signal; Tribune, however, received royalties from cable systems for programs to which it held the copyright.) As such, WGN-TV became the first Tribune-owned independent station to be distributed to a national pay television audience (United Video would later uplink WPIX in May 1984, Netlink began distributing KWGN-TV in October 1987 and Eastern Microwave Inc. began distributing KTLA in February 1988) and the first superstation to be distributed by United Video (with WGN and WPIX being joined by Gaylord Broadcasting-owned KTVT [now a CBS owned-and-operated station] in Dallas–Fort Worth in July 1984 and, after it assumed retransmission rights from Eastern Microwave, KTLA in April 1988). For about eleven years afterward, the WGN-TV satellite signal carried the same programming shown within the Chicago market.

As it gained national exposure, Channel 9 underestimated WFLD&#x27;s ability to acquire top-rated, off-network syndicated programs. WFLD&#x27;s respective owners during this timeframe—Field Communications and Metromedia, the latter of which acquired WFLD in 1982 as part of Field and partner company Kaiser Broadcasting&#x27;s concurring exits from the television industry—were particularly aggressive in their programming acquisitions as they leveraged their independent stations in other major and mid-sized markets for the strongest programs among those entering into syndication. Channel 32 began strengthening its syndication slate in the fall of 1979, when it acquired the local rights to off-network series such as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which helped it edge ahead of WGN-TV in the ratings by the end of that year. Not to stay outdone, after Tribune appointed Robert King to replace Sheldon Cooper (who was promoted to president and CEO of the upstart Tribune Entertainment syndication unit) as the station&#x27;s general manager in 1982, WGN-TV began making its own efforts to acquire stronger first-run and off-network syndicated programs, gaining the rights to series such as &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. WGN&#x27;s ratings improved throughout the 1980s under the stewardship of King and his successor, Dennis FitzSimons (who would later elevate to President of Tribune Broadcasting, and later to Executive Vice President and then Chairman/CEO of the Tribune Company before stepping down in 2007), firmly overtaking WFLD to again become the market&#x27;s top-rated independent by the end of the decade.

WGN-TV would gain two additional UHF independent competitors over the course of eight months in the early 1980s. On September 18, 1981, Focus Broadcasting signed on Joliet-based WFBN (channel 66, now WGBO-DT), initially running a mix of local public-access programs during the daytime hours and the Spectrum subscription service at night. Then on April 4, 1982, a shared operation over UHF channel 60 launched, involving Metrowest Corporation-owned English-language outlet WPWR-TV (which primarily carried the sports-centered pay service Sportsvision) and HATCO-60-owned Spanish-language outlet WBBS-TV (now UniMás owned-and-operated station WXFT-DT). (WBBS took over channel 60 full-time after WPWR moved to channel 50 in January 1987, as a byproduct of Metrowest&#x27;s 1986 buyout of HATCO-60&#x27;s share of the license and subsequent sale of the allocation to the Home Shopping Network.) WGN and WFLD remained the market&#x27;s strongest independent stations as they both had more robust programming inventories than their competitors.

In August 1983, WGN-TV unveiled one of the most successful station image campaigns in the United States with the launch of the &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Very Own&quot; campaign. (The slogan—to which WGN holds the trademark rights and by the station—is a variant of the &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Own&quot; tagline that had been used in on-air identifications periodically since the 1960s.) Developed by Peter Marino (WGN-TV&#x27;s director of promotions at the time) and Mike Waterkotte (then the creative director of now-defunct Chicago advertising agency Eisaman, Johns &amp; Law), the campaign promotions focused on the city&#x27;s people and cultural heritage as well as WGN-TV&#x27;s local programming efforts, and were accompanied by an imaging theme performed by legendary R&amp;B singer and Chicago native Lou Rawls. The seven-note musical signature of the image theme was also incorporated into two associated music packages that were used for the station&#x27;s newscasts and identifications between 1984 and 1993, while the slogan has served as the title for two other news themes commissioned exclusively for WGN-TV in subsequent years (a John Hegner-composed package used from 1993 to 1997 and a 615 Music-composed package that has been used since November 1, 2007) as well as for a weekly profile series that aired from 1988 until 1990 and would evolve into a continuing weekly 9 p.m. news segment. At various points over the years, the &quot;[city/region]&#x27;s Very Own&quot; slogan was also adapted by some of its Tribune-owned sister stations (such as WPIX, KTLA and WTTV in Indianapolis). On November 10, 1984, WGN-TV became an affiliate of the MGM/UA Premiere Network ad hoc syndicated film service.

On November 22, 1987, during that evening&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the WGN-TV signal was briefly overridden by video of an unidentified person wearing a Max Headroom mask and sunglasses in front of a sheet of corrugated metal imitating the moving electronic background effect used in the character&#x27;s TV and movie appearances. However, oscillating audio interference obscured the audio portion throughout the 13-second video excerpt; WGN engineers were able to successfully restore the signal by changing the frequency of its Hancock Center studio transmitter link to override the pirated feed. The extended video, as seen during the roughly 90-second-long hijack occurring later that night during a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode on PBS member station WTTW (channel 11), featured several references to WGN-TV (including the masked person mocking fill-in sports anchor and WGN Radio sports commentator Chuck Swirsky as a &quot;frickin&#x27; nerd&quot; and a &quot;frickin&#x27; liberal&quot;, and referring to his pretend defecation as a &quot;masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds&quot;, paraphrasing the WGN callsign&#x27;s meaning). Bemused, sports anchor Dan Roan—who was presenting highlights of that afternoon&#x27;s home game between the Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions (which the Bears won, 30–10) when the initial hijack took place at 9:14 p.m.—commented, &quot;Well, if you&#x27;re wondering what happened, so am I,&quot; and joked that the master control computer &quot;took off and went wild&quot;. (The perpetrators of the WGN and WTTW intrusions have never been caught or identified.)

On May 18, 1988, the FCC reinstituted the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule (&quot;SyndEx&quot;), a rule—previously repealed by the agency in July 1980—that allows television stations to claim local exclusivity over syndicated programs and requires cable systems to either black out or secure an agreement with the claimant station or a syndication distributor to continue carrying a claimed program through an out-of-market station. To indemnify cable systems from potential blackouts, when the rules went into effect on January 1, 1990, United Video began offering a separate WGN national feed consisting of local and some syndicated programs as well as sporting events—except those subjected to league restrictions pertaining to the number of games that could be shown on out-of-market stations annually—that aired on the WGN Chicago signal, and substitute programs not subjected to exclusivity claims. (The feed was originally structured similarly to the concurrently launched WWOR EMI Service feed of Secaucus, New Jersey–based WWOR-TV, albeit with a larger amount of shared programming. However, the amount of common programming between the WGN local and national feeds would decrease significantly during the 2000s and early 2010s as local exclusivity claims reduced the number of WGN-TV programs that Tribune could clear nationally in later years.) Of the four United Video-distributed superstations, WGN was the only one to increase its national coverage after the SyndEx rules were implemented, adding 2.2 million subscribers by July 1990; some systems also replaced WPIX and WWOR with the WGN superstation feed during the early 1990s.

Among the various community projects in which the station has been involved include the WGN-TV Children&#x27;s Charities, a charitable foundation established in 1990 through the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation, benefitting various local organizations that help local children dealing with poverty and medical issues. On January 1, 1993, Tribune launched Chicagoland Television (CLTV), a local cable news channel that featured rolling news, weather and sports content and public affairs, sports-talk and entertainment news programs, along with having formerly acted as an overflow feed for WGN&#x27;s sports telecasts. Originally utilizing its own in-house staff and resources from WGN-TV and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, CLTV consolidated its operations with WGN-TV on August 28, 2009, at which time the channel&#x27;s operations were relocated from its original studio facility in Oak Brook to WGN-TV&#x27;s Bradley Place studios and editorial control of CLTV was turned over to Channel 9&#x27;s news department. CLTV&#x27;s format soon became less reliant on live newscasts, focusing increasingly on repurposed newscasts and local programming from WGN-TV. Following its acquisition of Tribune Media, Nexstar shut down Chicagoland Television on December 31, 2019, after 27 years of operation.

===WB affiliation (1995–2006)===

On November 2, 1993, Time Warner and Tribune (which would acquire an 11 percent interest in the network in August 1995) announced the formation of The WB Television Network. Tribune committed six of the seven independent stations it owned at the time to serve as charter affiliates of The WB, though it initially exempted WGN-TV from the agreement, as station management had expressed concerns about how the network&#x27;s plans to expand its prime time and daytime program offerings would affect WGN&#x27;s sports broadcast rights and the impact that the potential of having to phase out its sports telecasts to fulfill network commitments would have on the superstation feed&#x27;s appeal to cable and satellite providers elsewhere around the United States. Ironically, despite its concerns with taking the WB affiliation, WGN had also vied to become the Chicago affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN), a joint venture between Chris-Craft/United Television and Paramount Television that announced its launch plans on October 21. On November 10, 1993, Paramount announced it had reached an agreement to affiliate UPN with then-Newsweb Corporation-owned WPWR-TV, which, upon the network&#x27;s January 16, 1995, launch, would become the largest UPN affiliate not to be owned by either of its parent companies.

On December 3, 1993, Tribune reached a separate agreement with Time Warner that would allow WGN-TV to serve as The WB&#x27;s Chicago affiliate and allow its companion superstation feed to act as a de facto national WB feed until the network was able to fill remaining gaps in affiliate coverage in &quot;white area&quot; markets that lacked a standalone independent station following its launch. In exchange, The WB agreed to reduce its initial program offerings to one night per week (from two) in order to limit conflicts with WGN&#x27;s sports programming. The superstation feed, which reached 37 percent of the country by that time, would extend the network&#x27;s initial coverage to 73 percent of all U.S. households that had at least one television set. (Prior to that deal, The WB had considered affiliating with WGBO-TV, which Univision would later purchase and convert into an owned-and-operated station of the Spanish-language network on December 30, 1994. United Video intended to provide an alternate feed of WGN with substitute programming for markets with a WB affiliate; however, no such measure was taken, creating network duplication in markets where over-the-air WB affiliates were forced to compete with the WGN cable feed.) WGN-TV (and its superstation feed) became a charter affiliate of The WB when the network launched on January 11, 1995. Upon joining The WB, WGN&#x27;s programming remained basically unchanged, continuing to feature syndicated programs, feature films, and locally produced shows. As The WB initially offered prime time programs only on Wednesdays at launch, Channel 9 filled the 7 to 9 p.m. time slot leading into its late-evening newscast with feature films or, from September 1995 until September 1997, programs from the ad-hoc Action Pack syndication block on nights when sports events were not scheduled to air. By the time The WB adopted a six-night-a-week schedule (running Sunday through Fridays) in September 1999, the station had relegated its prime time film presentations to Saturday nights.

Channel 9 chose not to clear the network&#x27;s Kids&#x27; WB block, in favor of airing a local morning newscast and an afternoon sitcom block on weekdays and a mix of news, public affairs and paid programs on Saturday mornings. On February 19, WCIU-TV—which had become an English-language independent full-time as a result of Univision (from which it had aired programming on a part-time basis) moving to WGBO the month prior—reached an agreement with Time Warner to carry the Kids&#x27; WB lineup as well as to take on responsibilities of airing WB programs at times when WGN was scheduled to air sporting events during prime time. (Although the network&#x27;s programming was split between WGN-TV and WCIU locally beginning with the Kids&#x27; WB block&#x27;s September 9, 1995, debut, the WGN superstation feed carried The WB&#x27;s prime time &quot;and&quot; children&#x27;s programs until the stopgap network feed was discontinued.) Even as Chicago&#x27;s network-owned stations began adopting network-centric station branding during the mid-to-late 1990s, WGN-TV continued to be referred to on-air as either &quot;WGN Channel 9&quot; or simply &quot;Channel 9&quot;; by 1999, the station began to be referred to mainly by the WGN call letters (as had been the case with the national feed since 1997). By that time, WGN replaced its late-night feature film presentations (except for the Saturday &quot;Action Theater&quot; showcase) with syndicated sitcoms.

During the latter half of the 1990s, most of The WB&#x27;s remaining national coverage gaps began to be filled through standalone affiliations with UPN charter affiliates, leftover independents and former noncommercial stations as well as dual affiliations with various existing network outlets (mainly UPN stations) within the top-100 media markets, and through the September 1998 launch of The WeB (subsequently renamed The WB 100+ Station Group), a packaged feed of WB network and syndicated programs provided to participating cable-based affiliates in the 110 smallest markets. In January 1999, Time Warner and Tribune mutually agreed to stop relaying WB programming over the WGN superstation feed effective that fall; when this move took effect on October 6, the WGN national feed replaced The WB&#x27;s prime time and children&#x27;s program lineups, respectively, with movies and syndicated programs. By 2002, game shows and additional talk and reality series had been added to the station&#x27;s schedule, while syndicated animated series were added on weekend mornings. WGN-TV—which continued to carry the network locally—began clearing the entire WB network schedule in September 2004, when it assumed the rights to the Kids&#x27; WB lineup from WCIU-TV, effectively becoming the sole remaining station in the Chicago market to run cartoons on weekday afternoons. WGN continued to carry Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s remaining Saturday morning lineup (which initially aired on a tape-delayed basis on Sunday mornings), after The WB replaced the block&#x27;s two-hour weekday afternoon slot with the Daytime WB rerun block in January 2006.

===Affiliation with The CW and superstation programming split (2006–2016)===
On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced the formation of The CW, a network that would initially feature a mix of programs originating on The WB and UPN—which Time Warner and CBS, respectively, would shut down in concurrence with The CW&#x27;s launch—as well as new series developed specifically for the CW schedule. In conjunction with the launch announcement, Tribune signed a ten-year agreement involving sixteen of the group&#x27;s 19 WB affiliates (including WGN-TV), which would join eleven UPN stations owned by CBS to form The CW&#x27;s initial group of charter affiliates. Because The CW primarily chose its original affiliates based on the highest overall viewership in each market among the pool of existing WB and UPN affiliates, WGN-TV was chosen as its Chicago affiliate over WPWR-TV, as Channel 9 had been the higher-rated of the two stations dating to WPWR&#x27;s sign-on. On February 22, Fox announced that WPWR and nine other non-Fox-O&amp;O stations (eight UPN stations, consisting of four in other major markets where The CW chose to align with a Tribune station and four based in non-Tribune markets, and one independent station) would become the initial charter outlets of MyNetworkTV, a joint venture between Fox Television Stations and Twentieth Television meant to fill the two weeknight prime time hours that would be opened up on UPN- and WB-affiliated stations that were not chosen to become CW charter outlets. The CW did not commission the WGN national feed—which became known as Superstation WGN in November 2002 and then as WGN America in August 2008—to act as a national default feed for the network, as it was able to maintain sufficient national coverage at launch through conventional over-the-air and digital multicast affiliates in the 100 largest markets as well as supplementary coverage in the remaining 110 markets through The CW Plus, a small-market feed comprising primary and subchannel-only over-the-air affiliates as well as cable-only affiliates that were part of the predecessor WB 100+ service.

Channel 9 remained an affiliate of The WB until the network ceased operations on September 17, 2006; it became a charter affiliate of The CW when that network debuted the following day on September 18. WPWR, meanwhile, had disaffiliated from UPN on September 4 and began carrying MyNetworkTV programming upon that network&#x27;s September 5 launch. As a CW affiliate, WGN-TV had been one of the network&#x27;s higher-rated affiliates in terms of overall viewership, often drawing more viewers than Fox-owned WFLD—even in prime time, despite the latter&#x27;s Fox programming. Channel 9 carried the entire CW schedule from the network&#x27;s launch, including its children&#x27;s program blocks (Kids&#x27; WB, The CW4Kids/Toonzai, Vortexx and One Magnificent Morning); however, from September 2013 to September 2016, WGN had aired the network&#x27;s daytime talk show block—which had been reduced to one hour (from two) in September 2011—one hour earlier (at 2 p.m.) than other CW affiliates in the Central Time Zone, aligning with the block&#x27;s East Coast airtime. WGN-TV gradually evolved its programming slate during the late 2000s and 2010s, adopting a news-intensive format (expanding its newscast production to 70 hours per week by 2016), and shifting its weekday daytime lineup towards mainly first-run talk and game shows during the daytime hours; as fewer film packages were offered on the syndication market, its weekend schedule also began relying less on feature films and shifted to incorporate local lifestyle and tourism programs as well as additional first-run and off-network syndicated shows.

On April 1, 2007, Chicago-based real estate investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company in an $8.2-billion leveraged buyout that gave Tribune employees stock and effective ownership of the company. The transaction and concurring privatization of the company was completed upon termination of Tribune stock at the close of trading on December 20, 2007. Prior to the sale&#x27;s closure, WGN-TV was one of two commercial television stations in the Chicago market, not counting network-owned stations, to have never been involved in an ownership transaction (along with WCIU-TV, which has been owned by Weigel Broadcasting since its February 1964 sign-on). On December 8, 2008, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing a debt load of around $13 billion—making it the largest media bankruptcy in American corporate history—that it accrued from the Zell buyout and related privatization costs as well as a sharp downturn in revenue from newspaper advertising. After a protracted four-year process, on December 31, 2012, Tribune formally exited from bankruptcy under the control of its senior debt holders, Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co. On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced plans to split off its broadcasting and newspaper interests into two separate companies. WGN-TV and WGN Radio would remain with the original entity, which was renamed Tribune Media and was restructured to focus on the company&#x27;s broadcasting, digital and real estate properties; the newspaper division—which, in addition to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, included publications such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;—was spun off into the standalone entity Tribune Publishing (known as Tronc from June 2016 until the company reverted to its former name in October 2018). The split was completed on August 4, 2014, ending the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s joint ownership with WGN-TV and WGN Radio after 66 and 94 years, respectively. However, WGN-TV continues to maintain a content partnership with the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

On December 13, 2014, Tribune converted the WGN America national feed into a conventional cable channel that would focus on acquired and original programs, containing significantly more domestic and internationally acquired programming than the channel did prior to its separation from WGN-TV, and switched from a royalty to a retransmission consent revenue model. As a result, WGN America immediately ceased simulcasts of WGN-TV&#x27;s Chicago-originated local programming (which was limited to its weekday noon and [until that simulcast was dropped the previous February] nightly 9 p.m. newscasts, select news specials, public affairs programs, special events and sports telecasts, alongside a limited number of off-network syndicated reruns, religious programs and feature films acquired for the Chicago feed). Starting with its addition to Comcast Xfinity&#x27;s Chicago-area systems on December 16, the changeover allowed cable and IPTV subscribers within the market—as local satellite viewers had been able to do for about two decades—to receive WGN America for the first time. (As a result of the October 2007 separation of TBS from its Atlanta parent WTBS, WGN America had been the last remaining national superstation to be distributed to cable, IPTV, fiber optic &quot;and&quot; satellite television providers, whereas the other six remaining superstations are distributed outside their home regions mainly on satellite.) Due to the separation of the local and national feeds, WGN-TV did not carry WGN America&#x27;s original drama series (such as &quot;Salem&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot;) outside of preview promotions, limiting the local availability of these programs to subscribers of DirecTV and Dish Network and through WGN America&#x27;s streaming agreement with Hulu. WGN-TV would regain national availability in the spring of 2015, when Channel Master included the Chicago feed among the initial offerings of its LinearTV over-the-top streaming service.

===Return to independence (2016–2024)===
On May 23, 2016, after a year of protracted negotiations pertaining to financial terms (including the share of reverse compensation that Tribune would pay to keep CW programming on those stations), Tribune Broadcasting and CW managing partner CBS Corporation reached a five-year agreement that allowed twelve of Tribune&#x27;s thirteen CW-affiliated stations to remain with the network through 2021. Tribune exempted WGN-TV from the renewed agreement, intending to free up its schedule to offer an increased schedule of Chicago Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks games in prime time during the calendar year, thereby giving WGN over-the-air exclusivity over all sporting events it is contracted to broadcast for the first time since 1993. The WB and The CW each contractually limited the number of network program preemptions, other than those caused by long-form breaking news coverage, that could occur on an annual basis; in compliance with these restrictions, WGN-TV purchased airtime on CLTV (from 1993 to 2002), WCIU-TV (from 1999 to 2015) and WPWR-TV (from 2015 to 2016) to carry certain game telecasts that the station was contracted to produce (totaling roughly 30 per year). WB and CW network programs subjected to sports-induced displacements on their regular nights were shown on a tape-delayed basis later in the week (usually in a graveyard slot or on a weekend evening timeslot not occupied by a scheduled game telecast, as neither The WB nor The CW has ever aired prime time programs on Saturdays and as The CW had embargoed providing programs on Sundays from September 2009 until October 2018).

Concurrently, Fox announced that WPWR would take over as Chicago&#x27;s CW affiliate (marking the second time that Fox Television Stations had owned a CW-affiliated station, as, under an existing contract that was already scheduled to expire before that station&#x27;s conversion into a Fox O&amp;O was announced, Charlotte sister station WJZY continued to carry the network&#x27;s programming for about 3½ months after its purchase by Fox was finalized in April 2013). Channel 9 reverted to independent status—marking the first time in 21 years that it was not affiliated with a major broadcast network—on September 1, filling timeslots previously occupied by CW network shows mainly with additional syndicated programs on weekdays and an expanded weekend morning newscast, station-produced lifestyle programs and syndicated educational programs on weekends. Beginning the same day, all CW programming concurrently moved to WPWR-TV (resulting in the weeknight-only MyNetworkTV schedule being shifted to air on a three-hour delay from 10 p.m. to midnight). As such, WPWR displaced WLVI in Boston as the largest CW station that is not owned by either Tribune or CBS Corporation. (The CW would eventually move to WCIU-TV on September 1, 2019, marking the first time that channel 26—which had maintained part-time affiliations with the Spanish International Network and successor Univision, NetSpan/Telemundo, and The WB [by way of Kids&#x27; WB] at various points between 1968 and 2004—had ever served as a full-time network affiliate.)

===Aborted sale to Sinclair Broadcast Group; sale to Nexstar Media Group===

Sinclair Broadcast Group announced their purchase of Tribune Media on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion, a deal publicly met with consternation among station employees due to concerns about the influence the conservative-leaning group could potentially have on WGN&#x27;s news content. In order to meet regulatory compliance, Sinclair opted to divest WGN-TV to a limited liability company controlled by Baltimore-based automotive dealer Steven Fader—who has acted as a business associate to Sinclair executive chairman David Smith—for $60 million. Under the terms of the deal, Sinclair planned to operating the station through programming and sales service agreements, and would hold an option to repurchase with eight years. Following public criticism of the proposed deal with Fader by FCC chairman Ajit Pai, Sinclair abandoned the deal and disclosed it would instead acquire WGN-TV directly. Despite this, the FCC instead voted to bring the merger up for a hearing by an administrative law judge, prompting Tribune Media to terminate the deal on August 9, 2018, and file a breach of contract lawsuit.

Following the collapse of the Sinclair merger, Nexstar Media Group agreed to acquire Tribune&#x27;s assets on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The transaction received approval by the FCC on September 16, 2019, and finalized three days later.

===Return to CW as an O&amp;O (since 2024)===
On May 1, 2024, it was announced that WGN-TV would rejoin The CW after the network&#x27;s current affiliation agreement with WCIU-TV expires on August 31, with the return occurring the next day on September 1. As Nexstar is the majority owner of The CW, this makes WGN a network owned-and-operated station, the second-largest directly owned after KTLA.

==Programming==

===Locally produced programs===
WGN-TV currently produces the following programs, some of which were previously rebroadcast on CLTV:
* ( &quot;Onward, Chicago&quot;) is a bi-weekly public affairs program (airing Saturdays every two weeks at 6:30 a.m.) that debuted on February 19, 2000, and was originally hosted by former WGN-TV assignment reporter Eddie Arruza. Currently hosted by Lourdes Duarte (who also co-anchors the 4 p.m. hour of the &quot;WGN Evening News&quot;), it features topical discussions, interviews and feature segments focusing on Chicago&#x27;s Hispanic community and culture.
* &quot;People to People&quot; is a bi-weekly public affairs program (airing most Saturdays at 6:30 a.m.) that debuted in 1973, with local civil rights leader Edwin C. &quot;Bill&quot; Berry as its original host. Currently hosted by Micah Materre (who also serves as weeknight co-anchor of the &quot;WGN Evening News&quot; and the 9 and 10 p.m. newscasts), the program community events and topical discussions focusing on the African-American community.
* &quot;Daytime Chicago&quot; is a morning lifestyle program (airing weekdays at 10 a.m.) that premiered on September 13, 2021. Hosted by weekend morning anchor Tonya Francisco and former assignment reporter Amy Rutledge, it features conventional and segments focusing on subjects such as fashion, cooking, travel and the arts.
* &quot;Spotlight Chicago&quot; is an afternoon lifestyle program (airing weekdays at 1 p.m.) that premiered on September 11, 2023. Hosted by Ji Suk Yi and former &quot;WGN Morning News&quot; traffic reporter Sarah Jindra, it features segments centered around local events around Chicagoland, stories on local residents and organizations making a difference in the community, and feature visits to area attractions.
* &quot;WGN-TV Political Report&quot;, which airs Sundays at 9 a.m. and premiered on January 12, 2020, is a weekly political talk show in which hosts Paul Lisnek (who serves as WGN-TV&#x27;s political analyst and hosted a similar daily evening program, &quot;Politics Tonight&quot;, from 2007 until CLTV&#x27;s closure in December 2019) and Tahman Bradley (who serves as the station&#x27;s weekend evening anchor and political reporter) provide analysis on Chicago-area and national political issues.
* &quot;BackStory with Larry Potash&quot; is a half-hour historical series that premiered on October 18, 2018. Hosted by &quot;WGN Morning News&quot; anchor/assignment reporter Larry Potash and airing Sundays at 11 p.m., the program looks at interesting stories pertaining to history, culture, religion and science within and outside of Chicago.

Channel 9 became known for its heavy schedule of local programs during the period from the 1950s through the 1980s, including some influential programs:
* &quot;The Bozo Show&quot;, a long-running children&#x27;s program that aired under various titles and formats—including as &quot;Bozo&quot; (1960–1961), &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot; (1961–1980) and &quot;The Bozo Super Sunday Show&quot; (1994–2001) as well as the short-lived prime time spin-off &quot;Big Top&quot; (1965–1967)—from June 20, 1960, until July 14, 2001. The program was WGN-TV&#x27;s most successful local program in terms of both ratings and cultural impact, and became the most well-known iteration of the &quot;Bozo&quot; franchise partly as a result of the exposure it received after WGN became a national superstation in 1978. &quot;Bozo&quot; originated as a live, half-hour midday broadcast (expanding to a full hour in September 1961) featuring comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoon shorts and in-studio games. The titular clown was portrayed by Bob Bell until 1984 and by Joey D&#x27;Auria thereafter, and featured additional characters such as Ringmaster Ned (Ned Locke, 1961–1976), Sandy the Tramp (Don Sandburg, 1961–1969), Oliver O. Oliver (Ray Rayner, 1961–1971), Cooky the Cook (Roy Brown, 1968–1994), Wizzo the Wizard (Marshall Brodien, 1968–1994) and the circus manager (Frazier Thomas, 1976–1985). At the peak of its popularity, ticket reservations for the show&#x27;s studio audience surpassed a ten-year backlog. (WGN-TV management would discontinue the wait list in 1990, and began awarding tickets through a contest-style giveaway.) In response to Chicago Public Schools rule changes that disallowed students from going home for lunch, the program was moved to weekday mornings and switched to a pre-taped format in August 1980; to accommodate the launch of the &quot;WGN Morning News&quot;, &quot;Bozo&quot; was relegated to Sunday mornings in September 1994, remaining there until it was controversially discontinued by station management in 2001. For the final four years of its run, &quot;The Bozo Super Sunday Show&quot; was restructured to incorporate segments compliant with FCC educational programming requirements.
* ( &quot;Chatting&quot;), a Spanish-language talk show focusing on Chicago&#x27;s Hispanic and Latino community (originally airing on Saturday mornings until 1992, when it was moved to Sundays) that aired from 1964 to 1999. Peter Nuno hosted the program for its entire 35-year run before retiring from WGN-TV in December 1999.
* &quot;Creature Features&quot;, a local version of the horror film franchise which aired Saturday nights from September 19, 1970, until May 19, 1976, showcasing classic horror and science fiction films released between the 1930s and the 1950s (many of which were Universal Studios releases). The films were presented by a disembodied voice known only as &quot;The Creature&quot; (voiced, at respective times, by WGN news anchors Carl Greyson and Marty McNeeley). After the WGN version ended, the title (unpluralized as &quot;Creature Feature&quot;) was used by WFLD for its weekend horror movie presentations until their replacement by the &quot;Son of Svengoolie&quot; showcase in 1979.
* &quot;Family Classics&quot;, a showcase of family-oriented feature films that originally ran from September 14, 1962, to December 25, 2000 and was co-created by Frazier Thomas and Fred Silverman (then a programming executive at WGN-TV). As host, Thomas also was responsible for selecting the program&#x27;s featured film titles and edited them to remove certain scenes he deemed unfit for family viewing; Roy Leonard took over hosting duties following Thomas&#x27;s death in April 1985 from complications tied to a stroke, and remained in that role until &quot;Family Classics&quot; ended its initial run. (After airing weekly throughout the fall-to-spring television season—first on Friday nights until 1986, and then on Sunday afternoons thereafter—for most of its run, the program began airing sporadically during the holiday season from November 1993 until the conclusion of the program&#x27;s original run.) &quot;Family Classics&quot; was revived as an occasional series on December 8, 2017, with longtime entertainment reporter Dean Richards as host.
* &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot;, a children&#x27;s program that aired on WGN-TV from September 1955 to October 1976 (originating on WBKB/WBBM-TV and then WBKB/WLS-TV under the unpluralized title &quot;Garfield Goose and Friend&quot; from 1952 to 1955). Considered the longest-running puppet show on television, the series was hosted by Frazier Thomas as the &quot;prime minister&quot; to the titular clacking goose puppet (puppeteered by Roy Brown) who designated himself as &quot;King of the United States&quot;. The WGN-TV run of the program featured a mix of puppet characters developed by Brown before and after the show&#x27;s move to Channel 9 such as Romberg Rabbit, Macintosh Mouse, Christmas &quot;Chris&quot; Goose (Garfield&#x27;s nephew) and sleepy bloodhound Beauregard Burnside III (a character named after two Civil War generals). In addition to skits, the show also featured animated shorts (such as &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot; and &quot;Space Angel&quot;) that were introduced by the camera zooming into the &quot;Little Theater Screen&quot;, as well as educational feature segments.
* &quot;Issues Unlimited&quot;, a Sunday morning public affairs program moderated by &quot;Chicago Bulletin&quot; editor and columnist Hurley Green Sr. from 1971 to 1987; the program featured a panel of local media representatives interviewing local and national newsmakers.
* &quot;Ray Rayner and His Friends&quot; (originally &quot;Breakfast with Bugs Bunny&quot; from 1962 to 1964), a long-running children&#x27;s program hosted by Ray Rayner from 1962 to 1980. The program featured animated shorts (including Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons), arts and crafts segments, animals (such as Chelveston the Duck, named after the military base where Rayner was stationed during World War II), science segments conducted with J. Bruce Mitchell of the Museum of Science and Industry and a viewer mail segment in which Rayner appeared alongside a talking orange dog puppet, Cuddly Dudley (voiced by Roy Brown), which was originally created by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as a promotional item.

In addition, Channel 9 broadcasts several local events including the Chicago Thanksgiving Parade (which has aired since 2007, under an agreement with the Chicago Festival Association in which the WGN national feed—which continues to carry the parade despite WGN America&#x27;s December 2014 programming separation from WGN-TV—was given national simulcast rights), the Chicago St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade (which aired from 1949 to 2002), the Chicago Auto Show (from 1952 to 1992 and again since 1999) and the Philadelphia-based Mummers Parade (by arrangement with sister station WPHL-TV). Local events that WGN-TV aired in previous years have included the Bud Billiken Parade (from 1978 to 2011, with WCIU-TV obtaining primary rights to the broadcast beginning in 2012, before shifting exclusively to WLS-TV—which had been a partial rightsholder for the parade since 1984—in 2014).

The station&#x27;s Bradley Place studios, in addition to housing a large number of its own programs, have also served as the production facilities for nationally syndicated programs, including &quot;Donahue&quot; (which shifted production from the Dayton, Ohio studios of WLWD [now sister station WDTN] to the WGN-TV facilities in Chicago in 1974, where production of the daytime talk show remained before moving to WBBM-TV&#x27;s Streeterville studios in January 1982), &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot; (which originated from the Bradley Place facility from the agriculture program&#x27;s national syndication debut in 1975 until production moved to South Bend, Indiana after &quot;Farm Journal&quot;″s production unit assumed distribution rights from the defunct Tribune Entertainment in 2008), and &quot;At the Movies&quot; (which was produced from the facility from 1982 until 1990, three years after Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert left the program amid a 1986 contract dispute with Tribune Entertainment to develop &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; with Buena Vista Television, which was produced out of WBBM-TV&#x27;s studios and later WLS-TV&#x27;s North State Street studios).

Channel 9 formerly served as the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)&#x27;s &quot;Love Network&quot; station for Chicago, carrying the charity&#x27;s annual telethon on Labor Day and the preceding Sunday night each September from 1973 to 2012 (in its original 21½-hour format that existed until 2010, the six-hour evening format used in 2011 and the three-hour prime-time-only format used in 2012). For most of its run on the station (except in 1994, due to the Major League Baseball strike that year), WGN-TV would preempt portions of the telethon on Labor Day to carry Chicago Cubs or White Sox games held during the afternoon of the holiday. Through its national distribution, beginning with the 1979 event, donations to the WGN-produced local segments of the telethon were also pledged by viewers in other parts of the United States and Canada. The broadcast moved from syndication to ABC in September 2013 (by then reduced to a two-hour special), airing thereafter by association on WLS-TV until the final telecast of the retitled &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot; in August 2014.

===Lottery===
WGN-TV served as the originating station for the Illinois Lottery beginning at its July 1974 inception. Live drawings initially aired as a half-hour Thursday night broadcast (then hosted by Ray Rayner) held at its Bradley Place studios. Channel 9 shared the drawing rights with WSNS-TV from March to May 1975 and again from September 1975 until August 1977, when WGN gained exclusivity over the telecasts. With the introduction of the Daily Game (now Pick 3) in February 1980, drawings began airing on the station at 6:57 p.m. nightly. After a three-year run on WFLD (which assumed drawing rights in January 1984), the Lottery migrated the drawing telecasts back to WGN-TV in January 1987. In August 1992, the Lottery awarded the telecast rights to its drawings and game show to CBS-owned WBBM—which beat out competing offers from WGN and WLS-TV, and saw the move as a way to help improve viewership for its third-place-ranked 10 p.m. newscast—effective December 28. WBBM&#x27;s bid was chosen for its offers to hold the drawings during its late newscast (which ultimately produced no beneficial ratings impact) and agreed to handle promotional responsibilities and production costs. Citing in part the station&#x27;s statewide cable distribution (which, after the SyndEx rules were implemented, would occasionally subject the evening drawings to preemption associated with that of the delayed 9 p.m. newscast when sports clearance restrictions applied to the WGN national feed), the Lottery moved its telecasts back to WGN on January 1, 1994; with this move, citing declining revenues under the WBBM contract partly under the later drawing timeslot, the live evening results were shifted to 9:22 p.m. Midday drawings for Pick 3 and Pick 4 were added upon their introduction on December 20, 1994. (The 12:40 p.m. drawings were shown during WGN&#x27;s noon newscast on weekdays, while the Saturday drawing was usually not shown live nationally because of programming substitutions.)

In addition to the live drawing results, WGN also carried two lottery-produced weekly game shows. From September 16, 1989, to December 19, 1992, and from January 8 to July 2, 1994, the station aired &quot;$100,000 Fortune Hunt&quot;. It was originally hosted by Jeff Coopwood, with co-host Linda Kollmeyer, and subsequently with Mike Jackson as host. The program saw six contestants selected from a preliminary scratch-off entry ticket drawing choose panels from a numbered 36-panel game board containing various dollar amounts. The player with the highest prize amount after five rounds won $100,000 and their two chosen at-home partners won $500 each; the remaining on-air contestants kept their existing winnings, with their partners receiving $100. (Initially, each on-air contestant was given the option of keeping their winnings or trading them for other prizes.) Its successor, &quot;Illinois Instant Riches&quot; (retitled &quot;Illinois&#x27; Luckiest&quot; in 1998), ran from July 9, 1994, to October 21, 2000, with Mark Goodman and Kollmeyer as co-hosts. Produced in conjunction with Mark Goodson Productions (later Jonathan Goodson Productions), it featured a similar drawing format as its predecessor, but had individual contestants chosen randomly by a wheel spun by Kollmeyer each round (which was hooked to lights above each contestant&#x27;s seat) play various mini-games.

In September 1996, the station began carrying The Big Game multi-state drawing (replaced by Mega Millions in May 2002) each Tuesday and Friday; Powerball drawings were eventually added upon Illinois joining that multi-state lottery in January 2010. WGN America ceased carrying the drawings nationally on December 12, 2014; the Lottery ceased televising its daily drawings outright and moved the results for the Pick 3, Pick 4, Lotto with Extra Shot and Lucky Day Lotto (formerly Little Lotto until 2011) games exclusively to its website on October 1, 2015, upon switching to a random number generator structure.

===Sports programming===

Throughout its history, WGN-TV has had a long association with Chicago sports, with most of the city&#x27;s major professional sports franchises—particularly the Chicago Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks—and several local and regional collegiate teams (including the Illinois Fighting Illini, the Northwestern Wildcats, the DePaul Blue Demons and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish as well as various Big Ten Conference universities) having regularly televised their games over channel 9.

The Cubs and White Sox were the first teams to be carried on the station, when on April 23, 1948, WGN aired a crosstown rivalry game that the Sox won, 4–1. (The Tribune Company wholly owned the Cubs from 1981 until 2008, and retained a minority interest in the team until January 2019.) Over the years, the number of Cubs and White Sox games on WGN had gradually decreased (down to about 70 per season for each team by 2008) as a result of the two Major League Baseball clubs—as well as the NBA&#x27;s Bulls—migrating some of their local game telecasts to cable-originated regional sports networks, Fox Sports Net Chicago (later FSN Chicago) from 1999 until 2003 and then Comcast SportsNet Chicago (now NBC Sports Chicago) beginning in 2004. Beginning in 2015, WGN-TV began sharing the over-the-air rights to Cubs games with WLS-TV, resulting in Channel 9 reducing its coverage schedule to 45 games per season as part of a four-year contract involving the two stations. WGN carried the White Sox until 1972, before returning to the station for one season in 1981; the White Sox moved its local telecasts to WGN-TV after an eight-year absence in 1990.

The Bulls began carrying their games with its inaugural season in 1966; after airing their games on WFLD for four years, the Bulls returned to WGN-TV for the 1989–90 season, overlapping with the start of the team&#x27;s NBA championship dynasty during Michael Jordan&#x27;s tenure with the team. WGN initially carried Blackhawks NHL games (which, per prohibitions on televised home games imposed by then-owner Bill Wirtz in order to sustain ticket sales, were restricted to away games) from 1961 until 1975. The Blackhawks returned to the station during the 2008–09 season, with a package of both home and away games (the result of Rocky Wirtz&#x27;s decision to end the home game television blackout after taking over the franchise&#x27;s ownership following his father&#x27;s death). WGN-TV carried Chicago Bears regular season football games as a DuMont affiliate during the 1951 NFL season, after which the team moved their telecasts to ABC (and by association, ABC O&amp;O WBKB-TV [now WLS-TV]) under a limited contract; the Bears aired their first game on WGN in 55 years on October 1, 2012, when the station carried the team&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; matchup against the Dallas Cowboys. (NFL rules require national games aired by cable networks to be syndicated to broadcast stations in the participating teams&#x27; home markets.) Although WLS-TV has right of first refusal to &quot;MNF&quot; due to its corporate parent The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s majority ownership of ESPN, WLS passed on carrying the game in order to air that night&#x27;s live broadcast of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

From November 1978 until October 2014, WGN America frequently simulcast WGN Sports broadcasts (mostly Cubs, White Sox and Bulls games) nationwide, when permitted under the station&#x27;s sports contracts. (Tribune&#x27;s President and CEO at the time, Peter Liguori, cited the limited viewership and advertising revenue generated from televising sports on a national basis relative to their contractual expense for its decision to stop carrying WGN&#x27;s sports telecasts over WGN America after the 2014 MLB season.) In addition, until it ceased offering sporting events in September 2019, WGN-TV also distributed its White Sox and Bulls telecasts to television stations in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa that are within their respective broadcast territories (including CW affiliate WISH-TV in Indianapolis and the subchannels of WGN sister stations WHO-DT in Des Moines and WQAD in Davenport, Iowa). WGN-TV&#x27;s Cubs and White Sox game broadcasts also were often carried on the MLB Extra Innings feeds available to DirecTV subscribers, sometimes including local commercials and station promotions that were not shown during the WGN America telecasts from the imposition of the SyndEx rules until the 2014 separation of the national and local feeds. (This also was the case for WGN-produced games shown on WPWR-TV, as well as WLS-TV&#x27;s Cubs broadcasts.)

On January 2, 2019, the White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks agreed to an exclusive multi-year deal with NBC Sports Chicago to take effect that fall. This was followed on February 13 by the announcement of the formation of the Marquee Sports Network, a joint venture between the Cubs and Sinclair Broadcast Group that launched in the spring of 2020. As a consequence of the four teams electing to move their local game telecasts off broadcast television completely in favor of airing them exclusively over regional sports networks, WGN wound down its local sports coverage throughout the spring and summer of 2019—beginning with the April 1 game between the Blackhawks and the Winnipeg Jets, and continuing with its final game telecasts involving the Bulls (an away game against the New York Knicks on April 9) and the Cubs (an away game against the rival St. Louis Cardinals on September 27)—as the station&#x27;s contracts with all four teams gradually expired. WGN-TV&#x27;s final sports telecast involving any of the station&#x27;s four legacy professional sports broadcast partners was the second game of a White Sox–Detroit Tigers doubleheader at Guaranteed Rate Field on September 28, 2019. However, on February 19, 2020, Chicago Fire FC announced a multi-year agreement with WGN-TV to broadcast their Major League Soccer (MLS) telecasts on the station, beginning with its March 7 match against the New England Revolution, returning regular sporting events to Channel 9 after a seven-month hiatus. Those games moved to MLS Season Pass beginning in 2023, and without any NFL-style syndication rights, the 2022 season was the final season for Fire broadcasts on any television channel. The deal also marks the first time in the station&#x27;s 74-year history that Channel 9 will not have any local sports programming on the station.

Sports programming returned to WGN in 2023, when it began carrying The CW&#x27;s weekend coverage of the controversial LIV Golf league in lieu of then-affiliate WCIU (a reversal of the programming relationship between the two stations during Channel 9&#x27;s WB and initial CW affiliations), which declined to carry the tournament broadcasts due to already-existing weekend programming commitments. Later that year, WGN also acquired rights to the network&#x27;s Atlantic Coast Conference football and men&#x27;s basketball game telecasts, which WCIU also chose not to clear. The CW&#x27;s sports programming moved to WGN-TV full-time upon becoming an owned-and-operated station in September 2024.

===News operation===
, WGN-TV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest newscast output of any television station in the Chicago market and the state of Illinois, and the sixth-highest newscast output in the United States (behind WAGA-TV/Atlanta, WHDH/Boston, KTVK/Phoenix, WISH-TV/Indianapolis, and WGN sister station KTLA/Los Angeles). In addition to its conventional local newscasts, the station produces two late-evening sports news programs: &quot;″GN Sports&quot;, a half-hour sports highlight and interview program (airing nightly at 10:30 p.m.), and &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, a 20-minute Sunday evening highlight program (airing during the final 20 minutes of the 9 p.m. newscast).

Until regular sports telecasts on WGN-TV ended in September 2019, the station&#x27;s midday, early and late evening newscasts were subject to (at least, partial) preemption or delay due to local sports telecasts overrunning into that time period; from July 8, 2010, onward, CLTV had served as an alternate broadcaster of WGN-TV newscasts that were preempted by the latter&#x27;s sports broadcasts and aired live half-hour editions of &quot;WGN News at Nine&quot; on nights when Channel 9 carried a sports event being held on the West Coast that started locally at 9 p.m. (An additional half-hour live newscast followed the game telecast on WGN-TV, which had originally been titled under the &quot;WGN News at Nine&quot; brand prior to the 2016 launch of its 10 p.m. newscast.) The WGN-TV weather staff also provides local weather updates for WGN Radio under an agreement that began on October 13, 2008, at the conclusion of The Weather Channel&#x27;s ten-year content partnership with the radio station.

====News department history====

Although sports has been a major part of WGN-TV&#x27;s identity, the station has also been well known in the Chicago area for its news programming, which, through its former co-ownership with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, has played an important role since its launch. WGN&#x27;s news department—which shared operations and management with WGN Radio until the news division was split into separate departments maintained by the respective properties in 1983—began operations along with the station on April 5, 1948, with the launch of its first regular news program, the &quot;Chicagoland Newsreel&quot;, which was the first television newscast in the Chicago market to consist entirely of filmed coverage. The 15-minute broadcast—which originally aired weeknights at 6:45 p.m., with a midday edition at 11:30 a.m. being added in September 1949—was anchored by news director Spencer Allen (who had been a reporter and news writer for WGN Radio since 1938) and used a large staff of photographers and technicians, many of whom had previously worked for the &quot;Tribune&quot;; Allen also anchored a 15-minute midday news program for Channel 9, &quot;Spencer Allen and the News&quot;, from 1951 to 1953.

From 1948 to 1965, WGN also produced an additional 15-minute-long newscast at 6:30 p.m., with Austin Kiplinger (to be replaced by Allen in 1953 and then by Lloyd Pettit in 1956) reading the news summary and Frann Weigel as the weather anchor; the program was expanded to a half-hour in September 1955, when &quot;Newsreel&quot; was discontinued in favor of an amended sports news segment (anchored originally by Vince Lloyd). Under Allen&#x27;s leadership, WGN-TV&#x27;s newscasts evolved from a &quot;police blotter/fire alarm-type of news operation&quot; to incorporating more in-depth and investigative reports. WGN-TV also was the first Chicago television station to televise a local appearance by a U.S. President (carrying Harry S. Truman&#x27;s 1948 visit to Chicago) and provided mobile coverage of Gen. Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s visit to the city (in April 1951); it has also provided coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions each election cycle since 1952, and provided extensive pool coverage of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s Mass at Grant Park in 1979.

In September 1951, Channel 9 began carrying a 15-minute late night edition of &quot;Chicagoland Newsreel&quot; that followed its late evening movie presentations (which began at 10 p.m. at the time). By 1967, the program had evolved into &quot;Night Beat&quot;, a 30-minute overnight newscast that—until it was discontinued in 1983—featured the main anchor (which had included, among others, Greyson, McNeeley, Cliff Mercer and Jack Taylor) presenting a summary of local and world news headlines as well as a brief weather forecast summary. In February 1955, the station installed a coaxial cable link from the city room of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (originally done for the early newscast, &quot;First Edition&quot;, which aired from 1954 to 1956) to allow &quot;Tribune&quot; reporters and contributors to provide information on developing stories being covered by the newspaper and the WGN news department. After WGN-TV became an independent station in August 1956, the evening newscast was moved to 7 p.m.—becoming the market&#x27;s first prime time newscast and often being subjected to sports-induced preemptions—before settling at 10 p.m. in September 1959, originally under the title &quot;10th Hour News&quot; (known in later years as &quot;The Park-Ruddle News&quot; and &quot;[Jack Taylor/John Drury and] NewsNine&quot;). In May 1960, the late newscast (which, by that point, was anchored by Jim Conway, who also hosted a self-titled daytime talk show at the time) became the first local television news program in the U.S. to expand to a half-hour broadcast. Standard news updates presented by various on-staff anchors—under the title &quot;WGN Newsbreak&quot;—also ran during the late morning, early afternoon and prime time hours in-between programs.

In 1965, WGN appointed the first dual-anchor team ever employed in Chicago television news, as Gary Park (who came to the station from KCRA-TV in Sacramento) and Jim Ruddle (who previously worked at WTVT in Tampa) took the helm of the evening newscasts. On January 9, 1967, WGN shifted the 10 p.m. edition of the newscast by 15 minutes (concurrently reducing it to that length) in an attempt to improve viewership by placing the telephone quiz show &quot;The Name Game&quot; in the timeslot, reducing competition with late newscasts on WLS-TV, WMAQ-TV and WBBM-TV. (This experiment ended in May 1967, when WGN reverted to carrying the late newscast in its former 10 p.m. slot and expanded it to 25 minutes.) The Park-Ruddle combination was broken up in June 1967, when Ruddle left to join NBC-owned WMAQ-TV, to be followed two years later by Park taking a prime time anchor role at fellow independent KTVU (now a Fox owned-and-operated station) in San Francisco. Also in 1965, WGN premiered its first attempt at a morning news show with &quot;Top &#x27;o&#x27; the Morning&quot;; Orion Samuelson—then a farm reporter for WGN Radio, who would eventually host the syndicated &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot; starting in 1975—and Harold Turner (later replaced by Max Armstrong) provided agricultural news and weather. The program was replaced in May 1984 by a traditional morning newscast, &quot;Chicago&#x27;s First Report&quot;, which was canceled due to low viewership that December.

The WGN news department has long been one of the most respected local television news operations in the United States and has earned several journalism awards throughout its history, including Emmy, Associated Press, United Press International and duPont-Columbia Awards. The station has also long established top-drawer talent for its newscasts, many of whom have worked at WGN-TV for more than ten years, including Jack Taylor (anchor/reporter, 1954–1984, whose run included a stint as primary weeknight anchor from 1970 to 1979), Carl Greyson (anchor, reporter and staff announcer, 1955–1980), Marty McNeeley (anchor/reporter, 1969–1986), Robert Jordan (anchor/reporter, 1973–1978 and 1980–2016), Muriel Clair (assignment reporter, 1978–present, part-time since December 2011), Dan Roan (sports director, 1984–2022), and Steve Sanders (anchor/reporter, 1982–2020). John Drury joined WGN-TV in 1967 for what would be a three-year stint as anchor of its 10 p.m. news as well as occasionally serving as anchor of &quot;Night Beat&quot;. After working for WLS-TV for nine years, Drury returned to his former role at WGN in 1979, displacing Jack Taylor as 10 p.m. &quot;NewsNine&quot; anchor. During his second stint at WGN, Drury took on an expanded role doing assignment and investigative reporting (often producing the reports with investigative reporter Alex Burkholder). In 1982, then-Mayor Jane Byrne, accompanied by members of her public relations and cabinet staff, tried to talk Drury into shelving a report on Byrne&#x27;s use of public funds towards city festivals designed to promote her administration in relation to her stint residing in the Cabrini-Green housing project. Drury went forward with the investigative report, which aided in Byrne&#x27;s loss to Harold Washington in the 1983 Democratic mayoral primary and would help earn Drury a Chicago Emmy Award for Individual Excellence (the first of four Emmys during his career).

Another mainstay of WGN-TV was Tom Skilling, who joined WGN in August 1978 to succeed Harry Volkman (who presented weather reports for the station from 1967 until 1970 and again from 1974 until the summer of 1978) as the station&#x27;s main evening meteorologist. Skilling—who was rumored to have been the highest paid local television meteorologist in the United States—would become known for presenting his on-air forecasts with detailed but fairly easy-to-understand analysis and striking accuracy (most noted by his predictions of the Groundhog Day blizzard two weeks before it created paralyzing effects on the Chicago area in late January and early February 2011), and with routine usage of ensemble computer models to illustrate expected weather scenarios. Skilling also occasionally hosted half-hour documentary specials explaining extreme weather phenomenon and advancements in forecasting technology (including 1991&#x27;s &quot;It Sounded Like a Freight Train&quot;, focusing on the science of the Chicago area&#x27;s climatological history with tornadoes, and 1992&#x27;s &quot;When Lightning Strikes&quot;, centering on the science and dangers of lightning), which have earned several Chicago Emmy nominations and award wins, as well as a weekly feature on the 9 p.m. newscast, &quot;Ask Tom Why&quot;, in which Skilling answered viewer-submitted weather questions (and which served as the basis for a similarly formatted column featured in the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s weather page). Under Skilling, WGN also coordinated the centralization of its weather operations to encompass WGN-TV, WGN Radio, CLTV, and the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and, in May 2007, became a broadcast partner in the WeatherBug real-time automated weather observation network (the largest station member by market size). Skilling holds the record as the longest-serving television meteorologist at a single station in the Chicago market, having served as chief meteorologist at WGN-TV for 45 years until he retired from broadcasting on February 28, 2024. (Volkman holds the record as Chicago&#x27;s longest-serving television meteorologist overall, having worked in the market from 1959 until he retired from broadcasting in 2004, including other stints at WMAQ-TV and WFLD as well as an 18-year run as chief meteorologist at WBBM-TV.)

The late newscast was moved into prime time on March 10, 1980, concurrently becoming known as &quot;The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (later retitled &quot;WGN News at Nine&quot; in May 1993, as part of a uniform retitling of its newscasts under the &quot;WGN News&quot; moniker used in some promotions and report sign-offs since 1981). The shift to the 9 p.m. hour briefly made it the first hour-long prime time newscast in the Midwest and, for its first seven years in that slot, it was the Chicago market&#x27;s only local television newscast at 9 p.m. Initially airing five nights a week for one hour, the revamped weeknight-only newscast was first anchored by the prior &quot;NewsNine&quot; team of Drury, Skilling, sports anchor Bill Frink and commentator Len O&#x27;Connor. On June 9 of that year, the program switched to a hybrid local-national format that incorporated the &quot;Independent Network News&quot; (&quot;INN&quot;)—a Tribune-syndicated nightly news program, later retitled &quot;INN: The Independent News&quot; in September 1984 and &quot;USA Tonight&quot; in January 1987, originating from New York sister station WPIX—in place of the locally produced segments that had occupied the 9:30 p.m. half-hour since the March format change. After briefly being relegated to weeknights following the shift to prime time, half-hour weekend editions of the 9 p.m. broadcast were added on October 4, 1980, anchored originally by Larry Roderick and Robert Jordan. By 1985, Drury (who returned to his previous role as main co-anchor at WLS-TV in late 1984) and Denise Cannon (who became the former&#x27;s co-anchor in 1981 and departed at the end of 1984) were succeeded as principal anchors by Rick Rosenthal and Pat Harvey.

Since the reformatting as a prime time newscast, WGN-TV has been the ratings leader in the 9 p.m. timeslot, with or without news competition in the arena and even at times when weaker-rated shows led into the newscast, and typically holds a larger audience than the 10 p.m. newscast on WBBM-TV. The 9 p.m. newscast&#x27;s dominance was to such an extent that, from 1984 until 1989 (when it was unseated by KTVU in San Francisco), it had the largest viewership of any prime time local newscast in the United States. Legitimate competition sprang up for &quot;The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on November 16, 1987, when Fox O&amp;O WFLD debuted an hour-long 9 p.m. broadcast, replacing the separate half-hour 7 and 11 p.m. newscasts it had been producing since its full-scale news operation launched three months earlier. Although WFLD aggressively marketed its fledgling newscast towards younger audiences as having a fresher style compared to WGN&#x27;s more traditional news format, viewer loyalty has continued to propel Channel 9 to first place at 9 p.m. to the present day (with one of the only exceptions being a tie with Channel 32 in the May 1996 sweeps period), even with the WFLD newscast having the Fox prime time lineup as its lead-in. For this reason, WFLD moved its newscast back to its original 7 p.m. timeslot in September 1988, only to return it to 9 p.m. the following year to accommodate the planned expansion of Fox&#x27;s prime time lineup. A sports highlight and interview program, &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, originally hosted by sports director Dan Roan until his retirement in May 2022, began accompanying the Sunday edition of the newscast in August 1987. WGN re-expanded its prime time newscast to one hour on June 4, 1990, after Tribune discontinued production of &quot;USA Tonight&quot; under a collaborative agreement between Tribune and Turner Broadcasting in which the Tribune stations were granted access to CNN Newsource content and began feeding video footage to the CNN video wire service.

WGN began programming long-form news outside its established 9 p.m. slot on September 19, 1983, when it debuted &quot;Midday Newscope&quot;, which grew out of the three-minute-long local news segments that had aired during the &quot;INN Midday Edition&quot; (which followed the newscast until that program&#x27;s September 1985 cancellation) since January 1983. Originally anchored by Rick Rosenthal (who was replaced by Steve Sanders, after Rosenthal replaced Drury as 9 p.m. co-anchor in 1984), the newscast—a local version of Telepictures and Gannett Broadcasting&#x27;s short-lived syndicated format, &quot;Newscope&quot;—featured a hybrid of local news headlines and weather forecasts and in-depth consumer, financial, entertainment and lifestyle features. The program was reformatted into a more traditional newscast, retitled &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Midday News&quot;, on September 17, 1984, and later expanded to an hour in September 1985. The midday newscast—which concurrently rebranded from &quot;WGN News at Noon&quot; to the &quot;WGN Midday News&quot; with the expansion—would eventually expand to 90 minutes (moving to an 11:30 a.m. start) on September 15, 2008; it was subsequently expanded to two hours (moving to 11 a.m.) on October 5, 2009. On September 19, 1988, WGN became the first Chicago television station to closed caption its newscasts for the hearing impaired.

On January 25, 1992, the station debuted hour-long 8 a.m. newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays. To accommodate the launch of &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Weekend Morning News&quot; (which marked the first major weekend morning news attempt in Chicago television and one of the only instances of a television station carrying a morning newscast on weekends without already having a weekday equivalent) and the concurring moves of and &quot;People to People&quot; to Sundays, WGN dropped three long-running religious programs—&quot;What&#x27;s Nu&quot; (produced by the Chicago Board of Rabbis), &quot;Heritage of Faith&quot; (produced by Protestant group Greater Chicago Broadcast Ministries) and &quot;Mass for Shut-ins&quot; (produced by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago)—from its Sunday morning lineup, a move that was criticized by the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago and other religious groups on grounds that the programs catered to diverse religious audiences in fulfillment of the station&#x27;s public service programming obligations. (The latter two programs were subsequently acquired by WGBO-TV, under an agreement which allowed them to continue to be produced out of the WGN-TV studios.) The Sunday edition was discontinued after the September 4, 1994, broadcast; the Saturday edition would follow suit four years later on December 19, 1998, with then-news director Steve Ramsey citing the need to provide more resources for its weekday morning newscasts. Weekend morning newscasts returned on October 2, 2010, with the debut of hour-long editions at 6 a.m. (shifted to a two-hour block at 7 a.m. on September 10, 2016, following Channel 9&#x27;s disaffiliation from The CW, and expanded to a third hour on Saturdays until 10 a.m. on January 11, 2020).

Morning news programming was extended to weekdays on September 6, 1994, with the &quot;WGN Morning News&quot; debuting as a one-hour broadcast from 7 to 8 a.m., anchored originally by Dave Eckert, Sonja Gantt and meteorologist Paul Huttner. In an effort to improve viewership, the program—which replaced children&#x27;s programs (including &quot;The Bozo Show&quot;, which displaced the Sunday edition of the morning newscast) that had previously aired in that time period—was soon reformatted from a more traditional newscast to feature a mix of straight news and entertainment and lifestyle features that use a looser style similar to morning radio programs. This reformatting helped the &quot;Morning News&quot; to eventually begin beating competing local and national morning news programs—including its closest initial competitor, WFLD&#x27;s &quot;Fox Thing in the Morning&quot; (now &quot;Good Day Chicago&quot;)—in the 25–54 age demographic and in total viewers. (The program would expand to two hours, extending until 9 a.m., on January 8, 1996, with a later hour-long expansion [to 10 a.m.] on September 3, 2013.) An hour-long 6 a.m. &quot;Early Edition&quot; of the newscast debuted on August 5, 1996; this block of the newscast would gradually expand to three hours, beginning with the addition of a 5:30 a.m. half-hour in January 2001 and ending with its July 11, 2011, extension to 4 a.m. (The &quot;WGN Morning News&quot; became the first WGN-TV newscast to be denied clearance on the national feed in September 1996, with its forced removal reportedly being due to self-imposed exclusivity restrictions concerning the newscast&#x27;s paid segments and rate charges that the station&#x27;s sales department would have to pay if the segments aired nationally; simulcasts of the &quot;WGN Morning News&quot; temporarily returned to WGN America on February 3, 2014, when it began airing the 4 a.m. hour.)

In July 1996, WGN-TV began using a Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter for newsgathering, &quot;Skycam 9&quot;, which is used for certain breaking news events and traffic reporting. In October 1999, freelance reporter Jane Boal made headlines when she was hit from behind while trying to move away from a car attempting to drive away from an accident with another vehicle during a live midday report about a carbon monoxide leak that forced the evacuation of a school in the Rogers Park neighborhood; Boal (who was laid off by the station in May 2009) suffered cartilage and ligament injuries to both of her legs after being pinned between the car involved in the accident and a WGN live truck, but was able to resume work in early November. In 2000, WGN-TV constructed a new newsroom covering two floors on the eastern portion of its studio facility, increasing the building&#x27;s size to approximately ; the original newsroom was renovated for use by the station&#x27;s weather department.

WGN scored a major coup in April 2008, when it persuaded veteran WMAQ-TV and WFLD anchor Mark Suppelsa—who turned down a contract with the latter station due to a proposed salary cut—to take over as lead anchor of the 9 p.m. newscast, replacing Steve Sanders (who was moved to the midday newscast and was later joined in September 2009 by his former co-anchor on the 9 p.m. broadcast from 1993 until Suppelsa&#x27;s appointment, Allison Payne, after Micah Materre moved to the prime time newscasts full-time). Suppelsa remained a main co-anchor of the weeknight newscasts until his retirement from broadcasting in December 2017, and was replaced two months later by Joe Donlon (who served a similar role at KGW in Portland, Oregon, and would himself depart WGN-TV in June 2020 to become main co-anchor of sister network WGN America″s fledgling prime time newscast &quot;NewsNation&quot;). On July 19, 2008, beginning with that night&#x27;s edition of the 9 p.m. newscast, WGN-TV became the third television station in the Chicago market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. Video from remote and field equipment was initially broadcast in 480p standard definition following the transition; high definition cameras began to be used for field reports in July 2010, a move which made WGN-TV the first station in the market to broadcast all locally originated portions of its newscasts (including live field reports) in HD.

Starting under the direction of now-former news director Greg Caputo, WGN-TV spearheaded a major expansion of its news programming. In addition to the expansions of its existing newscasts, WGN first launched an early-evening newscast on September 15, 2008, when the &quot;WGN Evening News&quot; premiered as a half-hour weeknight broadcast at 5:30 p.m. The newscast expanded to one hour (starting at 5 p.m.) on October 5, 2009, with Saturday and Sunday editions being added on July 12, 2014. The weekday editions of the newscast were later expanded to include a second hour (starting at 4 p.m.) on September 8, 2014, and then to three hours (extending it to the 6 p.m. hour) on April 4, 2017. (The superstation feed did not clear any of the expanded newscasts up until the conversion of WGN America into a conventional cable channel.) In 2009, WGN-TV began streaming its weekday midday and 5 p.m. newscasts live on its website. On February 22, 2010, WGN-TV became the first television station in the Chicago market to allow iPhone users to watch live streams of its newscasts; the 6 to 9 a.m. block of the &quot;WGN Morning News&quot;, the midday and 5 p.m. newscasts were initially available for streaming to iPhone users. (At present, all newscasts are streamed through the station&#x27;s website and on Apple devices, though sports segments are blacked out—presented only with the audio feed—due to streaming restrictions on sports highlights imposed by the major sports leagues.)

On October 5, 2015, the station restored a 10 p.m. newscast—originally only airing Monday through Friday nights—to its schedule after a 35-year absence; weekend editions of the 10 p.m. broadcast were added on January 11, 2020. A secondary live sports news show, &quot;GN Sports&quot;, premiered on January 28, 2020, as the lead-out program for the weeknight 10 p.m. newscasts; originally co-hosted by Dan Roan and Jarrett Payton, the program focuses on sports news and highlights, feature segments and in-studio interviews in a similar format as &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, as well as including sports gaming and fantasy sports analysis. (Payton formerly co-hosted the similar CLTV program &quot;Sports Feed&quot;—alongside WGN sports reporter Josh Frydman, who serves as a &quot;GN Sports&quot; contributor—from 2015 until Nexstar shut down the cable news channel in December 2019.) Weekend editions of &quot;GN Sports&quot; were added on August 14, 2021, with the Sunday broadcast replacing the cuisine and tourism program &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Best&quot; (which had aired on WGN for ten years from January 2011 until August 8, 2021).

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

The main 2.1 subchannel of WBBM-TV is also broadcast on the WGN-TV multiplex; WBBM-TV, Chicago&#x27;s high-power ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) station, carries WGN-TV in that format.

===Analog-to-digital transition===
WGN-TV began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 19 on January 4, 2001, operating from a transmitter located atop the Sears Tower. (Incidentally, WGN-TV was one of six, originally eight, Chicago television stations that declined offers to move their analog transmitters to the Sears Tower antenna farm ahead of the building&#x27;s 1973 completion.) The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The WGN-TV digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, with digital television receivers continuing to display WGN-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 9. As a consequence, WGN-TV permanently ceased transmissions from the John Hancock Center&#x27;s west antenna tower, establishing its existing digital facilities at the Sears Tower digital antenna as its main transmitter.

Though not a participant in the SAFER Act, WWME-CA carried simulcasts of WGN-TV&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast—except in the event of sports delays—and WMAQ-TV&#x27;s morning and early evening newscasts until July 12 to provide an analog &quot;lifeline&quot; for viewers that were unprepared for or who had reception issues following the digital transition.

==Canadian distribution==
In April 1985, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved eligibility for the signals of WGN-TV and fellow American superstations WTBS, WOR-TV and WPIX to be retransmitted as foreign services by multichannel television providers within Canada. Under CRTC linkage rules first implemented in 1983 that require providers to offer U.S.-based program services in discretionary tiers tied to Canadian services, WGN-TV/WGN America and other authorized U.S. superstations typically have been sold to prospective subscribers of one or more domestic premium services—such as Crave (formerly First Choice and The Movie Network), Starz (formerly Moviepix and The Movie Network Encore), Super Channel, Super Écran and Western Canada-based regional pay services Movie Central (the original user of the Superchannel name, now defunct) and Encore Avenue (also now defunct). However, some providers have chosen to offer WGN in a specialty tier under a related rule that allows for an eligible superstation of the provider&#x27;s choice to be carried on a non-premium tier. (Although KWGN-TV has also been authorized for carriage by the CRTC since that point, the Denver sister station is not carried on any multichannel television providers within Canada.)

After United Video began offering a separate national feed of WGN upon the stateside implementation the Syndex rules in January 1990, most Canadian cable providers began to replace the Chicago signal with the superstation feed as well. (Among the country&#x27;s satellite providers, Star Choice [now Shaw Direct] began carrying the national feed upon the satellite provider&#x27;s 1994 launch; Bell ExpressVu [now Bell Satellite TV] began distributing the Chicago-area signal when it commenced operations in 1996.) As a network affiliate, WGN-TV provided WB and CW programs to areas of Canada distant from the Canadian–U.S. border that could not receive over-the-air signals of other WB/CW affiliates from American cities. The WGN local feed was subjected to fewer sports blackouts than WGN America had been subjected to prior to the separation of the national and local feeds, as blackouts of programming to which Canadian broadcasters hold domestic rights apply only to imported U.S.-based specialty channels. However, simultaneous substitution rules have applied to certain CW programs that were also carried by Canadian-based terrestrial networks (such as Global, Citytv and CTV 2). The WGN-TV feed had also previously been available as part of the NHL Centre Ice sports package, primarily for simulcasts of Chicago Blackhawks games that WGN-TV aired until the 2018–19 season.

On January 17, 2007, WGN&#x27;s main Canadian uplink carrier, Shaw Broadcast Services, switched its distributed feed of the station to the Chicago signal, a decision believed to have resulted from increased licensing fees for the then-superstation feed; despite this, some providers (including MTS TV and Cogeco Cable) continued to carry the superstation feed in place of or in conjunction with the Chicago signal. Despite this, some providers continued to carry the national WGN channel in lieu of or—as was the case with providers such as MTS TV and Cogeco Cable—in tandem with the Chicago feed, resulting in the duplication of CW network and many syndicated programs that are available within the country on other networks (such as fellow superstations KTLA and Boston-based WSBK-TV). While the CRTC had approved the Chicago station&#x27;s broadcast signal &quot;and&quot; its national cable feed for carriage on any domestic multichannel television provider (including cable, satellite, IPTV and MMDS services), because of the conversion of WGN America from a superstation into an independent general-entertainment service and its resulting programming separation from WGN-TV, on December 15, 2014, Tribune Broadcasting sent notice that it would terminate all Canadian distribution rights for WGN America, effective January 1, 2015; the move was likely done to comply with CRTC genre protection rules in effect at the time, which prohibited the utilization of general entertainment programming formats by domestic or foreign cable channels. The WGN-TV Chicago feed, however, remains authorized for domestic distribution as a superstation. It is carried on Bell Satellite TV channel 1232 across Canada.

<doc id="189767" wikidata="Q163553" url="?curid=189767" title="Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)">
<text>The Symphony No. 1 in D major by Gustav Mahler was mainly composed between late 1887 and March 1888, though it incorporates music Mahler had composed for previous works. It was composed while Mahler was second conductor at the Leipzig Opera in Germany. Although in his letters Mahler almost always referred to the work as a symphony, the first two performances described it as a &quot;symphonic poem&quot; and as a &quot;tone poem in symphonic form&quot;, respectively. The work was premièred at the Vigadó Concert Hall in Budapest, Hungary, in 1889, but was not well-received. Mahler made some major revisions for the second performance, given at Hamburg, Germany, in October 1893; further alterations were made in the years prior to the first publication, in late 1898. Some modern performances and recordings give the work the title Titan, despite the fact that Mahler only used this label for the second and third performances, and never after the work had reached its definitive four-movement form in 1896.

Mahler conducted more performances of this symphony than of any of his later works.

== Composition ==

The symphony&#x27;s movements are arranged in a fairly typical four-movement setup. Conventionally, the minuet and trio would be the third movement and the slow movement the second, but Mahler has them switched, which was also sometimes done by Ludwig van Beethoven. The keys are D major for the first movement, A major for the second, D minor for the third, and F minor for the last, with a grand finale at the end in D major. The usage of F minor for the last movement was a dramatic break from conventional usage.

For the first three performances (Budapest, Hamburg and Weimar), an additional movement, &quot; (flower piece), was played between the first and second movements of the piece as it now stands. This movement was originally written in June 1884 as the opening piece – &quot; – of Mahler&#x27;s incidental music for a series of seven &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; based on Joseph Victor von Scheffel&#x27;s poem &quot;Der Trompeter von Säckingen&quot;, which, &quot;Blumine&quot; aside, has since been lost. The addition of this movement appears to have been an afterthought, and Mahler discarded it after the Weimar performance in 1894; it was rediscovered in 1966 by Donald Mitchell. The following year, Benjamin Britten conducted the first performance of it since Mahler&#x27;s time at the Aldeburgh Festival. The symphony is almost never played with this movement included today, although it is sometimes heard separately. In the 1970s, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra made the first recording of the symphony by a major orchestra to include &quot;Blumine&quot;. Some 20 recordings exist that include &quot;Blumine&quot;; however, most of them combine it with the revised edition of the other movements, thus making a &quot;blended&quot; version of the symphony that was at no time authorised by Mahler.

Nevertheless, Mahler quotes the main theme from the &quot;Blumine&quot; movement in two subsequent movements. It appears early in the second movement; he also quotes it in the final movement, as well as other themes from the other movements, which is in keeping with Beethoven&#x27;s own practice in his Symphony No. 9 of quoting themes from the first, second, and third movements early in the final movement. Beethoven gave the impression of rejecting the earlier themes, after he quotes them, and then introduces the famous &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; theme. The five-movement version generally runs around an hour, just as Mahler&#x27;s later symphonies (except for Symphony No. 4) are an hour or longer in length. Mahler followed a precedent, established by Beethoven in his ninth symphony and by Anton Bruckner in many of his symphonies, of lengthier, more detailed development of the themes, usually resulting in a performance time of an hour or more.

Under this early five-movement scheme, the work was envisioned by Mahler as a large symphonic poem in two parts, and he wrote a programme to describe the piece, but without adding any further title for the 1889 Budapest premiere. The first part consisted of the first two movements of the symphony as it is now known plus &quot;Blumine&quot;, and the second consisted of the funeral-march and finale. For the 1893 Hamburg and 1894 Weimar performances, Mahler gave the piece the title &quot;Titan&quot; after the novel by Jean Paul, although Mahler specified that the piece was not in any way &quot;about&quot; the book; the nickname is often used today, but properly only applies to those two versions.

The opening of the third movement features a double bass soloist performing a variation on the theme of &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;, distinguishing it as one of the few symphonic pieces to use the instrument in such a manner. Mahler uses the song, which he cites as &quot;Bruder Martin&quot;, changed from major to minor, thus giving the piece the character of a funeral march. The mode change to minor is not an invention by Mahler, as is often believed, but rather the way this round was sung in the 19th and early 20th century in Austria. A similar use of is present throughout the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7.

== Versions ==

There are several manuscripts that document the revisions to which Mahler subjected the work:
# 1888, Leipzig – The original autograph score, in Mahler&#x27;s handwriting (location unknown, may no longer exist)
# 1889, Budapest – The base layer in a copyist&#x27;s handwriting is probably identical to the original autograph score. Over this, there are many revisions in Mahler&#x27;s hand, and some whole sections deleted with new replacements added, in preparation for the 1889 Budapest premiere on 20 November. Bound into two volumes, vol. 1 containing the first movement and Scherzo, vol. 2 containing the last movement; the &quot;Blumine&quot; and funeral march movements are missing—in fact, conflicting numbering of the Scherzo, and the smaller size of the paper on which &quot;Blumine&quot; is written, seems to indicate that the &quot;Blumine&quot; was not originally part of Mahler&#x27;s conception, and that it was lifted whole from the 1884 &quot;&quot; score at some point between the symphony&#x27;s completion in early 1888 and the Budapest premiere in late 1889. The entire symphony is scored for the standard symphonic orchestra of the time, with 2 each of all the woodwinds and 4 horns. In this version the piece was called &quot;Symphonic-Poem in 2 Parts&quot;. (University of Western Ontario, Rose collection)
# 1893, Hamburg – The base layer in Mahler&#x27;s hand corresponds to the final version of the Budapest manuscript, and probably was the manuscript sent by Mahler to Schott as a &#x27; (engraver&#x27;s copy) in 1891 in hopes of publication, and for the first time given a title: &#x27; (&quot;From the Life of a Lonely-one&quot;). Over this base layer, there are many revisions and new sections (including to &quot;Blumine&quot;) added in 1893, in preparation for the second performance, in Hamburg on 27 October. Contains all 5 movements; the funeral march was apparently lifted whole out of the 1889 manuscript. Orchestra has 3 each of the woodwinds. Just before the Hamburg performance, Mahler added the titles from &quot;Titan&quot;. (Yale University, Osborn collection)
# 1894?, Hamburg – The base layer in a copyist&#x27;s handwriting corresponds to the final version of the 1893 manuscript, with further revisions by Mahler. Probably prepared for the third performance, in Weimar on 3 June. Pages containing the &quot;Blumine&quot; have been folded over, indicating deletion. Orchestra has 4 each of the woodwinds, and 3 additional horns. Still includes the titles from &quot;Titan&quot;. (New York Public Library, Bruno Walter collection)
# 1896?, Hamburg – The base layer in a copyist&#x27;s handwriting, with revisions by Mahler. Probably prepared for 4th performance, in Berlin on 16 March. Contains 4 movements (&quot;Blumine&quot; not included). Known from this point on as &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;. (Sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s in 1984, currently inaccessible).
# 1898?, Vienna – In a copyist&#x27;s handwriting, based on the final version of the 1894? manuscript. This is the &quot;&quot; [engraver&#x27;s copy], used as a basis for the first score published by Weinberger in February 1899. Probably prepared for the 5th performance, in Prague.

An arrangement by Bruno Walter for piano four hands (two players at one piano) was published in 1906.

== Form ==
Mahler&#x27;s symphony as ultimately published exists in the traditional four-movement form:

The first movement is in modified sonata form. The second is a scherzo and trio based on a Ländler, a traditional Austrian waltz. The third is a slower funeral march with a lyrical central section, and the fourth serves as an expansive finale. Initially, there existed an additional second movement, entitled &quot;Blumine&quot;, but it was removed by Mahler for the final publication in 1899.

In the first performances, the following program notes were attributed to the symphony:

Part I: From the days of youth, &quot;youth, fruit, and thorn pieces&quot;.
#Spring and no end. This introduction describes the awakening of nature at the earliest dawn.
#Flowerine Chapter (Andante).
#Set with full sails (Scherzo).
Part II: (Human Comedy)

# Stranded. A funeral march in the manner of Callot.
# Dall&#x27;inferno al Paradiso (From Hell to Heaven), as the sudden expression of a deeply wounded heart.
These programmatic notes were dropped starting with the 1896 performance in Berlin, because Mahler did not want the audience to be misled by such notes and their inherent ambiguities.

=== First movement ===

The first movement is in a modified sonata form, with a substantially slow introduction in A minor (Phrygian). The introduction begins eerily with a seven-octave drone in the strings on A, with the upper octaves being played on harmonics in the violins. A descending two-note motif is then presented by the woodwinds, and eventually establishes itself into the following repeated pattern:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key d \minor \bar &quot;|:&quot; a&#x27;2 e | f c | d bes | a1 \bar &quot;:|&quot; }
&lt;/score&gt;
This opening quotes the fourth movement of Johannes Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in D major, where the first half of this motif repeats several times beginning at bar 234. It also alludes to the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 in B major in its descending pattern and minimalist nature. 
This theme is then interrupted by a fanfare-like material first presented in the clarinets, and later by offstage trumpets, indicated in the score as &quot;&quot; (&quot;placed at a very far distance&quot;).
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;trumpet&quot; \clef treble \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 &lt;e a,&gt;2~\ppp &lt;e a,&gt;8. &lt;e a,&gt;32-. &lt;e a,&gt;-. \times 2/3 { &lt;e a,&gt;8-. &lt;e a,&gt;-. &lt;e a,&gt;-. } | &lt;fis d&gt;8.--_&quot;accel.&quot; &lt;e a,&gt;16 &lt;e a,&gt;8.-- &lt;d fis,&gt;16 &lt;d fis,&gt;8.-- &lt;e a,&gt;16 &lt;e a,&gt;8.-- &lt;fis d&gt;16 | \times 2/3 { &lt;fis d&gt;8-. &lt;e a,&gt;-. &lt;d fis,&gt;-. } \times 2/3 { &lt;fis d&gt;8-. &lt;e a,&gt;-. &lt;d fis,&gt;-. } &lt;e a,&gt;8-.[ r16 &lt;e a,&gt;-.] &lt;e a,&gt;4~ | &lt;e a,&gt;2 }
&lt;/score&gt;
A slow melody is also played by the horns,
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; \clef treble \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 &lt;fis d&gt;2(\pp^&quot;molto espress.&quot;_&quot;sehr weich gesungen&quot; &lt;a, fis&gt;4 &lt;d a&gt; | &lt;fis d&gt; &lt;a cis,&gt;2 &lt;g b,&gt;4 | &lt;fis a,&gt;2) }
&lt;/score&gt;
and the descending two-note motif is sped up in the clarinet, imitating the sound of a cuckoo.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot; \clef treble \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 2*1 d&#x27;8-.\sf\&gt; a4 r8\! }
&lt;/score&gt;
This opening is very true to Mahler&#x27;s style, putting the emphasis on the winds, and not more traditionally on the strings.

The mood then lightens to mark the beginning of the exposition, and the descending fourth motif becomes the first theme. This melodic material is recycled from the second of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;, entitled &quot;&quot; (&quot;I Went This Morning over the Field&quot;).
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef bass \time 2/2 \tempo 4 = 156 \key d \major r2 d4-. a-. | d-. e-. fis-. g-. | a1~ | a4 }
&lt;/score&gt;

The melody is first presented in the cellos in D major, and passed throughout the orchestra. This melody builds in dynamic, as the music modulates to A major, and a brief second theme, based on a new E–F#–C#–F#–E motif, is presented on the higher woodwinds. A slower development ensues, bringing back material from the introduction, including the drone on A, the cuckoo calls in the clarinet, and the original motif, but modulates through various keys. A new French horn fanfare is issued,
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; \clef bass \time 2/2 \key d \major \tempo 2 = 66 \partial 4*1 &lt;a fis d&gt;4-.\ppp | &lt;d a fis&gt;2( &lt;a fis d&gt;4-.) &lt;a fis d&gt;-. | &lt;d a fis&gt;2 r4 &lt;a fis d&gt;4-. | &lt;d a fis&gt;4.-. &lt;a fis d&gt;8-. &lt;d a fis&gt;4-. &lt;fis d a&gt;-. | &lt;d a fis&gt;2 }
&lt;/score&gt;

and &quot;development&quot; materials from the first and second themes are heard. The music modulates through A major, then through D-flat major. A-flat major is to be the next, then C major, and finally F major. The retransition of the development section starts in F minor, causing a terrifying darkness. The tension gradually builds up in this section which foreshadows the theme of the fourth movement, ultimately reaching a triumphant cadence in D major. Then the recapitulation begins with a return of the French horn fanfare. Ultimately, the two-note motive takes over the final measures of the recapitulation, and a coda brings the movement to a fiery and humorous close.

=== Second movement ===
The second movement is a modified minuet and trio. Mahler replaces the minuet with a ländler, a dance-form that was a precursor to the Viennese waltz. This is a frequently-used structure in Mahler&#x27;s other symphonies, as well as Franz Schubert&#x27;s. One main theme repeats throughout the Ländler, and it gathers energy towards a hectic finish. The main melody outlines an A major chord:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 3/4 \tempo 4 = 180 \key a \major \partial 4*1 e8-. r | a r r \autoBeamOff cis e, r | a4~ a8 r r e | a r \autoBeamOn a-.[ b-.] cis-.[ d-.] | e4~ e8 }
&lt;/score&gt;
with a secondary subject based on the &quot;Blumine&quot; melody, but phrased in time as opposed to .

The trio contains contrasting lyrical material.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 3/4 \key f \major \tempo &quot;Recht gemächlich.&quot; 2. = 54 &lt;a f&gt;2\pp &lt;c, a&gt;8-. r8 | &lt;a&#x27; f&gt;2 &lt;c, a&gt;8-. r8 | \autoBeamOff &lt;a&#x27; f&gt;4-.( r8 &lt;bes e,&gt;-. &lt;a d,&gt;-. r | &lt;c c,&gt;2.) }
&lt;/score&gt;
However, as it comes to a close, Mahler alludes again to the Ländler by interjecting brief rising material from the first section. Finally, the Ländler makes a formal return, shortened and orchestrated more heavily to close the movement.

=== Third movement ===
The third movement, in A–B–A structure, acts as the slow movement in the four-movement plan. The extra-musical idea behind it is that of a hunter&#x27;s funeral and a procession of animals that follows.

The initial 1st subject of the A section is based on the popular round &quot;Bruder Jakob&quot; (although Mahler calls it &quot;Bruder Martin&quot;) more commonly known as &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;; however, Mahler places the melody in a minor mode.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c { \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key d \minor d4\p( e f8 e d4) \breathe | d4( e f8 e d4) \breathe | f( g a2) \breathe | f4( g a2) \breathe | a8.([ bes16 a8 g] f e d4) \breathe | a&#x27;8.([ bes16 a8 g] f e d4) \breathe | a&#x27;( a, d2) \breathe | a&#x27;4( a, d2) }
&lt;/score&gt;

The movement opens with the same falling fourth motif heard in the first movement, presented with the timpani. The subject is first presented by a solo double bass, followed by bassoon, tuba and, eventually, the entire orchestra. A counter-melody is played over top of the canon in the oboe.

The mood changes, and the 2nd subject, one of the most distinctive portions of this symphony follows. Mahler uses cymbal, bass drum, oboes, clarinets and a trumpet duo to produce the sound of a small folk band. Although this melody is often said to be inspired by Klezmer, it is actually inspired by Czech folk music, since what is commonly known as Klezmer was not played in the region in which Mahler lived. Despite this, Mahler&#x27;s use of klezmer is sometimes credited to his Jewish roots.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key d \minor \partial 8*3 &lt;fis d&gt;8(\pp\&lt; &lt;g e&gt; &lt;a fis&gt;)\! | &lt;bes g&gt;8.\p_&quot;subito&quot;( &lt;a fis&gt;16 &lt;bes g&gt;8. &lt;a fis&gt;16 &lt;bes g&gt;8. &lt;a fis&gt;16 &lt;bes g&gt; &lt;cis a&gt; &lt;d bes&gt; &lt;bes g&gt; | &lt;a f&gt;8. &lt;gis e&gt;16 &lt;a f&gt;8. &lt;gis e&gt;16 &lt;a f&gt;8. &lt;gis e&gt;16 &lt;a f&gt; &lt;cis gis!&gt; &lt;d a&gt; &lt;a f&gt;) | &lt;g! e&gt;4( &lt;e&#x27; g,&gt;) }
&lt;/score&gt;

After a brief return to the 1st subject, a more contemplative B section, in G major ensues, featuring material from the fourth of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Two Blue Eyes of my Beloved&quot;).
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key d \major \tempo 4 = 72 \partial 4*1 d8(\pp g) | g4. g8 g4-- a8( b) | b( d) d4-- d-- d8(^&quot;gliss.&quot; g) | g4--( g8-. g-.) g( a16 g fis8 g) | d4. b8 d4-- }
&lt;/score&gt;

After the B section ends, the A section is repeated in a varied form. The 1st subject returns in E-flat minor. Then the 2nd subject is heard again, and after a while, the music modulates back to D minor, and Mahler incorporates all three thematic elements on top of each other. The final few bars of the 2nd subject is heard next, and once again, the 1st subject appears briefly for one last time in D minor, and the movement ends with simple alternating fourth in the lower strings, notably the key motif from the first movement.

=== Fourth movement ===

The fourth movement, in sonata-allegro form with a very long and extended development section and a shortened recapitulation, is by far the most involved, and expansive. It brings back several elements from the first movement, unifying the symphony as a whole. The movement&#x27;s introduction begins with an abrupt cymbal crash, a loud chord in the upper woodwinds, string and brass, and a timpani roll, all in succession. This contrasts greatly with the end of the third movement. As the strings continue in a frenzy of notes, fragments of the first theme of the exposition, in F minor, appear, presented forcefully in the brass, before being played in entirety by the majority of winds:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 2/2 \tempo &quot;Energisch&quot; 2 = 92 \key f \minor \partial 4*1 f8-.\ff r | g2\f^^ aes^^ | c r4 f,8-. r | bes-. r c-. r des4-- c8-. bes-. | f&#x27;2( c8) r }
&lt;/score&gt;

The movement continues frantically, until a bridge passage on the strings leads to an expansive and lyrical second theme in D-flat major, which is presented in the strings.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 2/2 \key des \major \tempo &quot;Sehr gesangvoll&quot; r2 f\pp(~ | f4 e f aes,) | f&#x27;2( ees!~ | ees f) | des2.( d4) | ees( f ges aes) | ges2( f~ | f) }
&lt;/score&gt;

Eventually, the closing section of the exposition, over a tonic bass pedal, is heard in D-flat major, and then opening fragments in the brass emerge from the beginning of the development section, and the energy picks up once more. The fast-paced and loud development is only interrupted by a brief quiet section in which a brass fanfare based on the theme appears in C major. After further development of both themes in C minor, a climax is reached in C major, upon which the aforementioned brass fanfare is loudly reintroduced, unexpectedly modulating to D major. The horns then play a full-forced altered version of the descending fourth pattern from the beginning of the symphony:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 2/2 \key d \major \tempo 2 = 92 d2^.^^\ff a^.^^ | b^.^^ fis^.^^ | g^.^^ fis4-. e-. | a2 }
&lt;/score&gt;
However, this ultimately leads to a decrescendo, and the momentum sinks to the retransition, bringing back other quotes from the first movement, including fanfares, and &quot;&quot; (see Lieder section). The recapitulation begins with the second theme in F major, with the first theme following it in F minor, heavily featuring the violas. This leads into a restatement of the retransition from the first movement in which the fourth-movement theme was initially foreshadowed, followed by a restatement of the brass fanfare in the development (the start of the coda section), this time starting in D major rather than C major. The above theme is repeated, and this time it does not decrescendo, instead leading to the triumphant &quot;outro&quot; section. The symphony concludes with fanfare material from the beginning, ultimately ending humorously with a quick octave drop.

== Incorporation of German &quot;Lied&quot; ==

One of the most important marks that Mahler left on the symphony as a genre is the incorporation of another important genre of the 19th century; the German &quot;lied&quot;. In his first symphony, Mahler borrowed material from his song cycle &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;, thus innovating the symphonic form and potentially answering questions about programmatic and personal elements in the music.

Although some of Mahler&#x27;s symphonic predecessors experimented with lyricism in the symphony, Mahler&#x27;s approach was much more far-reaching. Through the use of the second of his &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot; cycle, &quot;, we can see how the composer manipulates the song&#x27;s form to accommodate the symphonic form. Within the symphonic movement, the &quot; melody is a bright exposition in contrast with the slower and darker introduction. Although the song plays a similar role in the song cycle, being surrounded by darker-themed songs, Mahler changes the order of the strophes as originally found in the song. Of the three verses, the more relaxed third verse is used at the beginning of the exposition, whereas the more chromatic and rhythmically active first and second verses are found in the closing section, helping build the energy to the end of the exposition.

In the third movement of the symphony, the quotation of the lied &quot;&quot; demonstrates the subtlety with which Mahler combined the two genres. Within this funeral march, we can see the composer&#x27;s union of form and meaning, and also elements of a programme. In the last verse of the song cycle, the speaker acknowledges the painlessness of death, saying, &quot;[under the linden tree] I knew not how life fared, [there] all was good again!&quot; This melody is employed as a countermelody to the &quot;Frère Jacques&quot; theme in the minor mode, but the counterpoint that Mahler uses is unconventional, and the two melodies are never properly consolidated. This unresolved counterpoint has been interpreted as a conflict between the &quot;Frère Jacques&quot; theme&#x27;s Catholic implications and the Jewish klezmer qualities of the &quot; theme, thus alluding to a social conflict of which Mahler was very aware.

The subtlety and implications of Mahler&#x27;s incorporation of the &quot; song into the funeral march bring us to the issue of programme. The composer&#x27;s ideas about programmatic content are not concrete. The matter of subjectivity comes up when discussing what meanings Mahler intended the lieder to bring to the orchestral work. Looking at the programmes that he provided, one can see many connections between the song cycle and the symphony&#x27;s programmatic elements, but then it must also be taken into consideration that Mahler later removed the programmes. Among this uncertainty though, it is clear that some narrative elements that are associated with the poet and composer of a lied were transferred from the song cycle to the symphony. The lack of words, makes it much more difficult for the composer to be subjective in the symphony, so a more universal message must be found. The composer&#x27;s comments about the &quot;world&quot; that a symphony creates seems to reinforce this idea.

== &quot;Blumine&quot; ==

&quot;Blumine&quot; is the title of the rejected &quot;andante&quot; second movement of the symphony. It was first named &quot;Blumine&quot; in 1893. However it was not discarded until after the first three performances, where it remained the second movement. After the 1894 performance (where it was called &quot;&quot;), the piece received harsh criticism, especially regarding the second movement. In the Berlin premiere in 1896, &quot;Blumine&quot; was cut out, along with the title &quot;Titan&quot; and the programme of the symphony. Shortly after this, the symphony was published without the &quot;Blumine&quot; movement and in the subsequent versions of the symphony it was gone.

&quot;Blumine&quot; originates from some incidental music Mahler wrote for Joseph Victor von Scheffel&#x27;s dramatic poem &quot;&quot;. The trumpet serenade was used for &quot;Blumine&quot; with little change. It was originally scored for a small orchestra and this is how it appears in &quot;Blumine&quot;, which is in contrast to the large orchestra used in the rest of the symphony. The movement is a short lyrical piece with a gentle trumpet solo, similar to the posthorn solos in Symphony No. 3. Even though it was cut from the symphony, there are still traces of its influence in the rest of the movements.

&quot;Blumine&quot; translates to &quot;floral&quot;, or &quot;flower&quot;, and some believe this movement was written for Johanna Richter, with whom Mahler was infatuated at the time. The style of this movement has much in common with Mahler&#x27;s earlier works but also shows the techniques and distinct style of his later compositions. It was rediscovered by Donald Mitchell in 1966, while doing research for his biography on Mahler in the Osborn Collection at Yale University, in a copy of the Hamburg version of the symphony. Apparently, Mahler had given it to a woman he tutored at the Vienna Conservatory. It was passed on to her son, who then sold it to James Osborn, who then donated it to Yale University.

Benjamin Britten gave the first performance of the reconstructed Hamburg version in 1967, after it had been lost for over seventy years. After this discovery, other people performed this movement, some simply inserting the &quot;Blumine&quot; into the 1906 version. However, many people did not agree about playing this music as part of the symphony. Mahler had rejected it from his symphony, they reasoned, so it should not be played as part of it. Furthermore, the &quot;Blumine&quot; movement does not share the other movements&#x27; focus on the perfect fourth interval, making it incongruous within the symphony. Famous Mahler conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Georg Solti and Bernard Haitink never performed it. Others perform &quot;Blumine&quot; before or after the symphony, while still others have performed it on its own or alongside Mahler&#x27;s other works.

<text>Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic (analog or digital) equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment, communications and recreation. These products are usually referred to as black goods in American English, due to many products being housed in black or dark casings. This term is used to distinguish them from &quot;white goods&quot;, which are meant for housekeeping tasks, such as washing machines and refrigerators. In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers. In the 2010s, this distinction is absent in large big box consumer electronics stores, which sell entertainment, communication and home office devices, light fixtures and appliances, including the bathroom type.

Radio broadcasting in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the broadcast receiver. Later products included telephones, televisions, and calculators, then audio and video recorders and players, video game consoles, mobile phones, personal computers and MP3 players. In the 2010s, consumer electronics stores often sell GPS, automotive electronics (vehicle audio), video game consoles, electronic musical instruments (e.g., synthesizer keyboards), karaoke machines, digital cameras, and video players (VCRs in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by DVD players and Blu-ray players). Stores also sell smart light fixtures and appliances, digital cameras, camcorders, mobile phones, and smartphones. Some of the newer products sold include virtual reality head-mounted display goggles, smart home devices that connect home devices to the Internet, streaming devices, and wearable technology.

In the 2010s, most consumer electronics have become based on digital technologies. They have essentially merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to as the consumerization of information technology. Some consumer electronics stores have also begun selling office and baby furniture. Consumer electronics stores may be &quot;brick and mortar&quot; physical retail stores, online stores, or combinations of both. Annual consumer electronics sales are expected to reach by 2020. It is part of the wider electronics industry. In turn, the driving force behind the electronics industry is the semiconductor industry.

==History==
For its first fifty years, the phonograph turntable did not use electronics; the needle and sound horn were purely mechanical technologies. However, in the 1920s, radio broadcasting became the basis of mass production of radio receivers. The vacuum tubes that had made radios practical were used with record players as well, to amplify the sound so that it could be played through a loudspeaker. Television was soon invented but remained insignificant in the consumer market until the 1950s.

The first working transistor, a point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, which led to significant research in the field of solid-state semiconductors in the early-1950s. The invention and development of the earliest transistors at Bell led to transistor radios. This led to the emergence of the home entertainment consumer electronics industry starting in the 1950s, largely due to the efforts of Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now Sony) in successfully commercializing transistor technology for a mass market, with affordable transistor radios and then transistorized television sets.

Integrated circuits (ICs) followed when manufacturers built circuits (usually for military purposes) on a single substrate using electrical connections between circuits within the chip itself. IC technology led to more advanced and cheaper consumer electronics, such as transistorized televisions, pocket calculators, and by the 1980s, affordable video game consoles and personal computers that regular middle-class families could buy.

Starting in the 1980s with the compact disc and the introduction of personal computers, and until the early 2000s, many consumer electronics devices such as televisions and stereo systems, were digitized: digital computer technology, and thus digital signals, were integrated into the operation of consumer electronics devices, drastically changing their operation but with improved results such as improved image quality in televisions. This was made possible by Moore&#x27;s law.

In 2004, the consumer electronics industry was worth US$240billion annually worldwide comprising visual equipment, audio equipment, and games consoles. It was truly global with Asia Pacific having 35% market share, Europe having 31.5%, the US having 23%, and the rest of the world having the rest. Major players in this industry are household names like Sony, Samsung, Philips, Sanyo, and Sharp. Samsung Electronics is part of Samsung. In 2003, combined revenues for Samsung Electronics were $55billion. Samsung Electronics UK is a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics contributing $1.2billion in revenues. Samsung Electronics has one of the highest R&amp;D expenditure as a proportion of revenues in the industry and spent about $2.9billion in 2003. Along with its competitors, Samsung Electronics is global and employs 88,000 people in 89 offices in 46 countries. Not including facilities in Korea, it has 24 manufacturing complexes, 40 distribution bases and 15 branches spread over all continents except Antarctica. Countries with manufacturing facilities include the US, Malaysia, China, India, and Hungary.

=== White Goods ===
The increase in popularity of such domestic appliances as &#x27;white goods&#x27; is a characteristic element of consumption patterns during the golden age of the Western economy. Europe&#x27;s White Goods industry has evolved over the past 40 years, first by changing tariff barriers, and later by technical and demand shifts. The spending on domestic appliances has claimed only a tiny fraction of disposable income, rising from 0.5percent in the US in 1920, to about 2percent in 1980. Yet the sequence of electrical and mechanical durables have altered the activities and experiences of households in America and Britain in the twentieth century. With the expansion of cookers, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, washing machines, radios, televisions, air conditioning, and microwave ovens, households have gained an escalating number of appliances. Despite the ubiquity of these goods, their diffusion is not well understood. Some types of appliances diffuse more frequently than others. In particular, home entertainment appliances such as radio and television have diffused much faster than household and kitchen machines.&quot;

==Products==
Consumer electronics devices include those used for 
* entertainment (flatscreen TVs, television sets, MP3 players, video recorders, DVD players, radio receivers, etc.)
* communications (telephones, mobile phones, email-capable personal computers, desktop computers, laptops, printers, paper shredders, etc.)
* recreation (digital cameras, camcorders, video game consoles, ROM cartridges, radio-controlled cars, robot kits, etc.).

Increasingly consumer electronics products such as digital distribution of video games have become based on the internet and digital technologies. The consumer electronics industry has primarily merged with the software industry in what is increasingly referred to as the consumerization of information technology.

===Trends===
One overriding characteristic of consumer electronic products is the trend of ever-falling prices. This is driven by gains in manufacturing efficiency and automation, lower labor costs as manufacturing has moved to lower-wage countries, and improvements in semiconductor design. Semiconductor components benefit from Moore&#x27;s law, an observed principle which states that, for a given price, semiconductor functionality doubles every two years.

While consumer electronics continues in its trend of convergence, combining elements of many products, consumers face different purchasing decisions. There is an ever-increasing need to keep product information updated and comparable for the consumer to make an informed choice. Style, price, specification, and performance are all relevant. There are a gradual shift towards e-commerce web-storefronts.

Many products include Internet access using technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, EDGE, or Ethernet. Products not traditionally associated with computer use (such as TVs or hi-fi equipment) now provide options to connect to the Internet or to a computer using a home network to provide access to digital content. The desire for high-definition (HD) content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies, such as WirelessHD or ITU-T G.hn, which are optimized for distribution of HD content between consumer electronic devices in a home.

=== Business competition ===
The consumer electronics industry faces consumers with unpredictable tastes on the demand side, supplier-related delays or disruptions on the supply side, and production challenges occurring in the process. The high rate of technology evolution or revolution requires large investments without any guarantee of profitable returns. As a result, the big players rely on global markets to achieve economies of scale. Even these companies sometimes have to cooperate with each other, for instance on standards, to reduce the risk of their investments. In supply chain management, there is much discussion on risks related to such aspects of supply chains as short product life cycles, high competition combined with cooperation, and globalization. The consumer electronics industry is the very embodiment of these aspects of supply chain management and related risks. While some of the supply and demand related risks are similar to such industries as the toy industry, the consumer electronics industry faces additional risks due to its vertically integrated supply chains. There are also numerous supply-chain-wide contextual risks that cut across the supply chain especially impacting companies with global supply chains. These include cultural differences in multinational operations, environmental risk, regulations risk, and exchange rate risk across multiple countries. Whether or not demand is comparable across countries affects the extent of the gains from international integration. In addition, consumer preferences change over time to disturb existing patterns of behavior. A feature of some industries is that demand for variety increases as the market moves from first-time buying to replacement demand. A resource to further understand this idea of consumer preferences can be observed through Lizabeth Cohen&#x27;s book titled, &quot;A Consumers&#x27; Republic&quot;, &quot;Only if we have large demands can we expect large production&quot;.

==Industries==
The electronics industry, especially consumer electronics, emerged in the 20th century and has become a global industry worth billions of dollars. Contemporary society uses all manner of electronic devices built-in automated or semi-automated factories operated by the industry.

===Manufacturing===


Most consumer electronics are built in China, due to maintenance cost, availability of materials, quality, and speed as opposed to other countries such as the United States. Cities such as Shenzhen have become important production centres for the industry, attracting many consumer electronics companies such as Apple Inc.

====Electronic component====

An electronic component is any essential discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields. Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular form, and are not to be confused with electrical elements, conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components.

====Software development====

Consumer electronics such as personal computers use various types of software. Embedded software is used within some consumer electronics, such as mobile phones. This type of software may be embedded within the hardware of electronic devices. Some consumer electronics include software that is used on a personal computer in conjunction with electronic devices, such as camcorders and digital cameras, and third-party software for such devices also exists.

====Standardization====
Some consumer electronics adhere to protocols, such as connection protocols &quot;to high speed bi-directional signals&quot;. In telecommunications, a communications protocol is a system of digital rules for data exchange within or between computers.

===Trade shows===
The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) trade show has taken place yearly in Las Vegas, Nevada since its foundation in 1973. The event, which grew from having 100 exhibitors in its inaugural year to more than 4,500 exhibiting companies in its 2020 edition, features the latest in consumer electronics, speeches by industry experts and innovation awards.

The IFA Berlin trade show has taken place in Berlin, Germany since its foundation in 1924. The event features new consumer electronics and speeches by industry pioneers.

===IEEE initiatives===

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the world&#x27;s largest professional society, has many initiatives to advance the state of the art of consumer electronics. IEEE has a dedicated society of thousands of professionals to promote CE, called the Consumer Electronics Society (CESoc). IEEE has multiple periodicals and international conferences to promote CE and encourage collaborative research and development in CE. The flagship conference of CESoc, called IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE), is in its 35th year.
* IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics
* IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine
* IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society also have initiated a conference to research on next generation consumer electronics as Smart Electronics. The conference named IEEE Symposium on Smart Electronics Systems (IEEE-iSES) is on its 9th year.

===Retailing===
Electronics retailing is a significant part of the retail industry in many countries. In the United States, dedicated consumer electronics stores have mostly given way to big-box stores such as Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics retailer in the country, although smaller dedicated stores include Apple Stores, and specialist stores that serve, for example, audiophiles and exceptions, such as the single-branch B&amp;H Photo store in New York City. Broad-based retailers, such as Walmart and Target, also sell consumer electronics in many of their stores. In April 2014, retail e-commerce sales were the highest in the consumer electronic and computer categories as well. Some consumer electronics retailers offer extended warranties on products with programs such as &quot;SquareTrade&quot;.
An electronics district is an area of commerce with a high density of retail stores that sell consumer electronics.
===Service and repair===

Consumer electronic service can refer to the maintenance of said products. When consumer electronics have malfunctions, they may sometimes be repaired.

In 2013, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the increased popularity in listening to sound from analog audio devices, such as phonographs, as opposed to digital sound, has sparked a noticeable increase of business for the electronic repair industry there.

===Mobile phone industry===
A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called &quot;cellular telephones&quot; or &quot;cell phones&quot; in North America. In addition to telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.

A smartphone is a portable device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web navigation over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of MOSFET integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).

====By country====
==Environmental impact==
In 2017, Greenpeace USA published a study of 17 of the world&#x27;s leading consumer electronics companies about their energy and resource consumption and the use of chemicals.

=== Rare metals and rare earth elements ===
Electronic devices use thousands rare metals and rare earth elements (40 on average for a smartphone), these material are extracted and refined using water and energy-intensive processes. These metals are also used in the renewable energy industry meaning that consumer electronics are directly competing for the raw materials.

=== Energy consumption ===
The energy consumption of consumer electronics and their environmental impact, either from their production processes or the disposal of the devices, is increasing steadily. EIA estimates that electronic devices and gadgets account for about 10%–15% of the energy use in American homes – largely because of their number; the average house has dozens of electronic devices. The energy consumption of consumer electronics increases – in America and Europe – to about 50% of household consumption if the term is redefined to include home appliances such as refrigerators, dryers, clothes washers and dishwashers.

===Standby power===
Standby power – used by consumer electronics and appliances while they are turned off – accounts for 5–10% of total household energy consumption, costing $100 annually to the average household in the United States. A study by United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Berkeley Lab found that a videocassette recorders (VCRs) consume more electricity during the course of a year in standby mode than when they are used to record or playback videos. Similar findings were obtained concerning satellite boxes, which consume almost the same amount of energy in &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; modes.

A 2012 study in the United Kingdom, carried out by the Energy Saving Trust, found that the devices using the most power on standby mode included televisions, satellite boxes, and other video and audio equipment. The study concluded that UK households could save up to £86 per year by switching devices off instead of using standby mode. A report from the International Energy Agency in 2014 found that $80billion of power is wasted globally per year due to inefficiency of electronic devices. Consumers can reduce unwanted use of standby power by unplugging their devices, using power strips with switches, or by buying devices that are standardized for better energy management, particularly Energy Star-marked products.

===Electronic waste===
A high number of different metals and low concentration rates in electronics means that recycling is limited and energy intensive. Electronic waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Many consumer electronics may contain toxic minerals and elements, and many electronic scrap components, such as CRTs, may contain contaminants such as lead, cadmium, beryllium, mercury, dioxins, or brominated flame retardants. Electronic waste recycling may involve significant risk to workers and communities and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes. However, large amounts of the produced electronic waste from developed countries is exported, and handled by the informal sector in countries like India, despite the fact that exporting electronic waste to them is illegal. Strong informal sector can be a problem for the safe and clean recycling.

====Reuse and repair====

E-waste policy has gone through various incarnations since the 1970s, with emphases changing as the decades passed. More weight was gradually placed on the need to dispose of e-waste more carefully due to the toxic materials it may contain. There has also been recognition that various valuable metals and plastics from waste electrical equipment can be recycled for other uses. More recently, the desirability of reusing whole appliances has been foregrounded in the &#x27;preparation for reuse&#x27; guidelines. The policy focus is slowly moving towards a potential shift in attitudes to reuse and repair.

With turnover of small household appliances high and costs relatively low, many consumers will throw unwanted electric goods in the normal dustbin, meaning that items of potentially high reuse or recycling value go to landfills. While more oversized items such as washing machines are usually collected, it has been estimated that the 160,000 tonnes of EEE in regular waste collections were worth £220million. And 23% of EEE taken to Household Waste Recycling Centres was immediately resaleable – or would be with minor repairs or refurbishment. This indicates a lack of awareness among consumers about where and how to dispose of EEE and the potential value of things that are going in the bin.

For the reuse and repair of electrical goods to increase substantially in the UK, some barriers must be overcome. These include people&#x27;s mistrust of used equipment in terms of whether it will be functional, safe and the stigma for some of owning second-hand goods. But the benefits of reuse could allow lower-income households access to previously unaffordable technology while helping the environment at the same time.

==Health impact==

Desktop monitors and laptops produce major physical health concerns for humans when bodies are forced into unhealthy and uncomfortable positions to see the screen better. From this, neck and back pains and problems increase, commonly referred to as repetitive strain injuries. Using electronics before going to bed makes it difficult for people to fall asleep, hurting human health. Sleeping less prevents people from performing to their full potential physically and mentally and can also &quot;increase rates of obesity and diabetes&quot;, which are &quot;long-term health consequences&quot;. Obesity and diabetes are more commonly seen in students and in youth because they tend to be the ones using electronics the most. &quot;People who frequently use their thumbs to type text messages on cell phones can develop a painful affliction called De Quervain syndrome that affects their tendons on their hands. The best-known disease in this category is called carpal tunnel syndrome, which results from pressure on the median nerve in the wrist&quot;.
