<doc id="189448" wikidata="Q218169" url="?curid=189448" title="Tenné">
<text>In heraldry, tenné (; sometimes termed tenny or tawny) is a &quot;stain&quot;, or non-standard tincture, of orange (in English blazonry), light brown (in French heraldry) or orange-tawny (in continental heraldry) colour.

Tenné, however, is not to be confused with &quot;brunâtre&quot; (&quot;brownish&quot;) of French and German blazons. Tenné is used for the depiction of leather colour, while the much darker brunâtre is used for the depiction of bear hide colour.

==Etymology==
In the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;tenné&quot; is described as &quot;orange-brown, as a stain used in blazoning&quot;, and as a mid-16th-century variant of Old French &quot;tané&quot;. The origin of both &quot;tenné&quot; and &quot;tawny&quot; is the Medieval Latin word &quot;tannare&quot;, meaning &quot;to tan leather&quot;. As such, in French (and most of continental) heraldry, tenné is the light-brownish colour that leather is supposed to have once tanned. Used primarily for depicting wood and skin in &quot;proper&quot; charges, it then slowly became its own tincture.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first known use of term &quot;tenné&quot; in English (as &#x27;tenne&#x27;) was by Gerard Leigh in his 1562 &quot;Accedens of Armory&quot;. Leigh (1597) says of the tincture so named: &quot;It is the surest colour that is, of so bright a hewe, being componed: for it is made of two bright colours, which is Redde and Yellowe&quot;. Elsewhere, Leigh observes that roundels colored &quot;tenné&quot; are termed &#x27;oranges&#x27; &quot;because the Orenge is of the same colour, and is also round&quot;. A glossary appended to a later edition of the same work defines &quot;tenné&quot; as &quot;Orenge colour&quot;.

==Hatchings==
Perhaps as a symptom of the theoretical nature of heraldic stains, the hatchings assigned to these have been inconsistent among sources. The hatching for tenné has been given variously as a combination of vertical lines (as gules) and dexter to sinister lines (as vert), or as a combination of horizontal lines (as azure) and sinister to dexter lines (as purpure), (and other combinations may be found in other sources) though both these sources provide the same hatching of alternating vertical dots and dashes for &quot;orange&quot;.

==Poetic meanings==
In the system of poetic meanings, tenné is associated with the Dragon&#x27;s tail and with the gemstone sardonyx.

==In theory and in practice==
While tenné is frequently mentioned in books about heraldry, it is not among the basic heraldic colours and its appearance in practice is quite rare. Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, in his &quot;Complete Guide to Heraldry&quot;, asserted that both tenné and murrey were probably inventions of the theoretical (though never shown in actual practice) system of abatements, further commenting that he knew of only one instance of tenné to date (as of 1909), and that was in an estate livery rather than coat armory. &quot;The Oxford Guide to Heraldry&quot; cites a late-14th century English treatise as stating that in addition to the two metals and five colours, a colour called &quot;tawny&quot; was &quot;borne only in the Empire and France,&quot; the &quot;Oxford Guide&quot; also citing Gerard Leigh&#x27;s &quot;The Accendance of Armory&quot; (1562) as rejecting tenné or tawny as non-existent and sanguine or murrey as mistaken purpure.

==In Britain==

Despite its role in the system of theoretical abatements of honour introduced in the 16th century, tenné is quite rare in British armory, appearing only occasionally in liveries and never as a colour upon the escutcheon. &quot;The Oxford Guide to Heraldry&quot; notes that the &quot;stains&quot; (tenné, murrey and sanguine) &quot;occur occasionally in the twentieth century but have never been spotted in a Visitation record.&quot; Fox-Davies named the estate livery of Lord Fitzhardinge, worn by the lord&#x27;s hunt servants, as the only known occurrence of &quot;orange-tawny&quot; in British armory. To this, Woodward was able to add the standards of both the Earl of Derby, bearing the Stanley crest upon a field of tawny and vert, and the Earl of Northumberland, bearing &quot;four horizontal bands, the upper being russet, the two central ones yellow, and the lowest tawny&quot;. The Coat of arms of West Yorkshire (1975–1986) was supported on the sinister side by a lion &quot;per fess tenne and vert&quot;, with a lion &quot;per fess gules and tenne&quot; in crest.

According to the Heraldry Society of Scotland, the team colours of the Dundee United Football Club should be called &quot;tenny and argent&quot;. Dundee United calls the colours tangerine and white, and the team is referred to as &quot;the tangerines&quot;.

==In continental Europe==
According to the &quot;Oxford Guide to Heraldry&quot;, a late-14th century English treatise on heraldry stated that a colour called &quot;tawny&quot; was &quot;borne only in the Empire and France.&quot; Fox-Davies suggested that orange, as it appears in German heraldry, may be a different colour than tenné, noting that a different hatching is associated with German &quot;orange&quot; than that of British &quot;tenné&quot;. German heraldic author Ottfried Neubecker also noted a distinction between &quot;orange&quot; and &quot;brown&quot; or &quot;tenné&quot;, showing the usual hatching for tenné but a distinctive hatching of alternating vertical dots and dashes for orange. Orangé, tanné and tenné appear in the civic arms of several communes in the Department of Oise in France.

In French heraldry, &quot;tanné&quot; (same as tenné) is traditionally a light brown. It is to be a light brown colour, bright enough to be distinguished from the darkest heraldic colour, sable (black), as well as the darker brown color brunâtre, used for bear hide fur. It should also be a distinctive brown, and be clearly different than both flesh-color &quot;carnation&quot; and &quot;orangé&quot;, used per example as the field color for the arms of the French commune of Lamorlaye. Tenné takes its name from the colour of tanned leather, and occurs in the field of the arms of a few French communes, including Maruéjols-lès-Gardon. &quot;Tanné&quot; colour also occurs in the dexter chief quarter of the arms of La Neuville-Roy, where it notably replaces azure as the field for a semy of fleurs-de-lys very reminiscent of the ancient arms of France.

In English heraldry, all these colours are sometimes—yet mistakenly—confused as &quot;tenné&quot;.

==In Australia==

Granted in 1978, the Coat of arms of the Northern Territory has a tenny field, with a design inspired by Aboriginal paintings.

==In South Africa==

Orange is a common colour in South African heraldry, because of the history of South Africa as a Dutch colony, and the fact that royal house of the Netherlands is the House of Orange. The Dutch Prince&#x27;s Flag was an orange white and blue tricolour, and this was the basis of the flags of the Orange Free State (1857-1902) and the Union of South Africa (1928-1994).

==In the United States==

Tenné (so blazoned) is found in the arms and colours of some U.S. military units, particularly in the Signal Corps, where the colour is shown as a bright shade of orange, and the Cavalry, where tenné is sometimes called &quot;dragoon yellow&quot;.

The coat of arms of the 1st Signal Battalion, designed in 1932 by the U.S. Army Heraldic Program Office (since 1960 called the Institute of Heraldry) is &quot;per bend argent and tenné,&quot; since orange and white are the traditional colours of the Signal Corps. These colours are repeated in the arms of virtually every battalion in the Signal Corps.

The 1st Cavalry Regiment (also known as the 1st Regiment of Dragoons) was assigned a coat of arms by the Heraldic Program Office in 1921 featuring a gold dragon on a field of tenné. The 1st Cavalry was founded as the Regiment of United States Dragoons in 1833, and at the time the dragoon units wore a cord of tenné (which they called &quot;dragoon yellow&quot;) and Or (gold). These are also the colours of the torse in the coat of arms of the unit.

==In popular culture==

The &quot;Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot; describes the official tunic color of Star Fleet Command Section standard issue uniforms, such as those worn by James Kirk and Hikaru Sulu, as &quot;tenne&quot;. These are the tunics depicted on the actual show as yellow-gold fabric. Separate from this, officers of Captain&#x27;s rank or higher may optionally wear tunics and dress uniforms greenish in hue; the &quot;Manual&quot; specifies this color as &quot;olive.&quot;

<doc id="189451" wikidata="Q189575" url="?curid=189451" title="Ion Iliescu">
<text>Ion Iliescu (; born 3 March 1930) is a Romanian politician and engineer who served as the second and fourth president of Romania from 1989 until 1996 and from 2000 until 2004. Between 1996 and 2000 and also from 2004 to 2008, the year in which he retired, Iliescu was a senator for the Social Democratic Party (PSD), of which he is the founder and honorary president to this day.

Iliescu joined the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1953 and became a member of its Central Committee in 1965. Beginning with 1971, he was gradually marginalized by Nicolae Ceaușescu. He had a leading role in the Romanian Revolution, becoming the country&#x27;s president in December 1989. In May 1990, he became Romania&#x27;s first freely elected head of state. After a new constitution was approved by popular referendum, he served a further two terms, firstly from 1992 to 1996 and then secondly from 2000 to 2004, separated by the presidency of Emil Constantinescu, who defeated him in 1996.

In 2004, during his presidency, Romania joined NATO. In April 2018, Iliescu was charged in Romania with committing crimes against humanity by &quot;approving military measures, some of which had an evidently diversionary character&quot; during the deadly aftermath of the country&#x27;s 1989 revolution. In 2020, a judge rejected the case due to irregularities in the indictment. The indictment was remade and in 2023 the Court of Appeals decided that the trial can start. Iliescu is currently the oldest living former Romanian president.

== Early life and education ==

Ion Iliescu was born in Oltenița, on 3 March 1930. He was the son of Alexandru Iliescu and Maria Dumitru Toma. His mother, who was originally from Bulgaria, abandoned him when he was an infant. His father, a railroad worker, had communist views, during a period in which the Romanian Communist Party was banned by the authorities. In 1931, he went to the Soviet Union to take part in the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He remained in the USSR for the next four years and was arrested upon his return. He was imprisoned by the Romanian authorities from June 1940 to August 1944 and died in August 1945. During his time in the Soviet Union, Alexandru Iliescu divorced and married Marița, a chambermaid. According to Iliescu&#x27;s own statements, his grandfather, Vasili Ivanovici, was a Russian Jew, who, being persecuted by the tsarist authorities because of his socialist views, took refuge in Romania.

=== Education ===
Iliescu was raised by his stepmother and by his grandparents. At age 9 he was adopted by an aunt, Aristița, who worked as a cook for Ana Pauker. He studied fluid mechanics at the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute and then as a foreign student at Moscow Power Engineering Institute. During his stay in Moscow, he was the secretary of the &quot;Association of Romanian Students&quot;; it is alleged that he met Mikhail Gorbachev, although Iliescu always denied this. However, years later, president Nicolae Ceaușescu probably believed that there was a connection between the two, since during Gorbachev&#x27;s visit to Romania in July 1989, Iliescu was sent outside of Bucharest to prevent any contact.

Iliescu learned to speak English after the 1989 Revolution; he also speaks Russian, French, and some Spanish.

=== Marriage ===
In 1948 he met Elena &quot;Nina&quot; Șerbănescu, when they were both 18-year old students, he at the Saint Sava High School and she at the Iulia Hasdeu High School, in Bucharest. The two were married on July 21, 1951; they have no children as Nina had three miscarriages.

== Early political career (1944–1989) ==

=== Entry into politics ===

He joined the Union of Communist Youth in 1944 and the Communist Party in 1953 - becoming a career politician from that point forward. He was nominated and elected to be the secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth in 1956, and later elected to the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965. He also briefly served as the head of the Department of Propaganda, before taking the job of Minister for Youth-related Issues in 1967. In 1972, he was pressured to resign from this job, since Ceaușescu did not fully trust him and believed that Iliescu would be his successor. 

After this point, he was effectively sidelined from the national political scene yet retained his seat on the Central Committee of the Party; however Ceaușescu could not have him ousted from it until 1985 since he required a majority within the Committee to approve such a measure. Iliescu was demoted to vice-president of the Timiș County Council (1972–1974), and later president of the Iași Council (1974–1979). Until 1989, he was in charge of the Editura Tehnică publishing house. After his removal from the Central Committee in 1985, the Securitate (secret police) kept a closer watch on him, as he was openly in opposition to Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule while serving on the Committee.

=== Romanian Revolution ===

The Romanian Revolution began as a popular revolt in Timișoara. After Ceaușescu was overthrown on 22 December, the political vacuum was filled by an organization named National Salvation Front (FSN: &quot;Frontul Salvării Naționale&quot;), formed spontaneously by second-rank Communist party members opposed to the policies of Ceaușescu and non-affiliated participants in the revolt. Iliescu was quickly acknowledged as the leader of the organization and therefore of the provisional authority. He first learned of the revolution when he noticed the Securitate was no longer tailing him.

The Ceaușescus were captured, hauled before a drumhead court-martial, and executed on Christmas Day. Years later, Iliescu conceded that the trial and execution were &quot;quite shameful, but necessary&quot; to end the chaos that had riven the country since Ceaușescu&#x27;s overthrow.
Iliescu proposed multi-party elections and an &quot;original democracy&quot;. This is widely held to have meant the adoption of &quot;Perestroika&quot;-style reforms rather than the complete removal of existing institutions; it can be linked to the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country.

Iliescu later evoked the possibility of trying a &quot;Swedish model&quot; of social democracy and democratic socialism.

Rumours abounded for years that Iliescu and other high-ranking Party officials had been planning to overthrow Ceaușescu, but the events of December 1989 overtook them. For instance, Nicolae Militaru, the new regime&#x27;s first Defense Minister, said that Iliescu and others had planned to take Ceaușescu prisoner in February 1990 while he was out of the capital. However, Iliescu denied this, saying that the nature of the Ceaușescu regime—particularly the Securitate&#x27;s ubiquity—made advance planning for a coup all but impossible.
== Presidency (1990–2004) ==

=== First term (1990–1996) ===
The National Salvation Front (FSN) subsequently decided to organize itself as a party and participate in the 1990 general election—the first free election held in the country in 53 years–with Iliescu as its presidential candidate. The FSN won a sweeping victory, taking strong majorities in both chambers. In the separate presidential election, Iliescu won handily, taking 85 percent of the vote, still the largest vote share for a free presidential election. He became Romania&#x27;s first democratically elected head of state. To date, it is the only time since the Fall of Communism that a president has been elected in a single round.

Iliescu and his supporters split from the Front and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), which later evolved into the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), then the Social Democratic Party (PSD) (see Social Democratic Party of Romania). Progressively, the Front lost its character as a national government or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility.

Under the pressure of the events that led to the Mineriads, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent of &quot;Perestroika&quot;, Iliescu recast himself as a Western European social democrat. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong nationalist and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceaușescu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most Communist-to-social democrat changes in the Eastern Bloc, Romania&#x27;s tended to retain various cornerstones.
Romania adopted its first post-Communist Constitution in 1991. In 1992, Iliescu won a second term when he received 61% of the vote in the second round. He immediately suspended his NSDF membership; the Constitution does not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term. 

=== 1996 presidential campaign ===
He ran for a third time in 1996 but, stripped of media monopoly, he lost in the second round to Emil Constantinescu, his second-round opponent in 1992. Over 1,000,000 votes were cancelled, leading to accusations of widespread fraud. Nevertheless, Iliescu conceded defeat within hours of polls closing, making him the only incumbent president to lose a bid for re-election since the end of Communism.

=== Second term (2000–2004) ===

In the 2000 presidential election Iliescu ran again and won in the run-off against the ultra-nationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor. He began his third term on 20 December of that year, ending on 20 December 2004. The center-right was severely defeated during the 2000 elections due largely to public dissatisfaction with the harsh economic reforms of the previous four years as well as the political instability and infighting of the multiparty coalition. Tudor&#x27;s extreme views also ensured that most urban voters either abstained or chose Iliescu. The Năstase government, which came to power in this term of Iliescu, continued part of the series of reforms started by the previous governments between 1996 and 2000. During the second term of Ion Iliescu, Romania joined NATO and completed the negotiations for the accession to the European Union. One of the actions of the presidential institution during Ion Iliescu&#x27;s second term was the establishment of the &quot;International Commission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania&quot;, following diplomatic incidents caused by the Holocaust denial practiced by important figures in the country&#x27;s leadership. The commission, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, drew up a report on the Holocaust in Romania, report assumed and declared &quot;state document&quot; by Ion Iliescu.

== Post-presidency (2004–present) ==
In the PSD elections of 21 April 2005, Iliescu lost the Party presidency to Mircea Geoană, but was elected as honorary president of the party in 2006, a position without official executive authority in the party. 

In 2009, he appeared in a scene in the film Medal of Honor. 

In April 2019, Iliescu was admitted to a cardiological medical center in Bucharest. In September 2023, he was hospitalized in Bucharest.

==Controversies==

Though enjoying a certain popularity due to his opposition to Ceaușescu and image as a revolutionary, his political career after 1989 was characterized by multiple controversies and scandals. Public opinion regarding his tenure as president is still divided.

===Alleged KGB connections===
Some alleged Iliescu had connections to the KGB; the allegations continued during 2003–2008, when Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, who had been granted access to Soviet archives, declared that Iliescu and some of the NSF members were KGB agents, that Iliescu had been in close connection with Mikhail Gorbachev ever since they had allegedly met during Iliescu&#x27;s stay in Moscow, and that the Romanian Revolution of 1989 was a plot organized by the KGB to regain control of the country&#x27;s policies (gradually lost under Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule). The only hard evidence published was a discussion between Gorbachev and Bulgaria&#x27;s Aleksandar Lilov from 23 May 1990 (after Iliescu&#x27;s victory in the 20 May elections) in which Gorbachev says that Iliescu holds a &quot;calculated position&quot;, and that despite sharing common views with Iliescu, Gorbachev wanted to avoid sharing this impression with the public.

===Mineriads===

Iliescu, along with other figures in the leading FSN, was allegedly responsible for calling the Jiu Valley miners to Bucharest on January (January 1990 Mineriad) and June (June 1990 Mineriad) 1990 to end the protests of the citizens gathered in University Square, Bucharest, protests aimed against the ex-Communist leaders of Romania (like himself). The pejorative term for this demonstration was the Golaniad (from the Romanian &quot;golan&quot;, rascal). On 13 June, an attempt of the authorities to remove from the square around 100 protesters, which had remained in the street even after the May elections had confirmed Iliescu and the FSN, resulted in attacks against several state institutions, such as the Ministry of Interior, the Bucharest Police Headquarters and the National Television. Iliescu issued a call to the Romanian people to come and defend the government, prompting several groups of miners to descend on the capital, armed with wooden clubs and bats. They trashed the University of Bucharest, some newspaper offices and the headquarters of opposition parties, claiming that they were havens of decadence and immorality – drugs, firearms and munitions, &quot;an automatic typewriter&quot;, and fake currency. The June 1990 Mineriad in particular was widely criticized both at home and internationally, with one historian (Andrei Pippidi) comparing the events to Nazi Germany&#x27;s Kristallnacht. Government inquiries later established that the miners were infiltrated and instigated by former Securitate operatives. In February 1994 a Bucharest court &quot;found two security officers, Colonel Ion Nicolae and warrant officer Corneliu Dumitrescu, guilty of ransacking the house of Ion Rațiu, a leading figure in the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party, during the miners&#x27; incursion and stealing $100,000.&quot;

===King Michael===
In 1992, three years after the revolution which overthrew the Communist dictatorship, the Romanian government allowed King Michael I to return to his country for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. In Bucharest, over a million people turned out to see him. Michael&#x27;s popularity alarmed the government of President Iliescu, so Michael was forbidden to visit Romania again for five years. In 1997, after Iliescu&#x27;s defeat by Emil Constantinescu, the Romanian Government restored Michael&#x27;s citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country.

===Pardons===
In December 2001, Iliescu pardoned three inmates convicted for bribery, including George Tănase, former Financial Guard head commissioner for Ialomița County. Iliescu had to revoke Tănase&#x27;s pardon a few days later due to the media outcry, claiming that &quot;a legal adviser was superficial in analyzing the case&quot;. Later, the humanitarian reasons invoked in the pardon were contradicted by another medical expert opinion. Another controversial pardon was that of Dan Tartagă, a businessman from Brașov who, while drunk, had run over and killed two people on a pedestrian crossing. He was sentenced to three years and a half but was pardoned after only a couple of months. Tartagă was later sentenced to a two-year sentence for fraud.

Most controversial of all, on 15 December 2004, a few days before the end of his last term, Iliescu pardoned 47 convicts, including Miron Cozma, the leader of the miners during the early 1990s, who had been sentenced in 1999 to 18 years in prison in conjunction with the September 1991 Mineriad. This has attracted harsh criticism from all Romanian media. Many of the pardoned had been convicted for corruption or other economic crimes, while one had been imprisoned for his involvement in the attempts at suppressing the 1989 Revolution.

===Decorating Vadim Tudor===
In the last days of his president mandate, he awarded the Order of the Star of Romania (rank of ceremonial knighthood) to the controversial, nationalist politician Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a gesture which drew criticism in the press and prompted Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, fifteen Radio Free Europe journalists, Timișoara mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandu, songwriter Alexandru Andrieș, and historian Randolph Braham to return their Romanian honours in protest. The leader of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania, Béla Markó, did not show up to claim the award he received on the same occasion. President Traian Băsescu revoked the award granted to Tudor on 24 May 2007, but a lawsuit is ongoing even after Băsescu&#x27;s decree was declared constitutional.

===Black sites===
Ion Iliescu was mentioned in the report of the Council of Europe investigator into illegal activities of the CIA in Europe, Dick Marty. He was identified as one of the people who authorized or at least knew about and should stand accountable for the operation of a CIA black site at Mihail Kogălniceanu airbase from 2003 to 2005, in the context of the War on terror. In April 2015, Iliescu confirmed that he had granted a CIA request for a site in Romania, but was not aware of the nature of the site, describing it as a small gesture of goodwill to an ally in advance of Romania&#x27;s eventual accession to NATO. Iliescu further stated that had he known of the intended use of the site, he would certainly not have approved the request.

===Revolution of 1989 and subsequent accusations===
In 2016, a previously closed legal case regarding crimes against humanity committed by the interim government headed by Iliescu during the Romanian Revolution was reopened. In 2015, after 26 years of prolonged investigation, the authorities concluded that there was no evidence with which they could prosecute. In 2016, the case was ordered to be re-examined by the interim General Prosecutor. By 2017, military prosecutors had alleged that the events of 1989 were orchestrated by a misinformation campaign on the part of Iliescu&#x27;s government, which were disseminated through broadcasting media. Reportedly, this investigation lead to speculation of whether the conflict of 1989 could be classified as a revolution, or else as a coup d&#x27;état.

In April 2018, the General Prosecutor asked that Iliescu be put on trial. President Klaus Iohannis approved this request, as well as the proceeding of the prosecution of Petre Roman. Iliescu was charged for his alleged role in the killing of 862 people during the revolution, at which time he headed the National Salvation Front (FSN) interim government, as well as the spreading of misinformation. Allegations included Iliescu&#x27;s apparent involvement in the Mineriad case, in which miners quashed protests against the government. The initial charges, brought forward in 2005, were shortly dropped, until 2014 when the European Court of Human Rights found Iliescu&#x27;s lack of investigation into the events of Mineriad to be in violation of human rights to life, freedom from inhumane, and degrading treatment and demonstration, and again in 2015, when the Military Prosecutor&#x27;s Section within the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and the Justice Office reopened investigations into the Mineriad protests, accusing Iliescu, along with other accused perpetrators, of coordinating a general and systematic attack against the civilian population during the events from 13 until 15 June 1990 in Bucharest. On 13 June 2017, the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office indicted Iliescu for crimes against humanity for actions taken by Iliescu during the Mineriad protests. The statement released by the office claimed that the attack illegally involved forces of the Interior Ministry, Defence Ministry, Romanian Intelligence service, as well as the miners and other workers from various areas of the country. The office further alleged that attacks were also carried out against peaceful residents. The case was ultimately rejected in December 2020, as the judges found that the indictment was void and thus could not be used in a trial.

On 8 April 2019, Iliescu was officially charged with crimes against humanity Iliescu&#x27;s lawyer Adrian Georgescu complained that the file was illegitimate due to its lack of a prosecutor. In December 2019, Iliescu&#x27;s trial began to focus on allegations that he had intentionally spread disinformation through the use of broadcast media with the aid of Aurel Dragoș Munteanu, a member of the FSN and the director of TVR during the revolution of 1989, meaning that he was greatly influential in the FSN&#x27;s ability to foster support in the Romanian public. Among the claims investigated were Iliescu&#x27;s broadcast claim that &quot;unknown terrorists&quot; were responsible for the deaths of Elena and Nicolae Ceaușescu.

Amid candlelight vigils and other memorial services during the 30th anniversary of the Romanian Revolution, several survivors of the conflict spoke out against Iliescu&#x27;s trial, with many claiming it is a publicity stunt on the part of Iohannis to gain popularity from the Romanian population that still seek the truth about the revolution. Iliescu&#x27;s trial is not expected to reach a definitive conclusion. The trial was first postponed to February 2020 due to Iliescu&#x27;s declining health and the slow pace of legal proceedings. This case was also rejected in June 2020, as a judge decided the indictment was not valid.

==Public opinion and legacy==
According to the TVR show &quot;100 Greatest Romanians&quot; from 2006, launched as a campaign to identify the greatest Romanians of all time, out of 100 &quot;Great Romanians&quot; chosen by the participants, Iliescu came in 71st place. He was ranked below his predecessor Nicolae Ceaușescu and the incumbent president Traian Băsescu, but above Emil Constantinescu, who did not appear on the list.

<doc id="189452" wikidata="Q2069486" url="?curid=189452" title="Holodeck">
<text>The Holodeck is a fictional device from the television franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot; which uses &quot;holograms&quot; (projected light and electromagnetic energy which create the illusion of solid objects) to create a realistic 3D simulation of a real or imaginary setting, in which participants can freely interact with the environment as well as objects and characters, and sometimes a predefined narrative.

In several series, holodecks are an amenity available to the crew of starships. In the series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, a similar device is referred to as a holosuite, operated by the owner of the space station&#x27;s bar, Quark, who rents them out to customers.

From a storytelling point of view, the holodeck permits the introduction of a wide variety of locations and characters, such as events and persons in the Earth&#x27;s past, or imaginary places or beings, that would otherwise require the use of plot mechanisms such as time-travel or dream sequences. Writers often use it as a way to pose philosophical questions.

==Origins==
The &quot;Star Trek&quot; holodeck was inspired by inventor Gene Dolgoff, who owned a holography laboratory in New York City. &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry met Dolgoff in 1973.

The first appearance of a holodeck-type technology in &quot;Star Trek&quot; came in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Practical Joker&quot;, where it was called the &quot;recreation room&quot;. In the episode&#x27;s story, Dr. McCoy, Sulu and Uhura are trapped inside it by the ship&#x27;s computer.

The holodeck was a frequent plot mechanism in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, beginning with the 1988 episode &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot;, in which the holodeck played a central part of the plot.

Prior to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury wrote about a technology-powered &quot;nursery&quot;, a virtual reality room able to reproduce any place one imagines, in his 1950 story &quot;The Veldt&quot;.

The word &quot;holograph&quot; comes from the Greek words ὅλος (&quot;holos&quot;; &quot;whole&quot;) and γραφή (&quot;graphē&quot;; &quot;writing&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot;). Hungarian-British physicist Dennis Gabor received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 &quot;for his invention and development of the holographic method&quot;, work done in the late 1940s. The discovery was an unexpected result of research into improving electron microscopes; the original technique is still used and is known as electron holography. Optical holography was made possible by the development of the laser in 1960. The first practical optical holograms recording 3D objects were made in 1962 by Yuri Denisyuk in the Soviet Union and by Emmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks at the University of Michigan in the United States.

==Depiction==
In most &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes, the holodeck is a normal room within a starship. A panel outside the entrance offers the user various settings to select a program or adjust the experience.

The inside of the holodeck, when not running a program, is typically shown as an empty room of medium size. The floor and walls are depicted in different ways, either covered in a bright yellow grid on a black background (in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;), a metallic grid structure (in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;), or various other mechanisms.

When the holodeck is activated, the room disappears, replaced by a realistic, interactive simulation of a physical world. The door also disappears until the program ends or the user requests an exit verbally. The holodeck can be controlled by voice commands, or a computer terminal called the &quot;Arch&quot; which can be summoned by verbal command to provide manual controls. Some simulations are preprogrammed, while others are constructed on the fly by the user describing objects to be simulated to the computer.

The simulated environment is not limited to the size of the room, but can be any conceivable size, and participants can move freely, as far as they like. In some cases, the holodeck is shown to create an internal space at least as large as a starship. The opening scene of the 1994 film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; features a holodeck simulation of a sailing ship including a surrounding ocean.

The environment, objects and people are created from a combination of projected light, force fields, and replicated matter (using the same technique as the food replicators). Holographic projections are solid within the holodeck, and can be interacted with as if they were real, but disappear instantly when the program ends, or degrade rapidly if removed from the holodeck. However, some episodes do show simulated matter persisting beyond the confines of the holodeck, such as in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, in which Wesley Crusher falls into a holographic stream, and remains wet after leaving the holodeck.

Living characters within the holodeck can be given varying levels of intelligence, from total lack of animation, to fully interactive, convincing simulations of human beings and other sapient beings, even including self-awareness. Users can observe a scenario passively, with none of the simulated characters recognizing their presence, or can take an active role, playing the part of one of the characters in the narrative.

The metaphysical questions raised by self-aware simulated characters are explored in several &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes, including &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot;, in which a holodeck recreation of Professor Moriarty becomes self-aware and demands a life outside of the holodeck; unable to meet his demands, Captain Picard saves Moriarty&#x27;s program against the day when that will be possible. A story arc spanning the entire series of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; is the development of a holographic emergency medical program, known as The Doctor, from an intelligent but limited holographic tool into a fully realized sapient being. Originally restricted to sickbay, the character is eventually given a portable holographic projector that allows him to move freely and even leave the ship.

The holodeck is often depicted being used for practical purposes by Starfleet officers in the pursuit of their duties; it is used by the Enterprise&#x27;s tactical officers to create simulated opponents for combat training, and the holodeck is sometimes used to recreate real events for the purposes of criminal investigation.

It also serves a recreational function; &quot;holonovelists&quot; produce programs with real or fictional scenarios for entertainment, and in several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, Captain Jean-Luc Picard takes part in stories in which he plays the role of one of his boyhood heroes, fictional detective Dixon Hill.

Multiple &quot;Star Trek&quot; series suggest the use of holodecks for sexual experiences. In &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, patrons of Quark&#x27;s bar pay for hourly rentals of &quot;holosuites&quot; and pornographic holoprograms. The Holodecks in the animated comedy series &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; possess &quot;bodily fluid filters&quot;, also insinuating that the holodecks are used for sexual purposes.

Some users develop a pathological obsession with the holodeck, a condition known to the characters as holo-addiction. &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; also introduces alien beings known as photonic lifeforms who believe holodeck programs are real, rather than computer-driven simulations.

Although the Holodeck is supposed to be safe, preventing users from being injured even by realistic violence, many &quot;Star Trek&quot; shows feature plots in which the holodeck malfunctions and creates genuine dangers, or if the safety protocols have been disabled, which requires the authorization of two senior officers.

By 2399, when &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; begins, holomatrix guest rooms have become a familiar amenity. On board Rios&#x27; ship, &quot;La Sirena&quot;, the hospitality hologram &quot;(&quot;one of Rios&#x27; holographic doppelgängers) escorts Picard to a perfect re-creation of the study in his chateau in France. According to the hologram, who came with the ship&#x27;s basic installation, Zhaban provided the holoscans, thinking Picard might feel more at home. The view outside the window is a projection—Picard says &quot;Hold&quot; to pause the display and the birdsong—but all the objects within have been materialized, including Dahj&#x27;s necklace.

==Reception==
The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot; (airdate January 11, 1988), featuring a story set in the holodeck, was honored with a Peabody Award in recognition of its &quot;new standard of quality for first-run syndication&quot;. &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot; was also nominated for two Emmy Awards in the categories of Outstanding Cinematography for a Series and Outstanding Costumes for a Series; costume designer William Ware Theiss won the award. &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot; is the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode to win a Peabody Award.

<text>Ulm () is the sixth-largest city of the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg, and with around 129,000 inhabitants, it is Germany&#x27;s 60th-largest city.

Ulm is located on the eastern edges of the Swabian Jura mountain range, on the upper course of the River Danube, at the confluence with the small Blau Stream, coming from the Blautopf in the west. The mouth of the Iller also falls within Ulm&#x27;s city limits. The Danube forms the border with Bavaria, where Ulm&#x27;s twin city Neu-Ulm lies. The city was part of Ulm until 1810, and Ulm and Neu-Ulm have a combined population of around 190,000. Ulm forms an urban district of its own (&quot;Stadtkreis Ulm&quot;), and is the administrative seat of the Alb-Donau-Kreis, the district that surrounds it on three sides, but which the city itself is not a part of. Ulm is the overall 11th-largest city on the Danube River, and the third-largest German Danubian city after Regensburg and Ingolstadt.

Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former free imperial city. Ulm is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and is the seat of the University of Ulm (&quot;Universität Ulm&quot;), and of the Ulm University of Applied Sciences (&quot;&quot;, THU). The city lies on the international railway corridor &quot;Main Line for Europe&quot;, from Paris to Bratislava and Budapest, via Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Ulm, Augsburg, Munich, Salzburg, Linz and Vienna. The Ulm Minster (&quot;Ulmer Münster&quot;) is the tallest church in the world ().

In 1927, the then tiny village of Wiblingen was incorporated into Ulm, which led to that Wiblingen Abbey with its monastic library and its True Cross reliquary (&quot;Heilig-Kreuz-Reliquie&quot;), that allegedly contains wood particles from the True Cross, is now part of Ulm.

Famous personalities born in Ulm include (1777–1859), (1864–1922), Albert Einstein (1879–1955), Otto Kässbohrer (1904–1989) and Hildegard Knef (1925–2002).

== Geography ==
Ulm lies at the point where the rivers Blau and Iller join the Danube, at an altitude of above sea level. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the northern bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, Gögglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the southern bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the twin city of Neu-Ulm in the state of Bavaria, smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).

Except for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over , some of them part of the Swabian Alb. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the Alps, which are approximately from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.

The city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine Foreland basin, where the basin reaches the Swabian Alb. The Turritellenplatte of Ermingen (&quot;Erminger Turritellenplatte&quot;) is a famous palaeontological site of Burdigalian age.

== Neighboring communes ==
On the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town Neu-Ulm. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighbouring communes of Baden-Württemberg are the following: Illerkirchberg, Staig, Hüttisheim, Erbach (Donau), Blaubeuren, Blaustein, Dornstadt, Beimerstetten and Langenau as well as the eastern neighbouring community Elchingen.

== Town subdivisions ==

The city is divided into 18 districts (): Ulm-Mitte, Böfingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, Gögglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen, Oststadt, Söflingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.

Nine districts were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s: Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Gögglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, Mähringen und Unterweiler. They have their own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.

== History ==
The oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early Neolithic period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King Louis the German signed a document in the King&#x27;s palace of &quot;Hulma&quot; in the Duchy of Swabia. The city was declared an Imperial City () by Friedrich Barbarossa in 1181.

At first, Ulm&#x27;s significance was due to the privilege of a &quot;Königspfalz&quot;, a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds (), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church (Ulm Minster, 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm&#x27;s medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality textiles. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for painters and sculptors like Hans Multscher and Jörg Syrlin the Elder. During the Reformation, Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the New World (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), the city began to decline gradually. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), it was alternately invaded several times by French and Bavarian soldiers.
In the wars following the French Revolution, the city was alternately occupied by French and Austrian forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into Bavaria. During the campaign of 1805, Napoleon managed to trap the invading Austrian army of General Mack and forced it to surrender in the Battle of Ulm. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the Kingdom of Württemberg and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as Neu-Ulm (New Ulm).

In the mid-19th century, the city was designated a fortress of the German Confederation with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of industrialisation in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844–1891) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the Middle Ages.

From 1933 to 1935, a concentration camp primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The Jews of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their synagogue was torn down during in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War II (45 were sent to Theresienstadt on 22 August 1942), only four returned. Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.

The sole RAF strategic bombing during World War II against Ulm occurred on 17 December 1944, against the two large lorry factories of Magirus-Deutz and Kässbohrer, as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed. The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins. The Magirus factory hosted a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp.

Some parts of the city were rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but most parts of the historic old town have been restored. Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstraße part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, Ulm University was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like Daimler, Siemens and Nokia and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a twin city of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of Neu-Ulm, and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of Stuttgart and Munich and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.

== Demographics ==
==Climate==
Ulm has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dcbo&quot;). Compared with the plains, the temperature fluctuates greatly, with the average temperature ranging from in winter to in summer, and precipitation is concentrated from May to August.

The Lübeck weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Highest Temperature on 27 July 1983.
* Warmest Minimum on 1 July 1950.

===Note===
== Economy ==
The city has very old trading traditions dating from medieval times and a long history of industrialisation, beginning with the establishment of a railway station in 1850. The most important sector is still classical industry (machinery, especially motor vehicles; electronics; pharmaceuticals). The establishment of the University of Ulm in 1967, which focuses on biomedicine, the sciences, and engineering, helped support a transition to high-tech industry, especially after the crisis of classical industries in the 1980s. 

Companies with headquarters in Ulm include:
* Britax (child safety products) European headquarters in nearby Leipheim

== Ecology ==
In 2007 the City of Ulm was awarded the European Energy Award for its remarkable local energy management and its efforts to combat climate change. Examples of these efforts are a biomass power plant operated by the &quot;Fernwärme Ulm GmbH&quot; (10 MW electrical output), and the world&#x27;s biggest passive house office building, the so-called &quot;Energon&quot;, located in the &quot;Science City&quot; near the university campus. Moreover, the city of Ulm boasts the second largest solar power production in Germany. For all new buildings, a strict energy standard (German KFW40 standard) has been mandatory since April 2008. Ulm Minster has been fully powered by renewables since January 2008. Until the end of 2011 as a European pilot project a self-sustaining data-centre will be constructed in the west-city of Ulm. There is a solar-powered ferry that crosses the Danube 7 days a week in summer. The &quot;Bündnis 100% Erneuerbare Energien&quot; was founded in February 2010 with the aim of bringing together the people and organisations seeking to promote the transition to 100% renewable energy in Ulm and Neu-Ulm by 2030.

== Transportation ==

Ulm is situated at the crossroads of the A8 motorway (connecting the principal cities of southern Germany, Stuttgart and Munich), and the A7 motorway (one of the motorways running from northern to southern Europe).

The city&#x27;s railway station is served, among other lines, by one of the European train routes (Paris – Strasbourg – Stuttgart – Ulm – Munich – Vienna – Budapest). Direct connections to Berlin are also available.

Ulm&#x27;s public transport system is based on several bus lines and two tram lines. Several streets in the old town are for the use of pedestrians and cyclists only. Ulm was the first area to be served by the Daimler AG&#x27;s Car2Go carsharing service in 2008. However, the service in Ulm was discontinued at the end of 2014.

== Education and culture ==

The University of Ulm was founded in 1967 and focuses on the sciences, medicine, engineering, and mathematics / economics. With about 10,000 students, it is one of the smaller universities in Germany.

Ulm is also the seat of the city&#x27;s University of Applied Sciences (), founded in 1960 as a public school of engineering. The school also houses numerous students from around the world as part of an international study abroad programme.

In 1953, Inge Aicher-Scholl, Otl Aicher and Max Bill founded the Ulm School of Design (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung – HfG Ulm), a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus, which was, however, closed in 1968.

Ulm&#x27;s public library features over 480,000 print media. The city has a public theatre with drama, opera and ballet, several small theatres, and a professional philharmonic orchestra.

<text>The Canal du Midi (; ) is a long canal in Southern France (). Originally named the &quot;Canal Royal en Languedoc&quot; (Royal Canal in Languedoc) and renamed by French revolutionaries to &quot;Canal du Midi&quot; in 1789, the canal is considered one of the greatest construction works of the 17th century.

The canal connects the Garonne to the Étang de Thau on the Mediterranean and, along with the long Canal de Garonne, forms the Canal des Deux Mers, joining the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. 

Strictly speaking, &quot;Canal du Midi&quot; refers to the portion initially constructed from Toulouse to the Mediterranean – the Deux-Mers canal project aimed to link together several sections of navigable waterways to join the Mediterranean and the Atlantic: first the Canal du Midi, then the Garonne which was more or less navigable between Toulouse and Bordeaux, then the Garonne Lateral Canal built later, and finally the Gironde estuary after Bordeaux.

Jean-Baptiste Colbert authorized the start of work by royal edict in October 1666, with the aim of developing the wheat trade, under the supervision of Pierre-Paul Riquet, and construction lasted from 1666 to 1681, during the reign of Louis XIV. The Canal du Midi is one of the oldest canals of Europe still in operation (the prototype being the Briare Canal). The challenges in these works are closely related to the challenges of inland water transport today. The key challenge, raised by Pierre-Paul Riquet, was to convey water from the Montagne Noire (Black Mountains) to the Seuil de Naurouze, the highest point of the canal.

The Canal du Midi was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, because of its outstanding engineering and artistic design, and it was designated as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2016.

==Introduction==

===Location and profile of the canal===

The Canal du Midi is located in the south of France, in the departments of Hérault, Aude, and Haute-Garonne. It is long, starting in the west at Port de l&#x27;Embouchure, Toulouse and terminating in the east at &quot;Les Onglous&quot;, Marseillan, where the canal opens into the étang de Thau (between Agde and Sète).

The Canal du Midi is a summit-level canal, climbing from Toulouse on the Atlantic side over a distance of to the Seuil de Naurouze or summit level, where the feeder canal enters. The total rise is , and the summit level is at an altitude of . This difference in level down to the sea is covered over the remaining distance of from Naurouze to Les Onglous on the Étang de Thau.

The design canal depth is with a minimum of . The draft allowed is although regular users advise that even with boats will occasionally touch the bottom because of silt deposits in many places. The width on the surface is on average with variations between and . Finally, the width of the canal bed is .

This longitudinal profile of the Canal du Midi shows it rising from Toulouse (1) to the Seuil de Naurouze (2), then dropping down to Castelnaudary (3), Carcassonne (4) and Trèbes (5). The canal continues to Béziers after passing through the Fonserannes Locks (6), then Agde (7), to finish at Sète on the étang de Thau (8).

The longest canal pound is between Argens Lock and the Fonserannes Locks, while the shortest canal pound is between the two Fresquel locks.
===Legal status===
For historical reasons, the Canal du Midi has a unique legal status, which was codified in 1956 in the &quot;Public Code of waterways and inland navigation&quot;, then in the &quot;General code of the property of public persons&quot;. Under Article L. 2111-11 of the Code, public domain of the canal is determined by reference to the fief once granted to Pierre-Paul Riquet and limits were set by an official report in 1772. The staff quarters and warehouses, as well as the Lampy reservoir, were also added. Articles L. 2124-20 to L. 2124-25 set rules for maintenance of the canal, which is generally the responsibility of the public entity that owns it, with the participation of communes and, in some cases, waterside residents.

Under the Act of 27 November 1897, the State of France owns the Canal du Midi and its management is delegated to the public body Voies Navigables de France, attached to the Ministry of Transport.

==History==

===Abandoned projects===
The building of a canal was an old idea. Numerous and sometimes utopian projects were devised to build a canal between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Leaders such as Augustus, Nero, Charlemagne, François I, Charles IX and Henry IV had dreamed of it, as it is a true political and economic issue. King François I brought Leonardo da Vinci to France in 1516 and commissioned a survey of a route from the Garonne at Toulouse to the Aude at Carcassonne.

The construction of such a structure would save vessels (of trade but also the king&#x27;s galleys) and goods from sailing around the Iberian Peninsula which could take a month to complete. At that time shipping was fraught with dangers such as piracy and the Barbary pirates.

The most realistic projects were presented to the King in the 16th century. A first draft was presented by Nicolas Bachelier in 1539 to the Estates of Languedoc then a second in 1598 by Pierre Reneau and finally a third project was proposed by Bernard Aribat de Béziers in 1617. These projects were abandoned because they did not give enough thought to the water supply for the canal and provided a system of diversion of water from Pyrénées rivers too complex or impossible to implement. In 1650 another engineer also proposed to divert water from the Ariège to Cintegabelle to bring a non-navigable canal to Pech-David near Toulouse. Again, the question arose of how to carry water to the Seuil de Naurouze at a greater height than that of Toulouse.

The projects were not launched for fear of losing too much money and conviction of the human impossibility to dig such a canal. The major problem was how to supply the summit sections with enough water.

Nevertheless, Pierre-Paul Riquet, a wealthy collector of salt tax in Languedoc proposed a more convincing project than his predecessors. When Louis XIV received his proposal through the Archbishop of Toulouse (Charles-François Anglure of Bourlemont) in 1662 he saw the opportunity to deprive Spain of part of its resources, and the opportunity to mark his reign with an imperishable work.

===Study of the project===
Compared to canals, managing rivers is difficult but only one canal is required between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike a river, it is easier to manage the flow of a canal to ensure a constant flow of traffic throughout the year.

The Canal du Midi is a summit-level canal because it must pass over a height between two valleys. The construction of this canal required passage through the Seuil de Naurouze or the Seuil de Graissens.

Thirty years passed from the start of planning to the commencement of work: a similar project was also studied by a committee of which Riquet&#x27;s father was a member.
====Highlights====
In 1660, Riquet found the solution to the main problem: the water supply to the summit point to feed both sides of the canal. His idea was to get water flowing from the Montagne Noire. His important knowledge of the hydrography of the Montagne Noire and Sor allowed him to imagine an ingenious irrigation system. He was inspired by the French engineer Adam de Craponne who had implemented the same system for the Craponne Canal.

For this, he planned to recover the mountain waters in dams and reservoirs and then forward them to the Seuil de Naurouze through channels crossing the Seuil de Graissens. The water from the Sor passing near Revel was the main supply envisaged by Riquet. Other rivers from the Montagne Noire were also part of the system such as the Alzeau, the Laudot, the Rieutort, the Bernassonne, and the . The Montagne Noire is a region with twice the rainfall of the plain of Lauragais with 1400 millimetres per year at around above sea level. To store the river water he planned to create three basins: the Reservoir of Lampy-Vieux, a hexagonal harbour basin at Naurouze, and the Bassin de Saint-Ferréol with a large earth dam across the mouth of the valley of the Laudot stream.

In 1664, during the study of the project, the Estates of Languedoc asked Riquet to put into practice his idea experimentally. He then built a test channel diverting water from the Sor to the Seuil de Naurouze. It was the Rigole de la plaine which he completed in 1665 and used to prove that it is possible to bring water to the highest points of the course of the canal. This was the event that reassured the Committee of Experts that the king had set up on site to inspect the choices and plans prepared by Riquet. From that moment Louis XIV knew that the canal was technically feasible.

====Inaccuracies by Pierre-Paul Riquet====
Riquet studied in depth the supply of water to the canal at the Seuil de Naurouze. His study appeared rigorous and included a pilot phase with the construction of the Rigole de la plaine to substantiate his claim. The project still remained unclear in many respects especially the route of the canal. This route was not final and was not precise as it would be today for a highway project or high-speed railway. Only the directions of the route were known and plotted on a map. Changes in the route could be made by the Contractor depending on the difficulties he encountered on the ground.

On the Atlantic side, he proposed several layouts: one to pass by Castres and Revel through the Seuil de Graissens and Agout. In fact, this river was already under development for navigation. Another route would pass by the Girou river and avoid Toulouse as in the preceding route. On the Mediterranean side, the route was not set. He would use the Fresquel until the Aude but the arrival on the coast was first intended to be at Narbonne then at Sète.

In 1663 Riquet conducted field studies to finally fix the path on the Atlantic side by the seuil de Naurouze along the valley of the Hers-Vif to Toulouse downstream of the Garonne. The navigable part of the river is downstream of Bazacle which was a ford in the centre of Toulouse, blocking navigation. The canal could not consider not going through the economic heart of the region so therefore the final route was via Castres and the Girou.

====Study techniques====
Pierre-Paul Riquet had no technical training and learnt on the job. He regularly practised experiments and field observations. His technique remained highly empirical because at that time applied science and hydraulic techniques through laws or concepts had not been mastered. Even so, Riquet had a scientific approach as he systematically took measurements of flow and made calculations of volumes. In addition, to overcome his technical shortcomings, he was surrounded by many technicians such as Hector Boutheroüe, François Andreossy surveyor and cartographer, and Pierre Campmas an expert in water flows.

He set up experiments to prove that it was possible to bring the water to the Seuil de Naurouze from the river Sor in the Montagne Noire. At his own expense, of 200,000 livres, he built a test canal, only two feet wide, and on the 9 November 1665 he opened the flow successfully. When the canal was authorized the next year, this test rigole would become the Rigole de la plaine. He also built on his property in Bonrepos a model of the canal with locks, tunnels, and &quot;épanchoirs&quot; (spillways) reproducing the slopes and feeding all with water.

===Political and economic context===
The economic situation of the country was quite difficult at the time. When Colbert became minister he believed that domestic and international trade was not in favour of the Kingdom of France. The Dutch could take better advantage of trade and economic activity in the country. The prices of grain dropped a lot and wine production fell in 1660. This crisis caused depreciation of land values and small farms were going bankrupt. In addition, the region of Languedoc experienced religious conflict during the Fronde. It was difficult to implement a policy in this area and in particular to introduce taxes such as the salt tax.

Colbert then saw Pierre-Paul Riquet and his project as a way to pursue a policy of economic expansion in the service of absolutism in Languedoc. In fact, Riquet proposed himself to implement the salt tax and to build the Canal du Midi. Thus, the construction of the canal would permit the creation of a direct passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic without passing through the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by the Spaniards, the aim being to destroy the Spanish trade and establish a commercial flow through Languedoc. The Languedoc region had many resources such as wheat, wine from Minervois, woollen cloth, silk, and salt which producers were struggling to export due to lack of trade. By passing through the Canal du Midi, Colbert hoped to distribute goods in the different regions of &quot;le Midi&quot; to strengthen royal power and open up Toulouse and its region.

===The edict of Louis XIV and the financing of the project===
Despite a project that seemed precarious, Colbert authorized commencement of work by a royal edict in October 1666 after the approval of a committee of experts that looked at the route of the canal for several months. The project benefited significantly from the appointment of an engineer for fortifications and hydraulics – Louis Nicolas de Clerville – who used his influence with Colbert to start the project. The decree specified the authorization of the construction of the canal, its issuing of invitations to tender, and its awarding to the designer, Pierre-Paul Riquet, and his descendants. It also gave rights of expropriation to Riquet and describes the possibility of creating mills, warehouses and housing for the operation of the canal. The project formed a tax-exempt &quot;fief&quot; whose owner had the rights of fishing and hunting. Finally, it describes the operating procedures including the introduction of tolls, traffic organization, and ownership of vessels. The king decided to cede the ownership and operation of the facility in a particular order to overcome the potential drawbacks of a work so great. This system ensured the continued maintenance and operation of the canal even if the state&#x27;s finances are at their lowest.

The work was launched in two phases each called an &quot;enterprise&quot;. The first enterprise of connecting Toulouse to Trèbes was estimated at 3.6 million livres. The finances of the State, however, were not very sound and the Estates of Languedoc were not willing to fund such a project for fear that their funds would be used for unexpected expenses. So, in exchange for the ownership and operation of the canal, Pierre-Paul Riquet proposed to finance part of the works from his own funds. The rest was to be paid by the State in exchange for profits that Riquet earned from the salt tax. The second enterprise of works between Trèbes and the étang de Thau in December 1668 cost 5.832 million livres plus a million more livres for the resumption of work on the port of Sète.

Ultimately, while the initial budget was six million livres, all the work together would cost between 17 and 18 million livres of the time, 40% was advanced by the King, 40% by the province, and 20% by Riquet himself, who became the owner. His descendants continued to pay two million livres for over 50 years.

===Construction of the canal===
At the age of 63, Riquet started his great enterprise, sending his personal engineer, François Andreossy, and a local water expert, Pierre Roux, to the Montagne Noire to work on the water supply. This supply system successfully fed the canal with water where it crossed the continental divide, replacing water that drained toward the two seas. The system was a masterpiece of both hydraulic and structural engineering, and served as an early ratification of Riquet&#x27;s vision. It was also a major part of the massive undertaking.

Work began on the first &quot;enterprise&quot; on 1 January 1667 with the construction of the trough of the Rigole de la plaine then continued on 15 April 1667 with the laying of the first stone of the Lac de Saint-Ferréol. Originally Riquet wanted to build a dozen reservoirs but the Commissioner General of fortifications, Louis Nicolas de Clerville, asked him to replace them with a single reservoir. This was a great novelty at the time – no reservoir-lake of this magnitude had ever been built before.

Some of Clerville&#x27;s men with experience in military engineering came, to build the huge dam for the single reservoir, the Bassin de St. Ferréol, on the river Laudot. The Laudot is a tributary of the Tarn in the Montagne Noire some from the summit of the proposed canal at Seuil de Naurouze. This massive dam, long, above the riverbed and thick at its base was the largest work of civil engineering in Europe and only the second major dam to be built in Europe, after one in Alicante in Spain. It was connected to the Canal du Midi by a contoured channel over long, wide with a base width of . It was eventually equipped with 14 locks in order to bring building materials for the canal down from the mountains and to create a new port for the mountain town of Revel.

In November 1667 an official ceremony laid the foundation stone of the Garonne lock in Toulouse in the presence of representatives of the Parlement of Toulouse, the &quot;Capitouls&quot; (sheriffs), and the Archbishop of Toulouse, Charles-François d&#x27;Anglure de Bourlemont. A first filling of water was made between the seuil de Naurouze and Toulouse during the winter of 1671–1672 and the first boat traffic could begin. In 1673 the section from Naurouze to Trèbes was completed marking the end of the first &quot;enterprise&quot;.

From 1671 the second enterprise began linking Trèbes to the Mediterranean Sea and to build the port of Sète (then called &quot;Cette&quot;, the location was chosen and the port constructed by Clerville). This part of the canal posed problems at the junction between the étang de Thau and Trèbes because the canal must cross the course of the Hérault and the Libron. To work around the problem, Riquet set up a system of valves and chambers for Libron and a round lock with three doors for the étang de Thau and the Hérault. The round lock at Agde could switch between a reach of the Canal du Midi and the Hérault. This part of the canal was also a problem at the level of the seuil of Ensérune and the descent to Beziers in the valley of the Orb. Riquet solved these problems on the one hand by digging the Malpas Tunnel and secondly by building at Fonserannes a row of eight lock chambers to the Orb. The Malpas Tunnel was the first canal passage ever built through a tunnel. The Canal du Midi passes through a tunnel through a hill at the Oppidum d&#x27;Ensérune.

In 1681 work on the canal ended at Béziers. However, in October 1680, Riquet died during construction. He did not see the end of the project. It was the king&#x27;s engineer, &quot;La Feuille&quot;, who took over.

His sons inherited the canal, but the family&#x27;s investments were not recovered and debts not fully paid until over 100 years later. The canal was well managed and run as a paternalistic enterprise until the revolution.

The canal was built on a grand scale, with oval shaped locks long, wide at the gates and wide in the middle. This design was intended to resist the collapse of the walls that happened early in the project. The oval locks used the strength of the arch against the inward pressure of the surrounding soil that had destabilized the early locks with straight walls. Such arches had been used by the Romans for retaining walls in Gaul, so this technique was not new, but its application to locks was revolutionary and was imitated in early American canals.

Many of the structures were designed with neoclassical elements to further echo the king&#x27;s ambitions to make France a New Rome. The Canal du Midi as a grand piece of infrastructural engineering in itself was promoted as worthy of Rome and the political dreams behind it were clarified with plaques in Latin, and walls built with Roman features.

In May 1681 the channel was thoroughly inspected by order of the king to check the work and the water-tightness of the canal. It was then officially opened to navigation on 15 May 1681. At the inauguration of the canal at Toulouse on 15 May, the King&#x27;s steward and the president of the Estates of Languedoc travelled first on the canal followed by many other boats carrying particularly wheat. After the maiden voyage, the canal was drained as the work was not complete; it would not be reopened until December 1682. The canal was opened to traffic in May 1683 and stopped receiving public works in March 1685.

====Work organization and social conditions====
For fifteen years nearly 12,000 workers worked on the construction of the canal. Riquet hired men and women between 20 and 50 years old whom he organized in sections forming workshops led by a controller-general. This rationalization of work permitted the optimisation of tasks and allowed several projects to be performed at the same time. All of the work was manual and the digging of the canal was with shovels and pickaxes. The workforce was made up of farmers and local workers whose number varied from one period to another during the year. Pierre-Paul Riquet appealed to the military to compensate for this fluctuation. He also set up monthly payments of workers for their loyalty. He also offered accommodation for two deniers per day.

The women labourers were surprisingly important to the canal&#x27;s engineering. Many came from former Roman bath colonies in the Pyrenees, where elements of classical hydraulics had been maintained as a living tradition. They were employed at first to move earth to the dam at Saint Ferréol, but their supervisors, who were struggling to design the channels from the dam to the canal, recognized their expertise. Engineering in this period was mainly focused on fortress construction, and hydraulics was concerned mostly with mining and problems of drainage. Building a navigational canal across the continent was well beyond the formal knowledge of the military engineers expected to supervise it, but the peasant women who were carriers of classical hydraulic methods added to the repertoire of available techniques. They not only perfected the water supply system for the canal but also threaded the waterway through the mountains near Béziers, using few locks, and built the eight-lock staircase at Fonserannes.

The financial and social conditions of employment of the workers were very favourable and unusual for the time. To retain his workforce, Riquet paid his workers well enough. More importantly, he gave benefits never before seen such as non-working rain days, Sundays and public holidays, and finally paid sick leave. The employment contract was individual and done by free recruitment. Pay was, at the beginning, 20 sols (1 livre) per day, double the agricultural wage. Discontent from farm owners, however, forced Riquet to reduce pay to 15, then 12 sols per day. In 1668 he established the monthly payment of 10 livres.

====Trades and work measures implemented====
Many trades were found on the work sites of the canal in addition to the seasonal workers who were most often farmers. The masons and stonecutters were responsible for the construction of structures such as bridges, locks, and spillways. The blacksmiths and levellers were responsible for the maintenance of the tools and equipment. Carters and carriers, the Farriers and owners of sawmills were also requisitioned for the works.

Workers were organized into sections controlled by captains and sergeants. Finally, Pierre-Paul Riquet was surrounded by aides as well as auditor-generals and inspector-generals of the canal.

The workers&#x27; tools were very limited: picks, hoes and shovels to dig, baskets and stretchers to transport materials. They were provided to workers who must maintain them themselves. Gunpowder was used to blast the rocks.

===Inauguration===
In 1681 the first inspection took place &quot;dry&quot;. The king appointed a commission composed of Henri d&#x27;Aguessau, steward of Languedoc, Mr de la Feuille, Father Mourgues a Jesuit professor of rhetoric and mathematics at the University of Toulouse, two sons and two in-laws of Pierre-Paul Riquet, as well as Messrs. Andréossy, Gilade, and Contigny. This commission embarked for Beziers on 2 May 1681 and went up the canal back to Toulouse over six days. The filling with water had been done showing a measure of the progress of checks to Castelnaudary (the section Toulouse-Castelnaudary had water since 1672).

The inauguration itself took place just after the first inspection. The same people re-embarked at Toulouse on 15 May 1681 on a flagship boat followed by dozens of other boats. The Cardinal de Bonzi, Archbishop of Narbonne and President-born of the Estates of Languedoc joined the procession which arrived at Castelnaudary on 17 May. A great religious ceremony took place on 18 May at the Church of Saint-Roch followed by a procession to the canal to bless the work, the convoy, and the people present.

The convoy resumed its progress on 20 May with stops in the evening at Villepinte, on the 21st at Penautier, the 22nd at Puicheric, and the 23rd at Roubia. On 24 May it was the passage through the Malpas Tunnel then crossing the locks of Fonsérannes. The cardinal and the bishops went down to Beziers on the same day.

===Supplementary works===
In 1686, Vauban was made responsible for inspecting the channel which he quickly found was in a dilapidated state. He then ordered Antoine Niquet, the engineer of fortifications for Languedoc, to carry out new work at the Montagne Noire level to drill the Cammazes Tunnel to extend the Rigole de la montagne and strengthen the Bassin de Saint-Ferréol. In his haste, Riquet had underestimated the number of rivers that in case of a flood would silt up and swell the canal. The barrage of Saint-Ferréol was too small and its supply system was inefficient.

Vauban also built many masonry structures to isolate the many rivers that flow into the canal and spillways to regulate the water level. He built 49 culverts and aqueducts, including the Cesse aqueduct, the Orbiel aqueduct and the Pechlaurier culvert. Finally, he reinforced a lot of works and dams originally built by Riquet. This series of works, which lasted until 1694, greatly improved the supply and management of water. Antoine Niquet was responsible for monitoring the canal until 1726.

The Canal du Midi still had shortcomings because it did not pass through Carcassonne nor Narbonne and did not join the Rhône. In addition, to reach Bordeaux, it was necessary to take the Garonne which has variable flow rates and violent floods. The &quot;Canal de Jonction&quot; or &#x27;junction canal&#x27;, built in 1776, gave access to Narbonne via the Canal de la Robine de Narbonne. The same year the Canal de Brienne allowed the bypass of Bazacle - the ford on the Garonne in Toulouse which blocked the river. The connection between the étang de Thau and the Rhone was also completed in 1808. In 1810 a diversion canal allowed Carcassonne to be connected. Finally, in 1857 the Canal latéral à la Garonne was opened between Toulouse and Castets-en-Dorthe, completing the link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea that Riquet had dreamt of.

====Management====
Channel management was ensured primarily by the descendants of Riquet. This was through the elder son Jean-Mathias who took control of the fief until 1714, then Victor-Pierre-François until 1760, then Victor-Maurice, and finally Jean-Gabriel. The Riquet family quickly put up a pyramidal organisation structure with a &quot;Director-General of the Canal&quot; who governs a board of directors responsible for specific geographic areas of the channel. Seven zones were defined in the west and the east: Toulouse, Naurouze, Castelnaudary, Trèbes Le Somail, Beziers, and Agde. Each Director is responsible for maintenance of his zone and is supported by a receiver and a controller. Hundreds of lock-keepers are responsible for the locks. This organization facilitates the control and hiring of employees.

In Toulouse, a group of three people form a steering committee: the director general of works, the Receiver General who sets the fees, and the Comptroller General in charge of accounting. Canal management ensures the supply of money to pay for various works and staff hired for the canal. In the 1770s a tax report showed an income of 640,000 livres, half of which went to maintenance and salaries, and half the profits and funds were exceptional works. In 1785 this benefit increased to 950,000 livres which was a very large sum for the time.

====Maintenance====
The maintenance of the canal was a real problem for the descendants of Riquet. Despite many precautions, the canal silts up with silt from the water supply. In addition, it fills with the branches and leaves of trees. Every winter, a period of closure allows the cleaning of the canal. It is necessary to re-dig the canal bed every year for two months. These works are expensive and two months is not always sufficient. Another problem is the invasion of the canal by weeds in the levels and spillways. There is no way to eradicate this scourge. In 1820 dredging was set up to pull up the weeds and the mud layer.

Finally, rain, frost, and drought forces managers to keep an eye all along the canal to repair leaks and cracks that might open. Today, the channel is subject to the same constraints and managers must perform the same work. They are now mechanized. Approximately 350 employees are made available to the Waterways of France manager by the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy to maintain the canal.

==Operational history of the canal==
Once used to transport goods and people, the Canal du Midi is now mainly used by boaters and other tourists.
Initially, the canal appears to have been mainly used by small sailing barges with easily lowered masts, bow-hauled by gangs of men. By the middle of the 18th century, horse towing had largely taken over and steam tugs came in 1834 to cross the Étang. By 1838 273 vessels were regularly working the canal and passenger and packet boats for mail continued a brisk trade until the coming of the railways in 1857.

A &quot;malle-poste&quot; postal service was set up on boats along the canal. As for the Stagecoach for the mail, the boats were pulled by horses on towpaths. This type of transport was considered revolutionary thanks to its regularity, comfort, safety, and speed that were an improvement over the road. In addition, the canal could be travelled throughout the year. The journey takes four days from Toulouse to Sète.

This time was reduced to 32 hours in 1855 which corresponds to a speed of thanks to the replacement of horses every pulling boats. In addition rather than cross multiple locks travellers were transferred from one vessel to another which saved time and saved water used for the opening of the locks. Finally, the journeys also took place at night to save even more time. In 1684, travel from Toulouse to Agde cost one livre and a half. The rate was set per league with the rates displayed on a sign. Thus, a bourgeois paid three sols per league while a valet or a sailor paid one and a half sols per league. Payment offices were located along the route. Each office indicated the rate and provided the distances between each office.

The Canal relied on wheat and wine traffic in Languedoc which was its main purpose. This commercial traffic had the effect of enriching the descendants of Riquet very quickly. The wheat, wine, and alcohol could be exported from Lauragais to Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Marseille. The canal had the effect of broadening the sales area of the producers of Languedoc. In the 1730s commerce thrived and greatly improved agricultural businesses. The canal also allowed the import to Languedoc of products from other regions such as Marseille soap, rice, starch, dried fish, and spices and dyes. However, it was never the grand international route envisaged by the kings of France as its traffic was limited to local and national trade.

Freight rates depend on the cargo. Thus in the 17th century, the transportation of wheat cost 12 deniers per quintal and that of oats 6 deniers per quintal.

=== The boats ===
At its opening the canal was used by a majority of boats for the transport of goods. These vessels were twenty metres long and were hauled by horses or men. The tonnage of vessels increased over the centuries, from 60 tonnes at the beginning to 120 tonnes at the start of the 19th century. The proper Canal Barges were called &quot;owned barge&quot; or &quot;canal barge&quot; and also plied the route. In 1778 there were about 250 barges. In 1914, there were 126 &quot;owned boats&quot;, 70 rented boats, 300 horses, and 75 mules. In the year 1930 motor barges had completely replaced animal traction. They relaunched in part the merchant traffic on the canal but commercial and merchant inland water shipping finally disappeared around the late 1980s. The year 1856 was a record year for merchant activity with more than 110 million tonnes-kilometres of cargo and nearly 100,000 passengers carried.

For 250 years, horses have pulled many boats such as fast barges or long commercial boats. A horse can tow up to 120 times its weight when the load is on the water. Animal traction was then a strategic element in the operation of a canal.

The mail-barges or &quot;post vehicles&quot; which transported passengers were boats many metres long with a simple shelter on the deck. These boats evolved to become faster and more luxurious with lounges and were very large since the largest could reach long. Services inside these vessels also evolved with first class in private salons and second class in a common room. During the heyday of the canal some boats included first class lounges where dinner was served.

===Rail competition===
Curiously, the canal did not really serve its purpose. The economic and political context hindered the economic development that had been expected. After two hundred years of operation, the canal began to suffer from competition from rail and road. It reached its peak in the middle of the 19th century. In 1858 Napoleon III signed a decree entrusting the canal for a period of 40 years to the Chemins de fer du Midi railway company, the owner of the Bordeaux-Narbonne railway line. This act had the effect of amplifying the decline in boat traffic on the canal. The company primarily promoted the railway and placed higher freight rates on commercial traffic in the canal. The Canal du Midi had the highest rates of any of France&#x27;s waterway. In addition, the railway became smoother and faster than the waterway especially as the Canal du Midi suffered from its limited tonnage.

The period before 1859 corresponded to the canal operating without competition while from 1859 the installation of railways in the south of France began. The effect of rail competition is clearly visible in the table with the halving of freight traffic between 1856 and 1879. The traffic then continued to decline gradually. As for the railway, the Bordeaux–Sète railway carried almost 200 million tonne-kilometres in 1860. Management of the canal was taken over by the State in 1898 who made successive investments to maintain its competitiveness. The state removed taxes and tolls which had the effect of reviving traffic on the canal to which reached 80 million tonne-kilometres in 1909.

===The end of merchant traffic===
The government tried to revive the renovation of the canal by enacting a legal program to lift the channel to the standards of the Freycinet gauge. The canals of northern France were already at this level and had traffic well above the Canal du Midi. However, the law remained unimplemented due to lack of funds.

At the end of the First World War traffic was completely disorganized. In 1920 freight traffic recovered rapidly with the arrival of motorised barges. The HPLM company (Le Havre-Paris-Lyon-Marseille) operated 30 boats on the Canal du Midi. The Second World War saw a slowdown in traffic due to the shortage of oil but recovery was rapid after the conflict and the traffic reached 110 million km. However, the canal suffered from a size too small for later barges with high tonnage. Rail became more and more competitive and road transport also became a second competitor. The Canal du Midi became the third means of transport. Freight traffic ceased in the 1970s. In 1980 there were only two barges (the &quot;Bacchus&quot;, a wine carrier and the &quot;Espérance&quot;, a grain carrier) carrying regular traffic between Toulouse and Sète: they definitively ceased their activities in 1989 following the cessation of navigation pronounced by the Prefect of the Region due to drought. In 1991 operation of the canal was assigned to the administration of &quot;Voies navigables de France&quot; who remain managers today.

===The canal in the 21st century===
From the end of the 20th century, the canal has offered many activities. It can again play its original role in allowing the transit of boats between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.

====A canal for tourism and recreation====
The Canal du Midi is now used primarily by tourists, recreation, and housing.

It attracts more and more river tourism, including sailing on chartered boats, restaurant-boats, or hotel barges such as the Anjodi. Tourism has grown from the 1960s, most significantly from Britain, and then exploded in the 1980s. The canal was featured prominently in the BBC television series &quot;Rick Stein&#x27;s French Odyssey&quot; (2005), further publicising the canal to a British audience. Busier than the Seine, the canal alone accounts for one-fifth of French river tourism and 80% of passengers are foreigners, primarily Germans, Swiss and British. There are approximately 10,000 boat passages per year through the Fonséranes locks, with the most traffic at the Argens lock with 11,000 boats carrying an average of five passengers. The canal directly employs about 1,900 people, and the annual economic impact due to the activity of the canal is about 122 million euros.

Navigation of the channel is open from the third Saturday in March to the first week of November. Outside of this period, navigation can be authorized for individuals who have requested it. The winter period is called the &quot;period of unemployment&quot; and allows the completion of all maintenance work.

The Canal du Midi also allows other sports, mainly in urban areas, such as rowing, canoeing, fishing, cycling, roller-skating, and hiking along the banks. A paved stretch of from Toulouse to Avignonet-Lauragais and another of between Béziers and Portiragnes are particularly suited to cycling and rollerblading. It is possible to cycle the entire Canal des Deux Mers from Sète to Bordeaux. In addition, many barges have been converted to family housing, theatres, exhibition spaces, and restaurants.

====A canal for water====
During the dry season, the canal serves as a reservoir for agriculture. Nearly 700 irrigation pumps are installed along the canal. This is one of the fundamental roles of the canal and one of the reasons for its maintenance by the State since the end of commercial traffic. The canal can irrigate up to of agricultural land.

The Rigole de la plaine carries water from the Sor tapped from an offtake at Pont Crouzet for irrigation before emptying into the Canal du Midi. In addition, individual samples are collected from the water on the area between Revel and the seuil de Naurouze. In 1980 the Lac de la Ganguise was built near Castelnaudary providing a water reserve of 22 million cubic metres. In 2005 the dam was raised to reach a capacity of 44 million cubic metres. Near the old basin of Naurouze the Naurouze pumping station helps to regulate the water in the Canal du Midi and the lake. An underground pipe, the gallery of Mandore, provides the Naurouze with additional water from the Rigole de la plaine to Lake Ganguise. Conversely, during the dry season, Lake Ganguise can supply the Canal du Midi if the water supply of the Rigole de la plaine is not enough.

The canal has also provided a supply of drinking water through the water treatment plants at Picotalen (Picotalen I and Picotalen II) since 1973. They are part of the installations installed by the Institution for Interdepartmental Hydraulic Planning of Montagne Noire (IIAHMN) since its inception in 1948 to meet the water needs of Lauragais. The plant supplies water from the Cammazes channel to nearly 185 communes.

====The Canal as heritage====
While the canal was once seen as a tool of production, trade, and commerce it is now considered to be architectural and technical heritage as evidenced by the refusal of the mayor of Toulouse, Pierre Baudis, to allow space on the Canal du Midi to be used for an urban expressway. It has not been downgraded and remains open for navigation. On 7 December 1996 the channel and a buffer zone of 2,000 km were included in the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. In the same year, it was classified under French law as a &quot;Grand Site of France&quot;. This classification was extended to the canals of the plain and the mountain in 1996 and 2001. It caused a very rapid increase in tourist numbers.

Nevertheless, maintenance has not been carried out completely because many players are involved: three regions, six departments, and local collective authorities. None wish to bear the cost of restoration and do not always dare to launch development programs. &quot;Platanus&quot; (plane trees) is a particular source of problems because their roots destroy the banks and the paved cycle paths and their leaves invade the canal. In addition they are weakened by disease (canker of &quot;Platanus&quot;). The canal is a heavy heritage to maintain and enhance as the manager of French canals, Voies navigables de France (VNF), specializes in the management and maintenance of French canals in a market and commercial economy and not in the tourism market where the Canal du Midi is located. In addition maintenance costs are higher than in a traditional network because of the age of the canal. Also, the operation of the channel generates low levels of earnings. VNF must try to establish local partnerships to develop and maintain the canal since its budget does not allow it to provide the care and supervision of of canals.

The classification as a World Heritage Site creates an additional level of oversight by the State who must ensure that any changes along the canal and its structures are compatible with the strategic issues of UNESCO. However, a report of the General Inspectorate of Architecture and Heritage in 2003 showed that the channel was in very poor condition with many works and infrastructure devaluing its surroundings and suffering from significant housing pressure evidenced by uncontrolled construction, poorly designed facilities that misrepresent the site, and the construction of marinas in the ports on the canal. Nevertheless, to respect the uniformity of the canal development and support efforts for improvement, the Canal du Midi remains under the management of VNF under the tutelage of the State who want to create a monitoring mission like the Loire and Mont-Saint-Michel.

==The structures==
The Canal du Midi is long with a total of 328 structures including 63 locks, 126 bridges, 55 aqueducts, 7 aqueducts, 6 dams, 1 spillway, and 1 tunnel.

===Water supply for the canal===


It takes 90 million cubic metres of water to feed the canal for one year. To do this, Riquet set up a complex system of water supply to the canal. The idea was to capture the waters of the Montagne Noire located several tens of kilometres away and bring it to the Seuil de Naurouze, the highest point of the future canal, through channels.

These channels, called &quot;Rigole de la montagne&quot; (Channel of the Mountain) and &quot;Rigole de la plaine&quot; (Channel of the Plain) connected the upper three reservoirs (Lampy, Cammazes, and Saint-Ferréol) at the seuil de Naurouze. The Rigole de la Montagne measured long and has 22 structures between the outlet at Alzeau and the falls of Cammazes. The Rigole de la Plaine measured long at altitude and included 68 structures between the Crouzet bridge and the seuil de Naurouze.

Initially, two reservoirs fed the highest point of the canal at the seuil de Naurouze: the Bassin de Saint-Ferréol had a capacity of 6.3 million cubic metres and was built between 1667 and 1672. The other reservoir was much smaller - the Bassin de Lampy. Called &quot;Lampy-Vieux&quot;, it was quickly replaced by the &quot;Lampy-Neuf&quot; with a capacity of 1,672,000 cubic metres built over a hundred years later between 1777 and 1782.

The Bassin de Saint-Ferréol was and remains the main water reservoir for the canal with a surface of . It receives the waters of the Montagne Noire via the Channel of the Mountain which is itself supplied by the basin of Lampy. The lake waters are retained by a dam long and wide consisting of three parallel walls. The channel surrounds the basin and can evacuate any excess water. A museum is located near the outlets and has displays on the history of the construction of the Lake.

Originally the engineer planned and built a third reservoir, the Naurouze, but it was abandoned in 1680 due to its excessive silting. Pierre-Paul Riquet had dreamed of the construction of a new city around this basin that never saw the day. A floodway was quickly dug to drain the Naurouze basin from the south.

Other reservoirs were also built at Carcassonne to supply the lower part of the canal to the Mediterranean. So the waters of the Fresquel, the Cesse, and the Orbiel augmented those of the canal. On the other hand, the waters of the Orb at Béziers provided additional flow to part of the canal. In 1957 the Cammazes dam with a capacity of 20 million cubic metres of water was filled on the Sor which completed and finalized the supply network. This lake provides drinking water to more than 200 communes in the region. Of the 20 million cubic metres, 4 million are reserved for feeding the Canal du Midi.

===The locks===

The first locks built on the Toulouse plain by Pierre-Paul Riquet were experimental and were not satisfactory. They consisted of rectangular locks with wooden stilts as foundations for the side walls. This form did not properly restrain the lateral material when the lock was empty. They then collapsed on themselves. He redefined the shape of his locks to rounded side walls, thicker, and more resistant to the lateral pressure of the earth. The dimensions of the locks were then large enough for the time. Because of these rounded forms, the architecture of the locks in the Canal du Midi is called Baroque style.

The locks were built in stone and sealed with lime. They are closed by two double leaf doors. The doors, originally timber with the fewest possible metal parts, are subject to severe moisture stress and pressure. They had a &quot;vantelle&quot; (valve) controlled by a rack and pinion that allowed the draining of water from the lock chamber.

The nominal size of the locks built by Pierre-Paul Riquet was long, wide at the door, wide in the centre of the lock and an average of in height. In the 20th century, many locks were changed and therefore no longer have the original features.

At the town of Béziers there is a staircase of eight locks at Fonsérannes to bring it to the river Orb. The locks had to be cut from solid rock, and descended a hillside whose gradient varied. All the locks had to contain the same volume of water, but could not have precisely the same shape. Nonetheless, they were built successfully without a need for repair. This amazing piece of engineering was subcontracted out to two illiterate brothers, the Medhailes, and was built by a workforce composed mainly of women.

Some of the locks on the canal are architectural gems. For instance, the Agde Round Lock has three doors: two doors provide access to each side of the channel and the third provides access to the Hérault going to the Mediterranean. This system allows triple access while protecting the canal from river flooding. Similarly, the canal has several multiple locks – i.e. with multiple locks attached to one another. This system saves doors and foundations in areas where the slope is greatest. The best known of these locks is Fonserannes Lock which has eight chambers.

Today most of the locks are electrified which replaced the manual opening of the sluices and lock gates.

===The ports===
Several ports were built at regular intervals along the route of the canal in order to load and unload goods and also to provide stopping-places for travellers. Toulouse has two ports: the port de l&#x27;Embouchure is located at the junction of the Canal du Midi, the Canal de Brienne, and the Lateral canal of the Garonne while Port Saint-Sauveur is located in the centre of town near the &quot;Hall of Grains&quot;. There were two other ports in Toulouse but they were destroyed for urban development. So the &quot;Port des Minimes&quot; and the &quot;Port Saint-Etienne&quot; were replaced by towpaths.

Castelnaudary has a port of called &quot;Grand Basin&quot; built between 1666 and 1671. It served as a stopover halfway between Toulouse and Sète. Cybelle island in the middle of the basin was used to protect the barges from the wind. Carcassonne is today a major tourist stop on the canal and has a port built in 1810 at the time when the city was connected to the canal. The port of Trèbes is a major port which has numerous moorings for boats. There are also the ports of Homps which was one of the most important on the canal and Le Somail which was a popular place for rest and recreation. Finally, just before its arrival at the Mediterranean Sea, the canal has two ports: the port of Agde where there is the old hotel of the &quot;Administration of the Canal&quot;, and the port of Onglous at Marseillan which is the last port before Sète and its royal canal giving access to the sea.

Newer ports were built such as Ramonville-Saint-Agne, called Port-Sud, which has many residential barges and is set directly overlooking the harbour, and Port-Lauragais located near Avignonet-Lauragais on a service area of the A61 autoroute.

===The aqueducts===
Related article: Aqueducts on the Canal du Midi

Several aqueducts were built along the route of the Canal du Midi. They allow the canal to cross rivers that could disrupt the water flow in the canal. In fact, the rivers flowing into the canal cause an overflow of water during flooding and fill the canal with silt. Some aqueducts date from the time of Pierre-Paul Riquet, but most were built after the completion of the canal in particular due to improvements recommended by Vauban. The canal has the following aqueducts (in order from Agde to Toulouse):
*Orb aqueduct (PK 208) which was inaugurated in 1857, eliminating the difficult crossing of the river Orb
*Cesse aqueduct (PK 168)
*Répudre aqueduct (PK 159) was built between 1667 and 1676 to span the Répudre near the village of Paraza. The Répudre is a small tributary of the Aude in which the flow is too variable especially in winter (bridge length: ). It was also the first aqueduct built by Pierre-Paul Riquet
*Orbiel aqueduct at Trèbes (PK 117)
*Fresquel aqueduct (PK 109) was built beginning in 1800 and opened on 31 May 1810, as a result of the realignment of the route to pass through the centre of the city of Carcassonne, a city that refused to pay a share of the cost when the canal was first built
*Herbettes aqueduct, (PK 8), a new aqueduct at Toulouse completed in 1983, long, to cross a four-lane motorway.

===Other structures===
Pierre-Paul Riquet and the engineers who followed him over three centuries built many other structures on the Canal du Midi, of which the most important are listed here:

*the Malpas Tunnel long southeast of the Oppidum d&#x27;Ensérune which passes through a hill above sea level and was a technical challenge for the time

*the Argent-Double spillway located in La Redorte near the Argent-Double Aqueduct: this work incorporates eleven successive stone arches contemporary to Vauban, its designer; it was built by Antoine de Niquet and allows for the overflow water from the canal to be discharged into the stream

*the Fonserannes water slope, which bypasses the 6-lock staircase at Fonserannes, was built at the time when the canal was to be upgraded to Freycinet gauge to save time and allow larger vessels to work on. It has a unique machinery whose maintenance is expensive, but for several years, VNF has attempted to rehabilitate it to reduce waiting times at the Fonséranes locks

*the Ouvrages du Libron (the works of Libron), a unique achievement of its kind which allows the canal to cross the course of the Libron near Agde
*the watermills of the Canal du Midi are located in derivation of the number of locks (e.g. Naurouze, Gay, Trèbes, Matabiau, Minimes, Castelnaudary, Castanet, Beziers, etc.) and used the water height differences to power Quern-stones to grind grain from the commissioning of the canal. Thereafter, they become real Gristmills during the 18th century.

==Flora and fauna==
The canal is a long ribbon of water stretching through the landscape and attracts many animal species. Several species of fish such as bream breed in the canal, and others reproduce in its feeding rivers and spend part of their life in the canal. Molluscs such as anadontes, a kind of freshwater mussel, and corbicules, a kind of freshwater clam, occur in the canal. Invasive Coypu (River rat or nutria) and Muskrats introduced from the Americas burrow into the banks, which they damage. Finally, many animals and birds come to drink water from the canal.

The canal is also a very vegetated place. In the beginning, Pierre-Paul Riquet planted trees to stabilize the banks of the canal especially where it overlooked the surrounding lands. The willow was widely used for its rapid growth. The engineer also planted irises on the side of the canal to reduce subsidence of its banks. In the 18th century, the trees planted along the canal become a source of income. So mulberries were planted for rearing silkworms. Then, with the end of the silk culture in 1772, the mulberry trees were replaced by the poplar from Italy which was the most productive wood. Structures and lock-keepers&#x27; houses were decorated with fruit trees. At the time of the French Revolution plantations around the canal had approximately 60,000 trees when there were only 45,000 at the beginning. It was under the First Empire that plane trees began to be planted to replace the cut trees, which are today the dominant variety along the canal.

However, for several years, plane trees have been infected with canker stain, a disease caused by a microscopic fungus called &quot;Ceratocystis platani&quot;. The first outbreaks were detected in 2006 with the number of infected plane trees reaching 83 in 2008 and 153 in 2009. Selective tree-felling campaigns have been conducted to try to stop the spread but with no effect. In addition, there is no effective treatment against the disease. In 2011, 211 places and 1,338 diseased trees have been identified. In 15 to 20 years all 42,000 plane trees of the Canal du Midi will have to be felled and replaced mainly by other species (ash, lime), after initial experiments with a variety of plane-tree resisting the parasite.

==The Canal du Midi as a model==
The Canal du Midi was one of the great achievements of the late 17th century. Riquet understood the hydraulic system of the Montagne Noire and had controlled it to serve the Canal du Midi. King Louis XIV, who was the sponsor, also left it as a mark of his commitment to grandeur.

The canal was also magnified by the &quot;Encyclopedia or Reasoned Dictionary of Science, Arts, and Crafts&quot; by Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert in 1765 who highlighted its value and greatness. They compare it to Roman constructions. Another encyclopedia writer, Joseph Jerome Lefrancois Lalande lauded the architectural and hydraulic achievement in his work &quot;The navigation canals and especially the Canal de Languedoc&quot; in 1778. Similarly, Bernard Forest de Bélidor congratulated the designer in &quot;Hydraulic Architecture&quot;. The canal became an example in Europe as throughout the Age of Enlightenment it was the only canal of this size in Europe.

The American Thomas Jefferson, politician, architect, and future president of the United States, came to study the Canal du Midi in 1787. As the United States Ambassador to France he envisaged the construction of a similar work to link the Potomac River to Lake Erie.

In the 1820s the Hungarian reformer István Széchenyi visited France and was greatly impressed with the Canal du Midi in France. It inspired him to envision ways to improve navigation on the lower Danube and Tisza, which he implemented later in his career.

<text>New Britain () is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago, part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from New Guinea by a northwest corner of the Solomon Sea (or with an island hop of Umboi the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits) and from New Ireland by St. George&#x27;s Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. 

When the island was part of German New Guinea, its name was Neupommern (&quot;New Pomerania&quot;). In common with most of the Bismarcks it was largely formed by volcanic processes, and has active volcanoes including Ulawun (highest volcano nationally), Langila, the Garbuna Group, the Sulu Range, and the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan of the Rabaul caldera. A major eruption of Tavurvur in 1994 destroyed the East New Britain provincial capital of Rabaul. Most of the town still lies under metres of ash, and the capital has been moved to nearby Kokopo.

==Geography==


New Britain extends from 148°18′28″ to 152°24′15″ E longitude and from 4°08′00″ to 6°18′57″ S latitude. It is crescent-shaped, approximately along its southeastern coastline, and from wide, not including a small central peninsula. The air-line distance from west to east is . The island is the 38th largest in the world, with an area of .

Steep cliffs form some sections of the coastline; in others the mountains are further inland, and the coastal area is flat and bordered by coral reefs. The highest point, at , is the stratovolcano Mount Ulawun in the east. Most of the terrain is covered with tropical rainforest, and several large rivers are fed by the high rainfall.

The Nakanai Range in East New Britain is composed largely of limestone karst, which extends from the mountain peaks to the southern coast. Erosion of the porous limestone has created large sinkholes, or dolines, and extensive caves and river cave systems. The Nakanai Caves, together with two other karst regions on the New Guinea mainland, were nominated to the World Heritage Tentative List in 2007 as The Sublime Karsts of Papua New Guinea.

==Administrative divisions==

New Britain forms part of the Islands Region, one of four regions of Papua New Guinea. It comprises the mainland of two provinces:
* East New Britain with headquarters in Kokopo (formerly in Rabaul)
* West New Britain with headquarters in Kimbe

== History ==
In research science, there is evidence with Pleistocene-era cultural deposits discovered in open-site excavations in near Yombon, which show that New Britain has been inhabited by indigenous Papuans for thousands of years, with human occupation dating back to 21,000 BC.

=== Modern history ===
====Before 1700====
First noted in Europe by the explorer Sir Harper Matthew. Claimed by the Crown of England.

====1700–1914====
William Dampier became the first known British man to visit New Britain on 27 February 1700; he dubbed the island with the Latin name &quot;Nova Britannia&quot; (Eng: &quot;New Britain&quot;).

Whaling ships from Britain, Australia and America called at the island in the 19th century for food, water and wood. The first on record was the &quot;Roscoe&quot; in 1822. The last known whaling visitor was the &quot;Palmetto&quot; in 1881.

In November 1884, Germany proclaimed its protectorate over the New Britain Archipelago; the German colonial administration gave New Britain and New Ireland the names of Neupommern (or Neu-Pommern; &quot;New Pomerania&quot;) and Neumecklenburg (or Neu-Mecklenburg; &quot;New Mecklenburg&quot;) respectively, and the whole island group was renamed the Bismarck Archipelago. New Britain became part of German New Guinea.

In 1909, the indigenous population was estimated at 190,000; the foreign population at 773 (474 white). The expatriate population was practically confined to the northeastern Gazelle Peninsula, which included the capital, Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo). At the time had been converted to plantations, primarily growing copra, cotton, coffee and rubber. Westerners avoided exploring the interior initially, believing that the indigenous peoples were warlike and would fiercely resist intrusions.

====World War I====
On 11 September 1914, New Britain became the site of one of the earliest battles of World War I when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island. They quickly overwhelmed the German forces and occupied the island for the duration of the war.

====Interwar period====
After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919. Germany was stripped of all its possessions outside Europe. In 1920 the League of Nations included New Britain, along with the former German colony on New Guinea, in the Territory of New Guinea, a mandated territory of Australia.

====World War II====
During World War II the Japanese attacked New Britain soon after the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean. Strategic bases at Rabaul and Kavieng (New Ireland) were defended by a small Australian detachment, Lark Force. During January 1942, the Japanese heavily bombed Rabaul. On 23 January, Japanese marines landed by the thousands, starting the Battle of Rabaul. Two hundred and fifty civilians were evacuated from places on New Britain in March 1942, but others were captured in Rabaul when it fell. The Japanese used Rabaul as a key base until 1944; it served as the key point for the failed invasion of Port Moresby on New Guinea (May to November 1942).
New Britain was invaded by the U.S. 1st Marine Division in the Cape Gloucester area of the very western end of the island, and also by U.S. Army soldiers at some other coastal points. As for Cape Gloucester, with its swamps and mosquitos, the Marines said that it was &quot;worse than Guadalcanal&quot;. They captured an airfield but accomplished little toward reducing the Japanese base at Rabaul.

The Allied plan involved bypassing Rabaul by surrounding it with air and naval bases on surrounding islands and on New Britain itself. The adjacent island of New Ireland was bypassed altogether. Much of the story from the Japanese side, especially the two suicide charges by the Baalen group, are retold in Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths&quot;. The factual telemovie &quot;Sisters of War&quot; recounts experiences of Australian Army nurses and Catholic nuns during the conflict.

====After 1945====

The population of the main town of Rabaul was evacuated as a result of volcanic activity in 1994 which buried the town under a thick layer of volcanic ash.

==People and culture==
The indigenous people of New Britain fall into two main groups: the Papuans, who have inhabited the island for tens of thousands of years, and the Austronesians, who arrived around three thousand years ago. There are around ten Papuan languages spoken and about forty Austronesian languages, as well as Tok Pisin and English. The Papuan population is largely confined to the eastern third of the island and a couple of small enclaves in the central highlands. At Jacquinot Bay, in the south-east, they live beside the beach where a waterfall crashes directly into the sea.
The population of New Britain was 493,585 in 2010. Austronesian people make up the majority on the island. The major towns are Rabaul/Kokopo in East New Britain and Kimbe in West New Britain.

New Britain hosts diverse and complex traditional cultures. While the Tolai of the Rabaul area of East New Britain have a matrilineal society, other groups are patrilineal in structure. There are numerous traditions which remain active today, such as the &quot;dukduk&quot; secret society (also known as &quot;tubuan&quot;) in the Tolai area.

==Languages==
Non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages spoken on New Britain:

* Taulil–Butam languages: Taulil, Butam (extinct) (originally from New Ireland)
* &quot;Sulka&quot; (originally from New Ireland)
* Baining languages: Mali, Kaket, Kairak, Simbali, Ura
* &quot;Kol&quot;
* &quot;Makolkol&quot;
* &quot;Anêm&quot;
* &quot;Ata&quot;

The last two are spoken in West New Britain, and the rest in East New Britain. 

Austronesian languages include Tolai, Lungalunga, Siasi, Kimbe, Lamogai, Mengen and other  North New Guinea languages.

==Ecology==
The island is part of two ecoregions. The New Britain–New Ireland lowland rain forests extend from sea level to elevation. The New Britain–New Ireland montane rain forests cover the mountains of New Britain above elevation.

Forests on New Britain have been rapidly destroyed in recent years, largely to clear land for oil palm plantations.
Lowland rainforest has been hardest hit, with nearly a quarter of the forest below disappearing between 1989 and 2000. If those rates of deforestation continue, it is estimated that all forest below will be cleared by 2060. Despite this, most forest birds on New Britain are still widespread and secure in conservation status, though some forest-dependent species such as the New Britain kingfisher are considered to be at risk of extinction if current trends continue.

<text>Chaim Azriel Weizmann ( ; 27 November 1874 – 9 November 1952) was a Russian-born Israeli statesman, biochemist, and Zionist leader who served as president of the Zionist Organization and later as the first president of Israel. He was elected on 16 February 1949, and served until his death in 1952. Weizmann was instrumental in obtaining the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and convincing the United States government to recognize the newly formed State of Israel in 1948.

As a biochemist, Weizmann is considered to be the &#x27;father&#x27; of industrial fermentation. He developed the acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation process, which produces acetone, n-butanol and ethanol through bacterial fermentation. His acetone production method was of great importance in the manufacture of cordite explosive propellants for the British war industry during World War I. He founded the Sieff Research Institute in Rehovot (later renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science in his honor), and was instrumental in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Biography==

Chaim Weizmann was born in the village of Motal, located in what is now Belarus and at that time was part of the Russian Empire in 1874. He was the third of 15 children born to Oizer and Rachel (Czemerinsky) Weizmann. His father was a timber merchant. From ages four to eleven, he attended a traditional cheder, or Jewish religious primary school, where he also studied Hebrew. At the age of 11, he entered high school in Pinsk, where he displayed a talent for science, especially chemistry. While in Pinsk, he became active in the Hovevei Zion movement. He graduated with honors in 1892.

In 1892, Weizmann left for Germany to study chemistry at the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt. To earn a living, he worked as a Hebrew teacher at an Orthodox Jewish boarding school. In 1894, he moved to Berlin to study at the Technische Hochschule Berlin.

While in Berlin, he joined a circle of Zionist intellectuals. In 1897, he moved to Switzerland to complete his studies at the University of Fribourg. In 1898, he attended the Second Zionist Congress in Basel. That year he became engaged to Sophia Getzowa. Getzowa and Weizmann were together for four years before Weizmann, who became romantically involved with Vera Khatzman in 1900, confessed to Getzowa that he was seeing another woman. He did not tell the family he was leaving Getzowa until 1903. His fellow students held a mock trial and ruled that Weitzman should uphold his commitment and marry Getzowa, even if he later divorced her. Weizmann ignored their advice.

Of Weizmann&#x27;s fifteen siblings, ten immigrated to Palestine. Two also became chemists; Anna (Anushka) Weizmann worked in his Daniel Sieff Research Institute lab, registering several patents in her name. His brother, Moshe Weizmann, was the head of the Chemistry Faculty at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Two siblings remained in the Soviet Union following the Russian Revolution: a brother, Shmuel, and a sister, Maria (Masha). Shmuel Weizmann was a dedicated Communist and member of the anti-Zionist Bund movement. During the Stalinist &quot;Great Purge&quot;, he was arrested for alleged espionage and Zionist activity, and executed in 1939. His fate became known to his wife and children only in 1955. Maria Weizmann was a doctor who was arrested as part of Stalin&#x27;s fabricated &quot;Doctors&#x27; plot&quot; in 1952 and was sentenced to five years imprisonment in Siberia. She was released following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, and was permitted to emigrate to Israel in 1956. During World War I, another sister, Minna Weizmann, was the lover of a German spy (and later Nazi diplomat), , and worked as a spy for Germany in Cairo, Egypt (then wartime British protectorate) in 1915. Minna was outed as a spy during a trip to Italy and was deported back to Egypt to be sent to a British POW camp. Back in Cairo, she successfully persuaded the consul of the Russian Czar to provide her safe passage out, and en route to Russia, she managed to reconnect with Prüfer via a German consulate. Minna was never formally charged with espionage, survived the war, and would eventually return to Palestine to work for the medical service of the Zionist women&#x27;s organization, Hadassah.

Weizmann married Vera Khatzmann, with whom he had two sons. The elder son, Benjamin (Benjie) Weizmann (1907–1980), settled in Ireland and became a dairy farmer.
The younger one, Flight Lieutenant Michael Oser Weizmann (1916–1942), fought in the Royal Air Force during World War II. While serving as a pilot in No. 502 Squadron RAF, he was killed when his plane was shot down over the Bay of Biscay in February 1942. His body was never found and he was listed as &quot;missing&quot;. His father never fully accepted his death and made a provision in his will, in case he returned. He is one of the British Empire&#x27;s air force casualties without a known grave commemorated at the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede in Surrey, England.

His nephew Ezer Weizman, son of his brother Yechiel, a leading Israeli agronomist, became commander of the Israeli Air Force and also served as President of Israel.

Chaim Weizmann is buried beside his wife in the garden of his home at the Weizmann estate, located on the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, named after him.

==Academic and scientific career==
In 1899, he was awarded a PhD in organic chemistry. That year, he joined the Organic Chemistry Department at the University of Geneva. In 1901, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the University of Geneva.

In 1904, he moved to the United Kingdom to teach at the Chemistry Department of the University of Manchester as a senior lecturer. He joined Clayton Aniline Company in 1905 where the director Charles Dreyfus introduced him to Arthur Balfour, then Prime Minister.

In 1910, he became a British citizen when Winston Churchill as Home Secretary signed his papers, and held his British nationality until 1948, when he renounced it to assume his position as President of Israel. Chaim Weizmann and his family lived in Manchester for about 30 years (1904–1934), although they temporarily lived at 16 Addison Road in London during World War I.

In Britain, he was known as Charles Weizmann, a name under which he registered about 100 research patents. At the end of World War II, it was discovered that the SS had compiled a list in 1940 of over 2800 people living in Britain, which included Weizmann, who were to have been immediately arrested after an invasion of Britain had the ultimately abandoned Operation Sea Lion been successful.

===Discovery of synthetic acetone===

While serving as a lecturer in Manchester he became known for discovering how to use bacterial fermentation to produce large quantities of desired substances. He is considered to be the father of industrial fermentation. He used the bacterium &quot;Clostridium&quot; &quot;acetobutylicum&quot; (the &quot;Weizmann organism&quot;) to produce acetone. Acetone was used in the manufacture of cordite explosive propellants critical to the Allied war effort (see Royal Naval Cordite Factory, Holton Heath). Weizmann transferred the rights to the manufacture of acetone to the Commercial Solvents Corporation in exchange for royalties. Winston Churchill became aware of the possible use of Weizmann&#x27;s discovery in early 1915, and David Lloyd George, as Minister of Munitions, joined Churchill in encouraging Weizmann&#x27;s development of the process. Pilot plant development of laboratory procedures was completed in 1915 at the J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co gin factory in Bow, London, so industrial scale production of acetone could begin in six British distilleries requisitioned for the purpose in early 1916. The effort produced tonnes of acetone during the war, although a national collection of horse-chestnuts was required when supplies of maize were inadequate for the quantity of starch needed for fermentation. The importance of Weizmann&#x27;s work gave him favour in the eyes of the British Government, this allowed Weizmann to have access to senior Cabinet members and utilise this time to represent Zionist aspirations.

After the Shell Crisis of 1915 during World War I, Weizmann was director of the British Admiralty laboratories from 1916 until 1919. In April 1918 at the head of the Jewish Commission, he returned to Palestine to look for &quot;rare minerals&quot; for the British war effort in the Dead Sea. Weizmann&#x27;s attraction for British Liberalism enabled Lloyd George&#x27;s influence at the Ministry of Munitions to do a financial and industrial deal with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) to seal the future of the Zionist homeland. Tirelessly energetic Weizmann entered London again in later October to speak for a solid hour with the Prime Minister, propped by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and his Manchester friends. At another conference on 21 February 1919 at Euston Hotel the peace envoy, Lord Bryce was reassured by the pledges against international terrorism, for currency regulation and fiscal controls.

===Establishment of scientific research institutes===

Concurrently, Weizmann devoted himself to the establishment of a scientific institute for basic research in the vicinity of his estate in the town of Rehovot. Weizmann saw great promise in science as a means to bring peace and prosperity to the area. As stated in his own words &quot;I trust and feel sure in my heart that science will bring to this land both peace and a renewal of its youth, creating here the springs of a new spiritual and material life. [...] I speak of both science for its own sake and science as a means to an end.&quot;
His efforts led in 1934 to the creation of the Daniel Sieff Research Institute (later renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science), which was financially supported by an endowment by Israel Sieff in memory of his late son. Weizmann actively conducted research in the laboratories of this institute, primarily in the field of organic chemistry. He offered the post of director of the institute to Nobel Prize laureate Fritz Haber, but took over the directorship himself after Haber&#x27;s death en route to Palestine.

During World War II, he was an honorary adviser to the British Ministry of Supply and did research on synthetic rubber and high-octane gasoline.

==Zionist activism==
Weizmann was absent from the first Zionist conference, held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland, because of travel problems, but he attended the Second Zionist Congress in 1898 and each one thereafter. Beginning in 1901, he lobbied for the founding of a Jewish institution of higher learning in Palestine. Together with Martin Buber and Berthold Feiwel, he presented a document to the Fifth Zionist Congress highlighting this need especially in the fields of science and engineering. This idea would later be crystallized in the foundation of the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1912.

Weizmann met Arthur Balfour, the Conservative Prime Minister who was MP for East Manchester, during one of Balfour&#x27;s electoral campaigns in 1905–1906. Balfour supported the concept of a Jewish homeland, but felt that there would be more support among politicians for the then-current offer in Uganda, called the British Uganda Programme. Following mainstream Zionist rejection of that proposal, Weizmann was credited later with persuading Balfour, by then the Foreign Secretary during the First World War, for British support to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, the original Zionist aspiration. The story goes that Weizmann asked Balfour, &quot;Would you give up London to live in Saskatchewan?&quot; When Balfour replied that the British had always lived in London, Weizmann responded, &quot;Yes, and we lived in Jerusalem when London was still a marsh.&quot; Nevertheless, this had not prevented naturalization as a British subject in 1910 with the help of &quot;haham&quot; Moses Gaster, who asked for papers from Herbert Samuel, the minister.

Weizmann revered Britain but relentlessly pursued Jewish freedom. He was head of the Democratic Fraction, a group of Zionist radicals who posed a challenge to Herzlian political Zionism. Israel Sieff described him as &quot;pre-eminently what the Jewish people call folks-mensch ... a man of the people, of the masses, not of an elite&quot;. His most recent biographers challenge this, describing him as a blatant elitist, disgusted by the masses, coldly aloof from his family, callous with friends if they did not support him, despondently alienated from Palestine, where he lived only with reluctance, and repelled by the Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe there.

Gradually Weizmann set up a separate following from Moses Gaster and L. J. Greenberg in London. Manchester became an important Zionist center in Britain. Weizmann was mentor to Harry Sacher, Israel Sieff and Simon Marks (founders of Marks &amp; Spencer), and formed a friendship with Asher Ginzberg, a writer who pushed for Zionist inclusivity and urged against &quot;repressive cruelty&quot; to the Arabs. He regularly traveled by train to London to discuss spiritual and cultural Zionism with Ginzberg, whose pen name was Ahad Ha&#x27;am. He stayed at Ginzberg&#x27;s home in Hampstead, whence he lobbied Whitehall, beyond his job as Director of the Admiralty for Manchester.
Zionists believed that anti-Semitism led directly to the need for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Weizmann first visited Jerusalem in 1907, and while there, he helped organize the Palestine Land Development Company as a practical means of pursuing the Zionist dream, and to found the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Although Weizmann was a strong advocate for &quot;those governmental grants which are necessary to the achievement of the Zionist purpose&quot; in Palestine, as stated at Basel, he persuaded many Jews not to wait for future events,
During World War I, at around the same time he was appointed Director of the British Admiralty&#x27;s laboratories, Weizmann, in a conversation with David Lloyd George, suggested the strategy of the British campaign against the Ottoman Empire. From 1914, &quot;a benevolent goodwill toward the Zionist idea&quot; emerged in Britain when intelligence revealed how the Jewish Question could support imperial interests against the Ottomans. Many of Weizmann&#x27;s contacts revealed the extent of the uncertainty in Palestine. From 1914 to 1918, Weizmann developed his political skills mixing easily in powerful circles. On 7 and 8 November 1914, he had a meeting with Dorothy de Rothschild. Her husband James de Rothschild was serving with the French Army, but she was unable to influence her cousinhood to Weizmann&#x27;s favour. However, when Weizmanm spoke to Charles, second son of Nathan Mayer Rothschild, he approved the idea. James de Rothschild advised Weizmann to seek to influence the British Government. By the time he reached Lord Robert Cecil, Dr Weizmann was enthused with excitement. Cecil&#x27;s personal foibles were representative of class consciousness, which the Zionists overcame through deeds rather than words. C. P. Scott, the editor of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, formed a friendship with Weizmann after the two men encountered each other at a Manchester garden party in 1915. Scott described the diminutive leader asextraordinarily interesting, a rare combination of idealism and the severely practical which are the two essentials of statesmanship a perfectly clear sense conception of Jewish nationalism, an intense and burning sense of the Jew as Jew, just as strong, perhaps more so, as that of the German as German or the Englishman as Englishman, and secondly arising out of that and necessary for its satisfaction and development, his demand for a country, a home land which for him and for anyone during his view of Jewish nationality can be no other that the ancient home of his race.

Scott wrote to the Liberal Party&#x27;s Lloyd George who set up a meeting for a reluctant Weizmann with Herbert Samuel, President of the Local Government Board, who was now converted to Zionism. On 10 December 1914 at Whitehall, Samuel offered Weizmann a Jewish homeland complete with funded developments. Ecstatic, Weizmann returned to Westminster to arrange a meeting with Balfour, who was also on the War Council. He had first met the Conservatives in 1906, but after being moved to tears at 12 Carlton Gardens, on 12 December 1914, Balfour told Weizmann &quot;it is a great cause and I understand it.&quot; Weizmann had another meeting in Paris with Baron Edmond Rothschild before a crucial discussion with Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George, on 15 January 1915. Whilst some of the leading members of Britain&#x27;s Jewish community regarded Weizmann&#x27;s program with distaste, &quot;The Future of Palestine&quot;, also known as the &quot;Samuel Memorandum&quot;, was a watershed moment in the Great War and annexation of Palestine.

Weizmann consulted several times with Samuel on the homeland policy during 1915, but H. H. Asquith, then Prime Minister, would be dead set against upsetting the balance of power on the Middle East. Attitudes were changing to &quot;dithyrambic&quot; opposition; but in the Cabinet, to the Samuel Memorandum, it remained implacably opposed with the exception of Chancellor Lloyd George. Edwin Montagu, for example, Samuel&#x27;s cousin was strenuously opposed. Weizmann did not attend the meeting of Jewry&#x27;s ruling Conjoint Committee when it met the Zionist leadership on 14 April 1915. Yehiel Tschlenow had travelled from Berlin to speak at the congress. He envisioned a Jewish Community worldwide so that integration was complementary with amelioration. Zionists however had one goal only, the creation of their own state with British help.

In 1915, Weizmann also began working with Sir Mark Sykes, who was looking for a member of the Jewish community for a delicate mission. He met the Armenian lawyer, James Malcolm, who already knew Sykes, and British intelligence, who were tired of the oppositional politics of Moses Gaster. &quot;Dr Weizmann ... asked when he could meet Sir Mark Sykes ... Sir Mark fixed the appointment for the very next day, which was a Sunday.&quot; They finally met on 28 January 1917, &quot;Dr Weizmann...should take the leading part in the negotiations&quot;, was Sykes response. Weizmann was determined to replace the Chief Rabbi as Jewish leader of Zionism. He had the &quot;matter in hand&quot; when he met Sokolow and Malcolm at Thatched House on Monday 5 February 1917. Moses Gaster was very reluctant to step aside. Weizmann had a considerable following, yet was not involved in the discussions with François Georges-Picot at the French embassy: a British Protectorate, he knew would not require French agreement. Furthermore, James de Rothschild proved a friend and guardian of the nascent state questioning Sykes&#x27; motivations as their dealings on Palestine were still secretive. Sokolow, Weizmann&#x27;s diplomatic representative, cuttingly remarked to Picot underlining the irrelevance of the Triple Entente to French Jewry, but on 7 February 1917, the British government recognized the Zionist leader and agreed to expedite the claim. Weizmann was characteristically wishing to reward his Jewish friends for loyalty and service. News of the February Revolution (also known as the Kerensky Revolution) in Russia shattered the illusion for World Jewry. Unity for British Jewry was achieved by the Manchester Zionists. &quot;Thus not for the first time in history, there is a community alike of interest and of sentiment between the British State and Jewish people.&quot; The Manchester Zionists published a pamphlet &quot;Palestine&quot; on 26 January 1917, which did not reflect British policy, but already Sykes looked to Weizmann&#x27;s leadership when they met on 20 March 1917.

On 6 February 1917 a meeting was held at Dr Moses Gaster&#x27;s house with Weizmann to discuss the results of the Picot convention in Paris. Sokolow and Weizmann pressed on with seizing leadership from Gaster; they had official recognition from the British government. At 6 Buckingham Gate on 10 February 1917 another was held, in a series of winter meetings in London. The older generation of Greenberg, Joseph Cowen and Gaster were stepping down or being passed over. &quot;...those friends ... in close cooperation all these years&quot;, he suggested should become the EZF Council- Manchester&#x27;s Sieff, Sacher and Marks, and London&#x27;s Leon Simon and Samuel Tolkowsky. While the war was raging in the outside world, the Zionists prepared for an even bigger fight for the survival of their homeland. Weizmann issued a statement on 11 February 1917, and on the following day, they received news of the Kerensky take over in Petrograd. Tsarist Russia had been very anti-Semitic but incongruously this made the British government even more determined to help the Jews. Nahum Sokolow acted as Weizmann&#x27;s eyes and ears in Paris on a diplomatic mission; an Entente under the Ottoman Empire was unsettling. The Triple Entente of Arab-Armenian-Zionist was fantastic to Weizmann, leaving him cold and unenthusiastic. Nonetheless, the delegation left for Paris on 31 March 1917. One purpose of the Alliance was to strengthen the hand of Zionism in the United States.

Weizmann&#x27;s relations with Balfour were intellectual and academic. He was genuinely overjoyed to convince the former Prime Minister in April 1917. Just after the U.S. President, Woodrow Wilson, had left, the following morning, Lloyd George invited Weizmann to breakfast at which he promised Jewish support for Britain as the Jews &quot;might be able to render more assistance than the Arabs.&quot; They discussed &quot;International Control&quot;, the Russian Revolution and US involvement in the future of the Palestine Problem. The complexity of Arab &quot;desiderata&quot; – &quot;facilities of colonization, communal autonomy, rights of language and establishment of a Jewish chartered company&quot;. This was followed by a meeting with Sir Edward Carson and the Conservatives (18 April) and another at Downing Street on 20 April. With the help of George&#x27;s private secretary Philip Kerr the issue was moved up &quot;the Agenda&quot; to War Cabinet as a matter of urgency.

On 16 May 1917 the President of the Board of Deputies David Lindo Alexander QC co-signed a statement in the &quot;Times&quot; attacking Zionism and asserting that the Jewish Community in Britain was opposed to it. At the next meeting of the Board, on 15 June 1917, a motion of censure was proposed against the President, who said he would treat the motion as one of no confidence. When it was passed, he resigned. Although subsequent analysis has shown that the success of the motion possibly had more to do with a feeling on the part of Deputies that Lindo Alexander had failed to consult them than with a massive conversion on their part to the Zionist cause, nevertheless it had great significance outside the community. Within days of the resolution the Foreign Office sent a note to Lord Rothschild and to Weizmann asking them to submit their proposals for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The way had been opened to the Balfour Declaration issued in the following November.

==Political career==
On 31 October 1917, Chaim Weizmann became president of the British Zionist Federation; he worked with Arthur Balfour to obtain the Balfour Declaration.
A founder of so-called Synthetic Zionism, Weizmann supported grass-roots colonization efforts as well as high-level diplomatic activity. He was generally associated with the centrist General Zionists and later sided with neither Labour Zionism on the left nor Revisionist Zionism on the right. In 1917, he expressed his view of Zionism in the following words,
Weizmann&#x27;s personality became an issue but Weizmann had an international profile unlike his colleagues or any other British Zionist. He was President of EZF Executive Council. He was also criticized by Harry Cohen. A London delegate raised a censure motion: that Weizmann refused to condemn the regiment. In August 1917, Weizmann quit both EZF and ZPC which he had founded with his friends. Leon Simon asked Weizmann not to &quot;give up the struggle&quot;. At the meeting on 4 September 1917, he faced some fanatical opposition. But letters of support &quot;sobering down&quot; opposition, and a letter from his old friend Ginzberg &quot;a great number of people regard you as something of a symbol of Zionism&quot;.

Zionists linked Sokolow and Weizmann to Sykes. Sacher tried to get the Foreign Secretary to redraft a statement rejecting Zionism. The irony was not lost accusing the government of anti-semitism. Edwin Montagu opposed it, but Herbert Samuel and David Lloyd George favoured Zionism. Montagu did not regard Palestine as a &quot;fit place for them to live&quot;. Montagu believed that it would let down assimilationists and the ideals of British Liberalism. The Memorandum was not supposed to accentuate the prejudice of mentioning &#x27;home of the Jewish people&#x27;. Weizmann was a key holder at the Ministry of Supply by late 1917. By 1918 Weizmann was accused of combating the idea of a separate peace with Ottoman Empire. He considered such a peace at odds with Zionist interests. He was even accused of &quot;possibly prolonging the war&quot;.

At the War Cabinet meeting of 4 October, chaired by Lloyd George and with Balfour present, Lord Curzon also opposed this &quot;barren and desolate&quot; place as a home for Jews. In a third memo Montagu labelled Weizmann a &quot;religious fanatic&quot;. Montagu believed in assimilation and saw his principles being swept from under by the new policy stance. Montagu, a British Jew, had learnt debating skills as India Secretary, and Liberalism from Asquith, who also opposed Zionism.
All the memos from Zionists, non-Zionists, and Curzon were all-in by a third meeting convened on Wednesday, 31 October 1917. The War Cabinet had dealt an &quot;irreparable blow to Jewish Britons&quot;, wrote Montagu. Curzon&#x27;s memo was mainly concerned by the non-Jews in Palestine to secure their civil rights. Worldwide there were 12 million Jews, and about in Palestine by 1932. Cabinet ministers were worried about Germany playing the Zionist card. If the Germans were in control, it would hasten support for Ottoman Empire, and collapse of Kerensky&#x27;s government. Curzon went on towards an advanced Imperial view: that since most Jews had Zionist views, it was as well to support these majority voices. &quot;If we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda.&quot; Weizmann &quot;was absolutely loyal to Great Britain&quot;. The Zionists had been approached by the Germans, Weizmann told William Ormsby-Gore, but the British miscalculated the effects of immigration to Palestine and over-estimated German control over the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans were in no position to prevent movement. Sykes reported the Declaration to Weizmann with elation all round: he repeated &quot;mazel tov&quot; over and over. The Entente had fulfilled its commitment to both Sharif Husein and Chaim Weizmann.
Sykes stressed the Entente: &quot;We are pledged to Zionism, Armenianism liberation, and Arabian independence&quot;. On 2 December, Zionists celebrated the Declaration at the Opera House; the news of the Bolshevik Revolution, and withdrawal of Russian troops from the frontier war with Ottoman Empire, raised the pressure from Constantinople. On 11 December, Turkish armies were swept aside when Edmund Allenby&#x27;s troops entered Jerusalem. On 9 January 1918, all Turkish troops withdrew from the Hejaz for a bribe of $2 million to help pay Ottoman Empire&#x27;s debts. Weizmann had seen peace with Ottoman Empire out of the question in July 1917. Lloyd George wanted a separate peace with Ottoman Empire to guarantee relations in the region secure. Weizmann had managed to gain the support of International Jewry in Britain, France and Italy. Schneer postulates that the British government desperate for any wartime advantage were prepared to offer any support among philo-Semites. It was to Weizmann a priority. Weizmann considered that the issuance of the Balfour Declaration was the greatest single achievement of the pre-1948 Zionists. He believed that the Balfour Declaration and the legislation that followed it, such as the (3 June 1922) Churchill White Paper and the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine all represented an astonishing accomplishment for the Zionist movement.
On 3 January 1919, Weizmann met Hashemite Prince Faisal to sign the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement attempting to establish the legitimate existence of the state of Israel. At the end of the month, the Paris Peace Conference decided that the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire should be wholly separated and the newly conceived mandate-system applied to them. Weizmann stated at the conference that the Zionist objective was to &quot;establish such a society in Palestine that Palestine shall be as Jewish as England is English, or America American.&quot; Shortly thereafter, both men made their statements to the conference.

After 1920, he assumed leadership in the World Zionist Organization, creating local branches in Berlin, and serving twice (1920–31, 1935–46) as president of the World Zionist Organization. Unrest amongst Arab antagonism to a Jewish presence in Palestine increased, erupting into riots. Weizmann remained loyal to Britain, tried to shift the blame onto dark forces. The French were commonly blamed for discontent, as scapegoats for Imperial liberalism. Zionists began to believe racism existed within the administration, which remained inadequately policed.

In 1921, Weizmann went along with Albert Einstein for a fundraiser to establish the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and support the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. At this time, simmering differences over competing European and American visions of Zionism, and its funding of development versus political activities, caused Weizmann to clash with Louis Brandeis. In 1921 Weizmann played an important role in supporting Pinhas Rutenberg&#x27;s successful bid to the British for an exclusive electric concession for Palestine, in spite of bitter personal and principled disputes between the two figures.

During the war years, Brandeis headed the precursor of the Zionist Organization of America, leading fund-raising for Jews trapped in Europe and Palestine. In early October 1914, the arrived in Jaffa Harbor with money and supplies provided by Jacob Schiff, the American Jewish Committee, and the Provisional Executive Committee for General Zionist Affairs, then acting for the WZO, which had been rendered impotent by the war. Although Weizmann retained Zionist leadership, the clash led to a departure from Louis Brandeis&#x27;s movement. By 1929, there were about members remaining in the ZOA, a massive decline from the high of reached during the peak Brandeis years. In summer 1930, these two factions and visions of Zionism, would come to a compromise largely on Brandeis&#x27;s terms, with a restructured leadership for the ZOA. An American view is that Weizmann persuaded the British cabinet to support Zionism by presenting the benefits of having a presence in Palestine in preference to the French. Imperial interests on the Suez Canal as well as sympathy after the Holocaust were important factors for British support. Weizmann wrote in 1914:Should Palestine fall within the British sphere of influence, and should Britain encourage a Jewish settlement there, as a British dependency, we could have in 20 to 30 years a million Jews out there ... they would ... form a very effective guard for the Suez Canal.

===Jewish immigration to Palestine===
Jewish immigration was consciously limited by the British administration. Weizmann agreed with the policy but was afraid of the rise of the Nazis. From 1933, there were year-on-year leaps in mass immigration by 50%. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s attempted reassurance on economic grounds in a white paper did little to stabilize Arab-Israeli relations. In 1936 and early 1937, Weizmann addressed the Peel Commission (set up by the returning Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin), whose job it was to consider the working of the British Mandate of Palestine. He insisted that the mandate authorities had not driven home to the Palestinian population that the terms of the mandate would be implemented, using an analogy from another part of the British Empire:
I think it was in Bombay recently, that there had been trouble and the Moslems had been flogged. I am not advocating flogging, but what is the difference between a Moslem in Palestine and a Moslem in Bombay? There they flog them, and here they save their faces. This, interpreted in terms of Moslem mentality, means: &quot;The British are weak; we shall succeed if we make ourselves sufficiently unpleasant. We shall succeed in throwing the Jews into the Mediterranean.&quot;

On 25 November 1936, testifying before the Peel Commission, Weizmann said that there were in Europe Jews &quot;for whom the world is divided into places where they cannot live and places where they cannot enter.&quot; The Commission published a report that, for the first time, recommended partition, but the proposal was declared unworkable and formally rejected by the government. The two main Jewish leaders, Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation. This was the first official mention and declaration of a Zionist vision opting for a possible State with a majority of Jewish population, alongside a State with an Arab majority. The Arab leaders, headed by Haj Amin al-Husseini, rejected the plan.

Weizmann made very clear in his autobiography that the failure of the international Zionist movement (between the wars) to encourage all Jews to act decisively and efficiently in great enough numbers to migrate to the Jerusalem area was the real cause for the call for a Partition deal. A deal on partition was first formally mentioned in 1936 but not finally implemented until 1948. Again, Weizmann blamed the Zionist movement for not being adequate during the best years of the British Mandate.

Ironically, in 1936 Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky prepared the so-called &quot;evacuation plan&quot;, which called for the evacuation of 1.5 million Jews from Poland, the Baltic states, Nazi Germany, Hungary and Romania to Palestine over the span of next ten years. The plan was first proposed on 8 September 1936 in the conservative Polish newspaper &quot;&quot;, the day after Jabotinsky organized a conference where more details of the plan were laid out; the emigration would take 10 years and would include Jews from Poland, with between age of 20–39 leaving the country each year. Jabotinsky stated that his goal was to reduce Jewish population in the countries involved to levels that would make them uninterested in its further reduction.

The same year, he toured Eastern Europe, meeting with the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Józef Beck; the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy; and Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu of Romania to discuss the evacuation plan. The plan gained the approval of all three governments, but caused considerable controversy within the Jewish community of Poland, on the grounds that it played into the hands of anti-Semites. In particular, the fact that the &#x27;evacuation plan&#x27; had the approval of the Polish government was taken by many Polish Jews as indicating Jabotinsky had gained the endorsement of what they considered to be the wrong people.

The evacuation of Jewish communities in Poland, Hungary and Romania was to take place over a ten-year period. However, the British government vetoed it, and the World Zionist Organization&#x27;s chairman, Chaim Weizmann, dismissed it.

Weizmann considered himself, not Ben-Gurion, the political heir to Theodor Herzl. Herzl&#x27;s only grandchild and descendant was Stephen Norman (born Stephan Theodor Neumann, 1918–1946). Dr. H. Rosenblum, the editor of &quot;Haboker&quot;, a Tel Aviv daily that later became &quot;Yediot Aharonot&quot;, noted in late 1945 that Dr. Weizmann deeply resented the sudden intrusion and reception of Norman when he arrived in Britain. Norman spoke to the Zionist conference in London. Haboker reported, &quot;Something similar happened at the Zionist conference in London. The chairman suddenly announced to the meeting that in the hall there was Herzl&#x27;s grandson who wanted to say a few words. The introduction was made in an absolutely dry and official way. It was felt that the chairman looked for—and found—some stylistic formula which would satisfy the visitor without appearing too cordial to anybody among the audience. In spite of that there was a great thrill in the hall when Norman mounted on the platform of the presidium. At that moment, Dr. Weizmann turned his back on the speaker and remained in this bodily and mental attitude until the guest had finished his speech.&quot; The 1945 article went on to note that Norman was snubbed by Weizmann and by some in Israel during his visit because of ego, jealousy, vanity and their own personal ambitions. Brodetsky was Chaim Weizmann&#x27;s principal ally and supporter in Britain. Weizmann secured for Norman a desirable but minor position with the British Economic and Scientific Mission in Washington, D.C.

===Second World War===
On 29 August 1939, Weizmann sent a letter to Neville Chamberlain, stating in part: &quot;I wish to confirm in the most explicit manner the declarations which I and my colleagues have made during the last month and especially in the last week: that the Jews stand by Great Britain and will fight on the side of the democracies.&quot; The letter gave rise to a conspiracy theory, promoted in Nazi propaganda, that he had made a &quot;Jewish declaration of war&quot; against Germany.
At the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, Weizmann was appointed as an honorary adviser to the British Ministry of Supply, using his extensive political expertise in the management of provisioning and supplies throughout the duration of the conflict. He was frequently asked to advise the cabinet and also brief the Prime Minister. Weizmann&#x27;s efforts to integrate Jews from Palestine in the war against Germany resulted in the creation of the Jewish Brigade of the British Army which fought mainly in the Italian front. After the war, he grew embittered by the rise of violence in Palestine and by the terrorist tendencies amongst followers of the Revisionist fraction. His influence within the Zionist movement decreased, yet he remained overwhelmingly influential outside of Mandate Palestine.

In 1942, Weizmann was invited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to work on the problem of synthetic rubber. Weizmann proposed to produce butyl alcohol from maize, then convert it to butylene and further to butadiene, which is a basis for rubber. According to his memoirs, these proposals were barred by the oil companies.

===The Holocaust===
In 1939, a conference was established at St James&#x27;s Palace when the government drew up the May 1939 White Paper which severely curtailed any spending in the Jewish Home Land. Yishuv was put back to the lowest priority. At the outbreak of war the Jewish Agency pledged its support for the British war effort against Nazi Germany. They raised the Jewish Brigade into the British Army, which took years to come to fruition. It authenticated the news of the Holocaust reaching the allies.

In May 1942, the Zionists met at Biltmore Hotel in New York, US; a convention at which Weizmann pressed for a policy of unrestricted immigration into Palestine. A Jewish Commonwealth needed to be established, and latterly Churchill revived his backing for this project.

Weizmann met Churchill on 4 November 1944 to urgently discuss the future of Palestine. Churchill agreed that Partition was preferable for Israel over his White Paper. He also agreed that Israel should annex the Negev desert, where no one was living. However, when Lord Moyne, the British Governor of Palestine, had met Churchill a few days earlier, he was surprised that Churchill had changed his views in two years. On 6 November, Moyne was assassinated for his trenchant views on immigration; the immigration question was put on hold.

In February 1943, the British government also rejected a plan to pay $3.5 million and just $50 per head to allow , mostly Romanian, Jews to be protected and evacuated that Weizmann had suggested to the Americans. In May 1944, the British detained Joel Brand, a Jewish activist from Budapest, who wanted to evacuate 1 million Jews from Hungary on trucks, with tea, coffee, cocoa, and soap. In July 1944, Weizmann pleaded on Brand&#x27;s behalf but to no avail. Rezső Kasztner took over the direct negotiations with Adolf Eichmann to release migrants, but they came to nothing. Weizmann also promoted a plan to bomb the death camps, but the British claimed that this was too risky, dangerous and unfeasible, due to technical difficulties. On 20 September 1945, Weizmann presented the first official documents to the British, USA, France, and Soviets, for the restitution of property, and indemnification. He demanded that all heirless Jewish property should be handed over as part of the reparations for the rehabilitation of Nazi victims.

In his presidential statement at the last Zionist congress that he attended at Basel on 9 December 1946 he said: &quot;Massada, for all its heroism, was a disaster in our history; It is not our purpose or our right to plunge to destruction in order to bequeath a legend of martyrdom to posterity; Zionism was to mark the end of our glorious deaths and the beginning of a new path leading to life.&quot;

==First president of Israel==
Two days after the proclamation of the State of Israel, Weizmann succeeded Ben-Gurion as chairman of the Provisional State Council, a collective presidency that held office until Israel&#x27;s first parliamentary election, in February 1949.

On 2 July 1948, a new kibbutz was founded facing the Golan Heights (Syrian) overlooking the Jordan River, only 5 miles from Syrian territory. Their forces had already seized Kibbutz &quot;Mishmar Ha-Yarden&quot;. The new kibbutz was named (President&#x27;s Village) &quot;Kfar Ha-Nasi&quot;.

When the first Knesset met in 1949, Weizmann was nominated as Mapai&#x27;s candidate for president. The Revisionist Party put forward Prof. Joseph Klausner. Weizmann was elected president by the Knesset on 17 February 1949. On 24 February 1949, Weizmann as president entrusted Ben-Gurion with forming a government. A Coalition was made up of 46 Mapai, 2 Arab Democratic List of Nazareth, 16 of United Religious Front, 5 of Progressive Party, 4 of Sephardi List. Mapam was officially a socialist party with Mapai, but was anti-religious and so remained outside the coalition. On 2 November 1949, the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, the Daniel Sieff Institute, much enlarged and rebuilt, was renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science. The institute was a global success, attracting scientists from all over the Diaspora. In 1949 there were 20 researchers; twenty years later there were 400, and 500 students. Weizmann met with United States President Harry Truman and worked to obtain the support of the United States; they discussed emigration, for the establishment of the State of Israel.

President Weizmann lived at Rehovot, where he regularly received the Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion into his garden. He was denied any actualisation of the political role he had hoped for by the Left, and had to be consoled with the Weizmann Institute&#x27;s successes.

When Weizmann died on 9 November 1952, he was buried at Rehovot. He was acknowledged as a patriot long before Israel had even begun to exist. &quot;The greatest Jewish emissary to the Gentile world...&quot; was one academic verdict.

<text>Clinton Plaza was a thriving but short-lived nightlife district in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sukhumvit Road between Soi 13 and Soi 15. Its location was excellent, being midway between the Nana Entertainment Plaza to the west and the Soi Cowboy nightlife area to the east. 

The plaza, the brainchild of a Dutchman and an American, but then in 1999 was taken over by a New Zealand entrepreneur, began as a collection of beer bars in 1998. The following year it was named after then U.S. President Bill Clinton. A number of lively go-go bars appeared in 2000. Many of the names were tongue in cheek jabs at the president, including &quot;Monica Beer Bar&quot;, &quot;Bill&#x27;s Coffee House&quot; and the &quot;White House&quot;.

In 2001 the Interior Minister of Thailand, Purachai Piumsombun, began a campaign to enforce his ideas of social order. A 01:00 closing hour for all bars and nightclubs was enforced and employment of nude dancers was discouraged. The shortened hours, combined with contractual disputes related to redevelopment plans, led to the complete shut down of the bar area by May 2003. The existing structures were razed and a hotel has since been built on the location.

The Clinton Plaza bars &quot;Checkpoint Charlie&quot; and &quot;Hollywood-a-Go-Go&quot; appear in Jordan Clark&#x27;s 2005 documentary &quot;Falang: Behind Bangkok&#x27;s Smile&quot; which takes a critical view of sex tourism in Thailand.

<text>Exxon Valdez was an oil tanker that gained notoriety after running aground in Prince William Sound, spilling her cargo of crude oil into the sea. On 24 March 1989, while owned by the former Exxon Shipping Company, captained by Joseph Hazelwood and First Mate James Kunkel, and bound for Long Beach, California, the vessel ran aground on the Bligh Reef, resulting in the second largest oil spill in United States history. The size of the spill is estimated to have been . In 1989, the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill was listed as the 54th-largest spill in history.

== Carrier ==
The tanker was over 301 meters long, 51 meters wide, and 26 meters deep (987 ft x 166 ft x 88 ft), with a deadweight of 214,861 long tons and a full-load displacement of 240,291 long tons. The ship was able to transport up to at a sustained speed of , powered by a (31,650 shp) diesel engine. Her hull design was of the single-hull type, constructed by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in San Diego, California. She was a relatively new tanker at the time of the spill, having been delivered to Exxon on 16 December 1986.

== Incident and accidents ==

===Oil spill===
At the time of the spill, &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; was employed to transport crude oil from the Alyeska consortium&#x27;s pipeline terminal in Valdez, Alaska, to the lower 48 states of the United States. At the time it ran aground, the vessel was carrying about of oil. After the spill, the vessel was towed to San Diego arriving on 10 June 1989, and repairs were started on 30 June 1989. Approximately 1,600 tons of steel were removed and replaced that July, totaling US$30 million of repairs to the tanker. Its single-hull design remained unaltered.

The &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill occurred under President George H. W. Bush, whose Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, William K. Reilly, reportedly played a significant role in mobilizing presidential support for action to contain and clean up the spill.

====Litigation====
Litigation was filed on behalf of 38,000 litigants. In 1994, a jury awarded plaintiffs US$287 million in compensatory damages and US$5 billion in punitive damages. Exxon appealed and the Ninth Circuit Court reduced the punitive damages to US$2.5 billion. Exxon then appealed the punitive damages to the Supreme Court which capped the damages to US$507.5 million in June, 2008. On 27 August 2008, Exxon Mobil agreed to pay 75% of the US$507.5 million damages ruling to settle the 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill off Alaska.
In June 2009, a federal ruling ordered Exxon to pay an additional US$480 million in interest on their delayed punitive damage awards.

===Return to service===
After repairs, &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; was renamed &quot;Exxon Mediterranean&quot;, then &quot;SeaRiver Mediterranean&quot; in the early 1990s, when Exxon transferred its shipping business to a new subsidiary company, River Maritime Inc. The name was later shortened to &quot;S/R Mediterranean&quot;, then to simply &quot;Mediterranean&quot; in 2005. Although Exxon tried briefly to return the ship to its North American fleet, it was prohibited by law from returning to Prince William Sound even though her sister ship with the same design, &quot;Exxon Long Beach&quot;, never left that route. It then served in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In 2002, the ship was again removed from service. 

In 2005, it began operating under the Marshall Islands flag of convenience. Since then, European Union regulations have also prevented vessels with single-hull designs such as the Valdez from entering European ports. In early 2008, SeaRiver Maritime, an ExxonMobil subsidiary, sold &quot;Mediterranean&quot; to the Hong Kong–based shipping company, Hong Kong Bloom Shipping Ltd., which renamed the ship, once again, to &quot;Dong Fang Ocean&quot; (), under Panama registry. In 2008, she was refitted and converted from an oil tanker to an ore carrier. Hong Kong Bloom Shipping is a subsidiary of Chinese government-owned company China Ocean Shipping (Group) Corporation (COSCO).

=== Collision with MV &quot;Aali&quot; ===
On 29 November 2010, &quot;Dong Fang Ocean&quot; collided in the South China Sea with the Malta-flagged cargo ship, &quot;Aali&quot;. Both vessels were severely damaged in the incident, and &quot;Aali&quot; was towed to Weihai and &quot;Dong Fang Ocean&quot; was towed to Longyan Port in Shandong.

=== Retirement ===
In March 2012, &quot;Dong Fang Ocean&quot; was purchased by Global Marketing Systems, Inc. for scrap at an estimated US$16 million and sailed under her own power to a ship breaker in Singapore. She changed hands again among scrap merchants (a common occurrence) and was eventually routed to Alang, India, under the ownership of Priya Blue Industries and at some point renamed &quot;Oriental Nicety&quot;. Before being beached, some tried to halt the action, arguing that the vessel was in breach of the Basel Convention. On 30 July 2012, the Supreme Court of India granted permission for the owners of &quot;Oriental Nicety&quot; to beach her on the Gujarat coast to be dismantled. She was then beached at Alang on 2 August 2012.

<text>Viperinae, or viperines, are a subfamily of vipers endemic to Europe, Asia and Africa. They are distinguished by their lack of the heat-sensing pit organs that characterize their sister group, the subfamily Crotalinae. Currently, 13 genera are recognized. Most are tropical and subtropical, although one species, &quot;Vipera berus&quot;, even occurs within the Arctic Circle. Like all vipers, they are venomous.

The common names &quot;pitless vipers&quot;, &quot;true vipers&quot;, &quot;Old World vipers&quot;, and &quot;true adders&quot; all refer to this group.

==Description==
Members of this subfamily range in size from &quot;Bitis schneideri&quot;, which grows to a maximum total length (body and tail) of , to the Gaboon viper, which reaches a maximum total length of over . Most species are terrestrial, but a few, such as those of the genus &quot;Atheris&quot;, are completely arboreal.

Although the heat-sensing pits that characterize the Crotalinae are clearly lacking in the viperines, a supernasal sac with sensory function has been described in a number of species. This sac is an invagination of the skin between the supranasal and nasal scales and is connected to the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The nerve endings here resemble those in the labial pits of boas. The supernasal sac is present in the genera &quot;Daboia&quot;, &quot;Pseudocerastes&quot; and &quot;Causus&quot;, but is especially well developed in the genus &quot;Bitis&quot;. Experiments have shown that strikes are not only guided by visual and chemical cues, but also by heat, with warmer targets being struck more frequently than colder ones.

==Geographic range==
Viperinae are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, but not in Madagascar.

==Reproduction==
Generally, members of this subfamily are ovoviviparous, although a few, such as &quot;Pseudocerastes&quot;, &quot;Cerastes&quot;, and some &quot;Echis&quot; species are oviparous (egg-laying).

==Genera==

==Taxonomy==
Until relatively recently, two other genera were also included in the Viperinae. However, they were eventually considered so distinctive within the Viperidae, that separate subfamilies were created for them:

* Genus &quot;Azemiops&quot; — moved to subfamily &quot;Azemiopinae&quot; by Liem, Marx &amp; Rabb (1971).
* Genus &quot;Causus&quot; — recognition of subfamily &quot;Causinae&quot; was proposed by Groombridge (1987) and further supported by Cadle (1992).

Nevertheless, these groups, together with the genera currently recognized as belonging to the Viperinae, are still often referred to collectively as the true vipers.

Broadley (1996) recognized a new tribe, Atherini, for the genera &quot;Atheris&quot;, &quot;Adenorhinos&quot;, &quot;Montatheris&quot; and &quot;Proatheris&quot;, the type genus for which is &quot;Atheris&quot;.

<text>Rician fading or Ricean fading is a stochastic model for radio propagation anomaly caused by partial cancellation of a radio signal by itself — the signal arrives at the receiver by several different paths (hence exhibiting multipath interference), and at least one of the paths is changing (lengthening or shortening). Rician fading occurs when one of the paths, typically a line of sight signal or some strong reflection signals, is much stronger than the others. In Rician fading, the amplitude gain is characterized by a Rician distribution. 

Rayleigh fading is sometimes considered a special case of Rician fading for when there is no line of sight signal. In such a case, the Rician distribution, which describes the amplitude gain in Rician fading, reduces to a Rayleigh distribution. Rician fading itself is a special case of two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading.

== Channel characterization ==

A Rician fading channel can be described by two parameters. The first one, formula_1, is the ratio between the power in the direct path and the power in the other, scattered, paths:
:formula_2
The second one, formula_3, is the total power from both paths, and acts as a scaling factor to the distribution:
:formula_4

The received signal amplitude (&quot;not&quot; the received signal power) formula_5 is then Rice distributed with the following parameters:
:formula_6
:formula_7
The resulting Probability density function is:
:formula_8
where formula_9 is the 0th order modified Bessel function of the first kind.

<text>HTMS &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; (911) (, meaning &#x27;Sovereign of the Chakri Dynasty&#x27;, the Thai monarchy&#x27;s ruling family) is the flagship of the Royal Thai Navy (RTN), and Thailand&#x27;s first and only aircraft carrier, although the RTN refers to her as an &quot;Offshore Patrol Helicopter Carrier&quot;. Based on the Spanish Navy&#x27;s design and constructed by Spanish shipbuilder Bazán, &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; was ordered in 1992, laid down in 1994, launched in 1996, and commissioned into the RTN in 1997. The ship is the smallest functioning aircraft carrier in the world.

The aircraft carrier was designed to operate an air group of V/STOL fighter aircraft and helicopters, and is fitted with an aircraft ski-jump. Initial intentions were to operate a mixed air group of ex-Spanish AV-8S Matador Harrier V/STOL aircraft and Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters. However, by 1999 it was reported that only one Matador was operational due to parts, training, and fiscal limitations, although three Matadors were spotted on the ship during a show of force after the 29 January 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia. Her entire Matador jet fleet was removed from service in 2006. Although &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; was intended for patrols and force projection in Thai waters, a lack of funding brought on by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis meant the carrier has spent most of her career docked at the Sattahip naval base.

&quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; has been deployed on several disaster relief operations, including in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and in response to separate flooding incidents in late-2010 and early-2011.

==Design==
The original plan was to acquire a vessel from Bremer Vulcan, but the Thai government cancelled this contract on 22 July 1991. A new contract for a larger warship to be constructed at Bazán&#x27;s shipyard in Ferrol, Spain was signed by the Thai and Spanish governments on 27 March 1992. The proposed vessel was based on the design of the Spanish Navy aircraft carrier , which in turn was based on the United States Navy&#x27;s Sea Control Ship concept. The design is formally referred to by the RTN as an &quot;Offshore Patrol Helicopter Carrier&quot;.
&quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; while still operating with Matadors was the smallest aircraft carrier with a fixed wing air group in operation in the world. She displaces at full load. The carrier is long between perpendiculars, and overall. She is wide at the waterline, with a maximum beam of , and a draught of . The warship has a ship&#x27;s company of 62 officers, 393 sailors, and 146 aircrew. Up to 675 additional personnel can be transported, usually from the Royal Thai Marine Corps.

&quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; is propelled by a combined diesel or gas (CODOG) system. Each of the two, five-bladed propellers is connected to a Bazán-MTU 16V1163 TB83 diesel engine (providing , used for cruising speed), and a General Electric LM2500 gas turbine (providing , used to reach top speed for short periods). &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; has a maximum speed of , although she can only reach with the diesels alone. She has a maximum range of with a constant speed of , and at .

===Armament and aircraft===
&quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; is fitted with two .50-caliber machine guns, four 20 mm autocannons and three Matra Sadral sextuple surface-to-air missile launchers firing Mistral missiles. The missile launchers were installed in 2001. The vessel is also fitted for but not with an 8-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system for Sea Sparrow missiles, and four Phalanx close-in weapon systems. The carrier reportedly does not have a functioning anti-aircraft defense system installed.

The carrier was designed to operate an air group of up to six AV-8S Matador V/STOL aircraft, plus four to six S-70B Seahawk helicopters. &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; is also capable of carrying up to fourteen additional helicopters; a mix of Sikorsky Sea King, Sikorsky S-76, and CH-47 Chinook. There is only enough hangar space for ten aircraft.

The Matador was a first-generation export version of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, acquired secondhand from the Spanish Navy in 1997. The nine Spanish aircraft (seven standard versions plus two TAV-8S trainer aircraft) were refurbished by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA firm before delivery. By 1999, only one aircraft was operational, and the RTN was looking for other first-generation Harriers to cannibalize for spares. In 2003, the RTN attempted to acquire several second-generation, ex-Royal Navy Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft from British Aerospace, but the deal did not go ahead. The inoperative Matadors were finally eliminated from service lists in 2006.

The flight deck measures . A 12° ski-jump assists V/STOL aircraft to take off. There are two aircraft lifts, each capable of lifting 20 tons.

===Sensors and countermeasures===
The sensor suite of &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; consists of a Hughes SPS-52C air search radar operating on the E/F band, and two Kelvin-Hughes 1007 navigational radars. There are provisions to install an SPS-64 surface search radar and a hull-mounted sonar, but neither has been fitted as of 2008. Fire control facilities are also yet to be fitted.

The carrier is equipped with four SRBOC decoy launchers, and an SLQ-25 towed decoy.

In April 2012 Saab won a contract to upgrade &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot;″s command and control systems. This will include fitting a 9LV Mk4 command and control system to the ship as well as a Sea Giraffe AMB radar and improved datalinks.

During a network-centric exercise of the Royal Thai Navy in March 2021 networked data links were established between Gripen fighters and HTMS &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot;, and for the first time.

==Construction==

Work on the Thai carrier commenced in October 1993, although it was not until 12 July 1994 that the hull was laid down. &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; was launched on 20 January 1996 by Queen Sirikit. &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; cost US$336 million to build.

Sea trials were conducted from October 1996 to January 1997, the latter part of which was in coordination with the Spanish Navy. This was followed by aviation trials at Rota, Spain. The carrier was handed over on 27 March 1997, when she was commissioned into the RTN. She arrived at Phuket on 4 August 1997 following a 42-day voyage from Spain, and formally entered service on 10 August.

==Role and operational history==
&quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; is the first aircraft carrier to be operated by a Southeast Asian nation. She is assigned to the Third Naval Area Command, and her intended duties include operational support of the RTN&#x27;s amphibious warfare forces, patrols and force projection around Thailand&#x27;s coastline and economic exclusion zone, disaster relief and humanitarian missions and search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. However, at the time the carrier entered service, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis prevented the necessary funding to operate the ship from being available. Consequently, &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; was usually only operational for a single day per month for training, with the rest of the time spent alongside as a &quot;part-time tourist attraction&quot;. The struggles continued for years, but it is increasingly common for her to participate in a maritime exercise or joint forces exercise; these have included PASSEX, CARAT, Guardian Sea and Cobra Gold. She was also sent for a fleet review such as the 2017 International Maritime Review in Singapore.

Between 4 and 7 November 1997, &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; participated in disaster relief operations following the passage of Tropical Storm Linda across the Gulf of Thailand and the Kra Isthmus. The carrier&#x27;s main task was to search for and assist any fishing vessels affected by the storm.

Flooding in the Songkhla Province resulted in the carrier&#x27;s mobilisation in late November 2000. &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; was anchored at an island marina off Songkhla, and used as a base for helicopters and small boats transporting food, supplies and the wounded.

In January 2003 after the burning of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia, she was sent for her only &quot;show of force&quot; type mission to date; as an &quot;insurance&quot; policy for the &quot;Pochentong-1&quot; evacuation plan.

Following an undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean, tsunamis struck multiple regions around the Indian Ocean, including the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. The personnel of &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; were part of a 760-strong response by the Thai military to the disaster. This task force was involved in search-and-rescue around Phuket and the Phi Phi Islands, treatment of wounded and handling of dead and repair work to schools and government facilities.

In November 2010, the ship was involved in flood relief operations following the 2010 Thai floods; anchored off Songkhla Province, relief supplies and food were airlifted to people in the region, while hospital patients were evacuated by the ship&#x27;s helicopters. &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; was sent to Ko Tao in late-March during the 2011 Southern Thailand floods, as the heavy storms causing the flooding had isolated the island, requiring the evacuation of tourists and local citizens.

In 2021 it was reported that &quot;Chakri Naruebet&quot; usually spends only a day each month at sea, though it had recently sailed through the Singapore Strait. The ship is open to tourists when it is docked at its home port.

<text>An MFP (multi-function product/printer/peripheral), multi-functional, all-in-one (AIO), or multi-function device (MFD), is an office machine which incorporates the functionality of multiple devices in one, so as to have a smaller footprint in a home or small business setting (the SOHO market segment), or to provide centralized document management/distribution/production in a large-office setting. A typical MFP may act as a combination of some or all of the following devices: email, fax, photocopier, printer, scanner.

== Types of MFPs ==


MFP manufacturers traditionally divided MFPs into various segments. The segments roughly divided the MFPs according to their speed in pages-per-minute (ppm) and duty-cycle/robustness. However, many manufacturers are beginning to avoid the segment definition for their products, as speed and basic functionality alone do not always differentiate the many features that the devices include. Two color MFPs of a similar speed may end in the same segment, despite having potentially very different feature-sets, and therefore very different prices. From a marketing perspective, the manufacturer of the more expensive MFP would want to differentiate their product as much as possible to justify the price difference, and therefore avoids the segment definition.

Many MFP types, regardless of the category they fall into, also come in a &quot;printer only&quot; variety, which is the same model without the scanner unit included. This can even occur with devices where the scanner unit physically appears highly integrated into the product.

, almost all printer manufacturers offer multifunction printers. They are designed for home, small business, enterprise and commercial use. Naturally, the cost, usability, robustness, throughput, output quality, etc. all vary with the various use cases. However, they all generally do the same functions; Print, Scan, and Photocopy. In the commercial/enterprise area, most MFP have used laser-printer technology, while the personal, SOHO environments, utilize inkjet methods. Typically, inkjet printers have struggled with delivering the performance and color-saturation demanded by enterprise/large business use. However, HP has recently launched a business-grade MFP using inkjet technology. From the 1980&#x27;s to the 2010&#x27;s, multi-function printers often included fax functionality, contemporary with the prevalence of fax machines in office communications.

In any case, instead of rigidly defined segments based on speed, more general definitions based on intended target audience and capabilities are becoming much more common . While the sector lacks formal definitions, it is common agreed amongst MFP manufacturers that the products fall roughly into the following categories:

===All-in-one===
An All-in-one is a small desktop unit, designed for home or home-office use.

These devices focus on scan and print functionality for home use, and may come with bundled software for organising photos, simple OCR and other uses of interest to a home user. An All-in-one will always include the basic functions of Print and Scan, with most also including Copy functionality and a lesser number with Fax capabilities.

In the past, these devices were usually not networked, and were generally connected by USB or Parallel. even inexpensive all-in-one devices support ethernet and/or Wi-Fi connections. In some cases the wireless devices require connection to a host computer by wire (usually USB) to initialize the device, and once initial setup is done, support wireless operations for all the work performed thereafter.

All-in-one devices may have features oriented to home and personal use that are not found in larger devices. These functions include smart card readers, direct connection to digital cameras (e.g. PictBridge technology) and other similar uses.

The print engine of most All-in-one devices is based either on a home desktop inkjet printer, or on a home desktop laser printer. They may be black-and-white or colour capable. Laser models provide a better result for text while inkjet gives a more convincing result for images and they are a cheaper multifunctional.

Some of these devices, like the Hewlett-Packard Photosmart C8180 printer, have a DVD burner and LightScribe functionality where the user could burn DVDs and create an image on a special Lightscribe DVD, or CD using special software like Roxio or Nero AG Software Suite to create the image. To create a Lightscribe image takes about 10 to 25 minutes.

===SOHO MFP===
A large desktop or small freestanding unit, designed for Small Office/Home Office use. Often, the form factor of the MFP (desktop or freestanding) depends on the options added, such as extra paper trays.

Generally a SOHO MFP will have basic Print, Copy, Scan and Fax functionality only, but towards the larger end of the scale, may include simple document storage and retrieval, basic authentication functions and so on, making the higher end of the &quot;SOHO&quot; scale difficult to differentiate from the lower end of the &quot;Office&quot; MFP scale.

SOHO MFPs are usually networked, however may also be connected via USB or, less frequently, parallel. SOHO MFPs may have basic finishing functionality such as duplexing, stapling and hole-punching, however this is rare. In general, document output offset, sorting and collation are standard capabilities.

By comparison to an All-in-one product, a SOHO MFP is more likely to have an automatic document feeder, greater fax capabilities and faster output-performance. Most SOHO MFPs have their history in low-end black and white photocopiers, and the print engine is accordingly based around this type of technology.

===Office MFP===
A mid-sized free-standing unit, designed as a central office system.

These units are usually the most fully featured type of MFP. They include the basic Print, Copy and Scan functions with optional Fax functionality as well as networked document storage with security, authentication using common network user credentials, ability to run custom software (often a manufacturer will supply a Software development kit), advanced network scan destinations such as FTP, WebDAV, Email, SMB and NFS stores, encryption for data transmission and so on.

Office MFPs usually have moderately advanced finishing functions as options such as duplexing, stapling, holepunching, offset modes and booklet-creation.

Office MFPs are almost always networked, however some have optional or standard (but infrequently used) USB and parallel connections.
Most Office MFPs have their history in mid-range photocopiers (both colour and black-and-white), and the print engine is therefore based around this type of technology, however, Hewlett-Packard recently introduced two Office MFPs based on fixed-head inkjet technology.

===Production printing MFP===
A large free-standing unit, designed as a central printing-device or reprographic-department device.

These devices, while far larger and more expensive than Office MFPs, generally do not have all of the advanced network functionality of their smaller relations. They instead concentrate on high-speed, high-quality output, and highly advanced finishing functionality including book creation with cover insertion (including hot-glue binding) and so on. Production printing itself is often further divided into &quot;light&quot; production printing and &quot;heavy&quot; production printing, with the differentiating factor being the speed. A 100ppm device for example, falls into the light production printing category by the standards of most manufacturers.

Because of the focus on printing, while most Production Printing MFPs have a scanner, it is infrequently used and often only has very basic functionality.

There are a variety of different print engines for Production Printing MFPs, however in the &quot;light&quot; end of the Production Printing market, most are based on the large Office MFPs, which themselves are based on photocopier technology as described above.
Production Printing MFPs may also be known as &quot;Print on demand&quot; devices, or &quot;Digital presses&quot;. This latter term can also be used to refer to the print controller controlling the MFP, however.

==Characteristics==
It is useful to consider the features and functions of an MFP before integrating it into a home or office environment. It is possible to have an MFP with almost all of the features and functions listed below, however a typical AIO or SOHO MFP is unlikely to incorporate many of these.

An (incomplete) list of features that an MFP may offer or will vary depending on the MFP under consideration (in any segment):

===Print features/functions===

* Input
** Network print types available (Raw, LPR, IPP, FTP printing, print via email etc.)
** Network, USB, Parallel or other connection types
** PDLs (PostScript, PCL, XPS etc.) and direct interpreters (PDF, TIFF, etc.) supported
** Printer drivers available for different operating systems
* Output
** Ability to print directly to the MFP&#x27;s internal storage function
** Capability of using the MFP&#x27;s finishing functions (see below under Copy features/functions)
** Direct CD/DVD Label Printing (usually only available on some InkJet AIO models)
** Duplex printing capability - Whether the MFP can print on both sides of a sheet of paper without manual intervention by the user
** Paper formats (what kind of paper sizes and stocks the MFP can output)
** Printer technology (e.g. InkJet/Laser/Color Laser)
** Printing speed (typically given in pages per minute or ppm)
** Resolution DPI - this is an important metric for both printing and scanning quality. (Note that print DPI is rarely greater than 600dpi actual. Some MFPs use a system similar to sub-pixel rendering on computer displays to give &quot;enhanced&quot; resolutions of 1200x600 or 1800x600, however it is important to note that this is not a true resolution)

===Scan features/functions===

* Input
** Ability to retrieve a document from internal storage and send it as if it was a new &quot;scan&quot;
** Automatic document feeder (ADF) - this allows multiple sheets of paper to be input without manually placing each piece of paper on the platen glass.
** Duplex scanning capability (depends on the ADF) - Whether the MFP can scan both sides of a sheet of paper without manual intervention by the user.
* Output
** Scan file formats available (e.g. PDF, TIFF, JPEG, XPS, etc.)
** Scan transfer methods available (e.g. FTP, WebDAV, Email, SMB, NFS, TWAIN)
** Security of scanned documents - such as PDF encryption, digital signatures and so on.

===Fax features/functions===
* Answering machine
* Cordless telephone (generally only a consideration for AIO or smaller SOHO products)
* Color Fax capability
* PC Fax send and receive capability
* Sent / Received Faxes Forwarding to E-mail capability (via SMTP)
* TCP/IP Fax methods such as SIP Fax (Fax over IP), Network Fax (via SMTP), Internet Fax and so on

===Copy features/functions===
* Document Finishing capabilities
** Duplex output
** Stapling
*** Single point
*** Staple positioning
*** Two point
** Hole punching
*** International standard ISO 838 2-hole
*** Swedish &quot;triohålning&quot; 4-hole
*** US 3-hole
*** &quot;888&quot; 4-hole
** Folding
*** Cover binding (generally only available on production printing models) - differs from &quot;cover insertion&quot;, in that a cover is physically bound to the book instead of simply placing it around the other pages. Cover binding often uses hot glue to bind the cover to the finished book.
*** Cover insertion for booklets
*** Fold and centre staple (for Booklet pagination)
*** Half fold / crease
*** Tri-fold / Envelope-folding
*** Trimming for folded documents to avoid &quot;creep&quot;
* Document editing modes
** Booklet pagination / &quot;perfect binding&quot; booklet pagination
** Image scaling / rotation
** n-in-one (2 in 1, 4 in 1 etc.)
** Page numbering / text &amp; image stamping / watermarking
* Plus, see items under &quot;Print features/functions&quot; output and &quot;Scan features/functions&quot; input

===Document storage features/functions===
* Documents storage capability the MFP
* Storage (HDD) capacity
* User authentication for the stored document, and any relationship to the user authentication of the MFP (e.g. Network authentication with a server or custom software, internal only, etc.)

===Network features/functions===
* Active Directory or other authentication functionality
* Data encryption
* IPv6 support
* SNMP support - both private and public MIB specifications
* Wireless network capability

===Other features/functions===
* SDK availability and licensing model
* Software - Many MFPs support advanced functionality through third party software such as optical character recognition. In some cases, these software components are not specific to the MFP being used, however it is important to determine this, as in other cases proprietary technologies are used that effectively tie the software to the platform.
* User interface - By their nature, MFPs are complex devices. Many MFPs now include LCD screens and other user interface aids. Generally, AIO and SOHO products contain simple LCD displays, while Office MFPs contain advanced LCD panels resembling a custom computer-like user interface (some MFPs also offer optional keyboard and mouse attachments).

== Internal architecture ==

=== Hardware ===
MFPs, like most external peripherals that are capable of functioning without a computer, are essentially a type of computer themselves. They contain memory, one or more processors, and often some kind of local storage, such as a hard disk drive or flash memory. As mentioned in the Types of MFP section, the physical print engine may be based on several technologies, however most larger MFPs are an evolution of a digital photocopier.

==== Security ====
When disposing of old printers with local storage, one should keep in mind that confidential documents (print, scan, copy jobs) are potentially still unencrypted on the printer&#x27;s local storage and can be undeleted. Crypto-shredding can be a countermeasure.

=== Software ===
MFPs also run a set of instructions from their internal storage, which is comparable to a computer&#x27;s operating system.

Generally, as the size and complexity of an MFP increases, the more like a computer the device becomes. It is uncommon for a small AIO or even a SOHO MFP to use a general purpose operating system, however many larger MFPs run Linux or VxWorks.

Additionally, many print controllers, separate, but integral to the MFP, also run computer operating systems, with Linux and Microsoft Windows (often Windows NT 4.0 Embedded, Windows XP Embedded).

On top of the core operating system and firmware, the MFP will also provide several functions, equivalent to applications or in some cases daemons or services.

These functions may include (amongst many others):
* Bytecode interpreters or virtual machines for internally hosted third party applications
* Image conversion and processing functions
* MFP Panel control for user input
* Network service clients for sending of documents to different destinations
* Network service servers for receiving documents for print or storage
* Raster image processing functions (although, often this task is handled by a separate print controller unit instead)
* Web server for remote management functions

==Software==
Computer systems equipped with the proper software must be able to take advantage of the MFP&#x27;s capabilities, an important requirement to research when considering integrating an MFP with an existing office. Some or all of the following functionality might be provided:

* Device administration and configuration
* Document imaging, such as ad hoc scanning
* Document management such as remote scanning, document type conversion from text to PDF, OCR, etc.
* Document type/paper input mode selection
* Monitoring of print quotas, toner/ink levels etc.

==Software development kits==
In addition to specific software packages, many vendors also provide the ability for the user to develop software to communicate with the MFP through a Software development kit. Different vendors have different licensing models, from completely &quot;closed&quot; proprietary systems (often with large costs involved) to open strategies with no direct cost involved.
An incomplete list of these technologies is:
* Nuance OmniPage
* Canon MEAP (Multifunctional Embedded Application Platform)
* HP Open Extensibility Platform (OXP)
* Konica Minolta OpenAPI
* Lexmark Embedded Solutions Framework (eSF)
* Ricoh’s Device SDK
* Samsung XOA - eXtensible Open Architecture
* Sharp OSA (Open Systems Architecture)
* Toshiba OPA (Open Platform Architecture) 
* Xerox EIP (Extensible Interface Platform)

In general, these technologies fall into one of two technical models - Server based, or MFP internal software.

Server based technologies use a method to communicate information to and from the MFP (often SOAP/XML based), running the operating code on a suitably powered computer on the network. This method has the advantage of being very flexible, in that the software is free to do anything that the developer can make the computer do. The only limit from the MFP itself is the capability of the MFP to display a user interface to the workings of the application. As many of the applications are based around custom printing, scanning and authentication requirements, the MFP manufacturers that use this method gravitate towards these core technologies in the user interface.

MFP internal software, by comparison, has the advantage of not requiring anything outside of the MFP. The software runs within the MFP itself and so even a complete network outage will not disrupt the software from working (unless of course the software requires a network connection for other reasons). MFP internal software is often, but not always, Java based and runs in a Java virtual machine within the MFP. The negative side to this kind of software is usually that it is much more limited in capabilities than Server based systems.

==Manufacturers==
MFP manufacturers/brands include

* Brother
* Canon
* Dell
* Epson
* Hewlett-Packard
* Kodak
* Konica Minolta
* Kyocera
* Lexmark
* Océ (Canon)
* Okidata
* Olivetti
* Panasonic
* Ricoh
* Samsung
* Sharp
* Sindoh
* Toshiba
* Utax
* Xerox
* Infoeglobe

Note that not all of these manufacturers produce all types of MFP - some may only focus on AIO products, whilst others may only focus on Production Printing, while yet more may cover a wider range.

<text>:&quot;See Rotte for the psaltery, or Rotta for the plucked lyre.&quot;

The crwth ( , ), also called a crowd or rote or crotta, is a bowed lyre, a type of stringed instrument, associated particularly with Welsh music, now archaic but once widely played in Europe. Four historical examples have survived and are to be found in St Fagans National Museum of History (Cardiff); National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth); Warrington Museum &amp; Art Gallery; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (US).

==Origin of the name==

The name &quot;&quot; is Welsh, derived from a Proto-Celtic noun &quot;*-&quot; (&quot;round object&quot;) which refers to a swelling or bulging out, a pregnant appearance or a protuberance, and it is speculated that it came to be used for the instrument because of its bulging shape. Other Celtic words for violin also have meanings referring to rounded appearance. In Gaelic, for example, &quot;&quot; can mean &quot;hump&quot; or &quot;hunch&quot; as well as harp or violin. Like several other English loanwords from Welsh, the name is among the few words in the English language in which the letter W alone is used to indicate a vowel.

The traditional English name is crowd (or rote), and the variants &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; are little-used today. In Medieval Latin it is called the &quot;chorus&quot; or &#x27;. The Welsh word &quot;&quot; means a performer on the crwth. The Irish word is &quot;cruit&quot;, although it also was used on occasion to designate certain small harps. The English surnames Crewther, Crowder, Crother and Crowther denote a player of the crowd, as do the Scottish names MacWhirter and MacWhorter.

For this article&#x27;s purposes, &quot;crwth&quot; denotes the modern, or most recent, form of the instrument (see picture).

==History==
The crwth is quite a peculiar, very old instrument, which Aenantius Fortunatus, as early as about 609 A.D, specifies as British (chrotta Britanna canit). The chrotta was originally strung with three, later with six, strings, and was played with a bow. It is quite possible that the chrotta is the oldest bowed instrument and the antecessor to the violin.

A variety of string instruments so designated are thought to have been played in Wales since at least Roman times. Continuous, clear records of the use of &quot;crwth&quot; to denote an instrument of the lyre (or the Byzantine bowed lyre) class date from the 11th century. Medieval instruments somewhat resembling the crwth appear in pictures (first in Continental Europe) as far back as the 11th century, shortly after bowing was first known in the West. In Wales, the crwth long took second place to the harp in the musical hierarchy.

Schlesinger in the &quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; mentioned the crwth in an article about transition of instruments from the lyre to plucked and bowed instruments:
==Physical description and playing technique==

The crwth consists of a fairly simple box construction with a flat, fretless fingerboard and six gut strings, purportedly tuned gg´c´c´´d´d´´. The original report of that tuning (Edward Jones, &quot;Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards&quot;; London: 1784), from which most subsequent others appear to draw their information, uses arbitrary pitch designations for illustrative purposes. Jones also states that the tuning procedure began by tightening the highest string as much as possible without breaking it, subsequently tuning the others to it intervallically. Such was not an uncommon practice in the days before standardized pitch and was, in fact, mentioned in other manuals on string instrument playing.

While Jones&#x27;s report was widely read and used as the basis of a number of subsequent accounts, and therefore today is often considered to be evidence of a standard tuning, it is more likely that a variety of tunings were experimented with and in some cases employed, as was and still is the case with many other string instruments, particularly those within folk cultures. A second tuning, reported by William Bingley (&quot;A Tour Round North Wales&quot;; London: 1800), features the drones tuned in octaves, with the strings over the fingerboard tuned in paired fifths rather than seconds. However this tuning is almost certainly derived from later violin playing and is impractical given that the crwth is equipped with a flat bridge and therefore designed to play all six strings simultaneously.

Traditionally the soundbox, or resonator, and a surmounting yoke in the shape of an inverted U (see picture of player), were carved as a single unit from a block of maple or sycamore. The soundboard, or belly, a separate piece (the upper surface, nearest the strings), was most often made of deal or some other soft wood, and the bridge was usually made of cherry or some other fruitwood. Two soundholes, or circular openings about an inch to an inch and a quarter in diameter, were cut into the soundboard to allow pulsating air from the soundbox to escape and strengthen the tone. The two G strings (to use Jones&#x27;s terminology – see above) ran parallel to the fingerboard, but not over it, so those strings were used as fixed-pitch drones which could be plucked by the player&#x27;s left thumb. The remaining strings, which were tightened and loosened with metal harp wrest-pins and a tuning key or wrench, were usually bowed with a horsehair and wood bow. One characteristic feature of the crwth is that one leg of the bridge goes through a soundhole (see picture of player) and rests on the back of the instrument (the bottom of the soundbox). Although it has been conjectured that this is a primitive attempt at a sound post, or &quot;anima&quot;, something the instrument lacks, it is equally likely that it is designed to take some of the downward pressure of the tightened strings off the soundboard. Since that piece is flat, unbraced, and usually made of soft wood, it is much weaker than the belly of a violin.

All surviving pictures of crwth players show a playing position with the lower end of the crwth braced against the chest, supported with a strap around the player&#x27;s neck (see picture). The sound of the crwth was described by medieval poet Gruffydd ap Dafydd ap Hywel as &#x27;in the hand a hundred voices&#x27; (yn y llaw yn gan llais&#x27;), referring to the rich sound of six strings sounded simultaneously in harmony. Along with the harp and timpan, the six-stringed crwth was one of the three main string instruments of the Welsh according to the medieval Triads, and an instrument of the aristocracy with its own native repertoire and a strict examination system though which a master crwth player had to pass. A three-stringed version also existed which required less skill and was played by minstrels.

The tone of the crwth is softer and rougher than the modern violin, and has a comfortable melody range of an octave by the use of third position, although it is possible to reach an octave and a half by the use of higher positions. It&#x27;s sound that goes well with the timbres of the harp and pibgorn (hornpipe). For all its technical limitations, the crwth has great charm, and is much more than a historical curiosity. Research over about the last thirty-five years, and particularly experimentation with tunings, have shown it to have been much more versatile and facile than was once assumed, although it definitely was not a prototype of modern orchestral bowed string instruments, which emerged from an altogether different branch of the complex string family tree. Historically, it represents the logical end of a line of development, not an early stage of another.

==Welsh legends==

There are a number of legends in Wales related to &quot;Crythor Du&quot; or &quot;The Black (Haired) Crwth Player&quot;, the most notable of which is &quot;Y Crythor Du a&#x27;r Bleiddiaid&quot; or &quot;The Black (Haired) Crwth Player and the Wolves&quot;, where the main character escapes attack from a pack of hungry wolves by playing in turn forcefully, melodiously and gently. Another legend has a player and his servant dying of cold in Beddgelert, noted by Welsh antiquarian Edward Lhuyd. There is also the &quot;Cave of the black crwth player&quot; near Criccieth, which is said to have been the inspiration for the tune &quot;Ffarwél Ned Puw&quot; or &#x27;Farewell Dick the Piper&#x27;.

==Today==
A number of modern reconstructions of the crwth have been made; makers include Guy Flockhart, Nial Cain, Michael J. King, Hank Taylor and Gerard Kilbride. A handful of folk musicians are reviving the tradition of playing this instrument, among them Cass Meurig, who is the best-known modern player and who in 2004 released the album &quot;Crwth&quot;, the world&#x27;s second CD of crwth music, in 2004 on the Fflach:tradd label. (Meurig also plays with the groups Fernhill and Pigyn Clust.) Other musicians include Bob Evans (Bragod), Dan Morris (Cilmeri), and Sedayne. The repertoire of surviving crwth tunes is very small, although many other traditional tunes can be adapted for the instrument and new tunes are being written for it. It is also used by several early music groups, including Cancionero.

<text>The augment is an Indo-European verbal prefix used in Indo-Iranian, Greek, Phrygian, Armenian, and Albanian, to indicate past time. The augment might be either a Proto-Indo-European archaic feature lost elsewhere or a common innovation in those languages. In the oldest attested daughter languages, such as Vedic Sanskrit and early Greek, it is used optionally. The same verb forms when used without the augment are referred to as injunctive forms (because of one of their attested senses).

The augment originally appears to have been a separate word, with the potential meaning of &#x27;there, then&#x27;, which in time got fused to the verb. The augment is &quot;&quot; in PIE (&quot;é-&quot; in Greek, &quot;á-&quot; in Sanskrit) and always bears the accent.

==Greek==
The predominant scholarly view on the prehistory of the augment is that it was originally a separate grammatical particle, although dissenting opinions have occasionally been voiced.

===Homeric Greek===
In Homer, past-tense (aorist or imperfect) verbs appeared both with and without an augment.

===Ancient Greek===
In Ancient Greek, the verb &quot;légo&quot; &quot;I say&quot; has the aorist ἔλεξα &quot;élexa&quot; &quot;I said.&quot; The initial ε &quot;e&quot; is the augment. When it comes before a consonant, it is called the &quot;syllabic augment&quot; because it adds a syllable. Sometimes the syllabic augment appears before a vowel because the initial consonant of the verbal root (usually digamma) was lost:
* *έ-ϝιδον *&quot;é-widon&quot; → (loss of digamma) *ἔιδον *&quot;éidon&quot; → (synaeresis) εἶδον &quot;eîdon&quot;

When the augment is added before a vowel, the augment and the vowel are contracted and the vowel becomes long: ἀκούω &quot;&quot; &quot;I hear&quot;, ἤκουσα &quot;ḗkousa&quot; &quot;I heard&quot;. It is sometimes called the &quot;temporal augment&quot; because it increases the time needed to pronounce the vowel.

===Modern Greek===
Unaccented syllabic augment disappeared in some dialects during the Byzantine period as a result of the loss of unstressed initial syllables, this feature being inherited by Standard Modern Greek. However, accented syllabic augments have remained in place. So Ancient ἔλυσα, ἐλύσαμεν (&quot;élūsa&quot;, &quot;elū́samen&quot;) &quot;I loosened, we loosened&quot; corresponds to Modern έλυσα, λύσαμε (&quot;élisa&quot;, &quot;lísame&quot;). When the stem begins in a vowel, the augment has not survived in the vernacular and the vowel is left unaltered instead: Ancient ἀγαπῶ, ἠγάπησα (&quot;agapô&quot;, &quot;ēgápēsa&quot;) &quot;I love, I loved&quot;; Modern αγαπώ, αγάπησα (&quot;agapó&quot;, &quot;agápisa&quot;).

==Sanskrit==

The augment is used in Sanskrit to form the imperfect, aorist, pluperfect and conditional. When the verb has a prefix, the augment always sits between the prefix and the root. The following examples of verb forms in the third-person singular illustrate the phenomenon:

When the root starts with any of the vowels &quot;i-&quot;, &quot;u-&quot; or &quot;ṛ&quot;, the vowel is subject not to guṇa but vṛddhi.

* icch·á·ti -&gt; aí·cch·a·t
* urṇó·ti -&gt; aú·rṇo·t
* ṛdh·nó·ti -&gt; ā́r·dh·no·t

==Other==
* Phrygian seems to have had an augment. 
* Classical Armenian had an augment, in the form of .
* Yaghnobi, an East Iranian language spoken in Tajikistan, has an augment. 

==Constructed languages==
In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Quenya, the repetition of the first vowel before the perfect (for instance &quot;utúlië&quot;, perfect tense of &quot;túlë&quot;, &quot;come&quot;) is reminiscent of the Indo-European augment in both form and function, and is referred to by the same name in Tolkien&#x27;s grammar of the language.

<text>Peter Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler, (born 2 February 1938) is a British politician who served as a member of both Margaret Thatcher and John Major&#x27;s ministries during the 1980s and 1990s. He held the office of Lord Speaker from 1 September 2016 to 30 April 2021.

After serving as Shadow Minister of Transport, Fowler was appointed Minister of Transport in 1979, being responsible for making seat belts compulsory. Later, as Secretary of State for Social Services, he drew public attention to the dangers of AIDS. He resigned from the cabinet as Employment Secretary, and was knighted in 1990.

Fowler was Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1992 to 1994, Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions from 1997 to 1998, and Shadow Home Secretary from 1998 to 1999. In 2001, he was created a Conservative life peer. He renounced party political allegiance upon taking office as Lord Speaker. On 25 February 2021, he announced that in April he would step down as Lord Speaker to focus on campaigning work, particularly in relation to AIDS.

==Early life==
Fowler was born on 2 February 1938 to Norman Frederick Fowler and Katherine (née Baker). He is an only child. He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford, Essex. After school, he did National Service as a second lieutenant in the Essex Regiment. He then studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge (BA Economics &amp; Law 1961). He was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association in Michaelmas 1960, in which term he entertained both the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Rab Butler. Following university, became a journalist, and worked at &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Member of Parliament==
Fowler, who had aspired to become an MP since childhood, was elected for Nottingham South in 1970; after the seat was abolished, he switched to Sutton Coldfield at the February 1974 election.

===In opposition===
During the mid-1970s, Mr. Fowler was Shadow Minister of Transport. In April 1976, he was photographed outside the Palace of Westminster having just taken delivery of his third four-cylinder MG MGB GT – he had reportedly rejected the idea of buying a V8 version on account of the cost.

===In government===
Upon Margaret Thatcher becoming Prime Minister in 1979, she did not immediately appoint Fowler to her Cabinet, explaining: &quot;we were short of one place. As a result, Norman Fowler, as Minister of State at Transport, was not able to be an official member of the Cabinet, although he attended all our meetings.&quot;

As Secretary of State for Transport, Fowler drove through Lord Nugent&#x27;s 1981 bill to make seat belts compulsory, a law that came into force in 1983.

As Secretary of State for Social Services in 1986, Fowler implemented the first official drive to educate the British public to the dangers of AIDS. Under his tenure, awareness about how the disease was spread was transmitted through posters, newspaper advertisements, and television campaigns. The main campaign &quot;Don&#x27;t Die of Ignorance&quot; included mailing a leaflet to 23 million homes. By 1987 a Gallup Poll showed that 98% of the public was aware of how HIV was transmitted, and the vast majority supported Fowler&#x27;s campaign. By 1990 infection rates in the UK were below those of peer nations, including France and the US.

Some Conservatives, including Thatcher herself, objected to the frank content of these messages, which contained material about needle usage and intravenous drugs, as well as discussions about the risks of unprotected sex. During this time, Thatcher told Fowler that she felt he had become known as the &quot;minister for Aids&quot;, and she disapproved of this. The following year, she moved him to the role of Secretary of State for Employment.

===Backbenches, retirement and Shadow Cabinet===
Fowler later resigned from the Cabinet in January 1990. He later claimed that he was the first politician to cite a desire to spend more time with family as the reason for leaving office. The phrase has been reused by many others as a reason for a resignation, and is often treated as insincere or euphemistic, though Fowler has said he was being literal, as he worried he was growing distant from his young children.

Following his resignation from the frontbench, Fowler was knighted in 1990.

Fowler then returned twice to front-line politics, first as Chairman of the Conservative Party (as a backbencher in Parliament) from 1992 to 1994, during which time he oversaw the parliamentary boundary changes of the early 1990s; then on the Conservative front bench as Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions (1997–98) and finally as Shadow Home Secretary (1998–99).

In 2001, Fowler stepped down as a Member of Parliament.

==House of Lords==

After standing down from the House of Commons, he entered the House of Lords, sitting on the Conservative benches as Baron Fowler, &quot;of Sutton Coldfield, in the County of West Midlands&quot;. He had first been offered a peerage in 1989.

In 2003, Lord Fowler proposed that the European Union should appoint a high-level coordinator with ambassadorial rank to deal with the AIDS epidemic.

In 2006, Fowler chaired a House of Lords select committee which criticised the use of the television licence fee, which is used to fund the BBC.

His book &quot;A Political Suicide&quot; (Politico&#x27;s Publishing ) was published in 2008, and was shortlisted for the Channel 4 Political Book of the Year Award.

In May 2013, Fowler gave his support to legislation aiming to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples, stating: &quot;Parliament should value people equally in the law, and that enabling same-sex couples to marry removes the current inequity.&quot;

He was elected as Lord Speaker in 2016. He is the third person and first man to hold the office since it was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Fowler has stated that he favours reducing the House of Lords to 600 members.

On 19 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic he announced that he would be withdrawing from Westminster and remote working, with deputy speakers taking over his role in the House of Lords, but he returned in July to continue his role.

On 25 February 2021, Fowler announced that he would be stepping down ahead of the introduction of a series of structural and organisational changes and announced that it would be best if those changes were &quot;seen through by the team who will be implementing them&quot;. He also stated his desire to stand down in order to &quot;speak his mind&quot; as an independent member of the House of Lords on issues he has campaigned for, in particular LGBT rights in the United Kingdom and HIV and AIDS. In March 2021, Fowler backed calls for the UK&#x27;s first ever national AIDS memorial, with the aim of fighting stigma and discrimination against those with HIV and AIDS.

==Private sector==
Lord Fowler has served on the board of directors of several companies and is non-executive chairman of Aggregate Industries plc. He is a member of the National Union of Journalists.

==Personal life==
After a previous marriage ended in divorce, Fowler married Fiona Poole, a library clerk at the House of Commons, in 1979. They had two daughters, and Fowler became a stepfather to his wife&#x27;s son from her prior marriage.

, Fowler lives in Fulham, London.

<text>Lydian is an extinct Indo-European Anatolian language spoken in the region of Lydia, in western Anatolia (now in Turkey). The language is attested in graffiti and in coin legends from the late 8th century or the early 7th century to the 3rd century BCE, but well-preserved inscriptions of significant length are so far limited to the 5th century and the 4th century BCE, during the period of Persian domination. Thus, Lydian texts are effectively contemporaneous with those in Lycian.

Strabo mentions that around his time (1st century BCE), the Lydian language was no longer spoken in Lydia proper but was still being spoken among the multicultural population of Kibyra (now Gölhisar) in southwestern Anatolia, by the descendants of the Lydian colonists, who had founded the city.

== Text corpus and decipherment ==

In 1916 the Sardis bilingual inscription, a bilingual inscription in Aramaic and Lydian allowed Enno Littmann to decipher the Lydian language. From an analysis of the two parallel texts, he identified the alphabetic signs, most of them correctly, established a basic vocabulary, attempted translation of a dozen unilingual texts, gave an outline of Lydian grammar, and even recognized peculiar poetical characteristics in several texts. Eight years later William Hepburn Buckler presented a collection of 51 inscriptions then known. The 109 inscriptions known by 1986 have been treated comprehensively by Roberto Gusmani; new texts keep being found from time to time.

All but a few of the extant Lydian texts have been found in or near Sardis, the Lydian capital, but fewer than 30 of the inscriptions consist of more than a few words or are reasonably complete. Most of the inscriptions are on marble or stone and are sepulchral in content, but several are decrees of one sort or another, and some half-dozen texts seem to be in verse, with a stress-based meter and vowel assonance at the end of the line. Tomb inscriptions include many epitaphs, which typically begin with the words 𐤤𐤮 𐤥𐤵𐤫𐤠𐤮 &quot;es wãnas&quot; (&quot;this grave&quot;). The short texts are mostly graffiti, coin legends, seals, potter&#x27;s marks, and the like. The language of the Ionian Greek poet Hipponax (sixth century BCE, born at Ephesus) is interspersed with Lydian words, many of them from popular slang.

Lydian can be officially studied at Marburg University, Germany, within the Hittitology minor program.

== Classification ==
Within the Anatolian group, Lydian occupies a unique and problematic position. One reason is the still very limited evidence and understanding of the language. Another reason is a number of features that are not shared with any other Anatolian language. It is still not known whether those differences represent developments peculiar to pre-Lydian or the retention in Lydian of archaic features that were lost in the other Anatolian languages. Until more satisfactory knowledge becomes available, the status of Lydian within Anatolian remains a &quot;special&quot; one.

==Writing system==

The Lydian script, which is strictly alphabetic, consists of 26 signs:
The script is related to or derived from that of Greek as well as its western Anatolian neighbours, the exact relationship still remaining unclear. The direction of writing in the older texts is either from left to right or right to left. Later texts show exclusively the latter. Use of word-dividers is variable. The texts were found chiefly at the ancient capital of Sardis and include decrees and epitaphs, some of which were composed in verse; most were written during the 5th century and the 4th century BCE, but a few may have been created as early as the 7th century.

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

Lydian has seven vowels: 𐤠 a, 𐤤 e, 𐤦 i, 𐤬 o, 𐤰 u, 𐤵 ã, and 𐤶 ẽ, the last two being nasal vowels, typically before a (synchronic or diachronic) nasal consonant (like n, ñ or m). The vowels e, o, ã, and ẽ occur only when accented. A vowel or glide 𐤧 y appears rarely, only in the oldest inscriptions, and probably indicates an allophone of i or e that is perhaps unstressed.

Lydian is notable for its extensive consonant clusters, which resulted from the loss of word-final short vowels, together with massive syncope; there may have been an unwritten [ə] in such sequences.

=== Consonants ===
(Note: until recently the Buckler (1924) transliteration scheme was often used, which may lead to confusion. This older system wrote v, ν, s, and ś, instead of today&#x27;s w (𐤥), ñ (𐤸), š (𐤳), and s (𐤮). The modern system renders the sibilants more naturally and prevents confusion between v (= w 𐤥) and the Greek nu symbol ν (= ñ 𐤸).)

Voicing was likely not distinctive in Lydian. However /p t k/ are voiced before nasals and apparently before /r/. The palatal affricate (τ) and sibilant (š) may have been palato-alveolar.

It has now been argued that the laterals l and λ are actually flaps.

The sign 𐤣 has traditionally been transliterated d and interpreted as an interdental /ð/ resulting from the sound change *i̯ &gt; ð or the lenition of Proto-Anatolian *t. However, it has recently been argued that in all contexts d in fact represents the palatal glide /j/, previously considered absent from Lydian. An interdental /ð/ would stand as the only interdental sound in Lydian phonology, whereas a palatal interpretation of d is complemented by a full series of other palatal consonants: λ, š, ñ, and τ.

Lydian, with its many palatal and nasal sounds, must have sounded quite strange to the ears of ancient Greeks, and transcription of Lydian names into Greek would therefore present some difficulties. Recently a case has been made that the Lydian word Qλdãns, pronounced /kʷɾʲ&#x27;ðãns/, both meaning &#x27;king&#x27; and the name of a god, could correspond to the Greek Κροῖσος, or Croesus, the last Lydian king, whose kingdom was conquered by the Persians. If the identification is correct it would have the interesting historical consequence that king Croesus was not saved from being burnt at the stake, as Herodotus tells us, but chose suicide and was subsequently deified.

=== Stress ===
Heiner Eichner developed rules to determine which syllable in a word has the stress accent. In short, the rules are:
* Syllables with vowel &quot;-ã-, -ẽ-, -e-, -o-, -aa-&quot;, and &quot;-ii-&quot; always have stress. Syllables with &quot;-i- (-y-), -a-&quot; or &quot;-u-&quot; may be accented or unaccented.
* Enclitics (-añ-, -in-, -it-, etc.) never have stress.
* Prefixes, even those with a long vowel (ẽn-, ẽt-), do not have stress.
* An &quot;-a-&quot; before a nasal (m, n, ñ) never has stress.
* In consonant clusters syllabic liquidae (l, λ, r), nasals (m, n, ñ) and sibilants (s, š) do not have stress.
* Within a declension or conjugation stress does not move from one syllable to another.
A useful application of those rules is the investigation of metres in Lydian poetry.

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
Nouns and adjectives distinguish singular and plural forms. Words in the texts are predominantly singular. Plural forms are scarce, and a dual has not been found in Lydian. There are two genders: animate (or &#x27;common&#x27;) and inanimate (or &#x27;neuter&#x27;). Only three cases are securely attested: nominative, accusative, and dative-locative. A genitive case seems to be present in the plural, but in the singular usually a so-called possessive is used instead, which is similar to the Luwic languages: a suffix -li is added to the root of a substantive, and thus an adjective is formed that is declined in turn. However, recently it has been defended that a form ending in -l, formerly thought to be an &quot;endingless&quot; variant of the possessive, was indeed a genitive singular. Of an ablative case there are only a few uncertain examples.

Nouns, adjectives, and pronomina are all declined according to a similar paradigm:

===Verbs===
Just as in other Anatolian languages verbs in Lydian were conjugated in the present-future and preterite tenses with three persons singular and plural. Imperative or gerundive forms have not been found yet. Singular forms are often hard to distinguish from plural forms in the third person present active (both ending in &quot;-t/-d&quot;): the plural form seems to be in principle nasalized, but this could not always be expressed in the writing.

Lydian distinguished a mediopassive voice with the third-person singular ending &quot;-t(a)λ&quot; or &quot;-daλ&quot; (derived from Proto-Anatolian *-tori; &quot;-t(a)λ&quot; after consonant stems and part of the stems ending in a vowel, &quot;-daλ&quot; when lenited after other stems ending in a vowel or glide).

About a dozen conjugations can be distinguished, on the basis of (1) the verbal root ending (&quot;a&quot;-stems, consonant stems, -&quot;ši&quot;-stems, etc.), and (2) the endings of the third person singular being either unlenited (&quot;-t; -tλ, -taλ&quot;) or lenited (&quot;-d; -dλ, -daλ&quot;). For example, &quot;šarpta-&quot;(t) (to inscribe, to carve) is an unlenited &quot;a&quot;-stem (&quot;šarptat&quot;, he inscribes), &quot;qaλmλa-&quot;(d) (to be king) is a lenited &quot;a&quot;-stem (&quot;qaλmλad&quot;, he rules). Differences between the various conjugations are minor.

Many Lydian verbs are composite, using prefixes such as &quot;ẽn-&quot; (= &#x27;in-&#x27;?), &quot;ẽt-&quot; (= &#x27;into-&#x27;), &quot;fa-/f-&quot; (&#x27;then, subsequently, again&#x27;?), &quot;šaw-,&quot; and &quot;kat-/kaτ-&quot; (= &#x27;down-&#x27;?), and suffixes like &quot;-ãn-/-ẽn-&quot; (durative?), &quot;-no-/-ño-&quot; (causative?), &quot;-ši-&quot; (iterative?), and &quot;-ki-&quot; or &quot;-ti-&quot; (denominative?); their meaning is often difficult to determine.

Examples of verbal conjugation:

=== Particles ===
To emphasize where an important next part of a sentence begins, Lydian uses a series of enclitic particles that can be affixed to a pivotal word. Examples of such &quot;emphatic&quot; enclitics are -in-, -it-/-iτ-, -t-/-τ-, -at-, and -m-/-um-. When stacked and combined with other suffixes (such as pronomina, or the suffix -k = &#x27;and&#x27;) veritable clusters are formed. The word ak = &#x27;so..., so if...&#x27; provides many examples:
: akτin (= ak-τ-in) - &#x27;so...&#x27;, &#x27;so if...&#x27;, &#x27;yea, if...&#x27;
: akmsin (= ak-m-s-in) - &#x27;so if he...&#x27; (-s- = &#x27;he&#x27;), or (= ak-ms-in) - &#x27;so if to them...&#x27; (-ms- = &#x27;to them&#x27;)
: akmλt (= ak-m-λ-t) - &#x27;so if to him...&#x27; (-λ- = &#x27;to him&#x27;); etc.

==Syntax==
The basic word order is subject-object-verb, but constituents may be extraposed to the right of the verb. Like other Anatolian languages, Lydian features clause-initial particles with enclitic pronouns attached in a chain. It also has a number of preverbs and at least one postposition. Modifiers of a noun normally precede it.

==Sample text and vocabulary==

=== The Lydian bilingual ===
In May 1912 American excavators at the Sardis necropolis discovered a bilingual inscription in Lydian and Aramaic. Being among the first texts found, it provided a limited equivalent of the Rosetta Stone and permitted a first understanding of the Lydian language.

The first line of the Lydian text has been destroyed, but can be reconstructed from its Aramaic counterpart.

=== Vocabulary ===
Examples of words in the bilingual:
: 𐤬𐤭𐤠 – ora – month; cf. Greek ὥρα (season, year, moment), Latin hora (hour), English hour
: 𐤩𐤠𐤲𐤭𐤦𐤳𐤠 – laqriša – wall, walls (traditional translation); letters, inscription (?)
: 𐤡𐤦𐤭𐤠 – pira – house; cf. Hitt. pēr/parn- &#x27;house&#x27;
: 𐤲𐤦𐤭𐤠 – qira – field, ground, immovable property
: 𐤨 – -k (suffix) – and; cf. Greek τε, Latin -que = and

Other words with Indo-European roots and with modern cognates:
: 𐤲𐤦𐤳 – qiš – who; cf. Greek τίς, Latin quis, French qui
: 𐤡𐤭𐤠𐤱𐤭𐤮 – prafrs – community, brotherhood; cf. Latin frater, English brother, French frère
: 𐤹𐤦𐤥𐤳 – ciwš – god; cf. Greek Ζεύς, Latin deus, French dieu (god)
: 𐤠𐤷𐤠𐤮 – aλas – other; cf. Greek ἄλλος (other; is an element in words such as allogamy, allomorph, allopathy, allotropy), Latin alius (other), alter (another, the other one, second), French autre

Only a small fraction of the Lydian vocabulary is clearly of Indo-European stock. Gusmani provides lists of words that have been linked to Hittite, various other Indo-European languages, and Etruscan.

===Lydian words still in use===

Labrys (Greek: λάβρυς, lábrys) is the term for a symmetrical double-bitted axe originally from Crete in Greece, one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization. The priests at Delphi in classical Greece were called Labryades (the men of the double axe). 
The term &quot;labrys&quot; &quot;double-axe&quot; is not found in any surviving Lydian inscription, but on the subject, Plutarch states that &quot;the Lydians call the axe &quot;labrys&quot;&quot; (Λυδοὶ γὰρ ‘λάβρυν’ τὸν πέλεκυν ὀνομάζουσι).

Another possibly Lydian loanword may be &quot;tyrant&quot; &quot;absolute ruler&quot;, which was first used in Ancient Greek sources, without negative connotations, for the late 8th century or early 7th century BCE. It is possibly derived from the native town of King Gyges of Lydia, founder of the Mermnad dynasty, which was Tyrrha in classical antiquity and is now Tire, Turkey. Yet another is the element molybdenum, borrowed from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, &quot;lead&quot;, from Mycenaean Greek &quot;mo-ri-wo-do&quot;, which in Lydian was &quot;mariwda-&quot; &quot;dark&quot;.
All of those loanwords confirm a strong cultural interaction between the Lydians and the Greeks since the Creto-Mycenaean era (2nd millennium BCE).

== Lydian poetry ==
In his seminal decipherment of Lydian texts Littmann noted that at least five of them show two poetical aspects:

* First, assonance: all lines have the same vocal (o, or a, or i) in the last syllable. One of the longest inscriptions, 19 lines, has in each line an o in the last syllable. Littmann sensationally labeled these assonances &quot;the earliest rhyme in the history of human literature&quot;, though the word &#x27;rhyme&#x27; is slightly misleading because the consonants in the last syllables do vary (&quot;... factot / ... tasok / ... arktoλ&quot;, etc.).
* Secondly, the poetic texts apparently show a metre: lines have twelve (sometimes eleven or ten) syllables with a caesura before the fifth or sixth syllable from the end. The twelve-syllable lines often sound like anapestic tetrameters.

Also, partly in order to achieve assonance and metre (&quot;metri causa&quot;), in poetic texts word order is more free than in prose.

Martin West, after comparing historical metres in various Indo-European languages, concluded that the Lydian metres seem to be compatible with reconstructed common Proto-Indo-European metres. The Lydians probably borrowed these metres from the Greeks; however, the assonance was a unique innovation of their own.

Only one text shows mixed character: a poetical middle part is sandwiched in between a prose introduction and a prose conclusion. Analogous to the bilingual text the introduction tells who built the monument (a certain Karos), and for whom (both his son and his ancestors), while the final sentence of the original inscription may be the usual curse for those who would dare to damage it. The poetic middle part seems to claim that the monument was built after consulting a divine oracle, cited between Lydian &quot;quotation marks&quot; ▷...▷, and continues with an appeal to pay as much respect to the builder as to the venerable forefathers.

It is remarkable that clear examples of rhyme (like the stock expression &quot;aaraλ piraλ-k&quot;, &#x27;house and yard&#x27;, cf. German &#x27;Haus und Hof&#x27;) and alliteration (&quot;kλidaλ kofuλ-k qiraλ qelλ-k&quot;, &#x27;land and water, property and estate&#x27;) are absent in the poetical texts, but do occur in the prose bilingual.

<text>The Lycian language ( ) was the language of the ancient Lycians who occupied the Anatolian region known during the Iron Age as Lycia. Most texts date back to the fifth and fourth century BC. Two languages are known as Lycian: regular Lycian or Lycian A, and Lycian B or Milyan.
Lycian became extinct around the beginning of the first century BC, replaced by the Ancient Greek language during the Hellenization of Anatolia. Lycian had its own alphabet, which was closely related to the Greek alphabet but included at least one character borrowed from Carian as well as characters proper to the language. The words were often separated by two points.

==Area==
Lycia covered the region lying between the modern cities of Antalya and Fethiye in southern Turkey, especially the mountainous headland between Fethiye Bay and the Gulf of Antalya. The &quot;Lukka&quot;, as they were referred to in ancient Egyptian sources, which mention them among the Sea Peoples, probably also inhabited the region called Lycaonia, located along the next headland to the east, also mountainous, between the modern cities of Antalya and Mersin.

== Discovery and decipherment ==

From the late eighteenth century Western European travellers began to visit Asia Minor to deepen their acquaintance with the worlds of Homer and the New Testament. In southwest Asia Minor (Lycia) they discovered inscriptions in an unknown script. The first four texts were published in 1820, and within months French Orientalist Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin used a bilingual showing individuals&#x27; names in Greek and Lycian as a key to transliterate the Lycian alphabet and determine the meaning of a few words. During the next century the number of texts increased, especially from the 1880s when Austrian expeditions systematically combed through the region. However, attempts to translate any but the most simple texts had to remain speculative, although combinatorial analysis of the texts cleared up some grammatical aspects of the language. The only substantial text with a Greek counterpart, the Xanthos stele, was hardly helpful because the Lycian text was quite heavily damaged, and worse, its Greek text does not anywhere come near to a close parallel.

It was only after the decipherment of Hittite, by Bedřich Hrozný in 1917, that a language became known that was closely related to Lycian and could help etymological interpretations of the Lycian vocabulary. A next leap forward could be made with the discovery in 1973 of the Letoon trilingual in Lycian, Greek and Aramaic. Though much remains unclear, comprehensive dictionaries of Lycian have been composed since by Craig Melchert and Günter Neumann.

==Sources==
Lycian is known from these sources, some of them fairly extensive:
* 172 inscriptions on stone in the Lycian script dating from the 5th and 4th century BC (until ca. 330 BC). They include:
** The Xanthus stele. The inscribed upper part of a tomb at Xanthos, called the Xanthus Stele or the Xanthus Obelisk. A Lycian A inscription covers the south, east and part of the north faces. The north side also contains a 12 line poem in Greek and additional text, found mainly on the west side, in Milyan. Milyan appears only there and on a tomb in Antiphellos. The total number of lines on the stele is 255, including 138 in Lycian A, 12 in Greek, and 105 in Milyan.
** The Letoon trilingual, in Lycian A, Greek and Aramaic.
** 150 burial instructions carved on rock tombs.
** 20 votive or dedicatory inscriptions.
* About 100 inscriptions on coins minted at Xanthus from the reign of Kuprili, 485-440 BC, to the reign of Pericle, 380-360 BC.
* Personal and place names in Greek.

==Sample text==

A Lycian epitaph (shown right): 

Transliteration: Ebẽñnẽ prñnawu mẽn e prñnawatẽ hanadaza hrppi ladi ehbi setideime.

Translation: Hanadaza built this building for his wife and sons.

== Lycian alphabet ==

The Lycian alphabet consists of about 29 signs, many of them reminiscent of the Greek alphabet:

==Classification==

Lycian was an Indo-European language, one in the Luwian subgroup of Anatolian languages. A number of principal features help identify Lycian as being in the Luwian group:
* Assibilation of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) palatals (&quot;satem&quot; change): &quot;*h₁éḱwos&quot; to Luwian &quot;á-zú-wa/i-&quot;, Lycian &quot;esbe&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;.
* Replacement of genitive case with adjectives ending in &quot;-ahi&quot; or &quot;-ehi&quot;, Luwian &quot;-assi-&quot;.
* A preterite active formed with PIE secondary middle endings:
**PIE &quot;*-to&quot; to Luwian &quot;-ta&quot;, Lycian &quot;-te&quot; or &quot;-de&quot; in the third person singular
**PIE &quot;*-nto&quot; to Luwian &quot;-nta&quot;, Lycian &quot;-(n)te&quot; in the third person plural
* Similarity of words: Luwian &quot;māssan(i)-&quot;, Lycian &quot;māhān(i)&quot; &#x27;god&#x27;.

The Luwian subgroup also includes cuneiform and hieroglyphic Luwian, Carian, Sidetic, Milyan and Pisidic. The pre-alphabetic forms of Luwian extended back into the Late Bronze Age and preceded the fall of the Hittite Empire. These vanished at about the time of the Neo-Hittite states in southern Anatolia (and Syria); thus, the Iron Age members of the subgroup are localized daughter languages of Luwian.

Of the Luwic languages, only the Luwian parent language is attested prior to 1000 BC, so it is unknown when the classical-era dialects diverged. Whether the Lukka people always resided in southern Anatolia or whether they always spoke Luwian are different topics.

From the inscriptions, scholars have identified at least two languages that were termed &quot;Lycian&quot;. One is considered standard Lycian, also termed Lycian A; the other, which is attested on side D of the Xanthos stele, is Milyan or Lycian B, separated by its grammatical particularities.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
=== Consonants ===
*Melchert reconstructs // for , // for , // for and // for . Kloekhorst instead proposes // for , // for , // for and // for .
* alternates with and represents a transitional sound between // and //. Based on this, Melchert suggested a phonetic value [] for but later retracted this view.
*Lycian stops (represented by , , , , , , and possibly ) are voiced when after nasal consonants and voiceless otherwise.
*Nasal and liquid sounds can also occur as syllabic , and with being written as &quot;m̃&quot; and &quot;ñ&quot; respectively.

== Grammar ==
=== Nouns ===
Nouns and adjectives distinguish singular and plural forms. A dual has not been found in Lycian. There are two genders: animate (or &#x27;common&#x27;) and inanimate (or &#x27;neuter&#x27;). Instead of the genitive singular case normally a so-called possessive (or &quot;genitival adjective&quot;) is used, as is common practice in the Luwic languages: a suffix -(e)h- is added to the root of a substantive, and thus an adjective is formed that is declined in turn.

Nouns can be divided in five declension groups: &quot;a&quot;-stems, &quot;e&quot;-stems, &quot;i&quot;-stems, consonant stems, and mixed stems; the differences between the groups are very minor. The declension of nouns goes as follows:


=== Pronouns ===
==== Demonstrative pronoun ====
The paradigm for the demonstrative pronoun &quot;ebe&quot;, &quot;this&quot; is:

==== Personal pronoun ====
The demonstrative &quot;ebe&quot;, &#x27;this&#x27;, is also used as a personal pronoun: &#x27;this one&#x27;, therefore &#x27;he, she, it&#x27;. Here is a paradigm of all attested personal pronouns:
==== Other pronouns ====
Other pronouns are:
* Relative or interrogative pronouns: &quot;ti-&quot;, &#x27;who, which&#x27;; &quot;teri&quot; or &quot;ẽke&quot;, &#x27;when&#x27;; &quot;teli&quot;, &#x27;where&#x27;; &quot;km̃mẽt(i)-&quot;, &#x27;how many&#x27; (also indefinite: &#x27;however many&#x27;).

* Indefinite pronouns: &quot;tike-&quot;, &#x27;someone, something&#x27;; &quot;tise&quot;, &#x27;anyone, anything&#x27;; &quot;tihe&quot;, &#x27;any&#x27;.

* Reflexive pronoun: &quot;-ti&quot; (suffixed), &#x27;himself&#x27;.

=== Numerals ===
The following numerals are attested:

=== Verbs ===
Just as in other Anatolian languages (Luwian, Lydian) verbs in Lycian were conjugated in the present-future and preterite tenses and in the imperative with three persons singular and plural. Some endings have many variants, due to nasalization (&quot;-a- → -añ-, -ã-; -e- → -eñ-, -ẽ-&quot;), lenition (&quot;-t- → -d-&quot;), gemination (&quot;-t- → -tt-; -d- → -dd-&quot;), and vowel harmonization (&quot;-a- → -e-&quot;: &quot;prñnawãtẽ → prñnewãtẽ&quot;).

About a dozen conjugations can be distinguished, on the basis of (1) the verbal root ending (&quot;a&quot;-stems, consonant stems, &quot;-ije&quot;-stems, etc.), and (2) the endings of the third person singular being either unlenited (present &quot;-ti&quot;; preterite &quot;-te&quot;; imperative &quot;-tu&quot;) or lenited (&quot;-di&quot;; &quot;-de&quot;; &quot;-du&quot;). For example, &quot;prñnawa-&quot;(ti) (to build) is an unlenited &quot;a&quot;-stem (&quot;prñnawati&quot;, he builds), &quot;a(i)-&quot;(di) (to make) is a lenited &quot;a(i)&quot;-stem (&quot;adi&quot;, he makes). Differences between the various conjugations are minor. 

Verbs are conjugated as follows; Mediopassive &quot;(MP)&quot; forms are in brown:

A suffix -s- (cognate with Greek, Latin -/sk/-), appended to the stem and attested with half a dozen verbs, is thought to make a verb iterative:
: stem &quot;a(i)-&quot;, &#x27;to do, to make&#x27;, &quot;s&quot;-stem &quot;as-&quot;; (Preterite 3 Singular:) &quot;ade, adẽ&quot;, &#x27;he did, made&#x27;, &quot;astte&quot;, &#x27;he always did, has made repeatedly&#x27;;
: stem &quot;tuwe-&quot;, &#x27;to erect, place (upright)&#x27;, &quot;s&quot;-stem &quot;tus-&quot;; (Present/future 3 Plural:) &quot;tuwẽti&quot;, &#x27;they erect&#x27;, &quot;tusñti &quot;, &#x27;they will erect repeatedly&#x27;.

=== Syntax ===
Emmanuel Laroche, who analysed the Lycian text of the Letoon trilingual, concluded that word order in Lycian is slightly more free than in the other Anatolian languages. Sentences in plain text mostly have the structure
: &quot;ipc (initial particle cluster) - V (Verb) - S (Subject) - O (direct Object)&quot;.

The verb immediately follows an &quot;initial particle cluster&quot;, consisting of a more or less meaningless particle &quot;&quot;se-&quot; or &quot;me-&quot;&quot; (literally, &#x27;and&#x27;) followed by a series of up to three suffixes, often called emphatics. The function of some of these suffixes is mysterious, but others have been identified as pronomina like &quot;he&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, or &quot;them&quot;. The subject, direct object, or indirect object of the sentence may thus proleptically be referred to in the initial particle cluster. As an example, the sentence &quot;X built a house&quot; might in Lycian be structured: &quot;and-he-it / he-built / X / a-house&quot;.

Other constituents of a sentence, like an indirect object, predicate, or complimentary adjuncts, can be placed anywhere after the verb.

Contrary to this pattern, funeral inscriptions as a rule have a standard form with the object at the head of the sentence: &quot;This tomb built X&quot;; literally: &quot;This tomb / it / he built / X&quot; (order: &quot;O - ipc - V - S&quot;). Laroche suspects the reason for this deviation to be that in this way emphasis fell on the funerary object: &quot;This object, it was built by X&quot;. Example:

In line 1 &quot;mẽti = m-ẽ-ti&quot; is the initial particle cluster, where &quot;m- = me-&quot; is the neutral &quot;steppingstone&quot; to which two suffixes are affixed: &quot;-ẽ-&quot; = &quot;it&quot;, and the relative pronoun &quot;-ti&quot;, &quot;who, he who&quot;.

==== Subject-verb-object hypothesis ====
Kim McCone proposed in the 1970s that Lycian&#x27;s unmarked word order was instead subject-verb-object. The apparent VSO and OVS orders come from various frontings and dislocations of a basic SVO structure. 

Lycian&#x27;s SVO is itself a shift from the typical Anatolian subject-object-verb order, of which Lycian preverbal object pronouns like &quot;ẽ&quot; &quot;him/her/it&quot; would be a relic.

In spite of McCone&#x27;s alternative analysis, the assumption that verb-subject-object was Lycian&#x27;s unmarked word order went unchallenged until the 2010s, when Alwin Kloekhorst independently formulated and adopted the SVO hypothesis. This led to other linguists like Heiner Eichner and H. Craig Melchert to adopt the SVO hypothesis after him. The principal unmarked example cited by SVO supporters comes from the following sentence:

Further examples of subject-initial unmarked clauses cited by Melchert include:


==Endonym==
A few etymological studies of the Lycian language endonym exist, namely:
* Language of the mountain people (Laroche): Luwian tarmi- &quot;pointed object&quot; becomes a hypothetical *tarmašši- &quot;mountainous&quot; used in Trm̃mis- &quot;Lycia.&quot; Lycia and Pisidia each had a hill-town named Termessos.
* Attarima (Carruba): A previously unknown Late Bronze Age place name among the Lukka.
* Termilae (Bryce): A people displaced from Crete about 1600 BC.
* Termera (Strabo): A Lelege people displaced by the Trojan War, first settling in Caria and assigning such names as Telmessos, Termera, Termerion, Termeros, Termilae, then displaced to Lycia by the Ionians.

<doc id="189555" wikidata="Q392161" url="?curid=189555" title="Saguenay River">
<text>The Saguenay River (, ) is a major river of Quebec, Canada. 
It drains Lac Saint-Jean in the Laurentian Highlands, leaving at Alma and running east; the city of Saguenay is located on the river. It drains into the Saint Lawrence River. Tadoussac, founded as a French colonial trading post in 1600, is located on the northeast bank at this site.

The river has a very high flow-rate and is bordered by steep cliffs associated with the Saguenay Graben. Tide waters flow in its fjord upriver as far as Chicoutimi (about 100 kilometres). Many Beluga whales breed in the cold waters at its mouth, making Tadoussac a popular site for whale watching and sea kayaking; Greenland sharks also frequent the depths of the river. The area of the confluence of the Saguenay and Saint Lawrence is protected by the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park, one of Canada&#x27;s national parks.

== History ==
First Nations people, including Innus, have inhabited the Saguenay Fjord area for thousands of years prior to the first Europeans arriving. The first European to visit the area was Jacques Cartier, in 1535. After Samuel de Champlain established a fort in 1608 on the northern shores of the St. Lawrence River (around present-day Quebec City), various Indigenous peoples, including Innu, Haudenosaunee(Iroquois), Huron, Algonquins and Cree all traded along the Saguenay River. They named the river for the legendary Kingdom of Saguenay. It is the namesake of Saguenay Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

Beginning in the 19th century, the river was exploited for transport and power by the logging and pulp and paper industries. A dam on the upper Saguenay generates hydroelectricity for local industries, such as aluminum smelting and paper mills.

Severe flooding of the Saguenay&#x27;s tributary rivers from July 18 to 21, 1996, devastated the region in one of Canada&#x27;s costliest natural disasters, the Saguenay Flood. However, an unexpected effect of the flood was to cover the heavily contaminated sediments at the bottom of the river with of new, relatively clean sediments. Research has shown that the old sediments are no longer a threat to ecosystems.

== Geography ==
The Saguenay originates in Lac Saint-Jean at Alma. There are two channels: La Petite Décharge and La Grande Décharge, on which is built the dam Île Maligne hydroelectric plant. The island formed by these two rivers is part of the municipality of Alma. At this place, the water is freshwater. Three bridges cross the &quot;Petite Décharge&quot; and two others cross the &quot;Grande Décharge&quot;. It is when these two rivers meet just east of Alma that the Saguenay really begins. It begins in the form of a reservoir several kilometers long, unlike the rapids and powerful falls that dotted the river before the erection of dams.

At Shipshaw, Quebec, the Saguenay splits again in two. On the northern watercourse, there is the Shipshaw hydroelectric station and, on the south side, the Chute-à-Caron power plant. It is here that the Aluminum Bridge is located.

Between Chicoutimi and Jonquière, the two come together to form the Saguenay. It becomes accessible to navigation at this point. Moreover, Chicoutimi means &quot;how deep is it&quot; in Innu-aimun. In downtown Chicoutimi, the and the are located. At Tadoussac, a ferry provides the link between Tadoussac and Baie-Sainte-Catherine.

<doc id="189556" wikidata="Q244994" url="?curid=189556" title="Anorthite">
<text>Anorthite (an = not, ortho = straight) is the calcium endmember of the plagioclase feldspar mineral series. The chemical formula of pure anorthite is CaAl2Si2O8. Anorthite is found in mafic igneous rocks.

==Mineralogy ==

Anorthite is the calcium-rich endmember of the plagioclase solid solution series, the other endmember being albite (NaAlSi3O8). Pure anorthite, containing no sodium, is rare on Earth. Anorthite also refers, however, to plagioclase compositions with more than 90 molecular percent of the anorthite endmember (and up to 10 molecular percent of the albite endmember). The composition of plagioclases is often expressed as a molar percentage of An%, or (for a specific quantity) Ann, where n = Ca/(Ca + Na) × 100. This equation predominantly works in a terrestrial context; exotic locales and in particular Lunar rocks may need to account for other cations, such as Fe2+, to explain differences between optically and structurally derived An% data observed in Lunar anorthites.

At standard pressure, pure (An100) anorthite melts at .

==Occurrence==
Anorthite is a compositional variety of plagioclase. It occurs in mafic igneous rock. It also occurs in metamorphic rocks of granulite facies, in metamorphosed carbonate rocks, and corundum deposits. Its type localities are Monte Somma and Valle di Fassa, Italy. It was first described in 1823. It is more rare in surficial rocks than it normally would be due to its high weathering potential in the Goldich dissolution series.

It also makes up much of the lunar highlands; the Genesis Rock, collected during the 1971 Apollo 15 mission, is made of anorthosite, a rock composed largely of anorthite. Anorthite was discovered in samples from comet Wild 2, and the mineral is an important constituent of Ca-Al-rich inclusions in rare varieties of chondritic meteorites.

<doc id="189557" wikidata="Q3120530" url="?curid=189557" title="Guillemot">
<text>Guillemot is the common name for several species of seabird in the Alcidae or auk family, part of the order Charadriiformes. In Europe, the term covers two genera, &quot;Uria&quot; and &quot;Cepphus&quot;. In North America the &quot;Uria&quot; species are called murres and only the &quot;Cepphus&quot; species are called &quot;guillemots&quot;. 

The current spelling &quot;guillemot&quot; is of French origin, first attested by Pierre Belon in 1555, but derived from Old (11th century) French &quot;willelm&quot;, and matched by English variants &quot;willock&quot; (attested 1631), &quot;willick&quot;, &quot;will&quot; and &quot;wilkie&quot;, all from forms of the name William, cf. , but ultimately onomatopoeic from the loud, high-pitched &quot;&quot;will&quot;, &quot;willem&quot;&quot; begging calls of the newly fledged young of the common guillemot. The American name &quot;murre&quot;, also known from England (particularly Cornwall) from the 17th century, is by contrast, onomatopoeic of the growling call of adult common guillemots.

The two living species of &quot;Uria&quot;, together with the razorbill, little auk, and the extinct great auk, make up the tribe Alcini. They have distinctly white bellies, thicker and longer bills than &quot;Cepphus&quot;, and form very dense colonies on cliffs during the reproductive season. Guillemot eggs are large (around 11% of female weight), in shape, and colourful, making them attractive targets for egg collectors.

The three living species of &quot;Cepphus&quot; form a tribe of their own, Cepphini. They are smaller than the &quot;Uria&quot; species and have black bellies in breeding plumage, rounder heads and bright red feet.

==Systematics==
===&quot;Uria&quot;===
*Common murre or common guillemot, &quot;Uria aalge&quot;
*Thick-billed murre or Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot, &quot;Uria lomvia&quot;

Some prehistoric species are also known:

* &quot;Uria brodkorbi&quot; (Monterey or Sisquoc Late Miocene of Lompoc, USA)
* &quot;Uria affinis&quot; (Late Pleistocene of E USA)—possibly a subspecies of &quot;U. lomvia&quot;
* &quot;Uria paleohesperis&quot;

&quot;Uria brodkorbi&quot; is the only known occurrence of the Alcini tribe in the temperate to subtropical Pacific, except for the very fringe of the range of &quot;U. aalge&quot;.

===&quot;Cepphus&quot;===
* Black guillemot or tystie, &quot;Cepphus grylle&quot;
* Pigeon guillemot, &quot;Cepphus columba&quot; 
* Spectacled guillemot, &quot;Cepphus carbo&quot;

As in other genera of auks, fossils of prehistoric forms of &quot;Cepphus&quot; have been found:

* &quot;Cepphus olsoni&quot; (San Luis Rey River Late Miocene—Early Pliocene of W USA)
* &quot;Cepphus&quot; cf. &quot;columba&quot; (Lawrence Canyon Early Pliocene of W USA)
* &quot;Cepphus&quot; cf. &quot;grylle&quot; (San Diego Late Pliocene, W USA)

The latter two resemble the extant species, but because of the considerable distance in time or space from their current occurrence, they may represent distinct species.

==Pyriform egg==
Guillemots lay a single (pear-shaped) egg directly on a cliff edge in dense breeding colonies; they do not build a nest, allowing them to nest close to one another even on uneven cliff edges, the density protecting their eggs and chicks from predatory gulls. While the egg would seem vulnerable to rolling off the edge, this does not usually happen. It has been suggested that the egg might simply spin if disturbed, or roll in an arc preventing it from falling over the cliff edge. There is no evidence for either explanation. However, a pyriform egg placed experimentally on a steep slope did not roll, while a less pointed and more ellipsoidal egg did. Ornithologist Tim Birkhead experimented, and found that the arc that a pyriform egg rolls in is wider than most cliff ledges, so not protective against falls. He attributed the egg&#x27;s stability to its long straight edge resting on the ground, creating more friction and making it less likely to move and fall.

Guillemot eggs were collected until the late 1920s in Scotland&#x27;s St Kilda islands by their men scaling the cliffs. The eggs were buried in St Kilda peat ash to be eaten through the cold, northern winters. The eggs were considered to be similar to duck eggs in taste and nutrition.

==Bounciness in chicks==
Guillemot chicks are born on rocky cliffs near the seaside. They leave the nest by jumping off the cliffsides before their wings are strong enough to allow them to fly, so they parachute down toward the ground as opposed to flying. Their dense, downy feathers and underdeveloped wings allow them to avoid serious harm when falling to the ground, so they bounce around slightly after hitting the ground.

<text>Douglas Richard Flutie (born October 23, 1962) is an American former professional football quarterback who played professionally for 21 seasons. He played 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), eight seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and one season in the United States Football League (USFL). Flutie played college football for the Boston College Eagles, winning the Heisman Trophy in 1984 amid a season that saw him throw the game-winning touchdown pass in the final seconds against the Miami Hurricanes.

Flutie chose to begin his professional career with the USFL&#x27;s New Jersey Generals; his unavailability to NFL teams resulted in him being selected 285th overall by the Los Angeles Rams in the 11th round of the 1985 NFL draft, the lowest drafting of a Heisman winner. After the USFL folded, Flutie spent his first four NFL seasons with the Chicago Bears and the New England Patriots.

Flutie left the NFL in 1990 for the CFL, where he became regarded as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players. As a member of the BC Lions, the Calgary Stampeders, and the Toronto Argonauts, he was named the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player a record six times and won three Grey Cups. In all three of his championship victories, two with the Argonauts and one with the Stampeders, he was named Grey Cup MVP.

Following his CFL success, Flutie returned to the NFL in 1998 with the Buffalo Bills, earning Pro Bowl and NFL Comeback Player of the Year honors for leading Buffalo to the playoffs. He again helped the Bills obtain a playoff berth the following season, but was controversially benched in their subsequent Wild Card defeat; Flutie would be the last quarterback to bring the Bills to the postseason over the next 17 years. Flutie held his last starting role with the San Diego Chargers in 2001 and spent his final professional season as a backup for the Patriots. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2008. Flutie was also inducted to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2007, becoming the first non-Canadian inductee.

==Early life==
Flutie was born in Manchester, Maryland, to Dick and Joan Flutie. His paternal great-grandparents were Lebanese immigrants. His family moved to Melbourne Beach, Florida, when he was six, where his father worked as a quality engineer in the aerospace industry. While there, Flutie led Hoover Junior High School&#x27;s football team to two Brevard County Championships.

After the dramatic slow-down of the space program in the mid-1970s, the Flutie family again moved in 1976 to Natick, Massachusetts, 20 miles west of Boston. Flutie graduated from Natick High School, where he was an All-League performer in football, basketball, and baseball.

==College career==
Flutie played football at Boston College, the only Division I-A school to recruit him, from 1981 to 1984, and won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O&#x27;Brien Award in his senior year (1984). Flutie became the first quarterback to win the Heisman since Pat Sullivan in 1971. Flutie left school as the NCAA&#x27;s all-time passing yardage leader with 10,579 yards and was a unanimous All-American as a senior. He earned Player of the Year awards from UPI, Kodak, The Sporting News, and the Maxwell Football Club. The quarterback coach for Boston College from 1981 to 1983 was Tom Coughlin.

Flutie gained national attention in 1984 when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45–41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a &quot;Hail Mary pass&quot; that was caught in the end zone by his college roommate, Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47–45 win. Flutie won the Heisman trophy a week later, but the voting had finished before the game; Flutie said, however, that &quot;without the Hail Mary pass I think I could have been very, very easily forgotten&quot;.

The subsequent rise in applications for admission to Boston College after Flutie&#x27;s &quot;Hail Mary&quot; gave rise to the admissions phenomenon known as the &quot;Flutie Effect&quot;. This idea essentially states that a winning sports team can increase the recognition value of a school enough to make it more attractive to potential applicants.

In addition to his collegiate athletic achievement, Flutie maintained a distinguished academic record at Boston College, where he majored in communication and computer science. Flutie was a candidate for the Rhodes Scholarship, for which he was named a finalist in 1984. Upon graduating, Flutie won the National Football Foundation post-graduate scholarship.

In November 2008, Flutie was honored by Boston College with a statue of him throwing his famous &quot;Hail Mary&quot; pass outside of Alumni Stadium. His number, 22, has been retired by the Boston College football program.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===New Jersey Generals===

Despite his successful college achievements, whether Flutie was too small to play professional football was uncertain. When asked on television &quot;Can a guy who&#x27;s five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?&quot;, he answered &quot;Yes, he can. But it&#x27;s a matter of ability and not size. I feel I can play; I don&#x27;t know for sure, and those questions will be answered in the future.&quot;

Flutie was seen as extremely attractive to the USFL, which was desperate for a star to reinvigorate the league as it was in financial difficulty. Meanwhile, the Buffalo Bills, who had the first pick in the 1985 NFL draft, still had the rights to Jim Kelly (who had earlier spurned them to go to the USFL) and also had concerns about Flutie&#x27;s height. He was selected by the USFL&#x27;s New Jersey Generals in the 1985 territorial draft, which took place in January, months before the 1985 NFL Draft. Flutie went through negotiations with the Generals and agreed on a deal that would make him the highest paid pro football player and highest paid rookie in any sport with $7 million over five years; Flutie was officially signed on February 4, 1985. Having already signed with the USFL, Flutie was not selected in the NFL Draft until the 11th round as the 285th overall pick by the Los Angeles Rams.

Flutie entered the USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began to wonder if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right, despite the plenitude of great NFL quarterbacks with awful initial professional seasons. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, as his first two professional passes were intercepted by Renegades linebacker Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie&#x27;s debut was over, he completed 7 of 18 passes, for a total of 174 yards, while running for 51 yards. Flutie completed 134 of 281 passes for 2,109 yards and 13 touchdowns with the Generals in 1985 in 15 games. He suffered an injury late in the season that saw him turn over the reins to reserve quarterback Ron Reeves. The Generals went on to finish with an 11–7 record and a second-place finish in the USFL&#x27;s Eastern Conference. The USFL folded in 1986, and Flutie and punter Sean Landeta were the league&#x27;s last active players in the NFL.

===Chicago Bears===
On October 14, 1986, the Los Angeles Rams traded their rights to Flutie to the Chicago Bears in exchange for multiple draft picks. Flutie appeared in four games for the 1986 Chicago Bears, who were in need for quarterback play when Jim McMahon suffered a season-ending injury late in the season. He served as the starter in the Divisional Round game against Washington, which was only his second NFL start. He went 11-of-31 with 134 yards as Washington scored 20 unanswered points in the second half to overcome a halftime deficit while Flutie&#x27;s interception in the third quarter set up Washington for a subsequent touchdown.

=== New England Patriots (first stint)===
Chicago then traded Flutie to the New England Patriots at the start of the 1987 NFL season, a season which saw the NFL Players Association go on strike, and NFL games subsequently being played by replacement players. Flutie crossed the picket lines in order to play for the Patriots, one of many NFL players to rejoin their respective teams, and the strike quickly collapsed.

On October 2, 1988, after the Patriots began the season with a 1–3 record, Flutie came off the bench to lead a comeback victory over the Indianapolis Colts in Foxborough, scoring the winning touchdown on a 13-yard bootleg at the end of the fourth quarter. He then led the team to a 6–3 record, including wins at home over the eventual division winning Cincinnati Bengals and Chicago Bears. However, after taking the Patriots to the brink of the playoffs, on December 11 Flutie was benched by head coach Raymond Berry and replaced with Tony Eason, who had not played football in over a year; Berry cited a need for more &quot;explosive&quot; play from the offense, which Flutie pointed out had thrown little to begin with. New England lost the last game of the year in Denver and were eliminated from the postseason in a tiebreaker.

Flutie was released by the Patriots after playing the 1989 season in a mainly backup role. No other NFL teams showed interest in Flutie and he subsequently signed to play for the Canadian Football League (CFL). After his release from the Patriots, they won only nine games over the following three seasons.

===BC Lions===
In 1990, Flutie began his eight-year CFL career. That year, he signed with the BC Lions for a two-year contract reportedly worth $350,000 a season. At the time he was the highest paid player in the CFL. Flutie struggled in his first season, which would be his only losing season in the CFL.

The 1991 season saw Flutie set several CFL single season records:

* passing attempts (730)
* passing completions (466)
* passing yards (6,619)
* 300-yard passing games (14)
* 400-yard passing games (7)
* rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (14)

On October 12 vs Edmonton, Flutie threw for 582 yards, which was second most in a regular season game at the time. For his accomplishments, he won Most Outstanding Player award for the first time. BC made the playoffs for the first time since 1988, but ultimately lost to the eventual West Division Champion Calgary Stampeders in the West Semi-Final.

=== Calgary Stampeders ===
In 1992, Flutie was rewarded with a reported million-dollar salary from the Calgary Stampeders. He quarterbacked Calgary to a league-best 13 regular season wins, won his second Most Outstanding Player award, and won his first Grey Cup. In the Grey Cup game, Flutie was 33 of 49 for 480 passing yards. All three statistics were the second highest all-time for a single Grey Cup game. For his efforts, he was named the Grey Cup MVP.

In 1993, Flutie quarterbacked Calgary to a 10–0 start, with the team ultimately finishing 15–3. He passed for 6,000 yards for the second time in his career, and set a single season record for passing touchdowns with 44. He also tied his 1991 CFL record for 400-yard passing games in a season (7), and set the CFL record for consecutive 400-yard passing games (5). Flutie won his third consecutive Most Outstanding Player award. Calgary ultimately lost in the West Division Final to the visiting Edmonton Eskimos, which prohibited the Stampeders from playing in the Grey Cup that was to be played in Calgary the following Sunday.

The 1994 season saw Calgary once again finishing with a 15–3 record. Flutie broke his CFL record from the previous season for passing touchdowns in a single season with 48. He also rushed for 760 yards, which was his best rushing season in the CFL. Against Hamilton on October 30, he completed the longest pass of his career (106 yards), a touchdown to Pee Wee Smith. Flutie won his fourth consecutive Most Outstanding Player award. Calgary lost the West Division Final once again, this time to the visiting B.C. Lions, who defeated the Stampeders with a last play touchdown.

In 1995, Flutie missed several games with injury. During this time, Jeff Garcia, who later went on to start for the NFL&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers, started games at quarterback, and helped Calgary once again finish 15–3. The Stampeders advanced to the Grey Cup game, and Flutie started. However, Calgary was defeated by the Baltimore Stallions, the first American-based team to win the Grey Cup.

=== Toronto Argonauts ===
Flutie joined the Toronto Argonauts for the 1996 season, and they went 15–3. He won the Most Outstanding Player award for the fifth time in his career, and quarterbacked the team to a Grey Cup victory in The Snow Bowl held in Hamilton, Ontario. He won his second Grey Cup MVP award.

After a 15–3 regular season in 1997, Toronto was successful in its quest to win back-to-back Grey Cups when the team won the 1997 Grey Cup held in Edmonton, Alberta. With Flutie at quarterback, the Argonauts set a record for most consecutive completions in a Grey Cup game with 10, which occurred between the first and second quarters. From the late second quarter to the fourth quarter, this record was rewritten when Flutie completed 12 consecutive passes. For his performance in the Grey Cup, he won his third Grey Cup MVP award.

Prior to his final two Grey Cup victories with the Argonauts, Flutie was hampered by the opinion, supported by the media, that he was a quarterback who could not win in cold weather. In both 1993 and 1994, the Stampeders had the best record in the league, but lost the Western Final each year at home in freezing conditions. After first refusing to wear gloves in freezing temperatures, in later years Flutie adapted to throwing with gloves in cold weather.

Flutie credits his time in the CFL with helping him develop as a pro quarterback. Flutie specifically states that he modeled his game off of fellow CFL quarterback Damon Allen.

Upon completion of his CFL career, Flutie had set numerous CFL career records:

* 5,000+ yard passing seasons (6)
* consecutive 5,000+ yard passing seasons (4)
* 6,000+ passing yards in a season twice in a career (also a pro football record)
* 300-yard passing games (74)
* 400-yard passing games in a career (29)
* 6 Most Outstanding Player awards

Flutie ranked third in the following all-time regular season CFL passing categories: yards (41,355), touchdowns (270), completions (2,975), and he ranked fourth in all-time attempts (4,854). In all-time Grey Cup passing categories, Flutie held the record for most attempts (171), completions (108), and yards (1,421).

Other passing accomplishments upon completion of his CFL career included:

* leading the CFL in yards five times in only eight seasons
* holding four of the CFL&#x27;s top five highest single-season completion marks
* holding three of the CFL&#x27;s top five highest single-season yardage marks
* holding the top three single-season touchdown marks
* gaining 9,500+ yards for three different CFL franchises
* setting the single season individual records for three different CFL franchises in attempts, completions, yards, and touchdowns:
*since surpassed

On November 17, 2006, Flutie was named the greatest Canadian Football League player of all time from a top 50 list of CFL players conducted by TSN. In 2007, he was named to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, the first non-Canadian to be inducted.

===Buffalo Bills===
The Buffalo Bills&#x27; then-pro personnel director A. J. Smith convinced the organization that Flutie would be a great asset to the team, and the Bills signed him in the 1998 offseason. The Bills&#x27; attempt at making Todd Collins their starting quarterback was a failure, and Flutie was one of two quarterbacks, the other being Rob Johnson (the presumptive starter), to join the Bills in the 1998 offseason. In his first action with the Bills, Flutie entered for an injured Johnson and passed for two touchdowns while leading a fourth-quarter comeback against the Indianapolis Colts on October 11, 1998. The following week, Flutie made his first NFL start since October 15, 1989, against the unbeaten Jacksonville Jaguars. The nine-year gap between starts for a quarterback in the NFL is the third-longest in duration behind Tommy Maddox (December 12, 1992, to October 6, 2002) and the man Flutie replaced, Todd Collins (December 14, 1997, to December 16, 2007). Flutie was the hero of the Bills&#x27; victory as he scored the winning touchdown against the Jaguars by rolling out on a bootleg and into the end zone on a fourth-down play in the waning seconds. The Bills&#x27; success continued with Flutie at the helm; his record as a starter that season was 8 wins and 3 losses. He then threw for 360 yards in a wild card playoff loss at Miami. Flutie was selected to play in the 1998 Pro Bowl and is currently the shortest quarterback to make the Pro Bowl since 1970.

Flutie led the Bills to a 11–5 record in 1999 (10–5 with Flutie as the starter; he was rested for the final game of the season after the Bills clinched a playoff berth). In a controversial decision which football analyst Aaron Schatz said was &quot;the wrong decision on one of the most mismatched quarterback controversies of all time&quot;, Flutie was replaced by Johnson for the playoffs by coach Wade Phillips, who later said he was ordered by Bills owner Ralph Wilson to do so. Rob Johnson completed only ten passes, none for touchdowns, and was sacked six times, as the Bills lost 22–16 to the eventual AFC Champion Tennessee Titans. The game has become known as the Music City Miracle, as the Titans scored on the penultimate play of the game—a kickoff return following the Bills&#x27; apparent game-clinching field goal.

The following season, Flutie was named the Bills&#x27; backup and played only late in games or when Johnson was injured, which was often. During the season, Flutie had a 4–1 record as a starter, in while Johnson&#x27;s was 4–7. In a December 24, 2000 game against the Seattle Seahawks, Flutie achieved a perfect passer rating, completing 20 of 25 passes for 366 yards and three touchdowns. After the 2000 season, Bills President Tom Donahoe and head coach Gregg Williams decided to keep Johnson as the starter and cut Flutie.

=== San Diego Chargers ===
In 2001, Flutie signed with the San Diego Chargers, who had gone 1–15 in 2000. After opening 3–0, the Chargers slumped and were 4–2 going into Week 7, when Flutie&#x27;s Chargers met Rob Johnson&#x27;s Bills. Flutie prevailed as the new ex-Bill broke a sack attempt and ran 13 yards for the game-winning touchdown. It would be the last win for the Chargers in 2001, as they dropped their last nine games to finish 5–11 and cost head coach Mike Riley his job. (Buffalo finished 3–13 with Johnson and, later, Alex Van Pelt as starters.) Flutie was Drew Brees&#x27; backup in 2002. Brees idolized Flutie growing up, and credits Flutie with mentoring him during their time together at San Diego.

In 2003, Flutie replaced a struggling Brees when the Chargers were 1–7. The 41-year-old Flutie became the oldest player to score two rushing touchdowns in a game, the first player over 40 to accomplish that feat. He also became the oldest AFC Offensive Player of the Week, winning the award for the fourth time. On January 2, 2005, the season finale of the 2004 season, Flutie broke Jerry Rice&#x27;s record set two weeks prior, to become the oldest player ever to score a touchdown, at 42 years and 71 days. Rice was 42 years and 67 days when he made his touchdown. Flutie&#x27;s record as a starter that year was 2–3. He was released by the Chargers on March 13, 2005.

=== New England Patriots (second stint) ===
Flutie surprised many when he signed with the Patriots instead of the New York Giants. He became the backup behind Tom Brady and played several times at the end of games to take a few snaps. Flutie has a 37–28 record as an NFL starter, including a 22–9 record in home games.

Referring to his time in the Canadian Football League (and, presumably, to the quarterback&#x27;s relatively diminutive stature), television football commentator John Madden once said, &quot;Inch for inch, Flutie in his prime was the best QB of his generation.&quot;

In a December 26, 2005, game against the New York Jets, Flutie was sent in late in the game. The Jets also sent in their back-up quarterback, Vinny Testaverde. This was the first time in NFL history that two quarterbacks over the age of 40 competed against each other (Testaverde was 42, Flutie was 43).

In the Patriots&#x27; regular-season finale against the Miami Dolphins on January 1, 2006, Flutie successfully drop kicked a football for an extra point, something that was not done in a regular-season NFL game since 1941. It was Flutie&#x27;s first kick attempt in the NFL, and earned him that week&#x27;s title of AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, known for his knowledge of the history of the game, made comments that suggested that the play was a retirement present of sorts for his veteran quarterback, although Flutie made no comment on whether 2005 would be his last season. There is a video of Flutie describing the event in his own words.

During the 2006 off-season, Flutie&#x27;s agent Kristen Kuliga stated he was interested in returning to the Patriots for another season; as a result, he was widely expected to return, despite his age. However, on May 15, 2006, Flutie announced his decision to &quot;hang up his helmet&quot; at the age of 43 and retire. Flutie was the second-to-last former USFL player to retire, behind Sean Landeta, who last played in the same season of Flutie&#x27;s retirement (but did not formally retire until 2008).

=== Near-return to the CFL ===
Because of injuries with the Toronto Argonauts, Flutie was contemplating a temporary comeback with the team as of July 25, 2006. Flutie did not plan to play long-term, for he had planned on doing college football commentary on ESPN in the coming season. On August 18, 2006, a story was published on CFL.ca examining this topic in-depth. Flutie was pondering a return to the CFL because of his relationship with Argonauts head coach and former running back Pinball Clemons, and the desire to &quot;say goodbye to the CFL&quot;. According to the report, Flutie was poised to return to Toronto on July 22, after their victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the injury to backup quarterback Spergon Wynn. Nevertheless, Flutie chose to remain in retirement.

<text>Lac Saint-Jean (, ) is a large, relatively shallow lake in south-central Quebec, Canada, in the Laurentian Highlands. It is situated north of the Saint Lawrence River, into which it drains via the Saguenay River. It covers an area of , and is at its deepest point. Its name in the Innu language is Piekuakamu.

==Description==
The lake is fed by dozens of small rivers, including the Ashuapmushuan, the Mistassini, the Peribonka, the Des Aulnaies, the Métabetchouane, and the Ouiatchouane. The towns on its shores include Alma, Dolbeau-Mistassini, Roberval, Normandin, and Saint-Félicien. Three Regional County Municipalities lie on its shores: Lac-Saint-Jean-Est, Le Domaine-du-Roy, and Maria-Chapdelaine.

==History==
The lake was named Piekuakami by the Innu, the Indigenous people who occupied the area at the time of European arrival. It was given its French name by Jean de Quen, a Jesuit missionary who in 1647 was the first European to reach its shores.

Industry on the lake was dominated by the fur trade until the 19th century. Colonization began in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region in the early 19th century and continued intensively until the early 20th century. Industry was mainly forestry and agriculture. In the 20th century, pulp and paper mills and aluminum smelting rose to importance, encouraged by hydroelectric dams at Alma and on the Péribonka River. Lac Saint-Jean also has an important summer resort and sport-fishing industry.

The area is featured in the classic French-language novel Maria Chapdelaine by Louis Hémon published in 1914 and subsequently translated into twenty languages.

In the 1940s, during World War II, Lac Saint-Jean, along with various other regions within Canada, such as the Saguenay, Saint Helen&#x27;s Island and Hull, Quebec, had prisoner-of-war camps. Lac Saint-Jean&#x27;s was numbered and remained unnamed just like most of Canada&#x27;s other war prisons. The &quot;prisoners of war&quot; (POWs) were classified into categories including their nationality and civilian or military status. By 1942 this region had two camps with at least 50 POWs. Prisoners worked the land, including lumbering and assisting in the production of pulp and paper.

==Geology==
The bedrock of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region consists largely of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks. They are mostly composed of high-grade metamorphic rocks, amphibolite to granulite gneiss, that are intruded by anorthosite, mangerite, charnockite, and granite plutonic rocks. The Lac Saint-Jean anorthosite is the major mafic intrusion present in the area. These rocks comprise the Grenville Province of southern Quebec. It consists of fragments of island arcs and continental crust accreted to the south-eastern edge of Precambrian North American, Laurentia.

Lac Saint-Jean lies within a elongated rift valley that is known as the &quot;Lac Saint-Jean Lowlands&quot;. These lowlands are an elongated flat-bottomed basin formed by the Saguenay Graben by the displacement of Grenville crystalline rocks. This basin is long and wide. This basin is bounded by normal faults running parallel to its length. It extends from just west of Lac Saint-Jean along the Saguenay River to the Saint Lawrence Valley where is it truncated by St. Lawrence rift system.

Preserved within the down-faulted interior of the Saguenay Graben are two large eroded, isolated patches, known as &quot;outliers&quot;, of Paleozoic, Middle Ordovician, sedimentary rock composed of limestones and shales overlying Precambrian basement. The Lac-Saint-Jean outlier rests against the south wall of the graben south of Lac Saint-Jean and extends to the west of the lake. The Chicoutimi (Saguenay) outlier rests against the north wall of the graben and extends southward to a few kilometers from the Saguenay River north of Chicoutimi. These Middle Ordovician sedimentary rocks consist of sandstones, micritic limestones and highly fossiliferous, alternating beds of limestones and shales. These rocks have been preferentially eroded by repeated glaciations exhuming the Saguenay Graben.

The Saguenay Graben that undelies Lac Saint-Jean Lowlands has controlled the deposition and the accumulation of Quaternary deposits (sand, gravel, silt, and clay), which can reach up to in thickness beneath the central lowlands. The Quaternary sediments include glacial, marine, glaciofluvial sediments and post-glacial alluvial and delta plain sediments.

The area was covered by ice sheets several times throughout the Pleistocene. The valley formed by the Saguenay Graben being oriented more or less parallel to the glacial flow, became a preferred path for ice flow and resulted in deep excavation of the bedrock.The glaciers cut into the graben and widened it in some places as well as making it considerable deeper in others. At the time of retreat of the last ice sheet, the region had been depressed below contemporaneous sea level. As a result, as the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, the Saguenay Graben was flooded by marine waters to form the Laflamme Sea. As the land rose in response to considerable Post-glacial rebound, the bottom of the Saguenay Graben was blanketed by the Saguenay River with deltaic and terrestrial fluvial sediments to form the modern day Lac Saint-Jean Lowlands.

<text>In philately, gum is the substance applied to the back of a stamp to enable it to adhere to a letter or other mailed item. The term is generic, and applies both to traditional types such as gum arabic and to synthetic modern formulations. Gum is a matter of high importance in philately.

==History==
Before postage stamps existed, people receiving letters would have to pay for them. The payment was based on how many papers were in the envelope and how far the letter had traveled. Rowland Hill came up with a solution of prepayment. This led to his invention of stamp gum in 1837. The world&#x27;s first adhesive postage stamp was called the Penny Black. Many early stamps were not gummed, however, and some have been unable to be gummed due to shortage (for instance, the typewritten Uganda Cowry stamps of 1895). Extreme tropical climates were also a problem for Curaçao and Suriname. Some stamps, intended only for sale to stamp collectors, have been issued without gum, for instance the United States Farley&#x27;s Follies souvenir sheets of 1933. On the first stamps of Great Britain the gum was called &quot;cement&quot; and was made from a mixture of potato starch, wheat starch and acacia gum.

== Types and application ==

Originally, gumming took place after printing and before perforation, usually because the paper had to be damp for printing to work well, but in modern times most stamp printing is done dry on pre-gummed paper. There have been a couple of historical instances where stamps were regummed after being perforated, but these were unusual situations.

On early issues, gum was applied by hand, using a brush or roller, but in 1880 De La Rue came up with a machine gumming process using a printing press, and gum is now always applied by machine. The gum is universally spread as uniformly as possible.

The greatest manufacturing problem of the gumming process is its tendency to make the stamps curl, due to the different reaction of paper and gum to varying moisture levels. In the most extreme cases, the stamp will spontaneously roll up into a small tube. Various schemes have been tried, but the problem persists to this day. On Swiss stamps of the 1930s, Courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum, resulting in so-called &quot;grilled gum&quot;. Another scheme has been to slice the gum with knives after it has been applied. In some cases the gum solves the problem itself by becoming &quot;crackly&quot; when it dries.

The appearance of the gum varies with the type and method of application, and may range from nearly invisible to dark brown globs. Types of gum (adhesives) used on stamps include:
* dextrin, produced by heating starch
* gum arabic or acacia gum, derived from the acacia plant
* glue, from gelatin, rarely seen on stamps
* polyvinyl alcohol

Some stamps have had gum applied in a pattern resembling a watermark, presumably as an additional security device. German stamps from 1921 had a pattern of wavy lines while Czech stamps from 1923 had gum showing the initials of the Czech Republic, &quot;CSP&quot;. These patterns have been called &quot;gum devices&quot; or &quot;gum watermarks&quot;. Due to shortages of material, such as in the situation following World War II in Germany, stamps may be gummed in an economy fashion. This so-called &quot;economy gum&quot; (German: &quot;Spargummi&quot;) is only applied in patches.

== Self-adhesive stamps ==

In recent years, the use of self-adhesive stamps, otherwise known as pressure-sensitive stamps, has become widespread. This relatively new form of stamps has a smooth waxed or polymer-coated release carrier backing to which the pressure-adhesive adhesive of the stamp does not adhere as strongly as on paper. Therefore, the stamps can be released easily from the backing and placed onto a postal envelope. The first use was by Sierra Leone in 1964, and the United States tried it later on a 1974 Christmas stamp; this was judged a failure and was not reintroduced until 1989 when it gradually became widespread. In the 1990s, the U.S. Post Office began transitioning from water-based stamps into the use of self-adhesive stamps. By 1995, only 20 percent of the thirty-five billion stamps the Post Office produced every year were self-adhesive, yet by 2013 almost all U. S. stamps issued had become self-adhesive.

== Health risks ==
A 1965 British study of the transmission of bacteria and viruses on gummed paper found that &quot;Although pathogenic bacteria and viruses were not isolated from sample envelopes obtained from various sources, the gums used in manufacture were found to exert a protective effect against death from desiccation on the bacteria and viruses which had been introduced into them&quot; and it was possible to demonstrate bacterial multiplication in the gum used for the manufacture of postage stamps.&quot; The authors added the warning that &quot;postage stamps are often handled very carelessly when issued over the counter, and yet the purchaser will usually lick them without hesitation. The present work shows how readily bacteria can adhere to the surface of gummed paper which has been slightly moistened; and the finger is a suitable source both of moisture and of bacterial contamination.&quot;

A 1996 episode of the popular sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; featured a character (Susan Ross) who was poisoned after licking the flap of too many gummed envelopes. The episode has been linked anecdotally to an increase in worries about the health risks of licking gummed paper and it has been speculated that it may have contributed to the growing popularity of self-adhesive stamps, at least in the United States.

==Philately==
=== Condition of unused stamps ===
Stamp gum is an item of importance for collectors, although its presence is rarely of use in differentiating between common and rare stamps, and being on the back of the stamp it is not usually visible. Nevertheless, its condition is reflected in the valuation of unused stamps. Generally, the following conditions are distinguished:
* Mint: stamps with full, undamaged original gum, as sold by the post office. This condition (also called &quot;mint, never hinged&quot;) is valued highest.
* Unused: stamps whose original gum has been damaged, e.g. through use of stamp hinges, or other influences.
* Unused without gum: stamps which have lost their original gum.
In stamp catalogues, these conditions are abbreviated with the signs **, *, and (*), respectively.

Some stamps have been issued without any gum at all, either due to a lack of materials, or (in particular in tropical countries) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together. Such stamps cannot be found other than in (*) condition. Traditionally, in particular before World War II, stamps were mounted in albums with stamp hinges no matter whether they were used or unused. Hence some experts claim that very few unused stamps from the 19th century have not been hinged at some point in their existence. This means that old unused stamps in supposedly mint condition often come under suspicion of having been regummed, and the detection of regummed stamps is an important part of philatelic expertisation. Regummed stamps cannot be valued any higher than unused stamps without gum.

Dedicated philatelists strive to maintain the integrity of the backing gum, because such stamps are considered more desirable than stamps without their backing gum. The removal of any paper residue that has collected on the gum without removing the gum itself.

In 1906, trouble had constantly arisen due to the gum on the under face of the stamps. There was an official notice that stated that stamps were going to be prepared with &#x27;hard&#x27; gum, and were intended for use in the summer or humid season to prevent the premature sticking together of the stamps, or the sticking to the paraffin paper when in book form.

=== Varieties ===

Stamps that have text, numbers, or symbols imprinted on the adhesive are of special interest. e.g. to thematic collectors if the imprint is related to the occasion of the stamp issue, such as on the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration stamps of the United States. Stamps printed on the gummed side by mistake are sought after by collectors with an interest in uncommon varieties.

The gum of older stamp issues often causes the unused stamps to roll. To avoid this, some postal authorities, e.g. in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, had the gum broken by rollers, leading to its serration. The orientation of this serration is used to distinguish between different production runs.

=== Paper damage through stamp gum ===

Care must be taken during production that stamp gum, in particular if prepared from natural materials, does not contain an excess of acid. The latter can destroy the stamp paper over time. Notable cases are the Ostropa commemorative sheet issued in Germany in 1935, and the German Zeppelin airmail stamps of 1936.

The thick gum on some older stamps, namely on issues of Austria-Hungary, tends to break due to changes in air humidity and temperature. Such breaks can also affect the stamp paper and cause the stamps to disintegrate. In such cases, stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps.

<text>The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), first published in 1952, is one of a number of uniform acts that have been established as law with the goal of harmonizing the laws of sales and other commercial transactions across the United States through UCC adoption by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Territories of the United States.

While largely successful at achieving this ambitious goal, some U.S. jurisdictions (e.g., Louisiana and Puerto Rico) have not adopted all of the articles contained in the UCC, while other U.S. jurisdictions (e.g., American Samoa) have not adopted any articles in the UCC. Also, adoption of the UCC often varies from one U.S. jurisdiction to another. Sometimes this variation is due to alternative language found in the official UCC itself. At other times, adoption of revisions to the official UCC contributes to further variation. Additionally, some jurisdictions deviate from the official UCC by tailoring the language to meet their unique needs and preferences. Lastly, even identical language adopted by any two U.S. jurisdictions may nonetheless be subject to different statutory interpretations by each jurisdiction&#x27;s courts.

==Goals==
The goal of harmonizing state law is important because of the prevalence of commercial transactions that extend beyond one state. For example, goods may be manufactured in State A, warehoused in State B, sold from State C, and delivered in State D. The UCC achieved the goal of substantial uniformity in commercial laws and, at the same time, allowed the states the flexibility to meet local circumstances by modifying the UCC&#x27;s text as enacted in each state. The UCC deals primarily with transactions involving personal property (movable property) and not real property (immovable property).

Other goals of the UCC were to modernize contract law and to allow for exceptions from the common law in contracts between merchants.

==History==
The UCC is the longest and most elaborate of the uniform acts. The Code has been a long-term, joint project of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) and the American Law Institute (ALI). NCCUSL and ALI began drafting the first version of the UCC in 1945, following earlier, less comprehensive codification efforts for areas including the sale of goods across state lines.

Judge Herbert F. Goodrich was the chairman of the editorial board of the original 1952 edition, and the Code itself was drafted by legal scholars including Karl N. Llewellyn (the prime leader in the project), William A. Schnader, Soia Mentschikoff, and Grant Gilmore. The UCC contained principles and concepts borrowed from German law, although they were unacknowledged by Llewellyn.

The Code, as the product of private organizations, is not itself the law, but only a recommendation of the laws that should be adopted in the states. Once enacted by a state, the UCC is codified into the state&#x27;s code of statutes. A state may adopt the UCC verbatim as written by ALI and NCCUSL, or a state may adopt the UCC with specific changes. Unless such changes are minor, they can seriously obstruct the Code&#x27;s express objective of promoting uniformity of law among the various states. Thus, persons doing business in various states must check local laws.

The ALI and NCCUSL have established a permanent editorial board for the Code. This board has issued a number of official comments and other published papers. Although these commentaries do not have the force of law, courts interpreting the Code often cite them as persuasive authority in determining the effect of one or more provisions. Courts interpreting the Code generally seek to harmonize their interpretations with those of other states that have adopted the same or a similar provision.

In one or another of its several revisions, the UCC has been fully enacted with only minimal changes in 49 states, as well as in the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Louisiana and Puerto Rico have enacted most of the provisions of the UCC with only minimal changes, except Articles 2 and 2A, preferring instead to maintain their own civil law tradition for governing the sale and lease of goods. Also, some Native American tribes have adopted portions of the UCC, including the Navajo Nation, which has adopted Articles 1, 2, 3, and 9 with only minimal changes.

Although the substantive content is largely similar, some states have made structural modifications to conform to local customs. For example, Louisiana jurisprudence refers to the major subdivisions of the UCC as &quot;chapters&quot; instead of articles, since the term &quot;articles&quot; is used in that state to refer to provisions of the Louisiana Civil Code. Arkansas has a similar arrangement as the term &quot;article&quot; in that state&#x27;s law generally refers to a subdivision of the Arkansas Constitution. In California, they are titled &quot;divisions&quot; instead of articles, because, in California, articles are a third- or fourth-level subdivision of a code, while divisions or parts are always the first-level subdivision. Also, California does not allow the use of hyphens in section numbers because they are reserved for referring to ranges of sections; therefore, the hyphens used in the official UCC section numbers are dropped in the California implementation.

== UCC articles ==
The 1952 Uniform Commercial Code was released after ten years of development, and revisions were made to the Code from 1952 to 2022.
The Uniform Commercial Code deals with the following subjects under consecutively numbered Articles:

In 2003, amendments to Article 2 modernizing many aspects (as well as changes to Article 2A and Article 7) were proposed by the NCCUSL and the ALI. Because no states adopted the amendments and, due to industry opposition, none were likely to, in 2011 the sponsors withdrew the amendments. As a result, the official text of the UCC now corresponds to the law that most states have enacted.

In 1989, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws recommended that Article 6 of the UCC, dealing with bulk sales, be repealed as obsolete. Approximately 45 states have done so. Two others have followed the alternative recommendation of revising Article 6.

A major revision of Article 9, dealing primarily with transactions in which personal property is used as security for a loan or extension of credit, was enacted in all states. The revision had a uniform effective date of July 1, 2001 although in a few states it went into effect shortly after that date. In 2010, NCCUSL and the ALI proposed modest amendments to Article 9. Several states have already enacted these amendments, which have a uniform effective date of July 1, 2013.

The controversy surrounding with what is now termed the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) originated in the process of revising Article 2 of the UCC. The provisions of what is now UCITA were originally meant to be &quot;Article 2B&quot; on Licenses within a revised Article 2 on Sales. As the UCC is the only uniform law that is a joint project of NCCUSL and the ALI, both associations must agree to any revision of the UCC (i.e., the model act; revisions to the law of a particular state only require enactment in that state). The proposed final draft of Article 2B met with controversy within the ALI, and as a consequence the ALI did not grant its assent. The NCCUSL responded by renaming Article 2B and promulgating it as the UCITA. As of October 12, 2004, only Maryland and Virginia have adopted UCITA.

The overriding philosophy of the Uniform Commercial Code is to allow people to make the contracts they want, but to fill in any missing provisions where the agreements they make are silent. The law also seeks to impose uniformity and streamlining of routine transactions like the processing of checks, notes, and other routine commercial paper. The law frequently distinguishes between merchants, who customarily deal in a commodity and are presumed to know well the business they are in, and consumers, who are not.

The UCC also seeks to discourage the use of legal formalities in making business contracts, in order to allow business to move forward without the intervention of lawyers or the preparation of elaborate documents. This last point is perhaps the most questionable part of its underlying philosophy; many in the legal profession have argued that legal formalities discourage litigation by requiring some kind of ritual that provides a clear dividing line that tells people when they have made a final deal over which they could be sued.

== Article 2 ==
Article 2 deals with sales, and Article 2A deals with leases.

=== Contract formation ===
* Firm offers (offers to buy or sell goods and promising to keep the offer open for a period of time) are valid without consideration if signed by the offeror, and are irrevocable for the time stated on the purchase order (but no longer than three months), or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time.
* An offer to buy goods for &quot;prompt shipment&quot; invites acceptance by either prompt shipment or a prompt promise to ship. Therefore, this offer is not strictly unilateral. However, this &quot;acceptance by performance&quot; does not even have to be by conforming goods (for example, incomplete sets).
* Consideration—modifications without consideration may be acceptable in a contract for the sale of goods.
* Failure to state price—In a contract for the sale of goods, failure to state a price will not prevent the formation of a contract if the parties&#x27; original intent was to form a contract. A reasonable price will be determined by the court.
* Assignments—a requirements contract can be assigned, provided the quantity required by the assignee is not unreasonably disproportionate to the original quantity.

=== Contract repudiation and breach ===
* Nonconforming goods—If non-conforming goods are sent with a note of accommodation, such tender is construed as a counteroffer, and if accepted, forms a new contract and binds the buyer at previous contract price. If the seller refuses to conform and the buyer does not accept, the buyer must return all non-conforming goods at sellers expense within thirty days of receipt.
* Perfect tender—The buyer however does have a right of &quot;perfect tender&quot; and can accept all, reject all, or accept conforming goods and reject the rest; within a reasonable time after delivery but before acceptance, he must notify the seller of the rejection. If the buyer does not give a specific reason (defect), he cannot rely on the reason later, in legal proceedings (akin to the cure before cover rationale). Also, the contract is not breached per se if the seller delivered the non-conforming goods, however offensive, before the date of performance has hit.
* &quot;Reasonable time/good faith&quot;, four weeks&#x27; minimum lead time, standard—Such standard is required from a party to a contract indefinite as to time, or made indefinite by waiver of original provisions.
* Requirements/Output contracts—The UCC provides protection against disproportionate demands, but must meet the &quot;good faith&quot; requirement.
* Reasonable grounds for insecurity—In a situation with a threat of non-performance, the other part may suspend its own performance and demand assurances in writing. If assurance is not provided &quot;within a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days&quot;, the contract is repudiated.
* Battle of forms—New terms will be incorporated into the agreement unless:
** the offer is limited to its own terms, 
** they materially alter the original terms (limit liability etc.), 
** the first party objects to new terms in a timely manner, or the first party has already objected to new terms. Whether the new terms &quot;materially alter&quot; the original offer may depend on the nature of the item (e.g. a delay in delivery of nails is not the same as for fish).
* Battle of forms—A written confirmation of an offer sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms that are additional to or different from those offered, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional to the additions.
* Statute of frauds as applicable to the sale of goods—The actual contract does not need to be in writing. Just some note or memo must be in writing and signed. However, the UCC exception to the signature requirement is where written confirmation is received and not objected to within 10 days.
* Cure/cover—The buyer must give the seller time to cure the defective shipment before seeking cover.
* FOB place of business—The seller assumes risk of loss until the goods are placed on a carrier. FOB destination: the seller assumes risk of loss until the shipment arrives at its destination. If the contract leaves out the delivery place, it is the seller&#x27;s place of business.
* Risk of loss—Equitable conversion does not apply. In the sale of specific goods, the risk of loss lies with the seller until tender. Generally, the seller bears risk of loss until the buyer takes physical possession of the goods (the opposite of realty).
* Reclamation—Successful reclamation of goods excludes all other remedies with respect to the goods. The seller can reclaim goods upon demand within 20 days after the buyer receives them if the seller discovers that the buyer received the goods while insolvent.
* Rightfully rejected goods—A merchant buyer may follow reasonable instructions of the seller to reject the goods. If no such instructions are given, the buyer may make a reasonable effort to sell them, and the buyer/bailee is entitled to 10% of the gross proceeds.
* Implied warranty of fitness—Implied warranty of fitness arises when the seller knows the buyer is relying upon the seller&#x27;s expertise in choosing goods. Implied warranty of merchantability: every sale of goods fit for ordinary purposes. Express warranties: arise from any statement of fact of promise.
* UCC damages for repudiating/breaching seller—Difference between 1) the market price when the buyer learned of breach and the 2) contract price 3) plus incidental damages. An aggrieved seller simply suing for the contract price is economically inefficient.
* Specially manufactured goods—Specially manufactured goods are exempt from statute of frauds where manufacturer has made a &quot;substantial beginning&quot; or &quot;commitments for the procurement&quot; of supplies.

===Section 2-207: Battle of the forms===

One of the most confusing and fiercely litigated sections of the UCC is Section 2-207, which Professor Grant Gilmore called &quot;arguably the greatest statutory mess of all time&quot;. It governs a &quot;battle of the forms&quot; as to whose boilerplate terms, those of the offeror or the offeree, will survive a commercial transaction where multiple forms with varying terms are exchanged. This problem frequently arises when parties to a commercial transaction exchange routine documents like requests for proposals, invoices, purchase orders, and order confirmations, all of which may contain conflicting boilerplate provisions.

The first step in the analysis is to determine whether the UCC or the common law governs the transaction. If the UCC governs, courts will usually try to find which form constitutes the offer. Next, the offeree&#x27;s acceptance forms bearing the different terms is examined. One should note whether the acceptance is expressly conditional on its own terms. If it is expressly conditional, it is a counteroffer, not an acceptance. If performance is accepted after the counteroffer, even without express acceptance, under 2-207(3), a contract will exist under only those terms on which the parties agree, together with UCC gap-fillers.

If the acceptance form does not expressly limit acceptance to its own terms, and both parties are merchants, the offeror&#x27;s acceptance of the offeree&#x27;s performance, though the offeree&#x27;s forms contain additional or different terms, forms a contract. At this point, if the offeree&#x27;s terms cannot coexist with the offeror&#x27;s terms, both terms are &quot;knocked out&quot; and UCC gap-fillers step in. If the offeree&#x27;s terms are simply additional, they will be considered part of the contract unless (a) the offeror expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the original offer, (b) the new terms materially alter the original offer, or (c) notification of objection to the new terms has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after they are promulgated by the offeree.

Because of the massive confusion engendered by Section 2-207, a revised version was promulgated in 2003, but the revision has never been enacted by any state.

==Article 8==

The ownership of securities is governed by Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). This Article 8, a text of about 30 pages, underwent important recasting in 1994. That update of the UCC treats the majority of the transfers of dematerialized securities as mere reflections of their respective initial issue held primarily by two American central securities depositories, respectively The Depository Trust Company (DTC) for securities issued by corporations and the Federal Reserve for securities issued by the Treasury Department. In this centralised system, the title transfer of the securities does not take place at the time of the registration with the issuer&#x27;s registrar for the account of the investor, but within the systems managed by DTC or by the Federal Reserve.

This centralization is not accompanied by a centralized register of the investors/owners of the securities, such as the systems established in Sweden and in Finland (so-called &quot;transparent systems&quot;). Neither DTC nor the Federal Reserve hold an individual register of the transfers of property reflecting beneficial owners. The consequence for an investor is that proving ownership of its securities relies entirely on the accurate replication of the transfer recorded by DTC and FED and others in the intermediated holding system at the lower tiers of the holding chain of the securities. Each one of these links is composed respectively of an account provider (or intermediary) and of an account holder.

The rights created through these links are purely contractual claims: these rights are of two kinds:

# For the links where the account holder is itself an account provider at a lower tier, the right on the security during the time where it is credited there is characterized as a &quot;securities entitlement&quot;, which is an &quot;ad hoc&quot; concept invented in 1994: &quot;e.g.,&quot; designating a claim that will enable the account holder to take part to a prorate distribution in the event of bankruptcy of its account provider.
# For each link of the chain, in which the final account holder is at the same time the final investor, its &quot;security entitlement&quot; is enriched by the &quot;substantial&quot; rights defined by the issuer: the right to receive dividends or interests and, possibly, the right to take part in the general meetings, when that was laid down in the account agreement concluded with the account provider. The combination of these reduced material rights and of these variable substantial rights is characterised by article 8 of the UCC as a &quot;beneficial interest&quot;.

This decomposition of the rights organized by Article 8 of the UCC results in preventing the investor to the security in case of bankruptcy of the account provider, that is to say the possibility to claim the security as its own asset, without being obliged to share it at its prorate value with the other creditors of the account provider. As a consequence, it also prevents the investor from asserting its securities at the upper level of the holding chain, either up to DTC or up to a sub-custodian. Such a &quot;security entitlement,&quot; unlike a normal ownership right, is no longer enforceable &quot;&quot; to any person supposed to have the security in its custody. The &quot;security entitlement&quot; is a mere relative right, therefore a contractual right.

This re-characterization of the proprietary right into a simple contractual right may enable the account provider to &quot;re-use&quot; the security without having to ask for the authorization of the investor. This is especially possible within the framework of temporary operations such as security lending, option to repurchase, buy to sell back or repurchase agreement. This system the distinction between the downward holding chain which traces the way in which the security was subscribed by the investor and the horizontal and ascending chains which trace the way in which the security has been transferred or sub-deposited.

Contrary to claims suggesting that Article 8 denies American investors their security rights held through intermediaries such as banks, Article 8 has also helped US negotiators during the negotiations of the Geneva Securities Convention, also known as the Unidroit Convention on Substantive Rules for Intermediated Securities.

==Article 9==

Article 9 governs security interests in personal property as collateral to secure a debt. A creditor with a security interest is called a &quot;secured party&quot;.

Fundamental concepts under Article 9 include how a security interest is created (called &quot;attachment&quot;); how to give notice of a security interest to the public, which makes the security interest enforceable against others who may claim an interest in the collateral (called &quot;perfection&quot;); when multiple claims to the same collateral exist, determining which interests prevail over others (called &quot;priority&quot;); and what remedies a secured party has if the debtor defaults in payment or performance of the secured obligation.

Article 9 does not govern security interests in real property, except fixtures to real property. Security interests in real property include mortgages, deeds of trusts, and installment land contracts. There may be significant legal issues around security interests in Bitcoin.

The obligee which is the debtor shall return all assets stated in the collateral to secured party after the perfection of default by secured party in response to protest by the Obligee within specified time frame in the civil code and UCC Article 9-3.

The Model Tribal Secured Transactions Act (MTSTA) is a model act written by the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) and tailored to provide Native American tribes with a legal system to govern secured transactions in Indian country. It was derived from the UCC, primarily Article 9.

==International influence==
Certain portions of the UCC have been highly influential outside of the United States. Article 2 had some influence on the drafting of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), though the result departed from the UCC in many respects (such as refusing to adopt the mailbox rule). Article 5, governing letters of credit, has been influential in international trade finance simply because so many major financial institutions operate in New York. Article 9, which established a unified framework for security interests in personal property, directly inspired the enactment of Personal Property Security Acts in every Canadian province and territory except Quebec from 1990 onwards. This was followed by New Zealand&#x27;s Personal Property Securities Act 1999 and the Australian Personal Property Securities Act of 2009.

<doc id="189564" wikidata="Q139229" url="?curid=189564" title="Saguenay, Quebec">
<text>Saguenay ( , , ) is a city in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada, on the Saguenay River, about north of Quebec City by overland route. It is about upriver and northwest of Tadoussac, located at the confluence with the St. Lawrence River. It was formed in 2002 by merging the cities of Chicoutimi and Jonquière and the town of La Baie. Chicoutimi was founded by French colonists in 1676. As of July 2021, the city had a population of 145,000 and the metropolitan area had a population of 165,000.

The city of Saguenay constitutes a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE); its geographical code is 941. Together with the regional county municipality of Le Fjord-du-Saguenay, it forms the census division (CD) of Le Saguenay-et-son-Fjord (94). The mayor of Saguenay since 2021 is Julie Dufour. Prior to its use as the name of the city, the term &quot;the Saguenay&quot; or (less commonly) &quot;Saguenay Valley&quot; had already been used for the whole Saguenay River region (see Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean). Saguenay is the seat of the judicial district of Chicoutimi.

The city is divided into three boroughs: Chicoutimi (which includes the former city of Chicoutimi, as well as Laterrière and Tremblay township), Jonquière (which includes the former city of Jonquière, Lac-Kénogami, and Shipshaw) and La Baie (which corresponds to the former city of La Baie).

The name Saguenay is possibly derived from the Innu word &quot;Saki-nip&quot;, which means &quot;where water flows out&quot;.

==History==
Saguenay was formed on February 18, 2002, by amalgamating the cities of Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie and Laterrière, along with the municipalities of Lac-Kénogami and Shipshaw and part of the township of Tremblay.

===Chicoutimi===
First Nations people, including Innus have inhabited the Saguenay Fjord area for thousands of years prior to the first Europeans arriving. What was ultimately to become the centre of the borough of Chicoutimi was first settled in 1676 as a French trading post in the fur trade. At that time, the Saguenay and Chicoutimi rivers had been used for centuries by the Innu. The name &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; means &#x27;the end of the deepwater&#x27; in the Montagnais. Chicoutimi trading post was in operation until 1782.

The city of Chicoutimi was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1845 by Peter McLeod, a Métis timber contractor, who had built a sawmill there in 1842. It was designated in 1855 as the seat of Chicoutimi County and in 1878 as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicoutimi.

With the arrival of the Canadian National Railway in 1893, the local pulp and paper industries expanded, particularly in mechanical pulp production. The Chicoutimi Pulp Co. was founded in 1896 and backed by French-Canadian investors. By 1910 the Chicoutimi Pulp Mill became the biggest producer of mechanical pulp in Canada.

The economic decline of the Great Depression led the city&#x27;s economy to shift administration and commerce and commercial. The Conservatoire de musique de Saguenay was founded in Chicoutimi in 1967, and the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi was founded in 1969. The city played host to the Quebec Summer Games in 1972.

In the municipal amalgamations of 1976, Chicoutimi annexed the neighbouring towns of Chicoutimi-Nord and Rivière-du-Moulin. In a later round of amalgamations in 2002, the cities of Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie, Lac-Kénogami, Laterrière, Shipshaw and part of Tremblay merged to form the new city of Saguenay. Chicoutimi became a borough of Saguenay.

During the summer of 1996 a record rainfall in the region caused major flooding in the downtown, as well as outlying areas. The total cost of the disaster was recorded to be C$1.5 billion. It claimed seven lives and destroyed many bridges.

===Jonquière===
Jonquière was founded in 1847 by Marguerite Belley, who came from La Malbaie to settle on the Rivière aux Sables. It was named after Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonquière, Marquis de la Jonquière, governor of New France from 1749 to 1752.

Growth came from the construction of pulp and paper mills at the beginning of the 20th century. Between 1925 and 1928, the world&#x27;s largest aluminum plant was built along with the city Arvida (then a separate town). In 1942, to supply power to the plant, Alcan built a hydroelectric station at Shipshaw that was the largest in the world at that time. Jonquière, Arvida, and Kénogami were amalgamated into a single city, Jonquière, in 1975. Jonquière was the host city for the Quebec Games in the winter of 1976, and for the Canoe/Kayak World Championships in slalom and whitewater racing, in 1979.

Much of Jonquière&#x27;s development owed its strength to the Price family, who ran a pulp and paper factory in Kénogami. Today that factory is owned by Produits Forestiers Résolu. Arvida is the home of an aluminium plant owned by Rio Tinto Alcan. Jonquière is probably best known in the United States as a result of the local Wal-Mart store which attempted to unionize and was closed down shortly thereafter. The official reason for this shutdown was &quot;financial problems.&quot;

When the city of Saguenay was constituted on February 18, 2002, by municipal amalgamation, the borough of Jonquière was created from the former city of Jonquière, the former municipality of Shipshaw, and the former municipality of Lac-Kénogami. The former city of Jonquière had a population of 54,842 in the Canada 2001 Census, the last census in which Jonquière was counted as a separate city.

The Rivière aux Sables runs through the centre of Jonquière. Significant damage to the city&#x27;s buildings was caused by the 1996 Saguenay flood.

==Geography==

Saguenay is located in a depression in the Canadian shield called the Saguenay Graben, which has a somewhat more temperate climate than the surrounding region. This has encouraged agriculture and human settlement to take place. The relatively small and concentrated Lac St-Jean area where the city is located can be described as an isolated &quot;oasis&quot; in the middle of the vast remote wilderness of Northern Quebec. No paved roads go north from the area into the wilderness; the last paved roads to the north end just a short distance from the city, and still within the Lac St-Jean area. There are no human settlements due north of Saguenay all the way to the Canadian Arctic islands, except for a few isolated Cree and Inuit villages. Few roads connect with the area from the south and east. However, the remote, paved Route 167/113 heads northwest to the interior town of Chibougamau, providing access to Western Quebec and Hudson Bay. No services are available for the to Chibougamau from the Lac St-Jean area.

Two notable natural disasters have occurred within the current municipal boundaries of Saguenay: the Saint-Jean-Vianney landslide of May 4, 1971, and the Saguenay flood of 1996. The 1988 Saguenay earthquake, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake on November 25, 1988, had its epicentre 35 km south of Chicoutimi and was felt within the city.

===Climate===
Saguenay has a humid continental climate (Köppen Climate Classification &quot;Dfb)&quot; with large variation between summer and winter. The city features two brief transition seasons (spring and autumn), while summers are warm and occasionally hot, and winters are long and very cold. Temperatures drop below on average 43 times per year and below 6 times per year. The low winter temperatures characteristic of Saguenay are caused by a combination of factors, such as the cold waters of the Labrador Current and Hudson Bay to the north and east of the city.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Saguenay was on August 18, 1935. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 5, 1916.

==Economy==
Saguenay&#x27;s economy is in transition. It is increasingly based on developing research and teaching in applied technologies for energy, aluminum, boreal forest, genomics and biomedical sciences.

Saguenay has three large industrial parks totaling of commercial facilities: five city centres and shopping centres, six shopping centres, power centres, and five major commercial arteries.

Saguenay, in the borough of La Baie, opened a pier in 2006 followed by the Bagotville wharf cruise terminal in 2009, in order to accommodate some of the larger cruise ships such as and . At least 200 cruise ships have visited La Baie, including 54 ships and over 50,000 passengers in 2017.

In addition, Rio Tinto Alcan confirmed in December 2010 investment of 750 million dollars to upgrade its pilot plant in Jonquière AP-60. The plant was estimated to be 40% more productive than the existing aluminum plant. The first phase included 38 tanks equipped with new technology, with an estimated production of 60,000 tons of aluminum per year. The first ingots were cast in the first quarter of 2013.

According to 2010 data from the Institute of Statistics of Québec (ISQ), the per capita personal income in 2009 amounted to $31,677 versus $31,344 in 2008, a variation of 1.1%. On the other hand, the GDP of the Saguenay CMA in 2009 totaled $6 billion compared to the $9.1 billion GDP of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean.

Cobalt Aircraft operates a manufacturing plant in the city. On January 17, 2011, the company chose Saguenay for the assembly plant of the aircraft Co50, an advanced, high-end propeller plane.

==Arts and culture==
Cultural events in the Saguenay region include the Saguenay International Short Film Festival ().

==Sports==
The city has been home to the QMJHL&#x27;s Chicoutimi Saguenéens since 1973. They play at the Centre Georges-Vézina in the borough of Chicoutimi.
In 2008, the LNAH professional team Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu Summun-Chiefs moved to Saguenay and became the Saguenay 98.3. The team is now called Jonquière Marquis.

==Government==

===Municipal===


Julie Dufour has been mayor of Saguenay since 2021. Josée Néron served as mayor from 2017 to 2021. Jean Tremblay had previously served as mayor of Saguenay from the municipal merger of 2002 until 2017. He was also mayor of the now defunct city of Chicoutimi from 1997 until 2001. The governing body of Saguenay is Saguenay City Council, which consists of the mayor and 15 city councillors. The councillors are elected from single-member districts.

The city&#x27;s three boroughs are Jonquière, Chicoutimi, and La Baie. Each borough is subdivided into electoral districts, with each district being represented by a city councillor. Each borough has a borough president from among their city councilors.

===Federal and provincial===


Federally, Saguenay is part of two electoral districts. The riding of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, which includes the boroughs of Chicoutimi and La Baie as well as most of the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality, and the riding of Jonquière, which includes the borough of Jonquière as well as the southern part and parts of the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay RCM.

Provincially, Saguenay is represented in four electoral districts. The electoral district of Chicoutimi includes the former city of Chicoutimi, and is represented by Andrée Laforest of the Coalition Avenir Québec. The electoral district of Dubuc, which covers the part of Saguenay as well as the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay RCM, is represented by François Tremblay of the Coalition Avenir Québec. The electoral district of Jonquière, which covers most of the borough of Jonquière, is represented by Sylvain Gaudreault of the Parti Québécois.

==Infrastructure==
Thrice weekly passenger railway service is provided by Via Rail on the Montreal–Jonquière train, which runs from Montreal Central Station to Jonquière station.

The city is connected by highway to Quebec City by Quebec Route 175 to its south, and is also served by Quebec Route 172 and Quebec Route 170, which run east–west to the north and south of the Saguenay River, respectively.

The city is also served by the Bagotville Airport, which shares the Canadian Forces Base Bagotville aerodrome. It operates daily flights to Montreal-Trudeau International Airport as well as flights to Quebec City and Sept-Îles. It operates seasonal flights to Cancún, Mexico, and vacation destinations in Cuba. Another airfield, the former Chicoutimi/Saint-Honoré Aerodrome air force base, is located to the north of the city.

A pier in La Baie has been in operation since 2008 to accommodate cruise ships and tourists. The project required investment of about $33.75 million for the construction of a wharf, a visitor centre ($5 million) and a port village.

Saguenay derives power from its water resources. The city owns three hydroelectric power stations, one operating in the borough of Jonquière and two others, Pont-Arnaud and Chute-Garneau, in operation since spring 2011.

Saguenay is one of several &quot;megacities&quot; where the pre-merger telephone rate centres have never been amalgamated. It is still split between four rate centres–Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie and Laterrière. As a result, North American telephone customers placing calls to Saguenay may not recognize the charge details on their bills.

==Education==

The francophone primary and secondary public schools of Saguenay are managed by two boards, the School Board of Jonquière, which has 11,015 students and the school board of Rives-du-Saguenay, with 11,048 students. These figures include 38 primary schools, seven secondary schools and five vocational training centres in the city, and institutions of neighboring municipalities of Upper and Lower Saguenay. The private elementary Apostolic School of Chicoutimi has 160 students. The Seminary of Chicoutimi has 1,100 high school students. Saguenay also has primary and secondary schools in English, with 200 students; Riverside Regional School is the responsibility of the Central Québec School Board.

At the college level, Saguenay has two colleges, located in Jonquière and in Chicoutimi, with a combined 5,500 students. In addition to offering pre-university programs, and similar curricula, each of the schools has unique programs. For example, the Cégep de Jonquière offers technical training in Art and Media Technology, while that of Chicoutimi offers technical training in piloting aircraft.

The University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC) is located in Saguenay; this francophone campus of the province&#x27;s network has 6,500 students. It provides education at university level. As the only university in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, this campus attracts students from across Quebec and la Francophonie. Located near downtown, the Chicoutimi campus includes a sports pavilion and the pavilion of the Humanities. The university has a flagship research centre in Arctic ice and other conditions; departments of Forestry, Medicine, and Arts; and the centre of aluminium technology.

===Research===
Saguenay has several main components of the regional aluminum sector: the Quebec Centre for Research and Development of Aluminum (CQRDA), the Centre for Aluminum Technology of UQAC (CTA), the University Centre for Aluminium Research (CURAL), and college and government training programs.

In 2007, the Quebec government announced, in conjunction with Genome Quebec, Université de Montréal, the Centre for Health and Social Services and UQAC Chicoutimi, the creation of a biobank specializing in genomics research. The CSSS de Chicoutimi also specializes in research in primary care medicine and chronic illness and the rehabilitation of neuromuscular disorders.

<text>Emden () is an independent city and seaport in Lower Saxony in the northwest of Germany, on the river Ems. It is the main city of the region of East Frisia and, in 2011, had a total population of 51,528.

==History==

The exact founding date of Emden is unknown, but it has existed at least since the 8th century. Older names for Emden are Setutanda, Amuthon, Embda, Emda, Embden and Embderland. Town privilege and the town&#x27;s coat of arms, the &quot;Engelke up de Muer&quot; (The Little Angel on the Wall) was granted by Emperor Maximilian I in 1495. 

In the 16th century, Emden briefly became an important centre for the Protestant Reformation under the rule of Countess Anna von Oldenburg who was determined to find a religious &quot;third way&quot; between Lutheranism and Catholicism. In 1542 she invited the Polish noble John Laski (or &quot;Johannes a Lasco&quot;) to become pastor of a Protestant church at Emden, and for seven years he continued to spread the new religion around the area of East Frisia. However, in 1549 following pressure from the Emperor Charles V, the Countess was forced to ask Laski to leave for England and the experiment came to an end. Nevertheless, the legacy was important for the reformation in the Netherlands. 

At the end of the 16th century, Emden experienced a period of great prosperity. Due to the Spanish blockade of Flemish and Brabant ports at the start of the Dutch Revolt, Emden became the most important transshipment port on the North Sea. Thousands of Protestant refugees came from Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant to the Protestant city Emden to escape persecution by the Spanish rulers of the Low Countries. During this period, the predominantly Calvinist Emden came into conflict with the Lutheran counts of East Friesland. 

The Emden Revolution in 1595 resulted in Emden becoming a distinct city-state. With the support of the Dutch Republic, Emden became a free government city under the protection of the Dutch Republic. The Brabantian dialect became the official language of trade and civil administration. Emden was a very rich city during the 17th century, due to large numbers of Dutch and Flemish immigrants such as Diederik Jansz. Graeff. It was a centre of reformed Protestantism at that time. The political theorist Johannes Althusius served as Syndic from 1604 to 1638. 

In 1744, Emden was annexed by Prussia. The Emden Convention, signed on 14 March 1744, was a treaty that formalised Prussia&#x27;s annexation of East Frisia after the local Cirksena dynasty died out. It recognised the rights and privileges of the city of Emden and the regional estates. Carl Edzard, the last Count of East Frisia, assumed power in 1734 but faced opposition from Emden and other estates, leading to political and economic isolation. Emden sought to regain its status as a trading hub and looked to Prussia for help. In exchange for recognising Prussia’s claim to East Frisia, Emden demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops, the return of sequestered assets, and the relocation of the estate treasury to Emden. Prussia, under Frederick II, aimed to secure its claim to East Frisia, relying on a 1694 decree from Emperor Leopold I. Negotiations led by Sebastian Anton Homfeld resulted in two treaties signed on 14 March 1744. These agreements upheld Emden’s status and granted the city special economic and administrative privileges. After Carl Edzard’s death on 25 May 1744, Prussia quickly occupied East Frisia without resistance, and the region soon swore allegiance to the Prussian crown. Foreign troops withdrew from the area.

In 1752 Frederick the Great chartered the Emden Company to trade with Canton, but the company was ruined when Emden was captured by French forces in 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The city was recaptured by Anglo-German forces in 1758 and for the rest of the conflict was used as a major supply base by the British to support the ongoing war in Westphalia. During the Napoleonic Wars, Emden and the surrounding lands of East Frisia were part of the short-lived Kingdom of Holland. 

Industrialization started at around 1870, with a paper mill and a somewhat bigger shipyard. At the end of the 19th century, a big canal, the Dortmund-Ems Canal was constructed, which connected Emden with the Ruhr area. This made Emden the &quot;seaport of the Ruhr area&quot;, which lasted until the 1970s. Coal from the south was transported to the North Sea port, and imported iron ore was shipped via the canal towards Rhine and the Ruhr. The last iron ore freighter was moored in the port of Emden in 1986. In 1903, a large shipyard (&quot;Nordseewerke&quot;, &quot;North Sea Works&quot;) was founded and was in operation until 2010. 

During World War II, Emden was repeatedly targeted by Allied bombing raids, which destroyed the majority of the city center. The Royal Air Force (RAF) launched its first bombing raid over Emden in 31 March 1940, and both the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) continued to launch raids against the city for the duration of the war. On 6 September 1944, the RAF and USAAF launched their largest bombing raid against Emden, which destroyed approximately 80% of all structures in the city center. However, the Emden shipyards, in contrast to the rest of the city, was left largely unaffected by the bombing raids. After the war, Emden came under Allied occupation and rebuilding efforts commenced. On 6 September 1962, exactly 18 years after the 1944 raid, the current Emden city hall was officially opened.

==Economy==
The main industries in Emden are automobile production and shipbuilding. Volkswagen runs a large production plant which builds the Volkswagen Passat car and which employs around 10,000 people. Emden harbor is also one of the three main ports for car shipping in Europe (together with Zeebrugge in Belgium and Bremerhaven in Germany). Emden is the main location from which vehicles produced at all Volkswagen Group factories in Germany are marshalled for export overseas.

More than 1.4 million cars were imported and exported in 2017. The &quot;Nordseewerke&quot; shipyard, a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp, employs around 1,400 dockers and specializes in conventional submarines. It also produces different kinds of cargo ships as well as ships for special purposes such as icebreakers, dredgers and other ships of that type.

Another important economic sector is tourism, mainly as a day trip destination for tourists staying in the surrounding villages on the North Sea coastline.

A university of applied sciences () was opened in 1973. At present, around 4,240 students are enrolled, most of them studying for technical degrees.

The airline Ostfriesische Lufttransport had its headquarters in Emden.

==Sports==
The highest playing association football club is BSV Kickers Emden. The capacity of the stadium is 7,200, due to safety objections of the German Football Association. In 1994, some 12,000 spectators followed a match against the reserves squad of Hamburger SV, which remains the record. In that season, Kickers Emden finished top of the 3rd League, but were not promoted to the Second League as they lost the promotion round.

Since Emden is not only located close to the North Sea, but also to the river Ems and various small rivers and canals, boat sports are very popular among inhabitants and tourists.

A deep sea spot in the Pacific Ocean close to the Philippines is named after the first ship, and is therefore called &quot;Emdentief&quot; in German. The spot ( deep) was sounded in the 1920s (in 1920, 1923 or 1928—sources vary).

The word &quot;Yamandan&quot; and &quot;Emden&quot; entered the lexicons of Malayalam and Tamil respectively after the bombing of Madras Harbour in 1914 by SMS Emden. The word in the local language means a humongous or huge and sometimes &quot;a person who dares and works with precision&quot;.

In addition, the village of Emden, Illinois in the United States was named after Jacob Emden due to the large number of emigrants from Emden to the village in northwestern Logan County, Illinois. Other places in the U.S. named after the city include Emden, Missouri; Embden, Maine; and Embden, North Dakota.

<text>Longueuil () is a city in the province of Quebec, Canada. It is the seat of the Montérégie administrative region and the central city of the urban agglomeration of Longueuil. It sits on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River directly across from Montreal. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census totalled 254,483, making it Montreal&#x27;s second largest suburb, the fifth most populous city in Quebec and twentieth largest in Canada.

Charles Le Moyne founded Longueuil as a &quot;seigneurie&quot; in 1657. It would become a parish in 1845, a village in 1848, a town in 1874 and a city in 1920. Between 1961 and 2002, Longueuil&#x27;s borders grew three times, as it was amalgamated with surrounding municipalities; there was a strong de-amalgamation in 2006 (see 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec).

Longueuil is a residential, commercial and industrial city. It incorporates some urban features, but is essentially a suburb. Longueuil can be classified as a commuter town as a large portion of its residents commute to work in Montreal. Most buildings are single-family homes constructed in the post-war period. The city consists of three boroughs: Le Vieux-Longueuil, Saint-Hubert and Greenfield Park.

Longueuil is the seat of the judicial district of Longueuil. Residents of the city are called &quot;Longueuillois&quot;.

==History==
The territory of New France was divided into seigneuries in order to ensure the colony&#x27;s defence. Longueuil was founded in 1657 by Charles Le Moyne, a merchant from Ville-Marie (present day Montreal), as a seigneurie. According to Abbé Faillon, Charles Le Moyne, lord of the area starting in 1657, named Longueuil after the village of Longueil (note slightly different spelling) which is today the seat of a canton in the district of Dieppe in his homeland of Normandy.

His son, Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil, built Fort Longueuil as his fortified residence. It was constructed of stone between 1685 and 1690 and had four towers.

Fort Longueuil was believed to be occupied by American troops during the American Revolutionary War. It was subsequently occupied by the British. It was demolished in 1810 due to its poor condition. The archaeological remains of Fort Longueuil were recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on May 25, 1923. The site extends beneath the present-day Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral.

The seigneurial system ended in 1845 and Longueuil was turned into a parish municipality named Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil. In 1848, a portion detached from the parish and officially established as the village of Longueuil. This same village became a town in 1874, and then a city in 1920. Musician Paul Pratt notably served as the city&#x27;s mayor from 1935 to 1966.

Longueuil&#x27;s city limits expanded for the first time in 1961 when it merged with Montréal-Sud, and again in 1969 when it merged with Ville Jacques-Cartier. In both cases, Longueuil was chosen as the name of the new city.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec, the provincial government amalgamated the former Longueuil with Boucherville, Brossard, Greenfield Park, LeMoyne, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Saint-Hubert and Saint-Lambert. As with the 1960s, the name Longueuil was chosen for the new city. However, after a change of government and a 2004 referendum, Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Lambert and Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville were re-constituted as independent cities on January 1, 2006. As such, the current city of Longueuil now includes only the former cities of Longueuil (1969–2002), Saint-Hubert, Greenfield Park and LeMoyne.

==Geography==

Longueuil occupies 115.59 square kilometres (44.6 sq mi) of land. The city is bordered by the cities of Saint-Lambert to the west, Brossard to the southwest, Boucherville to the northeast, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville to the east, and the Saint Lawrence River and Montreal to the northwest. The city of Longueuil is located approximately 7 kilometres (5 mi) east of Montreal on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River.

Longueuil is located in the Saint Lawrence River valley, and is a vast plain. Areas near the river were originally swamp land with mixed forest, and later prime agricultural land. Agricultural land still exists in the portions of the city furthest from the river.

The city of Longueuil also includes Île Charron, a small island in the Saint Lawrence River, and part of the Boucherville Islands.

Street addresses in Longueuil increase west and east from the Chemin de Chambly, with suffixes of &quot;Ouest&quot; and &quot;Est&quot; used on east–west streets that cross it, and south from the Saint Lawrence River. (As in Montreal, the local cardinal directions are skewed to align with the shore of the river, and local grid &quot;north&quot; is closer to geographic northwest.)

===Climate===

<text>Jonquière (; ; 2021 population: 60,250) is a borough (arrondissement) of the city of Saguenay in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada. It is located on the Saguenay River, near the borough of Chicoutimi.

==History==

Jonquière was founded in 1847 by Marguerite Belley, who came from La Malbaie to settle on the Rivière aux Sables. It was named after Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonquière, Marquis de la Jonquière, governor of New France from 1749 to 1752.
Growth came from the construction of pulp and paper mills at the beginning of the 20th century. Between 1925 and 1928, the world&#x27;s largest aluminum plant was built along with the city Arvida (then a separate town). In 1942, to supply power to the plant, Alcan built a hydroelectric station at Shipshaw that was the largest in the world at that time. Jonquière, Arvida and Kénogami were amalgamated into the single city of Jonquière in 1975. Jonquière was the host city for the Quebec Games in the winter of 1976 and for the Canoe/Kayak World Championships in slalom and whitewater racing in 1979.

Much of Jonquière&#x27;s development owed its strength to the Price family, who ran a pulp and paper factory in Kénogami. Today that factory is owned by Resolute Forest Products. Arvida is the home of an aluminium plant owned by Rio Tinto Alcan.

When the city of Saguenay was constituted on February 18, 2002 by municipal amalgamation, the borough of Jonquière was created from the former city of Jonquière, the former municipality of Shipshaw, and the former municipality of Lac-Kénogami. The former city of Jonquière had a population of 54,842 in the Canada 2001 Census, the last census in which Jonquière was counted as a separate city.

The heavy metal band Voivod formed in Jonquière.

The Rivière aux Sables runs through the centre of Jonquière. Significant damage to the city&#x27;s buildings was caused by the 1996 Saguenay Flood.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
Jonquière is the northern terminus of the Montreal–Jonquière passenger train operated by Via Rail. Three round-trip trains per week run between Jonquière station and Montreal Central Station, scheduled to take about nine hours each way. This route is shared by the Montreal–Senneterre train as far as Hervey station. From Montreal, passengers can connect to trains serving major destinations such as Quebec City, Ottawa, Toronto, Halifax, and New York City.

<doc id="189571" wikidata="Q2449604" url="?curid=189571" title="Uniform Anatomical Gift Act">
<text>The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), and its periodic revisions, is one of the Uniform Acts drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), also known as the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), in the United States with the intention of harmonizing state laws between the states.

The UAGA governs organ donations for the purpose of transplantation. The Act permits any adult to become an organ donor. It also governs the making of anatomical gifts of one&#x27;s cadaver to be dissected in the study of medicine. The law prescribes the forms by which such gifts can be made. It also provides that in the absence of such a document, a surviving spouse, or if there is no spouse, a list of specific relatives in order of preference, can make the gift. It also seeks to limit the liability of health care providers who act on good faith representations that a deceased patient meant to make an anatomical gift. The Act also prohibits trafficking and trafficking in human organs for profit from donations for transplant or therapy.

The UAGA provides a template for the legislation to adjust public policy and align it with developments in medical practice. Some states have their own version of the UAGA which is an updated version of the Uniform laws already enacted throughout the United States.

==History==
There were three versions of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act that were enacted; the first was the UAGA of 1968, which was followed up with revisions in 1987. The most recent version was created in 2006. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act has been established in some form, in every state and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as of 2017.

The law has been revised to make the process of making an anatomical gift more streamlined, and to promote organ donation to citizens in order to address the high demand for donated organs for transplantation. The demand for donated organs is extremely high due to the fact that a large number of people die while waiting for an organ transplant in the United States. As of 2016, there were fewer registered organ donors than people in need of an organ or tissue transplant.

Formerly, anatomical gifts had to be executed with testamentary formalities, including the creation of a written document with two witnesses; the latest version of the statute eliminates the requirement of the witnesses. Medical examiners and medical professionals who cared for a patient upon their death were previously permitted to remove a part of a body if there was no known next of kin, or if the body was unidentified. This change is to encourage the practice of allowing an anatomical gift to be made by a notation on a driver&#x27;s license.

=== The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1968 ===
The first Uniform Anatomical Gift Act was created after the first successful heart transplant in 1967; the operation was performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard. In 1968, Congress approved the UAGA and recommended that all states adopt it. The Act was the first legislation enacted by all states in United States to address the donation of organs, tissues, and eyes as gifts to someone who may be in need of an organ for survival. The UAGA was drafted in order to increase organ and blood supplies and donation and to protect patients in the United States. It replaced numerous state laws concerning transplantation and laws lacking a uniform procedure of organ donation and an inadequate process of becoming a donor.

All states adopted the original version of the law.

=== The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1987 ===
In 1987, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1968 was revised so that there was a uniform manner of obtaining consent from individuals. At this time, every state enacted at least some part of the UAGA. The provisions of the UAGA of 1968 would ban the purchase and sale of body parts, facilitate the simplified process of obtaining authorization to retrieve organs, and ensure that medical staff establish procedures and guidelines to identify organ donors while under hospital care. The Act also characterized a body part or organ as property because of the ability of a living individual to gift parts of their body to another individual. Another major statement that this revised version of the UAGA made was that a coroner&#x27;s investigation or an autopsy could not be obstructed by an individual&#x27;s wish for organ donation. The 1987 UAGA regulated organs for the purposes of transplantation or therapy. In addition, the individual&#x27;s wishes to donate were prioritized over the family&#x27;s or next of kin&#x27;s wishes. Hospitals were authorized to retrieve organs if an individual was found to have documentation of consenting.

The Act&#x27;s revisions were enacted by 26 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

=== The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 ===

==== Summary ====
In 2006, The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act was revised with three main goals: motivating more of the population to make anatomical gifts, making honoring an individual&#x27;s wishes to donate a priority, and maintaining the current organ donation and transplantation system in the United States. It also has the purpose of setting rules and guidelines for determining the purposes that one had for choosing to make a gift as well as the purpose of the gift of an organ, eye, or tissue itself. The UAGA was revised to accommodate the developments in medicine and science regarding organ donation and transplantation, as well as the regulations of donation and transplantation with the goal of increasing the supply of gifted organs. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 was revised to make the laws governing anatomical gifts more uniform between states that had enacted and continued to enforce the UAGA of 1968 and ones that had enacted the revised UAGA of 1987, leading to more consistency.

==== Revisions ====
The UAGA of 2006 allows for individuals to consent to organ donation by expressing their wish when obtaining a driver&#x27;s license, through verbal expression, by writing it in a will or other advance directive, or in any other manner, simplifying the consent process. This is also known as &quot;opting in&quot; to organ donation. In some states, one may register to become an organ donor online on a state&#x27;s Donor Registry website, and an individual is permitted to choose which organs they wish to donate by checking boxes. An important addition to the UAGA of 2006 was the strengthening of certain language regarding one&#x27;s right to make a decision for themselves pertaining to consent of organ donation, making it harder for others to try to nullify one&#x27;s wish to consent after their death. The only exception allowing an individual&#x27;s consent to donate to be overridden is in the case of the death of a minor when parents or guardians may override the minor&#x27;s consent. Language in the Act is also made more clear so that one cannot revoke an anatomical gift as the donor&#x27;s decision is final. This revised UAGA additionally created legislation allowing certain people to make an anatomical gift to another person while the donating individual is still alive. It is stated that it&#x27;s the duty of law enforcement officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other emergency personnel to search for the records of donor consent upon death. Another significant addition to the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 is the rule of making transplantation or therapy prioritized over research or education with an anatomical gift when a donor&#x27;s wishes are unclearly stated in documentation.

The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 clarifies words written in the law that formerly were ambiguous and confusing such as: anatomical gift, record, refusal, guardian, prospective donor, reasonably available, and disinterested witness.

The UAGA revision of 2006 makes it a felony punishable by a fine or prison to falsify, deface, or destroy organ donor documentation of another.

Many states have drafted and enacted their own updated versions of the UAGA based on the revisions of 2006.

=== Legislation status of UAGA in the U.S. ===
In the United States, all states have enacted some version of the UAGA. States have the authority to use the Uniform Anatomical Gift Acts as a template to put additional revisions into law depending on what best fits the state&#x27;s needs.
== Ethical concerns ==
The UAGA does not specify regulations for organ donation by a prisoner or prohibit an inmate from donating their body or an organ. Christian Longo, a convicted murderer, has played a key role in rousing public debate regarding the rights of the incarcerated to become organ donors.

The retrieval of gametes from the deceased have been the subject of controversy because of the highly publicized court case &quot;In re Matter of Daniel Thomas Christy&quot; in Iowa, regarding the right to retrieve reproductive cells (posthumous sperm retrieval) from a deceased spouse or partner. The argument against the retrieval of post mortem gametes in this case was that the UAGA stated the purposes of donation were for transplantation, therapy, research, or education.

Since the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act was put into effect in all states, there still has been a donor shortage in the United States.

<doc id="189576" wikidata="Q335484" url="?curid=189576" title="A. L. Rowse">
<text>Alfred Leslie Rowse (4 December 1903 – 3 October 1997) was a British historian and writer, best known for his work on Elizabethan England and books relating to Cornwall.

Born in Cornwall and raised in modest circumstances, he was encouraged to study for Oxford by fellow-Cornishman Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College and later appointed lecturer at Merton College. Best known of his many works was &quot;The Elizabethan Age&quot; trilogy. His work on Shakespeare included a claim to have identified the &quot;Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot; as Emilia Lanier, which attracted much interest from scholars, but also many counterclaims. Rowse was in popular demand as a lecturer in North America.

In the 1930s, he stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Penryn and Falmouth, though later in life he became a Conservative.

==Life and politics==
Rowse was born at Tregonissey, near St Austell, Cornwall, the son of Annie (née Vanson) and Richard Rowse, a china clay worker. Despite his modest origins and his parents&#x27; limited education, he won a place at St Austell County Grammar School and then a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1921. He was encouraged in his pursuit of an academic career by a fellow Cornish man of letters, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, of Polperro, who recognised his ability from an early age. Rowse endured doubting comments about his paternity, thus he paid particular attention to his mother&#x27;s association with a local farmer and butcher from Polgooth, near St Austell, Frederick William May (1872–1953). Any such frustrations were channelled into academia, which reaped him dividends later in life.

Rowse had planned to study English literature, having developed an early love of poetry, but was persuaded to read history. He was a popular undergraduate and made many friendships that lasted for life. He graduated with first class honours in 1925 and was elected a fellow of All Souls College the same year. In 1927 Rowse was appointed lecturer at Merton College, where he stayed until 1930. He then became a lecturer at the London School of Economics. In 1929, he proceeded to a Master of Arts degree. While at Oxford, Rowse met Adam von Trott zu Solz who was attending Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. Rowse became deeply infatuated with Trott, a man whom he madly loved and who influenced his thinking about Germany. Trott took Rowse on a number of tours of Berlin, Hamburg and Dresden to introduce him to German high culture. Rowse&#x27;s biographer, Richard Ollard, described Trott as &quot;...the most longest and most intense love&quot; of Rowse&#x27;s life, a man whom he was never able to get over despite a rift that had developed between them by the late 1930s. Rowse described Trott as &quot;six feet tall&quot; and &quot;well aware of his shattering beauty&quot;, but complained that he was &quot;fundamentally heterosexual&quot;. He later stated that his relationship with Trott was &quot;an ideal love-affair, platonic in a philosophical sense; we never exchanged a kiss, let alone an embrace. We were both extremely high-minded, perhaps too much so&quot;. 

In 1931, Rowse contested the parliamentary seat of Penryn and Falmouth for the Labour Party, but was unsuccessful, finishing third behind a Liberal. In the general election of 1935 he again stood unsuccessfully, but managed to finish in second place, ahead of the Liberal. In both the 1931 and 1935 elections, Maurice Petherick was returned as a Conservative MP to Parliament, albeit with a minority of the vote. Rowse supported calls made by Sir Stafford Cripps and others for a &quot;Popular Front&quot;. Cripps was expelled from the Labour Party for his views. In 1937, Rowse wrote in his diary: &quot;My emotional life was engulfed in Adam, quite anguished enough in itself&quot;. By this point, Rowse and Trott were drifting apart as Trott sought to make a diplomatic career in the highly elitist &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; (Foreign Office), which offended Rowse as serving in the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; meant serving the Nazis. Moreover, Trott was a German ultra-nationalist committed to recovering all of the lands lost under the Treaty of Versailles, which led him to a certain support for Nazi foreign policy, a position that Rowse could not accept. Trott&#x27;s viewpoint that he did not particularly like the Nazis, but was willing to serve them insofar as Nazi foreign policy was aimed at undoing the Treaty of Versailles was dismissed by Rowse as amoral. 

Rowse worked to get agreement by Labour and Liberal parties in Devon and Cornwall, making a common cause with the Liberal MP Sir Richard Acland. A general election was expected to take place in 1939, and Rowse, who was again Labour&#x27;s candidate for Penryn &amp; Falmouth, was not expected to have a Liberal opponent. That would increase his chances of winning. But, due to outbreak of war, the election did not take place and his political career was effectively ended.

Undeterred, Rowse chose to continue his career by seeking administrative positions at Oxford becoming Sub-Warden of All Souls College. In 1952, he failed in his candidacy for election as Warden against John Sparrow. Shortly afterwards he began what became regular trips to The Huntington Library in Southern California, where for many years he was a senior research fellow. He received a doctorate (DLitt) from Oxford University in 1953. After delivering the British Academy&#x27;s 1957 Raleigh Lecture on history about Sir Richard Grenville&#x27;s place in English history, Rowse was selected as a fellow of the academy (FBA) in 1958.

Rowse published about 100 books. By the mid-20th century, he was a celebrated author and much-travelled lecturer, especially in the United States. He also published many popular articles in newspapers and magazines in Great Britain and the United States. His brilliance was widely recognised. His knack for the sensational, as well as his academic boldness (which some considered to be irresponsible carelessness), sustained his reputation. His opinions on rival popular historians, such as Hugh Trevor-Roper and A. J. P. Taylor, were expressed sometimes in very ripe terms. In 1977, he sparked much controversy with his book &quot;Homosexuals in History&quot; which linked creativity in the arts with being gay. Rowse wrote that his book was a study on the &quot;predisposing conditions of creativeness, the psychological rewards of ambivalence, the doubled response to life, the sharping of perception, the tensions that led to achievement&quot;. &quot;Homosexuals in History&quot; attracted critical reviews as some of the artists identified as being gay in the book were based on only circumstantial evidence; the book had no footnotes or endnotes; his theory of a connection between artistic creativity and homosexuality was ill-defined; and his opinionated writing style full of arch comments alienated many. The American scholar Richard Aldrich wrote that for its flaws &quot;Homosexuals in History&quot; was one of the first serious studies in gay history and that many of the artists whom Rowse &quot;outed&quot; in his book were indeed gay, which marked the first time that this aspects of their lives was discussed in a mainstream book. 

In his later years, Rowse moved increasingly towards the political right, and many considered him to be part of the Tory tradition by the time he died. One of Rowse&#x27;s lifelong themes in his books and articles was his condemnation of the Conservative-dominated National Government&#x27;s policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and the economic and political consequences for Great Britain of fighting a Second World War with Germany. He also criticised his former Labour Party colleagues–including George Lansbury, Kingsley Martin and Richard Crossman—for endorsing appeasement, writing &quot;not one of the Left intellectuals could republish what they wrote in the Thirties without revealing what idiotic judgments they made about events.&quot; Another was his horror at the degradation of standards in modern society. He is reported as saying: &quot;... this filthy twentieth century. I hate its guts&quot;.

Despite international academic success, Rowse remained proud of his Cornish roots. He retired from Oxford in 1973 to Trenarren House, his Cornish home, from where he remained active as writer, reviewer and conversationalist until immobilised by a stroke in 1996. He died at home on 3 October 1997. His ashes are buried in the Campdowns Cemetery, Charlestown near St Austell.

===Elizabethan and Shakespearean scholarship===
Rowse&#x27;s early works focus on 16th-century England and his first full-length historical monograph, &quot;Sir Richard Grenville of the Revenge&quot; (1937), was a biography of a 16th-century sailor. His next was &quot;Tudor Cornwall&quot; (1941), a lively detailed account of Cornish society in the 16th century. He consolidated his reputation with a one-volume general history of England, &quot;The Spirit of English History&quot; (1943), but his most important work was the historical trilogy &quot;The Elizabethan Age&quot;: &quot;The England of Elizabeth&quot; (1950), &quot;The Expansion of Elizabethan England&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Elizabethan Renaissance&quot; (1971–72), respectively examine the society, overseas exploration, and culture of late 16th-century England.

In 1963 Rowse began to concentrate on William Shakespeare, starting with a biography in which he claimed to have dated all the sonnets, identified Christopher Marlowe as the suitor&#x27;s rival and solved all but one of the other problems posed by the sonnets. His failure to acknowledge his reliance upon the work of other scholars alienated some of his peers, but he won popular acclaim. In 1973 he published &quot;Shakespeare the Man&quot;, in which he claimed to have solved the final problem – the identity of the &#x27;Dark Lady&#x27;: from a close reading of the sonnets and the diaries of Simon Forman, he asserted that she must have been Emilia Lanier, whose poems he would later collect. He suggested that Shakespeare had been influenced by the feud between the Danvers and Long families in Wiltshire, when he wrote &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The Danverses were friends of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton.

Rowse&#x27;s &quot;discoveries&quot; about Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets amount to the following:

# The Fair Youth was the 19-year-old Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, extremely handsome and bisexual.
# The sonnets were written 1592–1594/5.
# The &quot;rival poet&quot; was Christopher Marlowe.
# The &quot;Dark Lady&quot; was Emilia Lanier. His use of the diaries of Simon Forman, which contained material about her, influenced other scholars.
# Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s death is recorded in the sonnets.
# Shakespeare was a heterosexual man, who was faced with an unusual situation when the handsome, young, bisexual Earl of Southampton fell in love with him.

Rowse was dismissive of those who rejected his views. He supported his conclusions. In the case of Shakespeare&#x27;s sexuality, he emphasised the playwright&#x27;s heterosexual inclinations by noting that he had impregnated an older woman by the time he was 18, and was consequently obliged to marry her. Moreover, he fathered three children by the time he was 21. In the sonnets, Shakespeare&#x27;s explicit erotic interest lies with the Dark Lady; he obsesses about her. Shakespeare was still married and Rowse believes he was having an extramarital affair.

===Personal attitudes===

The diary excerpts published in 2003 reveal that &quot;he was an overt even rather proud homosexual in a pre-Wolfenden age, fascinated by young policemen and sailors, obsessively speculating on the sexual proclivities of everyone he meets&quot;. Much later, following retirement, he said, &quot;of course, I used to be a homo; but now, when it doesn&#x27;t matter, if anything I&#x27;m a hetero&quot;.

He was aware of his own intelligence from earliest childhood, and obsessed that others either did not accept this fact, or not quickly enough. The diaries describe what he said were &quot;a series of often inane jealousies&quot;.

He described a &quot;Slacker State&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to have my money scalped off me to maintain other people&#x27;s children. I don&#x27;t like other people; I particularly don&#x27;t like their children; I deeply disapprove of their proliferation making the globe uninhabitable. The fucking idiots – I don&#x27;t want to pay for their fucking.&quot;

==Literary career==
Rowse&#x27;s first book was &quot;On History, a Study of Present Tendencies&quot; published in 1927 as the seventh volume of Kegan Paul&#x27;s &quot;Psyche Miniature General Series&quot;. In 1931 he contributed to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s quarterly review &quot;The Criterion&quot;. In 1935 he co-edited Charles Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Essays in Cornish History&quot; for the Clarendon Press. His best-seller was his first volume of autobiography, &quot;A Cornish Childhood&quot;, first published by Jonathan Cape in 1942, which has gone on to sell nearly half a million copies worldwide. It describes his hard struggle to get to the University of Oxford and his love/hate relationship with Cornwall.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, he served as the General Editor for the popular &quot;Teach Yourself History&quot; and &quot;Men and their Times&quot; series, published by the English Universities Press.

Rowse wrote poetry all his life. He contributed poems to &quot;Public School Verse&quot; whilst at St Austell Grammar School. He also had verse published in &quot;Oxford 1923&quot;, &quot;Oxford 1924&quot;, and &quot;Oxford 1925&quot;. His collected poems &quot;A Life&quot; were published in 1981. The poetry is mainly autobiographical, descriptive of place (especially Cornwall) and people he knew and cared for, e.g. &quot;The Progress of Love&quot;, which describes his platonic love for Adam von Trott, a handsome and aristocratic German youth who studied at Oxford in the 1930s and who was later executed for his part in the July Plot of 1944 to kill Hitler. Unusually for a British poet, Rowse wrote a great number of poems inspired by American scenery.

His most controversial book (at the time of publication) was on the subject of human sexuality: &quot;Homosexuals in History&quot; (1977).

===Biographer===
He wrote other biographies of English historical and literary figures, and many other historical works. His biographies include studies of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and the Earl of Southampton, the major players in the sonnets, as well as later luminaries of English literature such as John Milton, Jonathan Swift and Matthew Arnold. A devoted cat-lover, he also wrote the biographies of several cats who came to live with him at Trenarren, claiming that it was as much a challenge to write the biography of a favourite cat as it was a Queen of England. He also published a number of short stories, mainly about Cornwall, of interest more for their thinly veiled autobiographical resonances than their literary merit. His last book, &quot;My View of Shakespeare&quot;, published in 1996, summed up his life-time&#x27;s appreciation of &quot;The Bard of Stratford&quot;. The book was dedicated &quot;&quot;To HRH The Prince of Wales in common devotion to William Shakespeare&quot;.&quot;

===Bibliophile===
One of Rowse&#x27;s great enthusiasms was collecting books, and he owned many first editions, many of them bearing his acerbic annotations. For example, his copy of the January 1924 edition of &quot;The Adelphi&quot; magazine edited by John Middleton Murry bears a pencilled note after Murry&#x27;s poem &quot;In Memory of Katherine Mansfield&quot;: &#x27;Sentimental gush on the part of JMM. And a bad poem. A.L.R.&#x27;

Upon his death in 1997 he bequeathed his book collection to the University of Exeter, and his personal archive of manuscripts, diaries, and correspondence. In 1998 the University Librarian selected about sixty books from Rowse&#x27;s own working library and a complete set of his published books. The Royal Institution of Cornwall selected some of the remaining books and the rest were sold to dealers. The London booksellers Heywood Hill produced two catalogues of books from his library.

==Honours==
Rowse was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS) and of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL).

In addition to his DLitt (Oxon) degree (1953), Rowse received the honorary degrees of DLitt from the University of Exeter in 1960 and DCL from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada, the same year.

In 1968 he was made a Bard of Gorseth Kernow, taking the bardic name &quot;Lef A Gernow&quot; (&#x27;Voice of Cornwall&#x27;), reflecting his high standing in the Cornish community.

He was elected to the Athenaeum Club under Rule II in 1972, and received the Benson Medal of the Royal Society of Literature in 1982.

Rowse was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1997 New Year Honours.

==Posthumous reputation==

As well as his own appearances on radio and television, Rowse has been depicted in various TV drama documentaries about British politics in the 1930s and appeasement.

Christopher William Hill&#x27;s radio play &quot;Accolades&quot;, rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March 2007 as a tribute to its star, Ian Richardson, who had died the previous month, covers the period leading up to the publication of &quot;Shakespeare the Man&quot; in 1973 and publicity surrounding Rowse&#x27;s unshakable confidence that he had discovered the identity of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets. It was broadcast again on 9 July 2008.

&quot;A Cornish Childhood&quot; has also been adapted for voices (in the style of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;) by Judith Cook.

<doc id="189577" wikidata="Q266066" url="?curid=189577" title="Douglas A-1 Skyraider">
<text>The Douglas A-1 Skyraider (formerly designated AD before the 1962 unification of Navy and Air Force designations) is an American single-seat attack aircraft in service from 1946 to the early 1980s, which served during the Korean War and Vietnam War. The Skyraider had an unusually long career, remaining in frontline service well into the Jet Age (when most piston-engine attack or fighter aircraft were replaced by jet aircraft); thus becoming known by some as an &quot;anachronism&quot;. The aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Spad&quot;, after the French World War I fighter.

It was operated by the United States Navy (USN), the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and the United States Air Force (USAF), and also saw service with the British Royal Navy, the French Air Force, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF), and others. It remained in U.S. service until the early 1970s.

==Design and development==
The piston-engined, propeller-driven Skyraider was designed during World War II to meet United States Navy requirements for a carrier-based, single-seat, long-range, high performance dive/torpedo bomber, to follow on from earlier aircraft such as the Douglas SBD Dauntless, the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver and the Grumman TBF Avenger. Designed by Ed Heinemann of the Douglas Aircraft Company, prototypes were ordered on 6 July 1944 as the &quot;XBT2D-1&quot;. The XBT2D-1 made its first flight on 18 March 1945, and the USN began evaluation of the aircraft at the Naval Air Test Center (NATC) in April 1945. In December 1946, after a designation change to &quot;AD-1&quot;, delivery of the first production aircraft to a fleet squadron was made to VA-19A.

The AD-1 was built at Douglas&#x27;s El Segundo plant in Southern California. In his memoir &quot;The Lonely Sky&quot;, test pilot Bill Bridgeman notes that the plane engines had a sensitive carburetor but could keep pace with a Mustang in simulated dogfights over southern California. 
The low-wing monoplane design started with a Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engine which was later upgraded several times. The aircraft had distinctive large straight wings with seven hardpoints apiece. The Skyraider had excellent maneuverability at low speed, and carried a large amount of ordnance over a considerable combat radius. It had a long loiter time for its size, compared to much heavier subsonic or supersonic jets. The aircraft was optimized for ground attack and was armored against ground fire in key locations, unlike faster fighters adapted to carry bombs, such as the Vought F4U Corsair or North American P-51 Mustang, which were retired by U.S. forces before the 1960s.

Shortly after Heinemann began designing the XBT2D-1, a study was issued showing that for every of weight reduction, the takeoff run was decreased by , the combat radius increased by and the rate-of-climb increased by . Heinemann immediately had his design engineers begin a program for finding weight savings on the XBT2D-1 design, no matter how small. Simplifying the fuel system resulted in a reduction of ; by eliminating an internal bomb bay and hanging external stores from the wings or fuselage; by using a fuselage dive brake; and by using an older tailwheel design. In the end, Heinemann and his design engineers achieved more than of weight reduction on the original XBT2D-1 design.

The Navy AD series was initially painted in ANA 623 glossy sea blue, but during the 1950s, following the Korean War, the color scheme was changed to light gull grey and white (Fed Std 595 27875). Initially using the gray and white Navy scheme, by 1967 the USAF began to paint its Skyraiders in a camouflaged pattern using two shades of green, and one of tan.
Used by the US Navy over Korea and Vietnam, the A-1 was a primary close air support aircraft for the USAF and RVNAF during the Vietnam War. The A-1 was famous for being able to take hits and keep flying thanks to armor plating around the cockpit area for pilot protection. It was replaced beginning in the mid-1960s by the Grumman A-6 Intruder as the Navy&#x27;s primary medium-attack plane in supercarrier-based air wings; however Skyraiders continued to operate from the smaller s.

The Skyraider went through seven versions, starting with the &quot;AD-1&quot;, then &quot;AD-2&quot; and &quot;AD-3&quot; with various minor improvements, then the &quot;AD-4&quot; with a more powerful &quot;R-3350-26WA&quot; engine. The &quot;AD-5&quot; was significantly widened, allowing two crew to sit side-by-side (this was not the first multiple-crew variant, the &quot;AD-1Q&quot; being a two-seater and the &quot;AD-3N&quot; a three-seater); it also came in a four-seat night-attack version, the &quot;AD-5N&quot;. The &quot;AD-6&quot; was an improved AD-4B with improved low-level bombing equipment, and the final production version &quot;AD-7&quot; was upgraded to an &quot;R-3350-26WB&quot; engine.

For service in Vietnam, USAF Skyraiders were fitted with the Stanley Yankee extraction system, which acted in a similar manner to an ejection seat, though with twin rockets extracting the pilot from the cockpit.

In addition to serving in Korea and Vietnam as an attack aircraft, the Skyraider was modified to serve as a carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft, replacing the Grumman TBM-3W Avenger. It fulfilled this function in the USN and Royal Navy, being replaced by the Grumman E-1 Tracer and Fairey Gannet, respectively, in those services.

Skyraider production ended in 1957 with a total of 3,180 having been built. In 1962, the existing Skyraiders were redesignated &quot;A-1D&quot; through &quot;A-1J&quot; and later used by both the USAF and the Navy in the Vietnam War.

==Operational history==

===Korean War===

The Skyraider was produced too late for use in World War II, but became the backbone of United States Navy aircraft carrier and United States Marine Corps strike aircraft sorties in the Korean War (1950–1953), with the first ADs going into action from with VA-55 on 3 July 1950. Its weapons load and 10-hour flying time far surpassed the jets that were available at the time. On 2 May 1951, Skyraiders made the only aerial torpedo attack of the war, hitting the Hwacheon Dam, then controlled by North Korea.

On 16 June 1953, a USMC AD-4 from VMC-1 piloted by Major George H. Linnemeier and CWO Vernon S. Kramer shot down a Soviet-built Polikarpov Po-2 biplane, the only documented Skyraider air victory of the war. AD-3N and -4N aircraft carrying bombs and flares, flew night-attack sorties, and radar-equipped ADs carried out radar-jamming missions from carriers and land bases.

During the Korean War, AD Skyraiders were flown by only the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, and were normally painted in dark navy blue. It was called the &quot;Blue Plane&quot; by enemy troops. Marine Corps Skyraiders suffered heavy losses when used in low-level close-support missions. To allow low-level operations to continue without unacceptable losses, a package of additional armor was fitted, consisting of thick external aluminum armor plates fitted to the underside and sides of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage. The armor package weighed a total of and had little effect on performance or handling. A total of 128 Navy and Marine AD Skyraiders were lost in the Korean War – 101 in combat and 27 to operational causes. Most operational losses were due to the tremendous power of the AD: ADs that were &quot;waved-off&quot; during carrier recovery operations were prone to performing a fatal torque roll into the sea or the deck of the aircraft carrier if the pilot mistakenly gave the AD too much throttle. The torque of the engine was so great that it would cause the aircraft to rotate about the propeller and slam into the sea or the carrier.

===Cathay Pacific VR-HEU incident===
On 26 July 1954, two Douglas Skyraiders from the aircraft carriers and shot down two Chinese PLAAF Lavochkin fighters off the coast of Hainan Island while searching for survivors after the shooting down of a Cathay Pacific Douglas DC-4 Skymaster airliner three days previously.

===Vietnam War===

As American involvement in the Vietnam War began, the A-1 Skyraider was still the medium attack aircraft in many carrier air wings, although it was planned to be replaced by the A-6A Intruder as part of the general switch to jet aircraft. Skyraiders from and participated in the first U.S. Navy strikes against North Vietnam on 5 August 1964 as part of Operation Pierce Arrow in response to the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, striking against fuel depots at Vinh, with one Skyraider from &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and a second from &quot;Constellation&quot; shot down, killing its pilot, Lieutenant Richard Sather.

====Shoot-downs====

During the war, U.S. Navy Skyraiders used their cannon to shoot down two Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 jet fighters. The first, on 20 June 1965 by Lieutenant Clinton B. Johnson and Lt. (jg) Charles W. Hartman III of VA-25, was the first gun kill of the Vietnam War. The other was on 9 October 1966 by Lt. (jg) William T. Patton of VA-176.

====Tactical operators====
As they were released from U.S. Navy service, Skyraiders were introduced into the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). Skyraiders were also used by the U.S. Air Force, specifically Special Operations elements of the Tactical Air Command, for search and rescue air cover. They were also used by the USAF to perform one of the Skyraider&#x27;s most famous roles — the &quot;Sandy&quot; helicopter escort on combat rescues. On 10 March 1966, USAF Major Bernard F. Fisher flew an A-1E mission and was awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing Major &quot;Jump&quot; Myers at A Shau Special Forces Camp. USAF Colonel William A. Jones III piloted an A-1H on 1 September 1968 mission for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. In that mission, despite damage to his aircraft and suffering serious burns, he returned to his base and reported the position of a downed U.S. airman.

====Losses====
On 5 August 1964, the first A-1H Skyraider was shot down during Operation Pierce Arrow. The pilot, Lt. (jg) Richard Sather, was the first Navy pilot killed in the war. On the night of 29 August 1964, an A-1E Skyraider was shot down and the pilot killed near Bien Hoa Air Base; it was flown by Capt. Richard D. Goss from the 1st Air Commando Squadron, 34th Tactical Group. The third A-1 was shot down on 31 March 1965 piloted by Lt. (jg) Gerald W. McKinley from the on a bombing run over North Vietnam. He was reported missing, presumed dead.

While on his first mission, Navy pilot Lt. (jg) Dieter Dengler took damage to his A-1J over Vietnam on 1 February 1966, and crash-landed in Laos. &lt;br&gt;Col. Oscar Mauterer ejected from his A-1 after taking heavy enemy fire while providing cover for a damaged friendly aircraft on February 15, 1966. Radio reports confirmed Mauterer had a good chute, but was captured by enemy forces. Mauterer is still POW/MIA status.

The next A-1 was shot down on 29 April 1966, and Pilot Capt. Grant N. Tabor, was lost on 19 April 1967; both were from the 602 Air Commando Squadron. A Skyraider from Navy Squadron VA-25 on a ferry flight from Naval Air Station Cubi Point (Philippines) to was lost to two Chinese MiG-17s on 14 February 1968: Lieutenant (jg) Joseph P. Dunn, USN flew too close to the Chinese island of Hainan and was intercepted. Lieutenant Dunn&#x27;s A-1H Skyraider 134499 (Canasta 404) was the last Navy A-1 lost in the war. He was observed to survive the ejection and deploy his raft, but was never found. Initially listed as missing in action, he is now listed as killed in action and posthumously promoted to the rank of Commander. In October 1965, to highlight the dropping of the six millionth pound of ordnance, Commander Clarence J. Stoddard of VA-25, flying an A-1H, dropped a special, one-time-only object in addition to his other munitions – a toilet. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy lost 65 Skyraiders, 48 of these in combat.

The U.S. Air Force used the naval A-1 Skyraider for the first time in Vietnam. As the Vietnam War progressed, USAF A-1s were painted in camouflage, while USN A-1 Skyraiders were gray/white in color in contrast to the Korean War, when A-1s were painted dark blue. After November 1972, all A-1s in U.S. service in Southeast Asia were transferred to the RVNAF. The Skyraider in Vietnam pioneered the concept of tough, survivable aircraft with long loiter times and large ordnance loads. The USAF lost 191 Skyraiders in Southeast Asia, 150 of these in combat. Of the combined total of 256 lost A-1s, five were shot down by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and three were shot down in air-to-air combat; the rest were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery.

===Republic of Vietnam Air Force===

The A-1 Skyraider was the close air support workhorse of the RVNAF for much of the Vietnam War. The U.S. Navy began to transfer some of its Skyraiders to the RVNAF in September 1960, replacing the RVNAF&#x27;s older Grumman F8F Bearcats. By 1962 the RVNAF had 22 of the aircraft in its inventory, and by 1968 an additional 131 aircraft had been received. Initially Navy aviators and crews were responsible for training their South Vietnamese counterparts on the aircraft, but over time responsibility was gradually transferred to the USAF.
The initial trainees were selected from among RVNAF Bearcat pilots who had accumulated 800 to 1200 hours flying time. They were trained at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, and then sent to NAS Lemoore, California for further training. Navy pilots and crews in Vietnam checked out the Skyraiders that were being transferred to the RVNAF, and conducted courses for RVNAF ground crews.

Over the course of the war, the RVNAF acquired a total more than 350 Skyraiders, and was operating six A-1 squadrons by the end of 1965. About one third of these were A-1E/G. These were reduced during the period of Vietnamization from 1968 to 1972, as the U.S. began to supply the South Vietnamese with more modern close air support aircraft, such as the A-37 Dragonfly and Northrop F-5, and at the beginning of 1968, only three of its squadrons were flying A-1s.

As the U.S. ended its direct involvement in the war, it transferred the remainder of its Skyraiders to the South Vietnamese, and by 1973, all remaining Skyraiders in U.S. inventories had been turned over to the RVNAF. Unlike their American counterparts, whose combat tours were generally limited to 12 months, individual South Vietnamese Skyraider pilots ran up many thousands of combat hours in the A-1, and many senior RVNAF pilots were extremely skilled in the operation of the aircraft. The last Skyraiders transferred to the VNAF were 23 A-1H/J and 21 A-1E/G in late 1972. In 1974, 61 were put in storage. A year later, eleven fled to Thailand (5 A-1E, 1 A-1G, 5 A-1H) and more than 40 were captured by North Vietnam.

A-1H 134600 was operated by the VNAF from 1965 to 1975. In 1997, it was acquired by the U. S. Army Center of Military History before it was restored and put on display at the National Museum of the USAF in 2022 (painted as 52–139738).

===United Kingdom===
The Royal Navy acquired 50 AD-4W early warning aircraft in 1951 through the Military Assistance Program. All Skyraider AEW.1s were operated by 849 Naval Air Squadron, which provided four-plane detachments for the British carriers. Flights from and took part in the Suez Crisis in 1956. 778 Naval Air Squadron was responsible for the training of the Skyraider crews at RNAS Culdrose until July 1952.

In 1960, the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 replaced the Skyraiders, using the AN/APS-20 radar of the Douglas aircraft. The last British Skyraiders were retired in 1962. In the late 1960s, the AN/APS-20 radars from the Skyraiders were installed in Avro Shackleton AEW.2s of the Royal Air Force which were finally retired in 1991.

===Sweden===
Fourteen ex-British AEW.1 Skyraiders were sold to Sweden to be used by Svensk Flygtjänst AB between 1962 and 1976. All military equipment was removed and the aircraft were used as target tugs supporting the Swedish Armed Forces.

===France===
The French Air Force bought 20 ex-USN AD-4s as well as 88 ex-USN AD-4Ns and five ex-USN AD-4NAs with the former three-seaters modified as single-seat aircraft with removal of the radar equipment and the two operator stations from the rear fuselage. The AD-4N/NAs were initially acquired in 1956 to replace aging Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in Algeria.

The Skyraiders were first ordered in 1956 and the first was handed over to the French Air Force on 6 February 1958 after being overhauled and fitted with some French equipment by Sud-Aviation. The aircraft were used until the end of the Algerian War. The aircraft were used by the 20e &quot;Escadre de Chasse&quot; (EC 1/20 &quot;Aures Nementcha&quot;, EC 2/20 &quot;Ouarsenis&quot; and EC 3/20 &quot;Oranie&quot;) and EC 21 in the close air support role armed with rockets, bombs and napalm.

The Skyraiders had only a short career in Algeria, but they nonetheless proved to be the most successful of all the ad hoc counter-insurgency aircraft deployed by the French. The Skyraider remained in limited French service until the 1970s. They were heavily involved in the civil war in Chad, at first with the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, and later with a nominally independent Chadian Air Force staffed by French mercenaries. The aircraft also operated under the French flag in Djibouti and on the island of Madagascar. When France at last relinquished the Skyraiders it passed the survivors on to allied states, including Gabon, Chad, Cambodia and the Central African Republic (several aircraft from Gabon and Chad were recovered by French warbird enthusiasts and entered on the French civil register).

The French frequently used the aft station to carry maintenance personnel, spare parts and supplies to forward bases. In Chad they even used the aft station for a &quot;bombardier&quot; and his &quot;special stores&quot; – empty beer bottles – as these were considered as non-lethal weapons, thus not breaking the government-imposed rules of engagement, during operations against Libyan-supported rebels in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

<text>Fart lighting, also known as pyroflatulence or flatus ignition, is the practice of igniting the gases produced by flatulence. The resulting flame is often of a blue hue hence the act being known colloquially as a &quot;blue angel&quot;, &quot;blue dart&quot; or in Australia, a &quot;blue flame&quot;. The fact that flatus is flammable and the actual combustion of it through this practice gives rise to much humorous derivation. Other colors of flame such as orange and yellow are possible depending on the mixture of gases formed in the colon.

In 1999, author Jim Dawson observed that fart lighting has been a novelty practice primarily among young men or college students for decades but is discouraged for its potential for causing harm. Such experiments typically occur on camping trips and in single-sex group residences, such as tree-houses, dormitories, or fraternity houses. With the advent of video sharing features online, hundreds of self-produced videos, both documentary as well as spoof, have been posted to sites such as YouTube. The people appearing in the videos are predominantly young teen males. In his book &quot;The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life&quot;, author Jim Dawson explains how a great deal of unhappiness is due to people&#x27;s inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior and that &quot;stupid stunts&quot;, including lighting flatulence, were a way to make an impression and be included in group bonding or hazing.
There are many anecdotal accounts of flatus ignition, and the activity appears in popular culture. In his book &quot;Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa,&quot; author Neil Slaven quotes Zappa discussing &quot;the manly art of fart-burning&quot;, and Zappa&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Let&#x27;s Make the Water Turn Black&quot; include &quot;Ronny helping Kenny helping burn his poots away&quot;. Another Zappa book quotes his neighbor Kenny Williams saying that it demonstrates &quot;compression, ignition, combustion and exhaust.&quot;

There have been documented cases of flatulence during surgery being inadvertently ignited causing patient injury and the risk of death.

==Chemistry==
The composition of flatus varies dramatically among individuals. Flatulence produces a mixture of gases including methane, which burns in oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide often producing a blue hue (Δc&quot;H&quot; = −891 kJ/mol), as:

:(g) + 2 (g) → (g) + 2 (g)

Hydrogen sulfide is also flammable (Δc&quot;H&quot; = −519 kJ/mol), and burns to

:2 (g) + 3 (g) → 2 (g) + 2 (g)

===Gas production===
Some of the gases that cause flatulence, such as methane and hydrogen, are produced by bacteria which live in symbiosis within the large intestines of humans and other mammals. The gases are created as a by-product of the bacteria&#x27;s digestion of food into relatively simpler substances. The oxygen and nitrogen component of flatus can be accounted for by aerophagy while the CO2 component results from the reaction of stomach acids (HCl) with alkaline pancreatic bile (NaHCO3).

The odor associated with flatus is due to hydrogen sulfide, skatole, indole, volatile amines, and short-chain fatty acids also produced by the bacteria. These substances are detectable by olfactory neurons in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide being the most detectable.

<doc id="189589" wikidata="Q4728372" url="?curid=189589" title="All-silica fiber">
<text>All-silica fiber, or silica-silica fiber, is an optical fiber whose core and cladding are made of silica glass. The refractive index of the core glass is higher than that of the cladding. These fibers are typically step-index fibers. The cladding of an all-silica fiber should not be confused with the polymer overcoat of the fiber.

All-silica fiber is usually used as the medium for the purpose of transmitting optical signals. It is of technical interest in the fields of communications, broadcasting and television, due to its physical properties of low transmission loss, large bandwidth and light weight.

== Applications ==
The practical application of optical fibers in various optical networks determines the requirements for the technical performance of optical fibers. For short-distance fiber-optic transmission networks, the multi-mode optical fiber is suitable for laser transmission and wider bandwidths, so as to support larger capacity of serial signal information transmission. For long-distance submarine optical cable transmission systems, in order to reduce the number of expensive optical fiber amplifiers, it is important to consider using optical fibers with large mode field diameter area and negative dispersion to increase the transmission distance. The focus of the land-based long-distance transmission system is to be able to transmit more wavelengths, each of which should be transmitted at a high rate as much as possible. Even if the dispersion value of the optical fiber with the changes of the wavelength is minimum, the dispersion of fiber still needs to be solved. For local area networks, since the transmission distance is relatively short, the focus of consideration is on the cost of the optical network rather than the cost of transmission. In other words, it is necessary to solve the add/drop multiplexing problem of the upper/lower path in the optical fiber transmission system, and at the same time, the cost of the add/drop wavelength must be minimized.

=== Dispersion Compensating Fiber (DCF) ===
Fiber dispersion is a problem that must be avoided in communication networks, and it is also a problem that needs to be solved in long-distance transmission systems. In general, fiber dispersion includes two parts: material dispersion and waveguide structure dispersion. Material dispersion depends on the dispersion of the silica master batch and dopants used to make the fiber. Waveguide dispersion is usually the tendency effective refractive index of a mode that tends to vary with wavelength. Dispersion compensation fiber is a technology used to solve dispersion management in transmission systems.

=== Non-Dispersion Shifted Fiber (USF) ===
Non-dispersion-shifted fiber (USF) is dominated by positive material dispersion. After combining with small waveguide dispersion, it produces zero dispersion near 1310 nm. The dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) and non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber (NZDSF) use technical means to deliberately design the refractive index profile of the fiber to produce waveguide dispersion compared with the material dispersion, so that the zero-dispersion wavelength of DSF moved to around 1550 nm after the material dispersion and the waveguide dispersion are added. The 1550 nm wavelength is the most widely used wavelength in the current communication network. In the submarine optical cable transmission system, two kinds of optical fibers with positive and negative dispersion are combined to form a transmission system for dispersion management. With the increase in the distance and capacity of the transmission system, a large number of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems have been put into use. In these systems, in order to perform dispersion compensation, a double-clad and triple-clad DCF with refractive index distribution that can work in the C-band and L-band has been developed.

=== Amplification Fiber ===
Amplification fibers, such as erbium-doped fiber (EDF), thulium-doped fiber (TOF), etc, can be made by doping rare earth elements, in the core layer of silica fiber. Amplifying fiber is highly integrable with traditional quartz fiber and also have many advantages such as high output, wide bandwidth, low noise and so on. Fiber amplifiers (such as EDFA) made of amplified fibers are the most widely used key components in today&#x27;s transmission systems.

=== Polarization Maintaining Fiber ===
Polarization-maintaining fiber is initially developed for coherent optical transmission and later has been used in the technical fields of fiber optic sensors such as fiber optic gyroscopes. In recent years, due to the increase in the number of wavelength division multiplexing in the DWDM transmission system and the development of high speed, the polarization maintaining fiber has been more widely used. Currently, the most widely used fiber is Panda Optical Fiber (PANDA). PANDA fiber is currently used as pigtails connected with other fiber optic devices and used in the system as a whole.

Single-mode non-stripping optical fiber(SM-NSF) is a new type of optical fiber that still has the NSP polyester layer remaining on the surface of the fiber cladding even after removing the fiber cladding to protect the mechanical properties and high reliability of the optical fiber. SM-NSP fiber and conventional SM fiber have the same outer diameter, eccentricity, and degree of accuracy. It can be widely used in the optical fiber of the transmission system and is an ideal new-type distribution optical fiber.

=== Optical Fiber for Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Light Transmission ===
One of the current research topics of solid-state lasers and gas lasers is laser oscillation technology in the deep ultraviolet field (250 nm). Deep ultraviolet light has been extremely widely used in the surface treatment of semiconductor substrates, DNA analysis and testing in the biochemistry field, and the treatment of myopia in the medical field.

<doc id="189591" wikidata="Q2416047" url="?curid=189591" title="List of communities in Alberta">
<text>The province of Alberta, Canada, is divided into ten types of local governments – urban municipalities (including cities, towns, villages and summer villages), specialized municipalities, rural municipalities (including municipal districts (often named as counties), improvement districts, and special areas), Métis settlements, and Indian reserves. All types of municipalities are governed by local residents and were incorporated under various provincial acts, with the exception of improvement districts (governed by either the provincial or federal government), and Alberta&#x27;s Indian reserves (governed by local band governments under federal jurisdiction).

Alberta also has numerous unincorporated communities (including urban service areas, hamlets and a townsite) that are not independent municipalities in their own right. However, they are all recognized as sub-municipal entities by Ministry of Municipal Affairs under the jurisdiction of specialized municipalities or rural municipalities, with the exception of the lone townsite (its jurisdiction is shared with an Indian reserve that surrounds it).

With the exception of Métis settlements, Statistics Canada recognizes all of Alberta&#x27;s municipalities as census subdivisions and groups them into 19 census divisions based on geography. Within census divisions, Statistics Canada groups some of Alberta&#x27;s municipalities/census subdivisions into two census metropolitan areas (CMAs) or 12 census agglomerations (CAs) for enumeration purposes. All CMAs include large urban centres and surrounding census subdivisions. All CAs also include large urban centres and in some cases their surrounding census subdivisions.

With the exception of Indian reserves, the administration of municipalities in Alberta is regulated by the Municipal Government Act, the Special Areas Act and the Metis Settlements Act.

As of 2019, the combined unofficial population of all of Alberta&#x27;s municipalities was 4,271,759.

== Municipalities ==

=== Urban municipalities ===

==== Cities ====
According to Section 82 of the &quot;Municipal Government Act&quot; (MGA), an area may incorporate as a city if:
* it has a population of 10,000 people or more; and
* the majority of its buildings are on parcels of land smaller than .

Essentially, cities are formed from urban communities with populations of at least 10,000 people.

Alberta currently has a total of 19 cities with a combined population totalling 2,959,559 as of 2019.
==== Towns ====
According to Section 81 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), an area may incorporate as a town if:
* it has a population of 1,000 people or more; and
* the majority of its buildings are on parcels of land smaller than .

Essentially, towns are formed from urban communities with populations of at least 1,000 people. When a town&#x27;s population exceeds 10,000 people, its council may apply to change its status to that of a city, but the change in incorporated status is not mandatory.

Communities with shrinking populations are allowed to retain town status even if the number of residents falls below the 1,000 limit. Some of Alberta&#x27;s towns have never reached a population of 1,000 people, but were incorporated as towns before the current requirement to have a population of 1,000 or more.

Alberta currently has a total of 107 towns, with a combined population totalling 466,470 as of 2019.

==== Villages ====
According to Section 80 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), an area may incorporate as a village if:
* it has a population of 300 people or more; and
* the majority of its buildings are on parcels of land smaller than .

Essentially, villages are formed from urban communities with populations of at least 300 people. When a village&#x27;s population exceeds 1,000 people, its council may apply to change its status to that of a town, but the change in incorporated status is not mandatory.

Communities with shrinking populations are allowed to retain village status even if the number of residents falls below the 300 limit. Some of Alberta&#x27;s villages have never reached a population of 300 people, but were incorporated as villages before there was a requirement to have a population of 300 or more.

Alberta currently has a total of 81 villages, with a combined population totalling 34,600 as of 2021.

==== Summer villages ====

According to former Section 79 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), a summer village is an area that:
* has at least 60 parcels of land developed with dwelling buildings; and
* has a population of less than 300 persons where the majority of the persons who would be electors do not permanently reside in that area.

As a result of Section 79 being repealed, summer villages can no longer be formed in Alberta.

Essentially, summer villages were once formed from urban communities with populations of less than 300 people and significant non-permanent populations. When a summer village&#x27;s population exceeds 300 people, its council may apply to change its status to that of a village, but the change in incorporated status is not mandatory.

Alberta currently has a total of 51 summer villages, with a combined population totalling 5,200 as of 2019.

=== Specialized municipalities ===

According to Section 83 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), a municipality may incorporate as a specialized municipality under one of the following three scenarios:
* where the Minister of Alberta Municipal Affairs (AMA) is satisfied that the other incorporated statuses under the MGA do not meet the needs of the municipality&#x27;s residents;
* to form a local government that, in the opinion of the Minister of AMA, will provide for the orderly development of the municipality in a similar fashion to the other incorporated statuses within the MGA; or
* for any other circumstances that are deemed appropriate by the Minister of AMA.

Essentially, specialized municipalities are municipalities that are unconventional in nature compared to other municipalities in Alberta, and they are incorporated under the authority of the existing MGA instead of relying on the creation of their own separate acts (i.e., the Special Areas Act allowed the incorporation of Alberta&#x27;s three special areas and the Metis Settlements Act allowed the incorporation of Alberta&#x27;s eight Métis settlements).

Alberta&#x27;s six specialized municipalities have a combined population totalling 242,395 as of 2019.
=== Rural municipalities ===

==== Municipal districts ====
According to Section 78 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), a municipal district is an area in which:
* the majority of the buildings used as dwellings are on parcels of land with an area of at least ; and
* there is a population of 1,000 or more.

Essentially, municipal districts are large rural areas in which their citizens reside on farms, country residential subdivisions or unincorporated communities (i.e., hamlets, localities and other settlements).

In Alberta, the term &quot;county&quot; is synonymous with the term &quot;municipal district&quot; – it is not its own incorporated municipal status that is different from that of a municipal district. As such, Alberta Municipal Affairs provides municipal districts with the opportunity to brand themselves either as &quot;municipal districts&quot; or &quot;counties&quot; in their official names.

Of Alberta&#x27;s 63 municipal districts, 46 of them brand themselves as &quot;counties&quot;. Over the past 30 years, Alberta has observed a trend of numerous municipal districts rebranding themselves as &quot;counties&quot; through official name changes. Some of the reasons why a municipal district would rebrand itself as a &quot;county&quot; include that the term &quot;county&quot; is: more recognizable by the general public; has a more traditional appeal; and is more marketable from an economic development perspective.

The last municipal district (MD) to rebrand itself as a &quot;county&quot; was the MD of Foothills No. 31, which was renamed as Foothills County on January 1, 2019.

Alberta&#x27;s 63 municipal districts have a combined population totalling 471,852 as of 2019.

==== Improvement districts ====
According to Section 581 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), Alberta&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, may form an improvement district. Section 582 of the MGA requires that the order to form an improvement district must describe its boundaries and give it an official name.

Alberta currently has seven improvement districts, which have a combined population totaling 2,146. With some exceptions, their boundaries are coterminous with that of a national or provincial park. Five of them are located within national parks, and two are within provincial parks.

==== Special areas ====

Special areas are rural municipalities created in 1938 under the authority of the Special Areas Act. A special area is not to be confused with a specialized municipality, which is a completely different municipal status.

Alberta&#x27;s three special areas had a combined population totalling 4,184 in 2016.

== Unincorporated communities ==

=== Urban service areas ===
An urban service area is a type of hamlet that is not officially defined under the Municipal Government Act (MGA). However, the province of Alberta recognizes it as equivalent to a city for the purposes of program delivery and grant eligibility according to the Orders in Council that established the Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo and Strathcona County as specialized municipalities.

These Orders in Council (see Schedule 1, Section 7 and Schedule 1, Section 3 respectively) also state that:

*the specialized municipalities shall provide to the province of Alberta any information required to administer programs or to determine the amount of grants which would have been paid if the urban service areas were incorporated cities; and
*for the purposes of enactments affecting roads, culverts, ditches, drains, and highways, the urban service areas are deemed to be cities.

Essentially, urban services areas meet the eligibility requirements of the MGA to incorporate as a city. As such, they are Alberta&#x27;s largest hamlets.

There are currently two urban services areas in Alberta:
*Fort McMurray; and
*Sherwood Park.

Fort McMurray, within the jurisdiction of the RM of Wood Buffalo, was formerly a city prior its amalgamation with Improvement District No. 143 on April 1, 1995. It was designated an urban service area at the time of the amalgamation.

Sherwood Park has always been an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of Strathcona County. It became an urban service area when Strathcona County changed its status from a municipal district to a specialized municipality on January 1, 1996.

=== Hamlets ===

According to Section 59 of the Municipal Government Act (MGA), hamlets are unincorporated communities that:
* consist of five or more buildings used as dwellings, a majority of which are on parcels of land smaller than ;
* have a generally accepted boundary and name; and
* contain parcels of land that are used for non‑residential purposes.

Further, Section 59 of the MGA provides the councils of municipal districts (or counties) and specialized municipalities the authority to designate unincorporated communities within its boundaries as hamlets. Hamlets may also be designated within improvement districts and special areas by the Minister of Municipal Affairs pursuant to Section 590 of the MGA and Section 10 of the Special Areas Act respectively.

When a hamlet&#x27;s population reaches 300, it becomes eligible to incorporated as a village under Section 80 of the MGA, so long as the majority of the buildings are still on parcels of land smaller than . However, it is a modern-day rarity for a hamlet to incorporate as a village – Barnwell and Wabamun were the last two to do so both on January 1, 1980. It is much more common these days for villages to revert to hamlet status through the dissolution process instead.

There are currently 403 hamlets in Alberta, two of which are the urban services areas presented above.

=== Townsites ===
A townsite is a type of unincorporated community that is not officially defined under the Municipal Government Act (MGA), but it is generally regarded as an independent urban area within an Indian reserve that is comparable in population, land area, services, and built form, to that of Alberta&#x27;s incorporated towns. Essentially, townsites would meet the eligibility requirements of the MGA to incorporate as a town if they were not on Indian reserve lands under federal jurisdiction.

Redwood Meadows is Alberta&#x27;s only townsite at this time and is located within the Tsuutʼina Nation.

=== Other unincorporated communities ===
== Métis settlements ==
Métis settlements are rural areas inhabited by the indigenous Métis in Alberta and were established and recognized in 1936 under the Métis Population Betterment Act. The settlements provide an autonomous land base, allow better access to education, health and other social services, and provide economic development opportunities for the only recognized Métis land-base in Canada. Métis settlements now operate under the authority of the Métis Settlements Act. These eight Métis settlements are governed by a unique Métis government known as the Métis Settlements General Council (MSGC).

Alberta currently has eight Métis settlements, all of which are in the northern half of the province. The official names of the eight settlements, and the municipal districts they are within, are as follows:
:&quot;*Areas generated from provincial Métis settlement boundary data.&quot;

Very small portions of the Gift Lake Métis Settlement and the Kikino Métis Settlement are also located within Northern Sunrise County and Lac La Biche County respectively.

Alberta&#x27;s eight Métis settlements have a combined population totalling 5,632 as of 2018.

== Indian reserves ==

Indian reserves in Alberta cover a total area of and range in size from to . Under the Constitution Act, 1982, legislative authority over Indian reserves is allocated to the Parliament of Canada. The Government of Canada exercises executive authority over Indian reserves through Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. Local administration is exercised by Band councils whose members are elected by members of the reserve.

<doc id="189592" wikidata="Q7931495" url="?curid=189592" title="Vince Gair">
<text>Vincent Clair Gair (25 February 190111 November 1980) was an Australian politician. He served as Premier of Queensland from 1952 until 1957, when his stormy relations with the trade union movement saw him expelled from the Labor Party. He was elected to the Australian Senate and led the Democratic Labor Party from 1965 to 1973. In 1974 he was appointed Australian Ambassador to Ireland by the Whitlam government, which caused his expulsion from the DLP.

==Early life==
Gair was born in Rockhampton to John Alexander and Catherine Mary Gair, a Scottish father and an Irish mother, and raised a Catholic. His parents were founding members of the Labor Party in Queensland in the 1890s. He began work with the Department of Railways upon the family&#x27;s move to Dutton Park, Queensland. In 1916 he joined the Labor Party. He married Florence Glynn in 1924. She died in an accident five years later.

==State parliamentary career==

The Queensland state electorate of South Brisbane was held from 1929 to 1932 by Neil MacGroarty, Attorney-General in the government of Arthur Moore. MacGroarty was influential in creating the Mungana Royal Commission to destroy the political career of Ted Theodore, and reportedly incurred the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig.

Gair worked at consolidating his hold on the marginal electorate, at which he was largely successful except in the 1938 election, when a newly formed Protestant Labor Party targeted his seat. He fended off the challenge and retained a low profile in Parliament. In 1941, Gair&#x27;s only daughter from his first marriage died. In 1944 he remarried, to Ellen Mary Sexton; the couple had two sons.

Gair was a backbencher for ten years during the William Forgan Smith government before being appointed as Secretary for Mines under the elderly Frank Cooper in 1942. The same year he became Minister for Labour and Employment (later Labour and Industry), and in 1947 he was elected by his colleagues as Deputy Premier. In 1950 he also became Treasurer. Gair had not previously held office in a trade union. Multiple Labor parliamentarians in Queensland in particular were closely aligned with the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU). Premier Edward Hanlon was the first in a succession of Queensland premiers &quot;not&quot; to be linked with the AWU, and this fact helped bring about a reduction in the union&#x27;s political influence.

In 1948, the Industrial Groups associated with the Catholic Movement of B. A. Santamaria were introduced into Queensland to combat the influence of the Communist Party of Australia in the trade unions. The Industrial Groups (whose members were known as Groupers) were supported by Gair, who hoped to use them to cement his personal power base within the party&#x27;s organisational wing, as well as by union leader Joe Bukowski and the AWU. When conflict with the Groupers precipitated a national split in the ALP, leading to the formation of the breakaway Democratic Labor Party (DLP), the national organisation of the AWU swung its support behind ALP leader Dr H. V. Evatt and disbanded the Groups. This would later deprive Gair of a potential source of support within the party organisation. Hanlon died on 15 January 1952 and Gair, having been acting premier since the previous August, was elected by the ALP Caucus to succeed him on 17 January.

==Premier of Queensland==

Under Gair&#x27;s premiership, reforms were carried out in worker&#x27;s compensation, sick leave, and annual leave. Long-service leave was also introduced, while the government&#x27;s price controls enabled workers in Queensland to enjoy the highest real wages (adjusted for prices) in Australia.

Gair came into conflict with Bukowski when the AWU in 1955 began making allegations that there was corruption in the process of granting and extending pastoral leases in the state. In July of that year, members of the AWU executive met Gair. According to an account they gave later, Gair promised them an inquiry, although Gair denied ever having promised any such thing. Bukowski publicly expressed a desire to appear before the Bar of Parliament to detail his allegations, in which he was supported by Frank Nicklin, then leader of the Opposition; but Gair defeated his motion in parliament.

In February 1956, Ian Wood, a Liberal Party Senator for Queensland, alleged that the government had demanded payments from pastoralists in order to ensure the extension of pastoral leases, and that these payments had been diverted to Labor Party funds. Gair immediately set up a royal commission, which resulted in the laying of criminal charges against Lands Minister Tom Foley. Foley was acquitted of the specific charges laid against him, but was found by the Royal Commission&#x27;s report to be responsible for the improper solicitation of party donations, for which he was dismissed from cabinet and expelled from the Labor Party.

Gair discovered that the AWU had gained its information about the scandal from a senior public official, Vivian Creighton. Gair pressed for Creighton&#x27;s resignation on the grounds of official misconduct. Creighton was summoned to appear before the Bar of Parliament to explain his actions but was later dismissed by cabinet. Gair easily won the elections of May 1956.

When the AWU uncharacteristically endorsed strike action by shearers, Gair raised the union movement&#x27;s ire by negotiating with the federal government in order to secure the export of wool shorn by non-union labour. He was ultimately successful in a negotiated end to the strike, but the effect was to cement an unlikely anti-Gair alliance between the Queensland Trades and Labour Council (TLC) (represented by Boilermaker&#x27;s Union secretary Jack Egerton) and the AWU.

Out of the several issues over which Gair and the union movement came into conflict, the most severe was the introduction of three weeks&#x27; paid leave to workers under state industrial awards. This had been part of the party&#x27;s election platform since 1953. Gair announced in 1955 that although the state&#x27;s finances did not permit the extension of annual leave, the government would extend entitlements to long service leave. This compromise was regarded as insufficient by both the TLC and the AWU, and in November they moved in the Queensland Branch&#x27;s Central Executive that legislation introducing the leave be introduced by the parliamentary party.

The majority of Gair&#x27;s Cabinet refused to accept what it saw as direction from the Central Executive, and in February 1956, Bukowski and Egerton organised the numbers at the next Labor Party convention to vote in favour of a leave increase. After private discussions it was revealed that Gair would introduce the leave sometime over the course of the year. After the election, however, State Treasurer Ted Walsh revealed that Queensland&#x27;s budget was in deficit and Gair claimed that extending leave would be financially irresponsible.

The parliamentary ALP found itself in deadlock with the organisational wing and the trade unions, with the TLC and the Central Executive maintaining pressure on Gair throughout early 1957. Gair still refused to budge, thinking that the executive would not dare to expel him. For its part, the QCE did not believe that Gair would take many of his caucus with him. The QCE finally expelled Gair on 24 April. He took a total of 25 defectors from the ALP Caucus with him, including all the Cabinet except Deputy Premier Jack Duggan, to form the Queensland Labor Party (QLP). Gair tried to gain Country Party support, but talks with Nicklin broke down when federal Country Party leader Arthur Fadden (who was himself a Queenslander) told Nicklin that he had a chance to become Premier himself. On 12 June, the ALP, now led by Duggan, voted to deny &quot;supply&quot; (that is, the money needed to govern) to what was left of the Gair government. The Country-Liberal Coalition moved to block supply as well and brought the government down.

An election was called for 3 August, in which both the QLP and the ALP lost ground. The two Labor factions won only 31 seats between them to the Coalition&#x27;s 42. Gair was re-elected at South Brisbane as a QLP candidate. Nicklin became Premier and for the first time in 25 years and only the second time since 1915, a Labor Government was out of office in Queensland. The ALP would not return to power in Queensland until 1989.

==Federal politics==
Although he was no longer Premier, Gair continued to lead the QLP, which was reduced to 11 members after the 1957 election. However, he was defeated at South Brisbane at the 1960 state election. In 1962 the QLP merged with the Democratic Labor Party, which had previously been largely inactive in Queensland. Gair unsuccessfully contested the Senate election of 1961 for the DLP. In 1964 he was elected as a DLP Senator for Queensland.

He became the second former Queensland Premier after Anderson Dawson to be elected to Federal Parliament as a Queensland representative. Two other former Premiers Tom Ryan and Ted Theodore had also served in Federal Parliament but were elected as New South Wales representatives in the House of Representatives.

On his election to the Senate, Gair became the federal DLP&#x27;s leader, a post he held until 1973. During his time in the Senate he advocated a strong defence and foreign policy based on anti-Communism. The DLP generally sought the middle ground on domestic issues. Gradually his anti-Communist views became outdated but he stubbornly refused to modify them in the face of developments like Richard Nixon&#x27;s détente with China and Russia in the early 1970s.

===The &quot;Gair Affair&quot;===

Gair subsequently became disillusioned with the DLP&#x27;s other senators, who forced him to resign as leader in October 1973. In 1974, when the Federal Labor government of Gough Whitlam was desperately attempting to gain a majority in the Senate, Whitlam tried to create an extra vacancy in Queensland for the upcoming Senate election so as to gain the ALP an increased chance of winning an extra Senate seat.

Whitlam approached Gair with the offer of the position of Ambassador to Ireland and not as a reconciliation with an ALP deflector in Gair, which Gair accepted on 14 March. Whitlam intended to keep the appointment confidential until 2 April, when Gair would tender his resignation from his Senate seat retroactive to 20 March, when Dublin cabled its acceptance of Gair&#x27;s appointment to Canberra. This would force the issuing of writs for the election of six Senators from Queensland, not five as would normally have been the case. Labor would have a realistic chance of winning three of those seats, and with it control of the Senate. Subsequently, when knowledge of the appointment became public on 2 April there was an outcry from the conservative parties. The then Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen decided to thwart Whitlam by causing the issue of writs for the usual five Senate vacancies before Gair could resign.

In Canberra, a group of Country Party senators kept Gair occupied in their office, away from the President of the Senate Magnus Cormack (to whom he needed to give his resignation), drinking beer and eating prawns, until 6pm (the Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that writs would be deemed to have been issued at 6pm irrespective of the time that they were actually issued). At 6:05pm, the Queensland Cabinet met and advised the governor, Air Marshal Sir Colin Hannah, to issue writs for the election of five senators for Queensland, and the writs were issued at 11pm. As a result, Gair failed to resign his Senate position in time for there to be six vacancies instead of five, thus thwarting Whitlam&#x27;s plan. This delaying tactic was later known as &quot;the Night of the Long Prawns&quot;. Gair later claimed he was perfectly aware of why he was being feted by his colleagues, some of whom were former enemies. Gair&#x27;s actions helped to precipitate a double dissolution. After the 18 May election, the ALP remained without control of the Senate. The 1974 election marked the electoral demise of the DLP, which lost all four of its remaining seats, largely as a backlash against Gair&#x27;s actions.

==Later life==
Gair took up his post in Ireland. During his tenure, he got into numerous rows with the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and other ambassadors. Several female staffers resigned to protest his frequently inappropriate (and often alcohol-induced) behaviour. He frequently criticised Opposition Leader Billy Snedden. After the Fraser government was confirmed to office at the 1975 election, Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock had Gair recalled on 21 January 1976, not for political reasons, but because he was unfit for diplomacy.

==Death==
Gair returned to Brisbane, and died on 11 November 1980, aged 79, on the fifth anniversary of the dismissal of the Whitlam government. He was given a state funeral and was buried in Nudgee Cemetery.

==Memorials==
Gair Park in Dutton Park, Brisbane, is named after Gair. The park is a triangular &quot;garden of remembrance&quot; with a Cenotaph, which originally opened on 25 April 1951.

<text>Communities in the province of Manitoba, Canada include incorporated municipalities, unincorporated communities and First Nations communities. 

Types of incorporated municipalities include urban municipalities, rural municipalities and local government districts. Urban municipalities can be named as cities, towns, villages or simply urban municipalities.

The administration of urban and rural municipalities is regulated by &quot;The Municipal Act&quot;.
Some municipalities have since amalgamated, making this list inaccurate. 

In the 2011 Census, Manitoba&#x27;s communities combined for a total provincial population of 1,208,268.

<text>USS &quot;Indiana&quot; was the lead ship of her class and the first battleship in the United States Navy comparable to foreign battleships of the time. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship also pioneered the use of an intermediate battery. She was designed for coastal defense and as a result, her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.

&quot;Indiana&quot; served in the Spanish–American War (1898) as part of the North Atlantic Squadron. She took part in both the blockade of Santiago de Cuba and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, which occurred when the Spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade. Although unable to join the chase of the escaping Spanish cruisers, she was partly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish destroyers &quot;Plutón&quot; and &quot;Furor&quot;. After the war, she quickly became obsolete—despite several modernizations—and spent most of her time in commission as a training ship or in the reserve fleet, with her last commission during World War I as a training ship for gun crews. She was decommissioned for the third and final time in January 1919 and was shortly after reclassified &quot;Coast Battleship Number 1&quot; so that the name &quot;Indiana&quot; could be reused. She was sunk in shallow water as a target in aerial bombing tests in 1920, and her hull was sold for scrap in 1924.

== Design ==
&quot;Indiana&quot; was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a US Navy policy board in 1889 for a short-range battleship. The original design was part of an ambitious naval construction plan to build 33 battleships and 167 smaller ships. The United States Congress saw the plan as an attempt to end the U.S. policy of isolationism and did not approve it, but a year later, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three coast defense battleships, which would become &quot;Indiana&quot; and her sister ships and . The &quot;coast defense&quot; designation was reflected in &quot;Indiana&quot;″s moderate endurance, relatively small displacement and low freeboard, which limited seagoing capability. The ships proved to be disappointments in service, as they were badly overweight upon completion, their low freeboard hampered operations at sea, and they handled poorly. &quot;Conway&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; describes her design as &quot;attempting too much on a very limited displacement.&quot; They were nevertheless the first modern battleships for the American fleet.

&quot;Indiana&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at and four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, generating a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, she was fitted with a heavy military mast, which was later supplemented by a stern cage mast in 1910–1911. She had a crew of 32 officers and 441 enlisted men, which increased to a total of 586–636 officers and enlisted.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /35 cal. guns, which were placed in four twin wing turrets. These were supported by a battery of six /40 cal. guns in a casemate battery amidships. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty 6-pounder guns and six 1-pounder guns in individual mounts. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Indiana&quot; carried  torpedo tubes in above-water mounts, though the number is unclear. According to &quot;Conway&#x27;s&quot;, she was fitted with six tubes, though the naval historian Norman Friedman states she was ordered with seven but completed with five.

&quot;Indiana&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and was reduced to at the bow and stern. The main battery gun turrets had thick sides, and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plate on their exposed sides. The 8 in turrets had 6 in of armor plating, and the casemate battery had . The conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history ==

=== Construction and early career ===
Construction of the ships was authorized on 30 June 1890, and the contract for &quot;Indiana&quot;—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp &amp; Sons in Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The ship&#x27;s total cost was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates caused a two-year delay. &quot;Indiana&quot;″s keel was laid down on 7 May 1891 and she was launched on 28 February 1893, attended by around 10,000 people, including President Benjamin Harrison, several members of his cabinet and the two senators from Indiana. During her fitting-out in early March 1894, the ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery. At this point, her side armor, guns, turrets, and conning tower had not yet been fitted, and her official trials would not take place until October 1895 due to the delays in armor deliveries.

&quot;Indiana&quot; was commissioned on 20 November 1895 under the command of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the ship&#x27;s motion, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the &quot;Indiana&quot; encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were installed on all three ships of the &quot;Indiana&quot;-class.

=== Spanish–American War ===
At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, &quot;Indiana&quot; was at Key West with the rest of the North Atlantic Squadron, at the time commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. His squadron was ordered to the Spanish port of San Juan in an attempt to intercept and destroy Admiral Cervera&#x27;s Spanish squadron, which was en route to the Caribbean from Spain. The harbor was empty, but &quot;Indiana&quot; and the rest of the squadron bombarded it for two hours on 12 May 1898 before realizing their mistake. The squadron returned to Key West, where news arrived three weeks later that Commodore Schley&#x27;s Flying Squadron had found Cervera and was now blockading him in the port of Santiago de Cuba. Sampson reinforced Schley on 1 June and assumed overall command.

In an attempt to break the stalemate, it was decided to attack Santiago from land. A transport convoy was assembled in Key West, and &quot;Indiana&quot; was sent back to lead it. The expeditionary force, under the command of Major General William Rufus Shafter, landed east of the city and attacked it on 1 July. Cervera saw that his situation was desperate and attempted to break through the blockade on 3 July 1898, resulting in the battle of Santiago de Cuba. The cruisers and and battleship &quot;Massachusetts&quot; had left the day before to load coal in Guantanamo Bay. Admiral Sampson&#x27;s flagship, the cruiser , had also sailed east earlier that morning for a meeting with General Shafter, leaving Commodore Schley in command. This left the blockade weakened and unbalanced on the day of the battle, as three modern battleships (&quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Oregon&quot; and ) and the armed yacht guarded the east, while the west was only defended by the second-class battleship , cruiser and armed yacht .

Occupying the extreme eastern position of the blockade, &quot;Indiana&quot; fired at the cruisers &quot;Infanta María Teresa&quot; and &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; as they left the harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable to keep up with the Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers &quot;Plutón&quot; and &quot;Furor&quot; emerged, &quot;Indiana&quot; was near the harbor entrance and, together with &quot;Iowa&quot;, she supported the armed yacht &quot;Gloucester&quot; in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, &quot;Vizcaya&quot; and &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;.

=== Post Spanish–American War ===
After the war, &quot;Indiana&quot; returned to training exercises with the North Atlantic Squadron. In May 1900, she and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; were placed in reserve as the navy had an acute officer shortage and needed to put the new and into commission. The battleships were reactivated the following month as an experiment in how quickly this could be achieved, but &quot;Indiana&quot; was placed in the reserve fleet again that winter. In March 1901, it was decided to use her that summer for a midshipman practice cruise, and this would be her regular summer job for the next few years, while the rest of the time she would serve as a training ship. During her time as a training vessel, her crew beat the 1903 world record with eight-inch guns, four bullseyes with four shots. She was decommissioned on 29 December 1903 to be overhauled and modernized. The obsolete battleship received several upgrades: new Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, counterweights to balance her main turrets, and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets. She was recommissioned on 9 January 1906 and manned by the former crew of her sister ship &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, including Captain Edward D. Taussig, commanding. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; had been decommissioned the day before to receive similar modernization.

During her second commission, &quot;Indiana&quot; spent most of her time laid up in the reserve fleet, occasionally participating in practice cruises. In January 1907, she helped provide relief in the aftermath of the 1907 Kingston earthquake. In 1908, the /40 caliber guns and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery turrets and because the ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops. At the same time, a cage mast was added. In early 1910, she was fitted with an experimental Lacoste speed brake, which would be deployed from the side of the hull to act as an emergency brake; the trials were inconclusive. By 1913 it was speculated that the ship might soon be used for target practice, but instead, the ship was decommissioned on 23 May 1914. After the United States entered World War I, &quot;Indiana&quot; was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island, and in the York River, and placed under the command of George Landenberger.

On 31 January 1919, she was decommissioned for the final time, and two months later, she was renamed &quot;Coast Battleship Number 1&quot; so that the name &quot;Indiana&quot; could be assigned to the newly authorized—but never completed—battleship . The old battleship was brought to shallow waters in the Chesapeake Bay near the wreck of the target ship (ex-Battleship &quot;Texas&quot;). Here she was subjected to aerial bombing tests conducted by the navy. She was hit with dummy bombs from aircraft, and explosive charges were set off at the positions where the bombs hit. The tests were a response to claims from Billy Mitchell—at the time assistant to Chief of Air Service Charles T. Menoher—who stated to Congress that the Air Service could sink any battleship. The conclusions drawn by the navy from the experiments conducted on &quot;Indiana&quot; were very different, as Captain William D. Leahy stated in his report: &quot;The entire experiment pointed to the improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out of action by aerial bombs.&quot; The subject remained a matter of dispute between Mitchell and the Navy, and several more bombing tests were conducted with other decommissioned battleships, culminating in the sinking of . Despite the navy&#x27;s conclusions, &quot;Indiana&quot; sank during the test and settled in the shallow water, where she remained until her wreck was sold for scrap on 19 March 1924. When the US Navy adopted hull numbers in 1920, &quot;Indiana&quot; was retroactively assigned the number &quot;BB-1&quot;.

<text>Communities in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, include incorporated municipalities, unincorporated communities and First Nations communities. 

Types of incorporated municipalities include urban municipalities, rural municipalities and northern municipalities. Urban municipalities are further classified into four sub-types – cities, towns, villages and resort villages. Northern municipalities, which are located in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (NSAD), are further classified into three sub-types – northern towns, northern villages and northern hamlets. Rural municipalities are not classified into sub-types.

Types of unincorporated communities include hamlets and organized hamlets within rural municipalities and northern settlements within the NSAD.

The administration of rural municipalities, towns, villages, resort villages, organized hamlets and hamlets is regulated by &quot;The Municipalities Act&quot;, while the administration of cities is regulated by &quot;The Cities Act&quot;. Administration of northern towns, northern villages, northern hamlets and northern settlements (those within the NSAD) is regulated by &quot;The Northern Municipalities Act&quot;.

In the 2021 Census, Saskatchewan&#x27;s communities combined for a total provincial population of 1,132,505.

==Municipalities==

Saskatchewan presently has 786 municipalities of various types (urban, rural and northern municipalities) and sub-types (cities, towns, villages, resort villages, northern towns, northern villages and northern hamlets).

===Urban municipalities===

Saskatchewan has 466 urban municipalities, which includes the sub-types of cities, towns, villages and resort villages.

==== Cities ====

In Saskatchewan, towns must have a population above 5,000 in order to be granted city status. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status or the appropriate provincial minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. The city of Melville retains city status as of 2010 despite dropping below 5,000 population in the 1990s.

Saskatchewan has 16 cities, including Lloydminster and not including Flin Flon.

====Towns====

In Saskatchewan, towns are formed from villages or resort villages with a population of at least 500 people. The council of the village or resort village must request the change to town status. When a town&#x27;s population exceeds 5,000 people, the council may request a change to city status, but the change in incorporation level is not mandatory. Towns with shrinking populations are allowed to retain town status even if the number of residents falls below the 500 limit. For example, the towns of Fleming, Francis, and Scott have populations that have dropped under 500 people and are still qualified under town status. Towns with populations below the limit may, however, revert to village or resort village status if the town council requests it.

Saskatchewan has 146 towns.

====Villages====

The people of an organized hamlet may request that the hamlet be incorporated as a village or resort village. In order to qualify, the hamlet must have been an organized hamlet for at least 3 years, have a population of at least 100 in the most recent census, and contain at least 50 separate dwelling units or business premises.

Saskatchewan has 260 villages.

==== Resort villages ====
Saskatchewan has 40 resort villages.

===Rural municipalities===
A rural municipality is created by the Minister of Municipal Affairs by ministerial order via section 49 of &quot;The Municipalities Act&quot;. Saskatchewan has 296 rural municipalities, which are located in the central and southern portions of the province.

Saskatchewan has 296 rural municipalities.

===Northern municipalities===

Saskatchewan has 24 northern municipalities, which includes the sub-types of northern towns, northern villages and northern hamlets.

====Northern towns====
A northern town is a town in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District. Its administration is regulated by &quot;The Northern Municipalities Act&quot;. A northern village may apply for town status when the actual resident population is at least 500.

Saskatchewan has two northern towns.

====Northern villages====
A northern village is located in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District, and its administration is regulated by The Northern Municipalities Act. A northern hamlet may apply for northern village status when the population is at least 100 and the northern hamlet contains at least 50 separate dwelling units or business premises.

Saskatchewan has 11 northern villages.

====Northern hamlets====
A northern hamlet is located in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District, and its administration is regulated by The Northern Municipalities Act. A northern settlement may apply for northern hamlet status when the population is at least 50 and the northern settlement contains at least 25 separate dwelling units or business premises. Unlike hamlets and northern settlements, northern hamlets are municipal corporations.

Saskatchewan has 11 northern hamlets.

==Unincorporated hamlets==

In Saskatchewan, a hamlet is an unincorporated community that is under the jurisdiction of a rural municipality. It has at least five occupied dwellings situated on separate lots and at least 10 separate lots, the majority of which are an average size of less than one acre.

The Government of Saskatchewan recognizes three different types of hamlets – generic &quot;hamlets&quot;, &quot;special service areas&quot; and &quot;organized hamlets&quot;. Some organized hamlets in Saskatchewan are recognized as designated places by Statistics Canada, while unorganized hamlets are not.

===Hamlets===
Generic hamlets in Saskatchewan are under the jurisdiction of a rural municipality and do not have any decision-making powers or independent authorities.

The following are hamlets that are neither special service areas nor organized hamlets.
===Special service areas===
Like a generic hamlet, a special service area is under the jurisdiction of a rural municipality and does not have any decision-making powers or independent authorities. Unlike a generic hamlet, a special service area may form its own electoral division within the rural municipality and may have a different tax regime within the rural municipality compared to a generic hamlet.

===Organized hamlets===
Saskatchewan has 151 organized hamlets that are established via ministerial order and under the jurisdiction of rural municipalities within southern and central Saskatchewan. The people in a hamlet may apply for organized hamlet status within the rural municipality in which the hamlet is located. The minimum requirements for organize status include a permanent population of at least 80 residents, 40 separate dwelling units or places of business, a taxable assessment of at least $4 million, and any other factor the minister may consider appropriate. 

==Northern settlements==
A northern settlement is an unincorporated community in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District, and its administration is regulated by The Northern Municipalities Act.

Saskatchewan has 11 northern settlements.

==Ghost towns==

A ghost town is a town that once had a considerable population, that has since dwindled in numbers causing some or all of its businesses and services to close, either due to the rerouting of a highway, railway tracks being pulled, or exhaustion of some natural resource.
