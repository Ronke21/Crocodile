<text>The pied wheatear (Oenanthe pleschanka) is a wheatear, a small insectivorous passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher (family Muscicapidae). This migratory central Asiatic wheatear occurs from the extreme southeast of Europe to China, and has been found wintering in India and northeastern Africa. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

The male is a boldly marked white-and-black bird. The white crown tinged with brown contrasts with the black face and throat and white rump. The female is browner, and the head is washed with sandy buff. Females are darker than the females of the northern wheatear, look smaller and show less white on the rump. The tail feathers are white with characteristic black markings, which form an inverted black &quot;T&quot; pattern that resembles the tail of the western black-eared wheatear. This bird nests in open, stony, sparsely vegetated regions, laying four to six eggs in a hole, under a stone or in a rock crevice. The pied wheatear primarily eats insects but will also take seeds.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;oenos&quot; (οίνος) &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; (ανθός) &quot;flower&quot;. It refers to the northern wheatear&#x27;s return to Greece in the spring just as the grapevines blossom. &quot;Pleschanka&quot; is the Russian name for the pied wheatear and refers to the white cap (&quot;plesch&quot; is a bald spot on the head). &quot;Wheatear&quot; is not derived from &quot;wheat&quot; or any sense of &quot;ear&quot;, but is a 16th-century linguistic corruption of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;, referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.

==Description==
The crown, nape and neck of the adult male pied wheatear are pale brown, the feathers having pale tips and white bases. The mantle and scapulars are black with buff tips to the feathers. The back, rump and upper tail-coverts are creamy-white. The central pair of tail feathers are black with white bases but the rest are white with black tips, the outer pair having rather more black than the rest. There is a narrow buff-coloured line extending from the base of the beak to over the eye and the lores, ear coverts, chin, throat and upper breast are black. The rest of the breast is buff, the belly creamy-buff and the underwing coverts and axillaries are black tipped with white. The wing feathers are black with tips and edgings of creamy-buff. The bird moults in late summer and by the following year, the edges of the feathers are abraded and the crown and nape are white and the mantle, scapulars and wings black. The beak, legs and feet are black and the eyes dark brown. The length is about .
The adult female is similar to the male but the mantle and scapulars are brown with buff tips rather than black, the tail feathers are brown and white and the wing feathers brown with buff tips. Again, abrasion wears of the tips of the feathers and the bird becomes more uniformly brown and white with creamy buff underparts. The female is slightly smaller than the male. The juvenile is similar to the female but the feathers of the brown upperparts have pale centres near the tips giving the bird a speckled appearance.

The voice is a harsh &quot;zack zack&quot;. The song is low-pitched and musical and is performed by the male in early summer and again in August. It consists of a variable, imitative series of notes, sometimes lark-like and sometimes whistling, pouring out in a continual stream. It is sung from a perch on a rock or other high place or in the air during flight.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pied wheatear is native to Southeast Europe and Western Asia. The breeding range extends from Romania and Bulgaria to Siberia, Altai and Mongolia and southwards to the Caucasus, Transcaspia, Turkestan, Iran and Afghanistan. It occurs at altitudes of up to in the Altai and up to in the Tien Shan.
It migrates to Northeast Africa, passing through Southwest Asia on the way. In the breeding season it is found in rough open country, steppes with scant vegetation, stony slopes and hilly country. In its winter quarters it is found in similar locations with rock, scree and on plains with thorny scrub. It sometimes visits grassy areas and gardens. It has occurred as a vagrant in Italy, Heligoland and Scotland.

==Behaviour==
The pied wheatear is rather shy but is conspicuous when spotted. It is not gregarious and single birds or pairs are found in rough, rocky countryside. It likes to perch on a bush or rock, alert and looking around and bobbing its tail up and down. When it spots a prey item it swoops down to the ground briefly to pick it up before returning to its perch. Its diet consists of small invertebrates such as ants, grasshoppers, beetles, flies and moths and their larvae, spiders and mites, and seeds are also eaten.

==Breeding==
The nest is made in holes in a riverbank, under stones and rocks and in crevices. It is made from dried grass stems and lined with slender roots and a few downy feathers. Four to six greenish-blue eggs with rust-coloured spots on the larger end are laid from early May onwards. They average and there is normally a single brood.

==Status==
The pied wheatear has a wide range across Eastern Europe and Western Asia and is common across that range. There are estimated to be somewhere between 96,000 and 420,000 individuals in Europe. As Europe forms 5 to 24% of the global range, the total population may be in the region of 400,000-8,400,000 individuals. The population is believed to be stable with no particular threats so the bird is rated as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot; by Birdlife International.

<text>A consolidation bill is a bill introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom with the intention of consolidating several acts of Parliament or statutory instruments into a single act. Such bills simplify the statute book without significantly changing the state of the law, and are subject to an expedited parliamentary procedure. Once enacted a consolidation bill becomes a consolidation act.

The parliamentary practice of legislating only for small portions of a subject at a time can create undue complexity in statute law. Acts relating to a particular subject often end up scattered over many years, and through the operation of clauses partially repealing or amending former acts, the specific meaning of the law regarding the subject becomes enveloped in intricate or contradictory expressions. For clarity, the law as expressed across many statutes is sometimes recast in a single statute, called a consolidation bill.

By 1911, such bills had been passed dealing with subjects as diverse as customs, stamps and stamp duties, public health, weights and measures, sheriffs, coroners, county courts, housing, municipal corporations, libraries, trustees, copyhold, diseases of animals, merchant shipping, and friendly societies.

These observations apply to the public general acts of the legislature. On the other hand, in settling local acts, such as those relating to railway and canal enterprise, the legislature always inserted certain clauses founded on reasons of public policy applicable to the business in question. To avoid the necessity of constantly re-enacting the same principles in local acts, their common clauses were embodied in separate statutes, and their provisions are ordered to be incorporated in any local act of the description mentioned therein. Such are the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 18),the Companies Clauses Act 1863 and the Railways Clauses Act 1863.

==Procedure==
Consolidation bills are introduced in the House of Lords which, by convention, has in these matters. The Lords has the only substantive discussion on the bill, at its second reading, before the bill is sent to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, which may propose amendments to it. Subject to this, the Lords&#x27; third reading and all readings in the House of Commons are usually formalities and pass without debate.

Most consolidation bills are proposed in the first instance by the Law Commission, and it is this prior consideration that gives rise to the expedited process afforded to these bills. Every consolidation bill proposed by the Law Commission has been passed by Parliament.

Once a consolidation bill receives royal assent it becomes a consolidation act. An example of a consolidation act is the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, which consolidated into a single act parts of sentencing legislation previously spread across twelve separate acts. Another example of a consolidation act in relation to sentencing is the Sentencing Act 2020, which significantly replaced many acts in relation to sentencing including the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.

==Categories==
There are five categories of bill that qualify as consolidation bills:
#Bills which only re-enact existing law.
#Bills which consolidate previous laws with amendments, proposed in response to recommendations from the Law Commission.
#Bills to repeal existing legislation, again prepared by the Law Commission.
#Bills to repeal various obsolete or unnecessary parts of existing legislation.
#Bills which make corrections and minor improvements to existing legislation, prepared under the Consolidation of Enactments (Procedure) Act 1949.

The first three categories now account for almost all consolidation bills.

<text>The Cyprus wheatear or Cyprus pied wheatear (Oenanthe cypriaca) is a small, 14–15 cm long passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It was formerly treated as a subspecies (race) of pied wheatear but Sluys and van den Berg (1982) argued that the form deserved full species status, on the basis of differences in biometrics and especially song, and the lack of sexual plumage dimorphism in &quot;cypriaca&quot;.

This migratory insectivorous species breeds only in Cyprus, and winters in southern Sudan and Ethiopia. It has been recorded as a vagrant on Heligoland, Germany.

This species closely resembles pied wheatear, although it has slightly more black on the tail and back, and on the head. The sexes are similar in appearance, a fact first documented by Christensen (1974). A 2010 study found that Cyprus wheatear differs from pied wheatear in fourteen external morphometric characters.

The song is distinctive, and very different from that of pied wheatear, resembling an insect. It consists of a series of high-pitched buzzing bursts.

The song-perches utilised by this species are high for a wheatear, typically being 5 to 10 metres above ground. It often breeds in woodland habitats, unlike other wheatears (Oliver 1990 suggested that it occupies the ecological niche used elsewhere in the Western Palearctic by the common redstart). It is the most arboreal species of wheatear in the western palearctic and it uses often aerial sallying and perch-pounce-feeding tactics. Recent work suggest an ecological differentiation between Cyprus wheatear and migrating northern wheatears &quot;O. oenanthe&quot; and black-eared wheatears &quot;O. hispanica melanoleuca&quot;. Cyprus wheatear uses more aerial sallying and occupies more forested habitats, but needs a minimum amount of open/bare ground, and a minimum of high bush/tree vegetation (Randler et al. 2009).

<doc id="195277" wikidata="Q1077225" url="?curid=195277" title="More Songs About Buildings and Food">
<text>More Songs About Buildings and Food is the second studio album by the American rock band Talking Heads, released on July 14, 1978, by Sire Records. It was the first of three albums produced by collaborator Brian Eno, and saw the band move toward an increasingly danceable style, crossing singer David Byrne&#x27;s unusual delivery with new emphasis on the rhythm section composed of bassist Tina Weymouth and her husband, drummer Chris Frantz.

&quot;More Songs&quot; established Talking Heads as a critical success, reaching number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart and number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. The album featured the band&#x27;s first top-thirty single, a cover of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;.

== Artwork and title==
The front cover of the album, conceived by Byrne and executed by artist Jimmy De Sana, is a photomosaic of the band comprising 529 close-up Polaroid photographs. The album&#x27;s rear cover shows &quot;Portrait U.S.A.&quot;, the first&lt;ref name=&quot;Landsat/Portrait-U.S.A.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; satellite color analog photomosaic of the United States from space, created by NASA and GE for National Geographic,&lt;ref name=&quot;whipplelib/Landsat&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; published in July 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;catalogue.nla.gov.au/2176956&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2020 memoir, &quot;Remain in Love&quot;, Frantz recalled that Byrne and Weymouth took the Polaroid photographs for the front cover on the roof of the loft building in Long Island City that Frantz and Weymouth lived in. Frantz wrote that he &quot;later realized [the cover art] was &#x27;heavily influenced&#x27; by Andrea Kovacs&#x27; work. We should have given her credit for that.&quot;

Of the album title, Weymouth told &quot;Creem&quot; in a 1979 interview:

XTC frontman Andy Partridge later claimed, however, that he gave the title to Byrne.

==Release==
&quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; was released on July 14, 1978. It peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. The album&#x27;s sole single, a cover of the Al Green hit &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;, peaked at number 26 on the pop singles chart in 1979. The single pushed the album to gold record status.

Warner Music Group re-released and remastered the album in 2005, on its Warner Bros., Sire and Rhino Records labels in DualDisc format, with four bonus tracks on the CD side—&quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1977 version), alternate versions of &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot; and &quot;The Big Country&quot;, and the &#x27;Country Angel&#x27; version of &quot;Thank You for Sending Me an Angel&quot;. The DVD-Audio side includes both stereo and 5.1 surround high resolution (96 kHz/24bit) mixes, as well as a Dolby Digital version and videos of the band performing &quot;Found a Job&quot; and &quot;Warning Sign&quot;. In Europe, it was released as a CD+DVDA two-disc set rather than a single DualDisc. The reissue was produced by Andy Zax with Talking Heads.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), critic Robert Christgau said &quot;Here the Heads become a quintet in an ideal producer-artist collaboration—Eno contributes/interferes just enough... Every one of these eleven songs is a positive pleasure, and on every one the tension between Byrne&#x27;s compulsive flights and the sinuous rock bottom of the music is the focus&quot;.

&quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; was ranked at number four among the top &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; for 1978 by &quot;NME&quot;, with &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; ranked at number 16 among the year&#x27;s top tracks. In 2003, the album was ranked number 382 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 383 in 2012, and 364 in 2020. It was ranked number 57 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the greatest albums of 1967–1987.

It was ranked the 45th best album of the 1970s by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2006. Reviewing the album for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Nick Sylvester said: &quot;&quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; transformed the Talking Heads from a quirky CBGB spectacle to a quirky near-unanimously regarded &#x27;it&#x27; band.&quot;

<text>Kevin John Wasserman (born February 4, 1963) better known as Noodles, is an American musician who serves as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the Offspring. He earned the nickname &quot;Noodles&quot; for his frequent &quot;noodling&quot; (improvising) on the guitar.

==Biography==
Before joining the Offspring, Noodles played in a local band called Clowns of Death along with some friends, including drummer James Lilja. Lilja got recruited by Dexter Holland to join his band Manic Subsidal, on an agreement that Lilja would play in Manic Subsidal, if Holland joined Lilja&#x27;s band Clowns of Death. After Holland played with Clowns of Death, he asked Noodles to join their band. After drummer Ron Welty joined the band in 1987 to replace James Lilja, the band started recording their debut album in 1989. After recording a demo in 1988, the Offspring signed a deal with a small-time label, Nemesis Records, for whom they recorded their first full-length album, &quot;The Offspring&quot;, in March 1989. This album would eventually be re-issued in 1995, by bandmate Greg K. and Holland&#x27;s own record label, Nitro Records. At one of the band&#x27;s earlier shows, he was stabbed in the shoulder by a skinhead.

In 1991, the Offspring signed with Epitaph Records (home of Bad Religion, L7, NOFX, Pennywise and other similar bands). Their first release on the label was &quot;Ignition&quot;, which was released in 1992. Their last album for that label was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot;, which still holds the world record for most sales of an album on an independent label. The band then signed with Columbia Records in 1996 (after Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph and guitarist for Bad Religion, sold the contract to Columbia) for whom they released their next six albums, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; (1997), &quot;Americana&quot; (1998), &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; (2000), &quot;Splinter&quot; (2003), &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; (2008) and &quot;Days Go By&quot; (2012). The albums &quot;Let The Bad Times Roll&quot; (2021) and &quot;Supercharged&quot; (2024) were released on Concord Records. Noodles is one of the two members (along with Dexter Holland) to appear on all of The Offspring&#x27;s albums

During the band&#x27;s early days, Noodles worked as a janitor at Earl Warren Elementary School in Garden Grove. Before &quot;Smash&quot; was released, he had been planning to quit the band, but the surprise success of &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; forced him to reconsider.

On their DVD release &quot;Huck It&quot; (2000), as part of a mock interview, Noodles claims to like the &quot;finer things in life&quot;, such as red wine, classical music, cigarettes, poetry and pasta. He occasionally goes snowmobiling and snowboarding.

==Equipment==

===Guitars===
Noodles generally plays Ibanez guitars, and he has now had four signature models, each of which is a Talman. His first was the NDM1, which has a duct tape finish. Second was the NDM2, which has the Offspring&#x27;s logo with glasses on the pickguard. His third
signature guitar, the NDM3, had P90 pickups. His latest signature guitar is the NDM4. It also has P90 pickups and has a sunburst finish on it. He prefers DiMarzio Tone Zone pickups.

In the early days of the Offspring, he played a wider range of guitars, including Fender Telecasters, Ibanez Talmans and Gibson Les Pauls. He also owns other guitar models, such as Paul Reed Smith guitars, a Fender Stratocaster and other Fender models, Jackson guitars, and Gibson guitars. In an interview on the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Complete Music Video Collection&quot;, Noodles said that he gave his Stratocaster to one of the actors that appeared on the video for their 1994 single &quot;Self Esteem&quot;.

===Amplifiers===
For early Offspring albums, Noodles used a Mesa/Boogie Mark IV. In 2013, he was turned on to VHT amplifiers by the band&#x27;s guitar tech and has since used Mark IVs and VHTs in unison.

<text>Abstinence pledges are commitments made by people, often though not always teenagers and young adults, to practice abstinence, usually in the case of practicing teetotalism with respect to abstaining from alcohol and other drugs, or chastity, with respect to abstaining from sexual intercourse until marriage; in the case of sexual abstinence, they are sometimes also known as purity pledges or virginity pledges. They are most common in the United States among Catholic and Evangelical Christian denominations, while others are nonsectarian.

==History==
The temperance movement arose in the 18th century and spread throughout Christians of the Methodist, Presbyterian, Quaker, and Roman Catholic denominations, among others. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), has encouraged people in their communities to sign abstinence pledges with the undersigned promising to not use alcohol or other drugs; the following is an example of wording that may appear on such abstinence pledge cards: &quot;I hereby promise, by the help of God, to abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors, including wine, beer, and cider as a beverage.&quot; Taking the abstinence pledge enrolls those signing the cards as members in the temperance organization that is distributing them, such as the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, Independent Order of Rechabites and International Organisation of Good Templars, among others. The Catholic Total Abstinence League of the Cross, founded by Cardinal Henry Manning in 1873, had the following pledge: &quot;I promise to you, reverend father, and to the League of the Holy Cross, by the help of God&#x27;s grace, to abstain from all intoxicating drinks.&quot; A similar organisation, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, continues distributing abstinence pledges today and Pope Pius X instated an plenary indulgence of 100 days for those promoting it. In Ireland, it is common for school children to take the pledge of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association after which they receive a lapel pin. 

The first program encouraging individuals to sign a pledge encouraging abstinence from sexual intercourse until marriage is True Love Waits, started in 1993 by the Southern Baptist Convention, which now claims over 2.5 million pledgers worldwide in dozens of countries. A torrent of abstinence pledge programs encouraging people to save sexual intercourse for marriage followed; one such program is the Silver Ring Thing (SRT), which started in 1995 has been featured in hundreds of media reports worldwide. In 2005, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services because it believed SRT used tax dollars to promote Christianity. SRT presented a two-part program, the first part about abstinence; the second about how the Christian faith fits into an abstinence commitment. The ACLU claimed federal funding given to this program violated their interpretation of separation of church and state.

On August 22, 2005, the department suspended SRT&#x27;s $75,000 federal grant until it submitted a &quot;corrective action plan.&quot;
In 2006, a corrective action plan was accepted by the department, the lawsuit was dismissed and SRT received its federal funding.

Abstinence pledge programs take a variety of stances on the role of religion in the pledge: some use religion to motivate the pledge, putting Biblical quotes on the cards, while others use statistics and arguments to motivate the pledge. Advocacy of virginity pledges is often coupled with support for abstinence-only sex education in public schools. Advocates argue that any other type of sexual education would promote sex outside of marriage, which they hold to be immoral and risky.

==Gallery and examples==

Independent Order of Rechabites (IOR) 1900 abstinence pledge:

I promise to abstain from all intoxicating liquors as beverages and to discountenance their use by others.

Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) current abstinence pledge:

I hereby solemnly promise, God helping me, to abstain from all distilled, fermented and malt liquors, including wine beer and hard cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in the same.

Pioneer Total Abstinence Association abstinence pledge and prayer (recited twice daily by members): 

For your greater glory and consolation, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, for your sake to give good example, to practice self-denial, to make reparation to you for the sins of intemperance and for the conversion of excessive drinkers, I will abstain for life from all intoxicating drinks. Amen.

True Love Waits 1993 abstinence pledge read as follows:

&quot;Believing that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, those I date, and my future mate to be sexually pure until the day I enter marriage.&quot;

True Love Waits more recent abstinence pledge reads:

&quot;Believing that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, my friends, my future mate, and my future children to a lifetime of purity including sexual abstinence from this day until the day I enter a Biblical marriage relationship.&quot;

True Love Waits recent abstinence pledge (2009):

&quot;I am making a commitment to myself, my family, and my Creator, that I will abstain from sexual activity of any kind before marriage. I will keep my body and my thoughts pure as I trust in God&#x27;s perfect plan for my life.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(quote on card) &quot;&quot;It is God&#x27;s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his/her own body in a way that is holy and honorable.&quot; 1 Thess 4:3-4&quot;
==Studies==
There have been numerous peer-reviewed studies on those who have taken abstinence pledges promising to maintain chastity until marriage, with varying results. Four of the five peer-reviewed virginity pledge studies and the non-peer-reviewed study discussed below use the same federal data, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), in which 13,000 adolescents were interviewed in 1995, 1996, and 2000. The other peer-reviewed study used a study of virginity pledges in California.

The first peer-reviewed study of virginity pledgers (by sociologists Peter Bearman of Columbia and Hannah Brueckner of Yale) found that in the year following their pledge, some virginity pledgers are more likely to delay sex than non-pledgers; when virginity pledgers do have sex, they are less likely to use contraception than non-pledgers. This study found that virginity pledges are only effective in high schools in which about 30% of the students had taken the pledge, meaning that they are not effective as a universal measure. Their analysis was that identity movements work when there is a critical mass of members: too few members, and people do not have each other for social support, and too many members, and people do not feel distinctive for having taken the pledge. This study was criticized for not being able to conclude causality, only correlation, a criticism which applies to all studies of virginity pledges thus far.

A second peer-reviewed study, also by Bearman and Brueckner, looked at virginity pledgers five years after their pledge, and found that the pledgers have similar proportions of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and at least as high proportions of anal and oral sex as those who have not made a virginity pledge. They deduced that there was substitution of oral and anal sex for vaginal sex among the pledgers, although the data for anal sex without vaginal sex reported by males did not reflect this directly.
This study also estimated that male pledgers were 4.1 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (25% vs. 6%), and estimated that female pledgers were 3.5 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (21% vs. 6%). The study also noted that those who pledge yet became sexually active reported fewer partners and were not exposed to STI risk for as long as nonpledgers. 
A third peer-reviewed study — by Melina Bersamin and others at Prevention Research Center, in Berkeley, California — found that adolescents who make an informal promise to themselves not to have sex will delay sex, but adolescents who take a formal virginity pledge do not delay sex.

A fourth peer-reviewed study — by Harvard public health researcher Janet Rosenbaum published in the American Journal of Public Health in June 2006 — found that over half of adolescents who took virginity pledges said the following year that they had never taken a pledge. This study showed that those who make the pledge but have sex are likely to deny ever pledging; and many who were sexually active prior to taking the pledge deny their sexual history, which, it is speculated, may cause them to underestimate their risk of having STIs.

A fifth peer-reviewed study, also by Janet Rosenbaum published in the journal &quot;Pediatrics&quot; in 2009, found no difference in sexual behavior of pledgers and similar non-pledgers five years after pledging, but found pledgers were 10 percentage points less likely to use condoms and 6 percentage points less likely to use birth control than similar non-pledgers. Rosenbaum&#x27;s study was innovative for using Rubin causal model matching, instead of relying on regression analysis, which makes potentially untrue parametric assumptions. According to Rosenbaum, past research findings that virginity pledgers delayed sex may have been affected by their statistical method&#x27;s inability to adjust fully for pre-existing differences between pledgers and non-pledgers: pledgers are much more negative toward premarital sex prior to even taking the pledge, so would be predicted to delay sex even if they had not taken the pledge. Comparing pledgers with similar non-pledgers is the only way to be certain that the effect comes from the pledge rather than the pre-existing greater beliefs of pledgers that sexuality should be restrained to the matrimonial context.
When examining the dynamics of abstinence pledges in the purity culture, it becomes clear that these pledges exist on the boundary between intentional and unintentional, as articulated by Muskrat (2024)https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13558358.2024.2332980. It is not uncommon for purity culture to create a space where teens are even encouraged to promise themselves no sex before marriage, the stage that society heavily stresses on temperature. Nevertheless, during the period of purity culture, when there is no restriction on physical intimacy, abstinence supporters often harbor doubts about the conformity of sexual behavior among the younger generation. g generation. The liminality (Muskrat, 2024), as with the whole nuance of the transition period from adolescence to adulthood, is the underlying necessity for learning to surmount the restraint that comes with a strict moral pattern.

On the other hand, Ray (2023) will talk in depth about virginity checking (VCT) and hymnography (HTG)https://books.google.co.ke/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=40DkEAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=RA1-PT21&amp;dq=virginity+pledges+journal+taylor+and+francis&amp;ots=2dLjGWntYS&amp;sig=qD_PuMtzeiQ6CCQJctuD--p40xc&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=virginity%20pledges%20journal%20taylor%20and%20francis&amp;f=false. He will also talk about the larger cultural norms that led to these practices. These norms show us how much society (especially women) values and expects people to uphold the traditions and customs of purity and righteousness. Indeed, such pledges can be perceived as a source of protection against the trend that modern civilization transmission and changing social norms are causing, undermining classical beliefs. On the other hand, Ray&#x27;s (2023) work on the campaign to make harmful cultural practices unacceptable exposes this approach as not up-to-date, rather ineffective, and even dangerous when promoting sexual health and well-being, and in general when taking into account the complexity of nowadays&#x27;s varied cultural, gender, and sexual development.

==Criticism==
The efficacy of virginity pledges has been extensively studied. Some studies suggest virginity pledges may delay vaginal intercourse, but are ineffective in reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections because pledgers may replace vaginal sex with other kinds, such as oral sex and anal sex. Other studies suggest no such substitution among pledgers, though pledgers may partake in vaginal or oral sex. Virginity pledges may also reduce the likelihood of contraceptive use once pledgers decide to engage in sex. Though studies have reported this and found that pledgers are more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who do not pledge and that those who do become sexually active report fewer sexual partners, at least one study found no difference in the sexual behavior of pledgers and non-pledgers after controlling for pre-existing differences between the groups. According to a study published in 2014 from the University of Washington, Evangelical men who made an abstinence pledge and got married would like more conversations about the place of sex in marriage in their churches.

<text>The Diet of Worms of 1521 ( ) was an imperial diet (a formal deliberative assembly) of the Holy Roman Empire called by Emperor Charles V and conducted in the Imperial Free City of Worms. Martin Luther was summoned to the diet in order to renounce or reaffirm his views in response to a Papal bull of Pope Leo X. In answer to questioning, he defended these views and refused to recant them. At the end of the diet, the Emperor issued the Edict of Worms (&quot;Wormser Edikt&quot;), a decree which condemned Luther as &quot;a notorious heretic&quot; and banned citizens of the Empire from propagating his ideas. Although the Protestant Reformation is usually considered to have begun in 1517, the edict signals the first overt schism.

The diet was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521 at the Bischofshof palace in Worms, with the Emperor presiding. Other imperial diets took place at Worms in the years 829, 926, 1076, 1122, 1495, and 1545, but unless plainly qualified, the term &quot;Diet of Worms&quot; usually refers to the assembly of 1521.

== Background ==
In June 1520, Pope Leo X issued the Papal bull &quot;Exsurge Domine&quot; (&quot;Arise, O Lord&quot;), outlining 41 purported errors found in Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; and other writings related to or written by him. Luther first attracted the attention of ecclesiastical authorities after the publication of his &quot;95 Theses&quot; (written 1517) in 1518. Luther continued to preach, write, and publish his attacks on the Church, was excommunicated in January 1521, and told to appear before the assembly at the city of Worms (pronounced Verms). Luther was summoned by the emperor. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony obtained an agreement that, if Luther appeared, he would be promised safe passage to and from the meeting. This guarantee was essential after the treatment of Jan Hus, who was tried and executed at the Council of Constance in 1415 despite a promise of safe conduct.

Emperor Charles V commenced the Imperial Diet of Worms on 23 January 1521 where Luther was considered outlawed by the Catholic Church as all of his writings were condemned as heretical to the church. Luther was summoned to renounce or reaffirm his views. When he appeared before the assembly on 16 April, Johann von Eck, an assistant of the Archbishop of Trier, Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads at that time, acted as spokesman for the emperor. He refused to recant and was charged as a &quot;notorious heretic&quot; and outlaw, making him a criminal.

==Martin Luther==
The main events of the Diet of Worms relating to Luther took place from 16 to 18 April 1521.

On 16 April, Luther arrived in Worms. He was told to appear before the diet at 4 PM the following day. Jerome Schurff, Wittenberg professor in canon law, was Luther&#x27;s lawyer before the diet. The Pope did not appear.

On 17 April, the imperial marshal, Ulrich von Pappenheim, and the herald, Caspar Sturm, came for Luther. Pappenheim reminded Luther that he should speak only in answer to direct questions from the presiding officer, . Eck asked if a collection of books was Luther&#x27;s and if he was ready to revoke their heresies. Schurff said: &quot;Please have the titles read&quot;. There were 25 of them, probably including &quot;The Ninety-five Theses&quot;, &quot;Resolutions Concerning the 95 Theses&quot;, &quot;On the Papacy at Rome&quot;, &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot;, &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot;, and &quot;On the Freedom of a Christian&quot;. Luther requested more time for a proper answer, so he was given until the next day at 4 p.m.

On 18 April, Luther, saying that he had prayed for long hours and consulted with friends and mediators, presented himself before the diet. When the counselor put the same questions to him, Luther first apologized that he lacked the etiquette of the court. Then he answered, &quot;They are all mine, but as for the second question, they are not all of one sort.&quot; Luther went on to place the writings into three categories: (1) Works which were well received even by his enemies: those he would not reject. (2) Books which attacked the abuses, lies, and desolation of the Christian world and the papacy: those, Luther believed, could not safely be rejected without encouraging abuses to continue. To retract them would be to open the door to further oppression, he said. &quot;If I now recant these, then, I would be doing nothing but strengthening tyranny&quot;. (3) Attacks on individuals: he apologized for the harsh tone of these writings but did not reject the substance of what he taught in them; if he could be shown by Scripture that his writings were in error, Luther continued, he would reject them. Luther then concluded, saying:

According to tradition, Luther is said to have declared, &quot;Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise&quot;, before concluding with &quot;God help me. Amen.&quot;

According to Luther, Eck informed Luther that he was acting like a heretic:

Private conferences were held to determine Luther&#x27;s fate, but he was not arrested at Worms. Through negotiations by his prince, Frederick III, Luther was given a letter of safe conduct to and from the hearing. After his dismissal, he departed for his home in Wittenberg. However, fearing for Luther&#x27;s safety, Frederick III sent men to fake a highway attack and abduct Luther, hiding him away at Wartburg Castle. Wartburg Castle where he was kept in protective custody, disguised as a knight, for nearly a year (early May 1521 to early March 1522). &quot;There, high above the surrounding hills, Luther said, he was ensconced in the land of the birds. It was a fitting respite for one whom the Nuremberg Mastersinger Hans Sachs called “the Wittenberg nightingale.”

The Edict of Worms was a decree issued on 25 May 1521 by Emperor Charles V. Its contents proscribed Luther&#x27;s writings, declaring him a heretic and an enemy of the state, even permitting anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence; the imperial ban. Though it was never enforced, (the movement for reform and protection from Protestant supporters acted in his favour) Roman Catholic rulers sought to suppress Luther and his followers, and Luther&#x27;s travels were restricted for the rest of his life.

It was the culmination of an ongoing struggle between Martin Luther and the Catholic Church over reform, especially concerning the practice of donations for indulgences. However, there were other deeper issues that revolved around both theological concerns:
*On a theological level, Luther had challenged the absolute authority of the Pope over the Church by maintaining that the doctrine of indulgences, as authorized and taught by the Pope, was wrong. 
*Luther maintained that salvation was by faith alone (&quot;sola fide&quot;) without reference to good works, alms, penance, or the Church&#x27;s sacraments. Luther maintained that the sacraments were a &quot;means of grace&quot;, meaning that while grace was imparted through the sacraments, the credit for the action belonged to God and not to the individual.

== Other decisions ==
The Diet of Worms was also the occasion for Charles V to reform the administration of the Empire. Given the vast domains of the House of Habsburg, the Emperor was often on the road and needed deputies, including the Governors of the Netherlands and the Regents of Spain, for the times he was absent from his territories.

Charles V elevated his younger brother Ferdinand to the status of Archduke as Imperial Lieutenant. As such, Ferdinand became regent and governor of the Austrian hereditary lands of Charles V and the Emperor&#x27;s representative in Germany. Ferdinand&#x27;s role as chairman of the German Imperial government was never implemented, however, and ended in 1523 with the body&#x27;s dissolution. Ferdinand&#x27;s rule of the Austrian lands in the name of the Emperor was confirmed with the secret &quot;Habsburg compact of Brussels&quot; in 1522, according to which Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as King of the Romans in Germany, which took place in 1531.

Following the abdications of Charles V in 1556, Ferdinand succeeded Charles as emperor and became &quot;suo jure&quot; Archduke of Austria.

== Aftermath ==
When Martin Luther eventually emerged from Wartburg, the emperor, distracted with other matters, did not press for Luther&#x27;s arrest. Ultimately, because of rising public support for Luther among the German people and the protection of certain German princes, the Edict of Worms was never enforced in Germany. However, in the Habsburg Netherlands, comprising present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, the Edict was initially enforced against Luther&#x27;s most active supporters. This could be done because these countries were under the direct rule of Emperor Charles V and his appointed regent, Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy and Charles&#x27; aunt.

In December 1521, Jacob Proost, prior of the Augustinian monastery in Antwerp, was the first Luther-supporting cleric to be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Worms Edict. In February 1522, Proost was compelled to make public recantation and repudiation of Luther&#x27;s teachings. Later that year, additional arrests were made among the Augustinians in Antwerp. Two monks, Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos, refused to recant; on 1 July 1523, they were burned at the stake in Brussels.

The 1522 and 1524 Diets of Nuremberg attempted to execute the judgement of the Edict of Worms against Luther, but they failed.

<doc id="195291" wikidata="Q1356850" url="?curid=195291" title="La Güera">
<text>La Güera ( &quot;al-Gūwayra&quot;; also known as &quot;La Agüera&quot;, &quot;Lagouira&quot;, &quot;El Gouera&quot;) is a ghost town on the Atlantic coast at the southern tip of Western Sahara, on the western side of the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula which is split in two by the Mauritania–Western Sahara border, west of Nouadhibou. It is also the name of a daira at the Sahrawi refugee camps in south-western Algeria.

It is the southernmost town of Western Sahara. La Güera is situated about south of the Moroccan Wall at Guerguerat and is technically abandoned.

==History==
The name La Güera comes from the Spanish word &quot;&quot; which is a ditch that carries rainwater to crops.

===Foundation and settlement===
La Güera came into existence in late 1920, when Spanish colonizer Francisco Bens (who had earlier taken possession of the Cape Juby region as a protectorate in 1916), after negotiating with tribal chiefs of the zone, established a fort and an air base on the western side of the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula, just a few kilometers away from the French settlement of Port-Étienne (now Nouadhibou) on the eastern side of the peninsula. (In the 1912 Convention of Madrid, Spain and France had agreed on a border between Mauritania and Spanish possessions that ran down the middle of the peninsula.)

In 1924, La Güera was incorporated into the Spanish colony of Río de Oro. During the short period (1920–1924) that the town was ruled as a separate part of the colony it released its own postage stamps. The town was served by La Güera Airport until the 1970s.

===Western Sahara War===
In 1979, when Mauritania withdrew from the war, La Güera&#x27;s population was estimated to be 816 inhabitants.

Since the Alegal Madrid Tripartite Agreement of 1975 it remains Territory in dispute. Before the long Sahrawi liberation war, the city was famous for its rich marine fauna: the monk seal as a symbol of the City, cetaceans and the special relationship of symbiosis in the art of fishing of these (dolphins) with fishermen belonging to the segment of the Sahrawi population most attached to Berber customs whose Amazigh language was still preserved, in the highest proportion of the territory, in addition to techniques and linguistic terms in common with Spanish fishermen from the Canary Islands and brothers of the same ethnic group imraguen, from the Mauritanian side. The times when the &quot;Canary-Saharan fishing bank&quot; functioned at full capacity for the local people are now only memories of the yesterday.

By 2002, it had been still abandoned and partially overblown by sand, inhabited only by a very few Imraguen fishermen and guarded by a Mauritanian military outpost, despite this not being Mauritanian territory.

<text>William Wesley Peters (June 12, 1912 – July 17, 1991) was an American architect and engineer, apprentice to and protégé of his father-in-law Frank Lloyd Wright.

==Early life==
Wes, as he was known to friends and associates, was born in Terre Haute, Indiana on June 12, 1912. He was the elder of two children born to Frederick Romer Peters and Claire Adelaide (née Margedant) Peters. His sister, Margedant Peters, was the wife of S. I. Hayakawa, the 9th President of San Francisco State University who served as a United States senator from California. His mother was an editor and activist and his father, an Ohio native and son of a Methodist minister, was the founding editor of the &quot;Evansville Press&quot; and &quot;Terre Haute Post&quot;, and was later inducted into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame.

He was educated at Evansville College (now the University of Evansville) and went on to two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Career==
Instead of returning to MIT, Peters went to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to join Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Taliesin Fellowship as, apparently, its first apprentice when it began in 1932. Wright wrote about Peters in his own autobiography: Among the very first to come in to the Fellowship, a tall dark-eyed young man turned up at Taliesin. He was the son of an Evansville editor…. The lad came from a course in engineering at Massachusetts Tech, was a fountain of energetic loyalty to the ideas for which Taliesin stood. He soon took a leading hand in whatever went on. His mind was alert, his character independent and generous. He was young—about nineteen….He remained extremely loyal to the Wright organization throughout his entire career.

Among his accomplishments were assisting Wright in the construction of Fallingwater, in Stewart Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, and the Johnson Wax administration building in Racine, Wisconsin. Peters was responsible for the structural designs of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City and for the laboratory tower at Johnson Wax, among many other projects. He and Taliesin Associates are credited with the design for the Kaden Tower in Louisville, Kentucky, the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts in San Jose, California, and the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota, Florida.

Peters also designed the Pearl Palace in Tehran, Iran on request from Princess Shams Pahlavi.

===Later life===

Upon Wright&#x27;s death in 1959, Peters became chairman of Taliesin Associated Architects, and in 1985, he became chairman of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, serving until his death in 1991.

In 1990, he gave an interview to Wolfgang von Freeden from Lübeck, Germany, about his life and work, including his part in realising the Pearl Palace with the help of glass craftsmen from Murano, Italy.

==Personal life==

In 1935, Peters married Wright&#x27;s step-daughter, Svetlana Hinzenberg Wright (1917–1946), who had just turned eighteen years old. Together, Svetlana and Wes had two children:

* Brandoch Peters (1941–2022), a cello prodigy who spent most of his adult life raising sheep.
* Daniel Peters (1944–1946), who died aged two in an automobile accident with his mother.

Svetlana, who was pregnant with their third child, and their son Daniel died in an automobile accident in 1946, after which Peters raised their other son, Brandoch, though he spent most of his youth with the Wrights since Peters was travelling for work often. 

Peters later briefly married Svetlana Alliluyeva (1926–2011), the youngest child and only daughter of Joseph Stalin, in a union arranged by his former mother-in-law, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright. Before their marriage on April 12, 1970, Alliluyeva had defected from the Soviet Union, renounced her father&#x27;s tyrannical rule and come to the United States in 1967. Before divorcing in 1973, the couple had one daughter:

* Olga Peters (later known as Chrese Evans) (b. 1971).

===Legacy===
The William Wesley Peters Library at The School of Architecture headquartered in Paradise Valley, Arizona (formerly at Taliesin), which contains a collection of over 32,000 volumes, is named in his honor.

<doc id="195300" wikidata="Q913435" url="?curid=195300" title="Natty Dread">
<text>Natty Dread is the seventh album by Bob Marley and the Wailers, released in 1974. Previously Marley had recorded with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer as the Wailers, and this was his first record without them.

&quot;Natty Dread&quot; was most popularly received in the UK, where it peaked at No. 43 and sold in excess of 100,000 copies, making it a gold album. Over time it gained popularity in other parts of the world, and in 2003 it was ranked No. 181 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

== Content ==

&quot;Natty Dread&quot; is a spiritually charged political and social statement. It opens with a blues-influenced positive celebration of skanking, reggae and sex, &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot;. The original and still unreleased demo of the Island version of &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; was recorded in 1973.

&quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, the second track, is probably the best known recording on the album. It is a nostalgic remembrance of growing up in the impoverished streets of Trenchtown, the ghetto of Kingston, Jamaica, and the happiness brought by the company of friends. The song has been performed by artists as diverse as Boney M. (sung by Liz Mitchell), The Fugees, Pearl Jam, Jimmy Buffett, Rancid and Gilberto Gil. Songwriting credit for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; went to &quot;V. Ford&quot;. Vincent Ford, better known as &quot;Tartar&quot; to his friends and neighbors, had been a kind friend of Marley as a child in Trenchtown. Marley claimed he would have starved to death on several occasions as a child if not for the aid of Tartar. The original version of the song was in gospel style, featuring Peter Tosh and some unknown female backing vocals and was cut for Island in 1973.

&quot;Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)&quot; is a warning against allowing a nation&#x27;s poor to go hungry, with the prophetic warning &quot;a hungry mob is an angry mob&quot;, while &quot;Talkin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; go deeper into controversial political commentary. &quot;Rebel Music (3 O&#x27;Clock Roadblock)&quot; is a reflection on the potential impact of reggae music on Jamaican society. The song was written after Marley had been stopped by a night-time police carcheck. The influence of Marley&#x27;s increasing devotion to Rastafari can be heard in religious-themed songs like &quot;So Jah S&#x27;eh&quot;, &quot;Natty Dread&quot; and &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot;, while Marley&#x27;s reputation as a romantic is confirmed with smooth, seductive songs like &quot;Bend Down Low&quot;. The title track of the album takes its title from an idealised personification of the Rastafari movement, Natty Dread.

=== Songwriting credits ===
Although the album&#x27;s liner notes list multiple songwriters, including family, friends and band members, all songs were written by Marley. Marley was involved in a contractual dispute with his former publishing company, Cayman Music.

Vincent Ford, a childhood friend from Jamaica, was given writing credit for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, as well as the songs &quot;Crazy Baldheads&quot; (with Marley&#x27;s wife Rita), &quot;Positive Vibration&quot; and &quot;Roots Rock Reggae&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot;, along with &quot;Inna De Red&quot; and &quot;Jah Bless&quot; with Marley&#x27;s son, Stephen.

Marley had not wanted his new songs to be associated with Cayman and it had been speculated, including in his obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, that he had put them in the names of his close friends and family members as a means of avoiding the contractual restrictions and as a way to &quot;provide lasting help to family and close friends&quot;.

Marley&#x27;s former manager Danny Sims sued to obtain royalty and ownership rights to the songs, claiming that Marley had actually written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford to avoid meeting commitments made in prior contracts. A 1987 court decision sided with the Marley estate, which assumed full control of the songs.

==Release==
&quot;Natty Dread&quot; was released 25 October 1974 by Island and Tuff Gong.

In 1975, this album was mentioned in a few audio magazines as being ready to be released on Quadraphonic 8-track tape. This never happened. However, the Quadraphonic mixes of &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; and &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; have been bootlegged from the master tapes and are available on the internet.

In 2001, a re-mastered edition of &quot;Natty Dread&quot; was released by Universal Records containing a bonus track.

==Reception and legacy==
Released in the US in May 1975, the album reached the top half of the Billboard 200 at No. 92. When it was released in the UK in October 1975, it did even better, reaching No. 43.

In 2003, the album was ranked No. 181 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. In 2025, the publication ranked &quot;Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)&quot; at number 12 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.&quot; The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="195305" wikidata="Q939505" url="?curid=195305" title="Disintegration (The Cure album)">
<text>Disintegration is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 2 May 1989, by Fiction Records. The band recorded the album at Hookend Recording Studios in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, with co-producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989.

The album marks a return to the introspective gothic rock style the band had established in the early 1980s. As he neared the age of 30, vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the band&#x27;s pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group&#x27;s newfound popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. Following the completion of the mixing, founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band.

&quot;Disintegration&quot; became the band&#x27;s highest charting album up to that point, reaching number three on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and produced several hit singles, including &quot;Lovesong&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It remains the band&#x27;s highest-selling record to date, with more than four million copies sold worldwide. It was greeted with a warm critical reception before later being widely acclaimed, including being placed at number 116 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2020. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it the &quot;culmination of all the musical directions the Cure were pursuing over the course of the &#x27;80s&quot;.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s 1987 double album &quot;Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot; was commercially successful, with a sold-out world tour booked in its wake. Despite the international success the band was now enjoying, internal friction was increasing due to Lol Tolhurst&#x27;s increasing alcoholism at the time. Keyboardist Roger O&#x27;Donnell (who had recently been touring with The Psychedelic Furs), was soon hired as a second touring keyboardist. As Tolhurst&#x27;s alcohol consumption increased, the other band members would tease Tolhurst, leading Smith to later comment that his behaviour was similar to that of &quot;some kind of handicapped child being constantly poked with a stick&quot;. At the end of the Kissing Tour in support of the album, Smith became uncomfortable with the side effects of being a pop star and moved to Maida Vale (in West London) with fiancée Mary Poole. Regularly taking LSD to cope with his depression, Smith once again felt the band was being misunderstood and sought to return to its dark side with their next record.

== Recording and production ==
Smith&#x27;s anguish prior to the recording of &quot;Disintegration&quot; gave way to the realisation on his 29th birthday that he would turn 30 in one year. This realisation was frightening to him, as he felt all the masterpieces in rock and roll had been completed well before the band members reached such an age. Smith consequently began to write music without the rest of the band. The material he had written instantly took a dismal, depressing form, which he credited to &quot;the fact that I was gonna be thirty&quot;. The band convened at drummer Boris Williams&#x27;s home and compared their individual demos that each member recorded, and they rated them &quot;1 to 10&quot;, then the group met later at a second session and recorded a total of 32 songs at Williams&#x27;s house with a 16-track recorder by the end of the summer. Of these 32 songs, 12 would make it onto the final album.

When the band entered Hook End Manor Studios, their attitude had turned sour towards Tolhurst&#x27;s escalating alcohol abuse, although Smith insisted that his displeasure was caused by a meltdown in the face of recording the band&#x27;s career-defining album and reaching 30. Displeased with the swollen egos he believed his bandmates possessed, Smith entered what he considered to be &quot;one of my non-talking modes&quot; deciding &quot;I would be monk-like and not talk to anyone. It was a bit pretentious really, looking back, but I actually wanted an environment that was slightly unpleasant&quot;. He sought to abandon the mood present on &quot;Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot; and the pop singles they had released, and rather recreate the atmosphere of the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Pornography&quot; (1982). Despite the serious subject matter of the album, O&#x27;Donnell commented in 2009 that the atmosphere in the studio was still upbeat during the sessions: &quot;I remember very clearly laughing and joking and fooling around in the control room while Robert was singing &#x27;Disintegration&#x27;, and then all of us trying to be serious when he came in to listen back.[...] It was never a serious atmosphere in the studio, and when you think about the album and how dark it is, I&#x27;m sure people think we were sitting around slitting our wrists with candles and chains hanging from the walls.&quot;

While Tolhurst had contributed to the foundation of the song &quot;Homesick&quot; (according to O&#x27;Donnell), his musical contributions to the album were marginal as his alcohol abuse rendered him more or less incapable of playing. The other members, finally, threatened to quit if Tolhurst was not fired before the end of the recording session. When Tolhurst arrived to the mixing of the album, and then became excessively drunk, a shouting match ensued and he left the building furious; three weeks later, Smith decided to terminate his tenure with the band prior to the band&#x27;s upcoming tour. It was during this period that O&#x27;Donnell was asked by Smith to become a full-time member, instead of simply a touring musician. Despite Tolhurst&#x27;s ejection from the group, Smith told &quot;NME&quot; in April 1989, &quot;He&#x27;ll probably be back by Christmas. He&#x27;s getting married, maybe that&#x27;s his comeback.&quot; Tolhurst briefly reunited with the band in 2011 during the Reflection tour.

== Music ==
&quot;Disintegration&quot; was Smith&#x27;s thematic return to a dark and gloomy aesthetic that the Cure had explored in the early 1980s. Smith deliberately sought to record an album that was depressing, as it was a reflection of the despondency he felt at the time. The sound of the album was a shock to the band&#x27;s American label Elektra Records; the label requested Smith shift the release date back several months. Smith recalled &quot;they thought I was being &#x27;wilfully obscure&#x27;, which was an actual quote from the letter [Smith received from Elektra]. Ever since then I realised that record companies don&#x27;t have a fucking clue what The Cure does and what The Cure means.&quot; Despite rumours that Smith was one of the only contributors to the record, he confirmed that more than half of the dozen tracks on &quot;Disintegration&quot; had substantial musical input from the rest of the band.

&quot;Disintegration&quot; is characterised by a significant usage of synthesizers and keyboards, slow, &quot;droning&quot; guitar progressions and Smith&#x27;s introspective vocals. &quot;Plainsong&quot;, the album&#x27;s opener, &quot;set the mood for &quot;Disintegration&quot; perfectly&quot;, according to biographer Jeff Apter, by &quot;unravelling ever so slowly in a shower of synths and guitars, before Smith steps up to the mic, uttering snatches of lyrics (&#x27;I&#x27;m so cold&#x27;) as if he were reading from something as sacred as the Dead Sea Scroll.&quot; Smith felt the song was a perfect opener for the record, describing it as &quot;very lush, very orchestral&quot;. The album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Closedown&quot;, contains layers of keyboard texture complemented with a slow, gloomy guitar line. The track was written by Smith as a means to list his physical and artistic shortcomings. Despite the dark mood present throughout &quot;Disintegration&quot;, &quot;Lovesong&quot; was an upbeat track that became a hit in the United States. Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted the difference from other songs: &quot;the Simon Gallup/Boris Williams rhythm section create a tight, serviceable dance groove, while Smith and Porl Thompson add further guitar fills and filigrees as well, adding just enough extra bite to the song. Smith himself delivers the lyric softly, with gentle passion.&quot;

Much of the album made use of a considerable amount of guitar effects. &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot;, a depressing track (Raggett noted: &quot;the phrase &#x27;savage torpor&#x27; probably couldn&#x27;t better be applied anywhere else than to this song&quot;) sees Thompson and Smith &quot;treating their work to heavy-duty flanging, delay, backwards-run tapes and more to set the slow, moody crawl of the track.&quot; Others, like the title track, are notable for &quot;Smith&#x27;s commanding lead guitar lines [that are] scaled to epic heights while at the same time buried in the mix, almost as if they&#x27;re trying to burst from behind the upfront rhythm assault. Roger O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s keyboards add both extra shade and melody, while Smith&#x27;s singing is intentionally delivered in a combination of cutting clarity and low resignation, at times further distorted with extra vocal treatments.&quot;

While the album mainly consists of sombre tracks, &quot;Lovesong&quot;, &quot;Pictures of You&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; were equally popular for their accessibility. Smith wanted to create a balance on the album by including songs that would act as an equilibrium with those that were unpleasant. Smith wrote &quot;Lovesong&quot; as a wedding present for Mary Poole. The lyrics had a noticeably different mood than the rest of the record, but Smith felt it was an integral component of the album: &quot;It&#x27;s an open show of emotion. It&#x27;s not trying to be clever. It&#x27;s taken me ten years to reach the point where I feel comfortable singing a very straightforward love song.&quot; The lyrics were a notable shift in his ability to reveal affection. In the past, Smith felt it necessary to disguise or mask such a statement. He noted that without &quot;Lovesong&quot;, &quot;Disintegration&quot; would have been radically different: &quot;That one song, I think, makes many people think twice. If that song wasn&#x27;t on the record, it would be very easy to dismiss the album as having a certain mood. But throwing that one in sort of upsets people a bit because they think, &#x27;That doesn&#x27;t fit&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Pictures of You&quot;, while upbeat, contained poignant lyrics (&quot;Screamed at the make-believe/Screamed at the sky/You finally found all your courage to let it all go&quot;) with a &quot;two-chord cascade of synthesizer slabs, interweaving guitar and bass lines, passionate singing and romantic lyrics.&quot; &quot;Lullaby&quot; is composed of what Apter calls &quot;sharp stabs&quot; of rhythmic guitar chords with Smith whispering the words. The premise for the song came to Smith after remembering lullabies his father would sing him when he could not sleep: &quot;[My father] would always make them up. There was always a horrible ending. They would be something like &#x27;sleep now, pretty baby or you won&#x27;t wake up at all.&#x27;&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Disintegration&quot; was released on 2 May 1989 and peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart, the highest position the band had placed on the chart at that point. In the UK, the lead single &quot;Lullaby&quot; became the Cure&#x27;s highest-charting hit in their home country when it reached number five. In the US, due to its appearance in the film &quot;Lost Angels&quot;, the band&#x27;s American label Elektra Records released &quot;Fascination Street&quot; as the first single. The international follow-up single to &quot;Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Lovesong&quot;, became the Cure&#x27;s highest-charting hit in the United States, when it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The success of &quot;Disintegration&quot; was such that the March 1990 final single &quot;Pictures of You&quot; reached number 24 on the British charts, despite the fact that the album had been released a year earlier. &quot;Disintegration&quot; was certified silver (60,000 copies shipped) in the United Kingdom, and by 1992 had sold more than three million copies worldwide.

== Critical reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, music critic Michael Azerrad gave the album three-and-a-half out of five stars and felt that, &quot;while &quot;Disintegration&quot; doesn&#x27;t break new ground for the band, it successfully refines what the Cure does best&quot;. He concluded, &quot;Despite the title, &quot;Disintegration&quot; hangs together beautifully, creating and sustaining a mood of thoroughly self-absorbed gloom. If, as Smith has hinted, the Cure itself is about to disintegrate, this is a worthy summation.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer Chris Roberts dismissed the claims that &quot;Disintegration&quot; was not a miserable record and, noting the tone of the album and its lack of melody (&quot;You&#x27;ll be lucky to find a tune on here. Or a gag&quot;), he commented that &quot;The Cure have almost invisibly stopped making pop records&quot;. Roberts summarised the album as &quot;challenging and claustrophobic, often poignant, often tedious. It&#x27;s nearly surprising.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; praised &quot;Disintegration&quot; for its tunes, &quot;from the first track &#x27;Plainsong&#x27;, a swaying, slow narrative, paralysing the listener with sex-poison, to &quot;Disintegration&quot;&#x27;s last &#x27;Untitled&#x27; Smith&#x27;s lyrical agony of indecision is remorseless&quot;. Reviewer Barbara Ellen noted the large range of emotions in Smith&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;from deep, loving pink to an ugly, violent maroon and almost back again&quot;. Although she found the two extra-tracks superfluous, Ellen hailed &quot;Disintegration&quot; as &quot;a mindblowing and stunningly complete album&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; gave the album a three-star rating out of five, mainly comparing it to Joy Division&#x27;s work. Writer Mat Snow observed: &quot;The Cure have studied well the art of the tragic bass line, the hesitant and melancholy guitar lick, the funereal keyboard coloration&quot;. He concluded: &quot;&quot;Disintegration&quot; is thus well-crafted [...], just don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s original&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a &quot;C+&quot; grade and felt that Smith attempts to appease a larger audience by broadening &quot;gothic clichés&quot; and &quot;pumping his bad faith and bad relationship into depressing moderato play-loud keyb anthems far more tedious than his endless vamps&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave &quot;Disintegration&quot; four-and-a-half out of five stars, and applauded the band by saying, &quot;The Cure&#x27;s gloomy soundscapes have rarely sounded so alluring [and] the songs – from the pulsating, ominous &#x27;Fascination Street&#x27; to the eerie, string-laced &#x27;Lullaby&#x27; – have rarely been so well-constructed and memorable.&quot; Erlewine went on to praise &quot;Disintegration&quot; for being &quot;darkly seductive&quot;, and &quot;a hypnotic, mesmerizing record&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised the record, admitting &quot;&quot;Disintegration&quot; stands unquestionably as Robert Smith&#x27;s magnum opus.&quot; Writer Chris Ott noted that &quot;scant few albums released in the 1980s can boast an opener as grand as &#x27;Plainsong&#x27;, the most breathtaking, shimmering anthem the band ever recorded.&quot;

&quot;Disintegration&quot; has been included in numerous &quot;best of&quot; lists. In 2000 it was voted number 94 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the record at number 326 on its 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the ranking in the 2012 update, and raising it to number 116 in the 2020 reboot of the list. The magazine&#x27;s German counterpart placed &quot;Disintegration&quot; at number 184 on the same list. The album was considered to be the best album of 1989 by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, 17th on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;, and 38th on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;Best Albums of the 80s&quot; and 9th in the 2018 version. The album placed at number 14 in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;New Classics: The 100 Best Albums from 1983 to 2008.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 15 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In a 2001 article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, readers selected &quot;Disintegration&quot; as number 9 in the &quot;10 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; named the album at tenth in their list &quot;The 50 Best New Wave Albums.&quot; In 2024, the magazine ranked &quot;Disintergration&quot; number 2 on its list of the greatest albums of all-time.

In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Mecha-Streisand&quot;, Kyle Broflovski called it &quot;the best album ever&quot;; the show&#x27;s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are fans of the Cure, and had got Smith to voice himself in this episode. The album plays a role in the climax of the 2015 Marvel film &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, as &quot;Plainsong&quot; plays when an iPhone&#x27;s Siri mishears the villain, Corey Stoll&#x27;s Darren Cross, saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to disintegrate you&quot;; director Peyton Reed said that &quot;It&#x27;s such an epic song that it transcended the joke&quot;, and that &quot;Disintegration&quot; was the second album he ever bought.

== The Prayer Tour and aftermath ==

Following completion of &quot;Disintegration&quot;, Smith noted that the Cure had &quot;despite my best efforts, actually become everything that I didn&#x27;t want us to become: a stadium rock band.&quot; Furthermore, Smith claimed the album&#x27;s title was the most appropriate one he could think of: &quot;Most of the relationship with the band outside of the band fell apart. Calling it &quot;Disintegration&quot; was kind of tempting fate, and fate retaliated. The family idea of the group really fell apart too after &quot;Disintegration&quot;. It was the end of a golden period.&quot;

The Prayer Tour began in Europe shortly after the release of the album. The band performed numerous high-profile concerts, including shows in front of more than 40,000 fans over two nights in Paris and their first performances in Eastern Europe. Following the European leg, the band elected to travel to North America for their upcoming US leg by boat, instead of plane. Smith and Gallup shared a fear of flight, and ultimately lamented the upcoming dates, wishing to reduce the number of concerts they booked. The record label and tour promoters strongly disagreed, and even proposed to add several new shows to the itinerary because of the success of &quot;Disintegration&quot; in the US. The first concert in the United States was at New Jersey&#x27;s Giants Stadium, where 44,000 people attended; 30,000 tickets were purchased on the first day alone. Pixies and Love and Rockets were the special guests on the biggest concerts of that tour, in addition to the support act Shelleyan Orphan which was present on all the dates. The Cure were extremely displeased with the massive turnout; according to O&#x27;Donnell: &quot;We had been at sea for five days. The stadium was too big for us to take it all in. We&#x27;ve decided that we don&#x27;t like playing stadiums that large.&quot; Smith recalls that &quot;it was never our intention to become as big as this&quot;.

The band&#x27;s show at Los Angeles&#x27;s Dodger Stadium attracted roughly 50,000 attendees, grossing over US$1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The band&#x27;s notably greater popularity in the United States—virtually every concert in the leg was sold out—caused Smith to break down, and threatened the band&#x27;s future: &quot;It&#x27;s reached a stage where I personally can&#x27;t cope with it,&quot; he said, &quot;so I&#x27;ve decided this is the last time we&#x27;re gonna tour.&quot; Backstage, there were ongoing feuds between band members owing to the strife caused by Smith. He recalled that towards the end of the tour &quot;I was tearing my hair out ... It was just a difficult tour.&quot; Cocaine use was prevalent, and it only ended up distancing Smith from his fellow band members.

Upon returning to the United Kingdom in early October, Smith wanted nothing more to do with recording, promoting and touring for an album. In 1990, &quot;Lullaby&quot; won Best Music Video of 1989 at the Brit Awards. The Cure also released a live album titled &quot;Entreat&quot; (1991), which compiled songs entirely off &quot;Disintegration&quot; from their performance at Wembley Arena, and despite claims that the Cure would never tour again, Smith accepted an invitation to headline the Glastonbury Festival. O&#x27;Donnell, after two years with the group, left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by the band&#x27;s guitar technician Perry Bamonte. Smith, who was influenced by the acid house movement that had exploded in London that summer, released a predominantly electronic remix album, &quot;Mixed Up&quot;, in 1990.

== Track listing ==
*US Elektra CD and cassette copies of &quot;Disintegration&quot; listed &quot;Last Dance&quot; and &quot;Homesick&quot; as bonus tracks, as they were not included on the original vinyl issue of the album in any country. Vinyl reissues of the album 2010-onwards were expanded to double LPs and include these tracks.

<doc id="195306" wikidata="Q17141" url="?curid=195306" title="Harvey Milk">
<text>Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American politician and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Milk was born and raised in New York. He acknowledged his homosexuality in adolescence but secretly pursued sexual relationships well into adulthood. The counterculture of the 1960s caused him to shed many of his conservative views about individual freedom and sexual expression. Milk moved to San Francisco in 1972 and opened a camera store. Although he held an assortment of jobs and frequently changed addresses, he settled in the Castro, a neighborhood that was experiencing a mass immigration of gay men and lesbians. He ran for city supervisor in 1973 but the existing gay political establishment resisted him. Milk&#x27;s campaign was compared to theater due to his personality, earning media attention and votes, although not enough to be elected. He campaigned again in the next two supervisor elections, dubbing himself the &quot;Mayor of Castro Street&quot;. The voter response caused him to also run for the California State Assembly. Due to his growing popularity, he led the gay rights movement in battles against anti-gay initiatives. Milk was elected city supervisor in 1977 after San Francisco began to choose neighborhood representatives rather than city-wide ones. During Milk&#x27;s almost eleven months in office, he sponsored a bill banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodations, housing, and employment. The Supervisors passed the bill by a vote of 11–1, and Mayor George Moscone signed it into law. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, a disgruntled former city supervisor who cast the sole vote against Milk&#x27;s bill.

Despite his short political career, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr in the LGBTQ community. In 2002, Milk was called &quot;the most famous and most significant openly LGBTQ official ever elected in the United States&quot;. Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: &quot;What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us.&quot; Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.

== Early life ==
Harvey Bernard Milk was born in the New York City suburb of Woodmere, to William Milk and Minerva Karns. He was the younger son of Litvak parents and the grandson of Morris Milk, a department store owner who helped to organize the first synagogue in the area. As a child, Milk was teased for his protruding ears, big nose, and oversized feet, and tended to grab attention as a class clown. While he was in school, he played football and developed a passion for opera. Under his name in the high school yearbook, it read, &quot;Glimpy Milk—and they say WOMEN are never at a loss for words&quot;.

Milk graduated from Bay Shore High School in Bay Shore, New York, in 1947 and attended New York State College for Teachers in Albany (now the State University of New York at Albany) from 1947 to 1951, majoring in mathematics. He also wrote for the college newspaper. One classmate remembered, &quot;He was never thought of as a possible queer—that&#x27;s what you called them then—he was a man&#x27;s man&quot;.

=== Early career ===
After graduation, Milk joined the United States Navy during the Korean War. He served aboard the submarine rescue ship as a diving officer. Milk later transferred to Naval Station, San Diego to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he resigned from the Navy at the rank of lieutenant, junior grade, forced to accept an &quot;other than honorable&quot; discharge and leave the service rather than be court-martialed because of his homosexuality.

Milk&#x27;s early career was marked by frequent changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Milk pursued Campbell passionately. Milk continued to write Campbell romantic notes and poems after they moved in together. Seeking a warmer climate with milder winters, Milk and Campbell left New York in 1957 and moved to Dallas, Texas; after they struggled to find employment and were disappointed with the city&#x27;s social scene compared to New York, they moved back to the latter. In New York, Milk worked as a public school teacher in Long Island and then a stock analyst in Manhattan. In 1961, Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years.

Milk tried to keep his early romantic life separate from his family and work. Once again bored and single in New York, he thought of moving to Miami to marry a lesbian friend to &quot;have a front and each would not be in the way of the other&quot;. However, he decided to remain in New York, where he secretly pursued gay relationships. In 1962, Milk became involved with Craig Rodwell, who was 10 years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every morning with a call and sending him notes, Milk was uncomfortable with Rodwell&#x27;s involvement with the New York Mattachine Society, a gay-rights organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, and charged with inciting a riot and with indecent exposure (the law required men&#x27;s swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail. The relationship soon ended as Milk became alarmed at Rodwell&#x27;s tendency to agitate the police.

Milk abruptly stopped working as an insurance actuary and became a researcher at the Wall Street firm Bache &amp; Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk&#x27;s heart was not in his work. Before Milk&#x27;s thirty-fourth birthday, he started a romantic relationship with a 17-year-old boy (b. October 18, 1946) named Jack Galen McKinley after he left his hometown on October 22, 1963. Milk had recruited McKinley to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign. McKinley was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk&#x27;s ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell&#x27;s despondency caused to him consider committing suicide.

=== Castro Street ===
Since the end of World War II, the major port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men who had been expelled from the military and decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the Kinsey Institute believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for Tom O&#x27;Horgan, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of &quot;Hair&quot;. McKinley was offered a job in the New York City production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.

Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, without a steady job or plan. In New York City he became involved with O&#x27;Horgan&#x27;s theater company as a &quot;general aide&quot;, signing on as associate producer for &quot;Lenny&quot; and for Eve Merriam&#x27;s &quot;Inner City&quot;. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk&#x27;s conservatism. A contemporary &quot;New York Times&quot; story about O&#x27;Horgan described Milk as &quot;a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads&quot;. Craig Rodwell read the description of the formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk&#x27;s Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk&#x27;s attitude: &quot;I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life.&quot; Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s documentary short film &quot;Homosexuals in New York&quot; shows Milk exuberant as a protester on Christopher Street Day 1971 in New York City. Milk met Scott Smith, 18 years his junior, and began another relationship. Milk and Smith returned to San Francisco, where they lived on money they had saved. In March 1973, after a roll of film Milk left at a local shop was ruined, he and Smith opened a camera store on Castro Street with their last $1,000.

=== Changing politics ===
In the late 1960s, the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) and the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) began to work against police persecution of gay bars and entrapment in San Francisco. Oral sex was still a felony, and in 1970, nearly 90 people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800 gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a sex offender.

Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, and other California politicians recognized the growing clout and organization of homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings of gay and lesbian organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto&#x27;s win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.

SIR had become powerful enough for political maneuvering. In 1971 SIR members Jim Foster, Rick Stokes, and &quot;Advocate&quot; publisher David B. Goodstein formed the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club, known as simply &quot;Alice&quot;. Alice befriended liberal politicians to persuade them to sponsor bills, proving successful in 1972 when Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon obtained Feinstein&#x27;s support for an ordinance outlawing employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000 votes, he was quiet and unassuming, and did not win. Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the 1972 Democratic National Convention ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard when they wanted the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.

Milk became more interested in political and civic matters when he was faced with civic problems and policies he disliked. One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk&#x27;s shop Castro Camera and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends also remember around the same time having to restrain him from kicking the television while Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave consistent &quot;I don&#x27;t recall&quot; replies during the Watergate hearings. Milk decided that the time had come to run for city supervisor. He said later, &quot;I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up&quot;.

== Campaigns ==
Milk received an icy reception from the gay political establishment in San Francisco. Jim Foster, who had by then been active in gay politics for ten years, resented that the newcomer had asked for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, &quot;There&#x27;s an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don&#x27;t get to dance unless you put up the chairs. I&#x27;ve never seen you put up the chairs.&quot; Milk was furious that Foster had snubbed him for the position, and the conversation marked the beginning of an antagonistic relationship between the &quot;Alice&quot; Club and Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.

Milk had drifted through life up to this point, but he found his vocation, according to journalist Frances FitzGerald, who called him a &quot;born politician&quot;. At first, his inexperience showed. He tried to do without money, support, or staff, and instead relied on his message of sound financial management, promoting individuals over large corporations and government. He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a citywide ballot to district ballots, which was intended to reduce the influence of money and give neighborhoods more control over their representatives in city government. He also ran on a culturally liberal platform, opposing government interference in private sexual matters and favoring the legalization of marijuana. Milk&#x27;s fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him a significant amount of press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900 votes—sweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods and coming in 10th place out of 32 candidates. Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.

=== Mayor of Castro Street ===

From early in his political career, Milk displayed an affinity for building coalitions. The Teamsters wanted to strike against beer distributors—Coors in particular—who refused to sign the union contract. An organizer asked Milk for assistance with gay bars; in return, Milk asked the union to hire more gay drivers. A few days later, Milk canvassed the gay bars in and surrounding the Castro District, urging them to refuse to sell the beer. With the help of a coalition of Arab and Chinese grocers the Teamsters had also recruited, the boycott was successful. Milk found a strong political ally in organized labor, and it was around this time that he began to style himself &quot;The Mayor of Castro Street&quot;. As Castro Street&#x27;s presence grew, so did Milk&#x27;s reputation. Tom O&#x27;Horgan remarked, &quot;Harvey spent most of his life looking for a stage. On Castro Street he finally found it.&quot;

Tensions were growing between the older citizens of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays who were entering the Castro District. In 1973, two gay men tried to open an antique shop, but the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted to prevent them from receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.

=== Serious candidate ===
Although he was a newcomer to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting to be taken seriously as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk&#x27;s campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. His store, Castro Camera, became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.

Milk favored support for small businesses and the growth of neighborhoods. Since 1968, Mayor Joseph Alioto had been luring large corporations to the city despite what critics labeled &quot;the Manhattanization of San Francisco&quot;. As blue-collar jobs were replaced by the service industry, Alioto&#x27;s weakened political base allowed for new leadership to be voted into office in the city. In 1975, state senator George Moscone was elected mayor. Moscone had been instrumental in repealing the sodomy law earlier that year in the California State Legislature. He acknowledged Milk&#x27;s influence in his election by visiting Milk&#x27;s election night headquarters, thanking Milk personally, and offering him a position as a city commissioner. Milk came in seventh place in the election, only one position away from earning a supervisor seat.

Despite the new leadership in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. In one of Moscone&#x27;s first acts as mayor, he appointed a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against the wishes of the SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.

=== Outing of Oliver Sipple ===
Milk&#x27;s role as a representative of San Francisco&#x27;s gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President Gerald Ford, while visiting San Francisco, walked from his hotel to his car. In the crowd, Sara Jane Moore raised a gun to shoot him. A former Marine who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement. The bystander was Oliver &quot;Bill&quot; Sipple, who had left Milk&#x27;s ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting Campbell&#x27;s suicide attempt. The incident drew great attention to Sipple. On psychiatric disability leave from the military, Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that the public perception of gay people would be improved if they came out of the closet. He told a friend: &quot;It&#x27;s too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms.&quot; Milk contacted a newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes2/13/89&quot;&gt;Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). &quot;Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days later, Herb Caen, a columnist at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, outed Sipple as gay and exposed him as a friend of Milk&#x27;s. The announcement was picked up by national newspapers, and Milk&#x27;s name was included in many of the stories. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Milk as a leader in San Francisco&#x27;s gay community. Sipple was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the &quot;Chronicle&quot; for invasion of privacy. President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk claimed that Sipple&#x27;s sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.

=== Race for State Assembly ===
Keeping his promise to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone appointed him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk considered seeking a position in the California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk&#x27;s sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.

Milk spent five weeks on the Board of Permit Appeals before Moscone was forced to fire him when he announced he would run for the California State Assembly. Rick Stokes replaced him. Milk&#x27;s firing, and the backroom deal made between Moscone, the assembly speaker, and Agnos, fueled his campaign as he took on the identity of a political underdog. He railed that high officers in the city and state governments were against him. He complained that the prevailing gay political establishment, particularly the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club, were shutting him out; he referred to Jim Foster and Stokes as gay &quot;Uncle Toms&quot;. He enthusiastically embraced a local independent weekly magazine&#x27;s headline: &quot;Harvey Milk vs. The Machine&quot;. The Alice B. Toklas Club made no endorsement in the primary—neither Milk nor Agnos—while other gay-aligned clubs and groups endorsed Agnos or did dual endorsements.

Milk&#x27;s continuing campaign, run from the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk&#x27;s notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager&#x27;s assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned with the man who was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.

If the candidate was manic, he was also dedicated and filled with good humor, and he had a particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding &quot;Milk for Assembly&quot; signs while commuters drove into the heart of the city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple. Milk accepted Temple volunteers to work his phones. On February 19, 1978, Milk wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending cult leader Jim Jones as &quot;a man of the highest character&quot; when asked. Milk&#x27;s relationship with the Temple was similar to other politicians&#x27; in Northern California. According to &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, Jones and his parishioners were a &quot;potent political force&quot;, helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, &quot;Well fuck him. I&#x27;ll take his workers, but, that&#x27;s the game Jim Jones plays.&quot; But to his volunteers, he said: &quot;Make sure you&#x27;re always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it.&quot;

The race was close, and Milk lost by fewer than 4,000 votes. Agnos taught Milk a valuable lesson when he criticized Milk&#x27;s campaign speeches as &quot;a downer ... You talk about how you&#x27;re gonna throw the bums out, but how are you gonna fix things—other than beat me? You shouldn&#x27;t leave your audience on a down.&quot; In the wake of his loss, Milk, realizing that the Toklas Club would never support him politically, co-founded the San Francisco Gay Democratic Club.

== Broader historical forces ==
The fledgling gay rights movement had yet to meet organized opposition in the US. In 1977 a few well-connected gay activists in Miami, Florida, were able to pass a civil rights ordinance that made discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal in Dade County. A well-organized group of conservative fundamentalist Christians responded, headed by singer Anita Bryant. Their campaign was titled Save Our Children, and Bryant claimed the ordinance infringed her right to teach her children Biblical morality. Bryant and the campaign gathered 64,000 signatures to put the issue to a county-wide vote. With funds raised in part by the Florida Citrus Commission, for which Bryant was the spokeswoman, they ran television advertisements that contrasted the Orange Bowl Parade with San Francisco&#x27;s Gay Freedom Day Parade, stating that Dade County would be turned into a &quot;hotbed of homosexuality&quot; where &quot;men ... cavort with little boys&quot;.

Jim Foster, then the most powerful political organizer in San Francisco, went to Miami to assist gay activists there as election day neared, and a nationwide boycott of orange juice was organized. The message of the Save Our Children campaign was influential, and the result was an overwhelming defeat for gay activists; in the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County, 70% voted to repeal the law.

=== &quot;Just politics&quot; ===
Christian conservatives were inspired by their victory, and saw an opportunity for a new, effective political cause. Gay activists were shocked to see how little support they received. An impromptu demonstration of over 3,000 Castro residents formed the night of the Dade County ordinance vote. Gay men and lesbians were simultaneously angry, chanting &quot;Out of the bars and into the streets!&quot;, and elated at their passionate and powerful response. &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; reported that members of the crowd pulled others out of bars along Castro and Polk Streets to &quot;deafening&quot; cheers. Milk led marchers that night on a five-mile (8 km) course through the city, constantly moving, aware that if they stopped for too long there would be a riot. He declared, &quot;This is the power of the gay community. Anita&#x27;s going to create a national gay force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfexam6/8/78&quot;&gt;Sharpe, Ivan (June 8, 1977). &quot;Angry Gays March Through S.F.&quot;, &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Activists had little time to recover, however, as the scenario replayed itself when civil rights ordinances were overturned by voters in Saint Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon, throughout 1977 and into 1978.

California State Senator John Briggs saw an opportunity in the Christian fundamentalists&#x27; campaign. He was hoping to be elected governor of California in 1978, and was impressed with the voter turnout he saw in Miami. When Briggs returned to Sacramento, he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had nothing against gays, telling gay journalist Randy Shilts, &quot;It&#x27;s politics. Just politics.&quot; Random attacks on gays rose in the Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted &quot;Faggot!&quot; Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough&#x27;s mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs. One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at San Francisco City Hall where he called the city a &quot;sexual garbage heap&quot; because of homosexuals. Weeks later, 250,000 people attended the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the largest attendance at any Gay Pride event to that point.

In November 1976, voters in San Francisco decided to reorganize supervisor elections to choose supervisors from neighborhoods instead of voting for them in citywide ballots. Harvey Milk quickly qualified as the leading candidate in District 5, surrounding Castro Street.

=== Last campaign ===
Anita Bryant&#x27;s public campaign opposing homosexuality and the multiple challenges to gay rights ordinances across the United States fueled gay politics in San Francisco. Seventeen candidates from the Castro District entered the next race for supervisor; more than half of them were gay. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an exposé on the veritable invasion of gay people into San Francisco, estimating that the city&#x27;s gay population was between 100,000 and 200,000 out of a total 750,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold11/6/77&quot;&gt;Gold, Herbert (November 6, 1977), &quot;A Walk on San Francisco&#x27;s Gay Side&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, p. SM17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Castro Village Association had grown to 90 businesses; the local bank, formerly the smallest branch in the city, had become the largest and was forced to build a wing to accommodate its new customers. Milk biographer Randy Shilts noted that his campaign was fueled by &quot;broader historical forces&quot;.

Milk&#x27;s most successful opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who was backed by the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes was open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure electroshock therapy to &#x27;cure&#x27; him. Milk, however, was more expressive about the role of gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, &quot;I&#x27;m just a businessman who happens to be gay,&quot; and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk&#x27;s contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;We don&#x27;t want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays ... I represent the gay street people—the 14-year-old runaway from San Antonio. We have to make up for hundreds of years of persecution. We have to give hope to that poor runaway kid from San Antonio. They go to the bars because churches are hostile. They need hope! They need a piece of the pie!&quot;

Other causes were also important to Milk: he promoted larger and less expensive child care facilities, free public transportation, and the development of a board of civilians to oversee the police. He advanced important neighborhood issues at every opportunity. Milk used the same manic campaign tactics as in previous races: human billboards, hours of handshaking, and dozens of speeches calling on gay people to have hope. This time, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; endorsed him for supervisor. On election day, November 8, 1977, he won by 30% against sixteen other candidates, and after his victory became apparent, he arrived on Castro Street on the back of his campaign manager&#x27;s motorcycle—escorted by Sheriff Richard Hongisto—to what a newspaper story described as a &quot;tumultuous and moving welcome&quot;.

Milk had recently taken a new lover, a young man named Jack Lira, who was frequently drunk in public, and just as often escorted out of political events by Milk&#x27;s aides. Since the race for the California State Assembly, Milk was receiving increasingly violent death threats. Concerned that his raised profile marked him as a target for assassination, he recorded on tape his thoughts, and whom he wanted to succeed him if he were killed, adding: &quot;If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door&quot;.

== Supervisor ==
Milk&#x27;s swearing-in made national headlines, as he became the first non-incumbent openly gay man in the United States to win an election for public office.&lt;ref name=&quot;cone1/8/1978&quot;&gt;Cone, Russ (January 8, 1978). &quot;Feinstein Board President&quot;, &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He likened himself to pioneering African American baseball player Jackie Robinson and walked to City Hall arm in arm with Jack Lira, stating &quot;You can stand around and throw bricks at Silly Hall or you can take it over. Well, here we are.&quot; The Castro District was not the only neighborhood to promote someone new to city politics. Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (Carol Ruth Silver), a Chinese American (Gordon Lau), and an African American woman (Ella Hill Hutch)—all firsts for the city. Dan White, a former police officer and firefighter, was also a first-time supervisor, and he spoke of how proud he was that his grandmother was able to see him sworn in.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1/12/78&quot;&gt;Ledbetter, Les (January 12, 1978). &quot;San Francisco Legislators Meet in Diversity&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vol. 127, no. 43818. p. A14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Milk&#x27;s energy, affinity for pranking, and unpredictability at times exasperated Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein. In his first meeting with Mayor Moscone, Milk called himself the &quot;number one queen&quot; and dictated to Moscone that he would have to go through Milk instead of the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club if he wanted the city&#x27;s gay votes—a quarter of San Francisco&#x27;s voting population. Milk also became Moscone&#x27;s closest ally on the Board of Supervisors. The biggest targets of Milk&#x27;s ire were large corporations and real estate developers. He fumed when a parking garage was slated to take the place of homes near the downtown area, and tried to pass a commuter tax so office workers who lived outside the city and drove into work would have to pay for city services they used. Milk was often willing to vote against Feinstein and other more tenured members of the board. In one controversy early in his term, Milk agreed with fellow Supervisor Dan White, whose district was located two miles south of the Castro, that a mental health facility for troubled adolescents should not be placed there. After Milk learned more about the facility, he decided to switch his vote, ensuring White&#x27;s loss on the issue—a particularly poignant cause that White championed while campaigning. White did not forget it. He opposed every initiative and issue Milk supported.

Milk began his tenure by sponsoring a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ordinance was called the &quot;most stringent and encompassing in the nation&quot;, and its passing demonstrated &quot;the growing political power of homosexuals&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Only Supervisor White voted against it; Mayor Moscone enthusiastically signed it into law with a light blue pen that Milk had given him for the occasion.

Another bill Milk concentrated on was designed to solve the number one problem according to a recent citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets&#x27; feces. Dubbed the &quot;pooper scooper law&quot;, its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk&#x27;s campaign manager, called him &quot;a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper&quot;. He invited the press to Duboce Park to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras. It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.

Milk had grown tired of Lira&#x27;s drinking and considered breaking up with him when Lira called a few weeks later and demanded Milk come home. When Milk arrived, he found Lira had hanged himself. Already prone to severe depression, Lira had attempted suicide previously. One of the notes he left for Milk indicated he was upset about the Anita Bryant and John Briggs campaigns.

=== Briggs Initiative ===
John Briggs was forced to drop out of the 1978 race for California governor, but received enthusiastic support for Proposition 6, dubbed the Briggs Initiative. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers—and any public school employees who supported gay rights—mandatory. Briggs&#x27; messages supporting Proposition 6 were pervasive throughout California, and Harvey Milk attended every event Briggs hosted. Milk campaigned against the bill throughout the state as well, and swore that if Briggs won California, he would still not win San Francisco. In their numerous debates, which toward the end had been honed to quick back-and-forth banter, Briggs maintained that homosexual teachers wanted to abuse and recruit children. Milk responded with statistics compiled by law enforcement that provided evidence that pedophiles identified primarily as heterosexual, and dismissed Briggs&#x27; assertions with one-liner jokes: &quot;If it were true that children mimicked their teachers, you&#x27;d sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around.&quot;

Attendance at Gay Pride marches during the summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An estimated 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco&#x27;s Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying &quot;I&#x27;m from Woodmere, N.Y.&quot; He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the &quot;Hope Speech&quot;, that &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; said &quot;ignited the crowd&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs6/27/78&quot;&gt;Jacobs, John (June 26, 1978). &quot;An Ecumenical Alliance on the Serious Side of &#x27;Gay&#x27; &quot;, &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country ... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets ... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I&#x27;m going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.

Despite the losses in battles for gay rights across the country that year, he remained optimistic, saying &quot;Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality to a greater extent than ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit down and talk about it.&quot;

Citing the potential infringements on individual rights, former governor of California Ronald Reagan voiced his opposition to the proposition, as did Governor Jerry Brown and President Jimmy Carter, the latter in an afterthought following a speech he gave in Sacramento. On November 7, 1978, the proposition lost by more than a million votes, astounding gay activists on election night. In San Francisco, 75 percent voted against it.

== Assassination ==
On November 10, 1978 (10 months after he was sworn in), Dan White resigned his position on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 () was not enough to support his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;exam11/11/78&quot;&gt;&quot;Mayor Hunts a Successor for White&quot;, &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, (November 11, 1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt11/29/78&quot;&gt;Ledbetter, Les (November 29, 1978). &quot;2 Deaths Mourned by San Franciscans&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vol. 128, no. 44051. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White&#x27;s district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.&lt;ref name=&quot;time12/11/78&quot;&gt;&quot;Another Day of Death&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, December 11, 1978. Retrieved on September 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18 and 19, news broke of the mass suicide of 900 members of the Peoples Temple. The cult had relocated from San Francisco to Guyana. California Representative Leo Ryan was in Jonestown to check on the remote community, and he was killed by gunfire at an airstrip as he tried to escape the tense situation. White remarked to two aides who were working for his reinstatement, &quot;You see that? One day I&#x27;m on the front page and the next I&#x27;m swept right off.&quot;

Moscone planned to announce White&#x27;s replacement on November 27, 1978. A half hour before the press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window and went to Moscone&#x27;s office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt11/28/78&quot;&gt;Turner, Wallace (November 28, 1978). &quot;Suspect Sought Job&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vol. 128, no. 44050. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk face down on the floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, &quot;Today, San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty to inform you that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White.&quot; Milk was 48 years old. Moscone was 49.

Within an hour, White called his wife from a nearby diner; she met him at a church and was with him when he turned himself in. Many people left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a spontaneous candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; a small one at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.

=== &quot;City in agony&quot; ===
In the wake of the Jonestown suicides, Moscone had recently increased security at City Hall. Cult survivors recounted drills for suicide preparations that Jones had called &quot;White Nights&quot;. Rumors about the murders of Moscone and Milk were fueled by the coincidence of Dan White&#x27;s name and Jones&#x27;s suicide preparations. A stunned District Attorney called the assassinations so close to the news about Jonestown &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, but denied any connection. Governor Jerry Brown ordered all flags in California to be flown at half staff, and called Milk a &quot;hard-working and dedicated supervisor, a leader of San Francisco&#x27;s gay community, who kept his promise to represent all his constituents&quot;. President Jimmy Carter expressed his shock at both murders and sent his condolences. Speaker of the California Assembly Leo T. McCarthy called it &quot;an insane tragedy&quot;. &quot;A City in Agony&quot; topped the headlines in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; the day after the murders; inside the paper stories of the assassinations under the headline &quot;Black Monday&quot; were printed back to back with updates of bodies being shipped home from Guyana. An editorial describing &quot;A city with more sadness and despair in its heart than any city should have to bear&quot; went on to ask how such tragedies could occur, particularly to &quot;men of such warmth and vision and great energies&quot;. Dan White was charged with two counts of murder and held without bail, eligible for the death penalty owing to the recent passage of a statewide proposition that allowed death or life in prison for the murder of a public official. One analysis of the months surrounding the murders called 1978 and 1979: &quot;the most emotionally devastating years in San Francisco&#x27;s fabulously spotted history&quot;.

The 32-year-old White, who had been in the Army during the Vietnam War, had run on a tough anti-crime platform in his district. Colleagues declared him a high-achieving &quot;all-American boy&quot;. He was to have received an award the next week for rescuing a woman and child from a 17-story burning building when he was a firefighter in 1977. Though he was the only supervisor to vote against Milk&#x27;s gay rights ordinance earlier that year, he had been quoted as saying, &quot;I respect the rights of all people, including gays&quot;. Milk and White at first got along well. One of White&#x27;s political aides (who was gay) remembered, &quot;Dan had more in common with Harvey than he did with anyone else on the board&quot;. White had voted to support a center for gay seniors, and to honor Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin&#x27;s 25th anniversary and pioneering work.

After Milk&#x27;s vote for the mental health facility in White&#x27;s district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and communicated with only one of Milk&#x27;s aides. Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. &quot;He was impulsive ... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively so ... I think he could not take defeat,&quot; San Francisco&#x27;s assistant fire chief told reporters. White&#x27;s first campaign manager quit in the middle of the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an egotist and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press. White&#x27;s associates and supporters described him &quot;as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge&quot;. The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, &quot;Talking to him, I realized that he saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all that was wrong with the world&quot;.

When Milk&#x27;s friends looked in his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been affected by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart and all of his socks had holes. His remains were cremated and his ashes were split. His closest friends scattered most of the ashes in San Francisco Bay. Other ashes were encapsulated and buried beneath the sidewalk in front of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk at the Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city&#x27;s acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.

=== Trial and conviction ===
Dan White&#x27;s arrest and trial caused a sensation and illustrated severe tensions between the liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration as well as the liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore &quot;Free Dan White&quot; T-shirts in the days after the murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: &quot;The more I observed what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement.&quot; White showed no remorse for his actions, and exhibited vulnerability only during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.

The jury for White&#x27;s trial consisted of white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused from the jury pool. Some of the members of the jury cried when they heard White&#x27;s tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty. White&#x27;s defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that his client was not responsible for his actions; Schmidt used the legal defense known as diminished capacity: &quot;Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don&#x27;t kill people in cold blood.&quot; Schmidt tried to prove that White&#x27;s anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White&#x27;s mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the Twinkie defense. White was acquitted of the first-degree murder charge on May 21, 1979, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five. He cried when he heard the verdict.

=== White Night riots ===

Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk&#x27;s successor Harry Britt condemned the jury&#x27;s decision. When the verdict was announced over the police radio, someone sang &quot;Danny Boy&quot; on the police band. A surge of people from the Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting &quot;Avenge Harvey Milk&quot; and &quot;He got away with murder&quot;. Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk&#x27;s friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter&#x27;s question about why they were destroying parts of the city: &quot;Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That&#x27;s why this is happening.&quot; The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The White Night riots, as they became known, lasted several hours.

Later that evening, several police cruisers filled with officers wearing riot gear arrived at the Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk&#x27;s protégé Cleve Jones and a reporter for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking along the street.

After the verdict, District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced a furious gay community to explain what had gone wrong. The prosecutor admitted to feeling sorry for White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who had recorded White&#x27;s confession (and who was a childhood friend of White&#x27;s and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, he did not want to embarrass the detective in front of his family in court. Nor did Freitas question White&#x27;s frame of mind or lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified on the last day of the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship. Freitas blamed the jury who he claimed had been &quot;taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [the] trial&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===
The murders of Milk and Moscone and White&#x27;s trial changed city politics and the California legal system. In 1980, San Francisco ended district supervisor elections, fearing that a Board of Supervisors so divisive would be harmful to the city and that they had been a factor in the assassinations. A grassroots neighborhood effort to restore district elections in the mid-1990s proved successful, and the city returned to neighborhood representatives in 2000. As a result of Dan White&#x27;s trial, California voters changed the law to reduce the likelihood of acquittals of accused who knew what they were doing but claimed their capacity was impaired. Diminished capacity was abolished as a defense to a charge, but courts allowed evidence of it when deciding whether to incarcerate, commit, or otherwise punish a convicted defendant. The &quot;Twinkie defense&quot; has entered American mythology, popularly described as a case where a murderer escapes justice because he binged on junk food, simplifying White&#x27;s lack of political savvy, his relationships with George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and what &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen described as his &quot;dislike of homosexuals&quot;.

Dan White served just over five years for the double homicide of Moscone and Milk; he was released from prison on January 7, 1984. On October 21, 1985, White was found dead in a running car in his wife&#x27;s garage, having committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. He was 39 years old. His defense attorney told reporters that he had been despondent over the loss of his family and the situation he had caused, adding, &quot;This was a sick man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt10/22/85&quot;&gt;Lindsey, Robert (October 22, 1985). &quot;Dan White, Killer of San Francisco Mayor, a suicide&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vol. 135, no. 46570. p. A18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Milk&#x27;s political career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, and the importance of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk&#x27;s public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide the fact that he was gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.

Milk strongly believed that neighborhoods promoted unity and a small-town experience, and that the Castro should provide services to all its residents. He opposed the closing of an elementary school; while most gay people in the Castro did not have children, Milk saw his neighborhood having the potential to welcome everyone. He told his aides to concentrate on fixing potholes and boasted that 50 new stop signs had been installed in District 5. Responding to city residents&#x27; largest complaint about living in San Francisco—dog feces—Milk made it a priority to enact the ordinance requiring dog owners to take care of their pets&#x27; droppings. Randy Shilts noted, &quot;some would claim Harvey was a socialist or various other sorts of ideologues, but, in reality, Harvey&#x27;s political philosophy was never more complicated than the issue of dogshit; government should solve people&#x27;s basic problems.&quot;
Karen Foss, a communications professor at the University of New Mexico, attributes Milk&#x27;s impact on San Francisco politics to the fact that he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, &quot;Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose ... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies.&quot; Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the &quot;Hope Speech&quot;, which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: &quot;My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you.&quot; A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective:

And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us&#x27;es, the us&#x27;es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.

In the last year of his life, Milk emphasized that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so:

I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they&#x27;ll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects ... I hope that every professional gay will say &#x27;enough&#x27;, come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.

However, Milk&#x27;s assassination has become entwined with his political efficacy, partly because he was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, &quot;No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death.&quot; His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk&#x27;s success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White&#x27;s verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk&#x27;s life was &quot;a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America&quot;. According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk&#x27;s legend has been unable to be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: &quot;The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him a great deal of the Castro&#x27;s optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one.&quot; On the 20th anniversary of Milk&#x27;s death, historian John D&#x27;Emilio said, &quot;The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one&#x27;s life at all times with integrity.&quot; For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: &quot;His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process.&quot;

=== Tributes and media ===

The City of San Francisco has paid tribute to Milk by naming several locations after him. Where Market and Castro streets intersect in San Francisco flies an enormous Gay Pride flag, situated in Harvey Milk Plaza. The San Francisco Gay Democratic Club changed its name to the Harvey Milk Memorial Gay Democratic Club in 1978 (it is currently named the Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club) and boasts that it is the largest Democratic organization in San Francisco.

In April 2018, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and mayor Mark Farrell approved and signed legislation renaming Terminal 1 at San Francisco International Airport after Milk, and planned to install artwork memorializing him. This followed a previous attempt to rename the entire airport after him, which was turned down. Officially opening on July 23, 2019, Harvey Milk Terminal 1 is the world&#x27;s first airport terminal named after a leader of the LGBTQ community.

In New York City, Harvey Milk High School is a school program for at-risk youth that concentrates on the needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students and operates out of the Hetrick-Martin Institute.

In July 2016, US Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus advised Congress that he intended to name the second ship of the Military Sealift Command&#x27;s John Lewis-class oilers USNS &quot;Harvey Milk&quot;. All ships of the class are to be named after civil rights leaders. In November 2021, the ship was launched.

In response to a grassroots effort, in June 2018 the city council of Portland, Oregon, voted to rename a thirteen-block southwestern section of Stark Street to Harvey Milk Street. The mayor, Ted Wheeler, declared that it &quot;sends a signal that we are an open and a welcoming and an inclusive community&quot;.

In 1982, freelance reporter Randy Shilts completed his first book: a biography of Milk, titled &quot;The Mayor of Castro Street&quot;. Shilts wrote the book while unable to find a steady job as an openly gay reporter. &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk&quot;, a documentary film based on the book&#x27;s material, won the 1984 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. Director Rob Epstein spoke later about why he chose the subject of Milk&#x27;s life: &quot;At the time, for those of us who lived in San Francisco, it felt like it was life changing, that all the eyes of the world were upon us, but in fact most of the world outside of San Francisco had no idea. It was just a really brief, provincial, localized current events story that the mayor and a city council member in San Francisco were killed. It didn&#x27;t have much reverberation.&quot; Milk was also the subject of Helene Meyers work, &quot;Got Jewish Milk: Screening Epstein and Van Sant for Intersectional Film History&quot;, which explored the contemporary depiction of Milk and his &quot;Jewishness&quot;.

Milk&#x27;s life has been the subject of a musical theater production; an eponymous opera; a cantata; a children&#x27;s picture book; a French-language historical novel for young-adult readers; and the biopic &quot;Milk&quot;, released in 2008 after 15 years in the making. The film was directed by Gus Van Sant and starred Sean Penn as Milk and Josh Brolin as Dan White, and won two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. It took eight weeks to film, and often used extras who had been present at the actual events for large crowd scenes, including a scene depicting Milk&#x27;s &quot;Hope Speech&quot; at the 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade.

Milk was included in the &quot;&quot;Time&quot; 100 Heroes and Icons of the 20th Century&quot; as &quot;a symbol of what gays can accomplish and the dangers they face in doing so&quot;. Despite his antics and publicity stunts, according to writer John Cloud, &quot;none understood how his public role could affect private lives better than Milk ... [he] knew that the root cause of the gay predicament was invisibility&quot;. &quot;The Advocate&quot; listed Milk third in their &quot;40 Heroes&quot; of the 20th century issue, quoting Dianne Feinstein: &quot;His homosexuality gave him an insight into the scars which all oppressed people wear. He believed that no sacrifice was too great a price to pay for the cause of human rights.&quot;

In August 2009, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Milk the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to the gay rights movement stating &quot;he fought discrimination with visionary courage and conviction&quot;. Milk&#x27;s nephew Stuart accepted for his uncle. Shortly after, Stuart co-founded the Harvey Milk Foundation with Anne Kronenberg with the support of Desmond Tutu, co-recipient of 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom and was a member of the Foundation&#x27;s advisory board. Later in the year, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger designated May 22 as Harvey Milk Day and inducted Milk in the California Hall of Fame.
Since 2003, the story of Harvey Milk has been featured in three exhibitions created by the GLBT Historical Society, a San Francisco–based museum, archives, and research center, to which the estate of Scott Smith donated Milk&#x27;s personal belongings that were preserved after his death. On May 22, 2014, the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp honoring Harvey Milk, the first openly LGBTQ political official to receive this honor. The stamp features a photo taken in front of Milk&#x27;s Castro Camera store and was unveiled on what would have been his 84th birthday.

Harry Britt summarized Milk&#x27;s impact the evening Milk was shot in 1978: &quot;No matter what the world has taught us about ourselves, we can be beautiful and we can get our thing together ... Harvey was a prophet ... he lived by a vision ... Something very special is going to happen in this city and it will have Harvey Milk&#x27;s name on it.&quot;

In 2010, radio producer JD Doyle aired the two-hour Harvey Milk Music on his Queer Music Heritage radio program. The mission of the broadcast was to gather music about and inspired by the Harvey Milk story. That broadcast and playlist of songs is archived online.

Milk was inducted in 2012 into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago which celebrates LGBTQ history and people. He was named one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. Paris named a square Place Harvey-Milk in Le Marais in 2019.

The USNS &quot;Harvey Milk&quot;, a United States Navy oiler launched on November 6, 2021, bears his name: it is the first U.S. Navy ship named for an openly gay leader. In July 2016, United States Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus advised Congress that he intended to name the Military Sealift Command&#x27;s John Lewis-class oilers after prominent civil rights leaders, with the second to be named for gay rights activist Harvey Milk. Milk served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War aboard the submarine rescue ship and held the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) at the time that he was forced to accept an &quot;other than honorable&quot; discharge rather than face a court martial for his homosexuality. The ship was officially named at a ceremony in San Francisco on August 16, 2016, generating some controversy considering Milk&#x27;s antiwar stance later in his life. It is the first U.S. Navy ship named for an openly gay leader. The first cut of steel occurred on December 13, 2019, marking the beginning of construction of the vessel.

<text>Something to Write Home About is the second studio album by American rock band the Get Up Kids, released on September 28, 1999, through Vagrant Records and the band&#x27;s own label Heroes &amp; Villains Records. Following the promotional tours for their debut album &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; (1997), the band were in discussion with Mojo Records. During this period, James Dewees joined as the band&#x27;s keyboardist. As negotiations with the label eventually stalled, they eventually went with Vagrant Records. They recorded their next album at Mad Hatter Studios in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, co-producing it with Chad Blinman and Alex Brahl. Described as an emo album, &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; expands on the harder edge of its predecessor, with frontman Matt Pryor citing the works of the Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World and Wilco as influences.

&quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics, with many praising the songwriting. The album was a commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies, and peaking at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart in the United States. The band promoted it with a European tour and a US tour with At the Drive-In until the end of 1999. &quot;Action &amp; Action&quot; was released as the lead single from the album. Later that year, the band toured across Australia, Japan, Europe, ending with a headlining US tour; in early 2001 they supported Green Day and Weezer.

The success of &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; made Vagrant Records one of the major players in the fledgling emo scene, attracting bands like Dashboard Confessional, Saves the Day, and Alkaline Trio to sign with the label. It is often cited as one of the best albums of the second-wave movement of emo, and is cited as an influence on third wave acts like Coheed &amp; Cambria. Publications such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, among others, have included the album on best-of lists for the emo and pop-punk genres. It was re-released as a CD and DVD set in 2008, and has been re-pressed on vinyl in 2015 and 2016; the 2015 version charted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Vinyl Albums chart.

==Background and writing==
With the release of the &quot;Woodson&quot; EP in 1997, the Get Up Kids signed a two-album recording contract with independent label Doghouse Records. In June 1997, the group went on a tour of the United States, on which they became friends with Coalesce. Shortly afterwards, their drummer, James Dewees, moved in with the bassist Rob Pope and his brother, drummer Ryan Pope. When the Get Up Kids went on tour, Dewees would look after the apartment. The group released their debut album, &quot;Four Minute Mile,&quot; in September 1997. It was supported by American and European tours between September 1997 and May 1998. The group then went on a break and spent the next few months writing material for their next record. Their next album, &quot;Four Minute Mile,&quot; sold over 40,000 copies, which attracted attention from various labels.

The band, who wanted to leave Doghouse, began discussions with other labels, such as Geffen, Vagrant and Mojo Records. Starting from December 1998, the group wrote a batch of new material as they were waiting for their deal with Mojo Records to be finalized. The Pope brothers&#x27; apartment had a piano that Dewees would often play; while the group were practising a song at the apartment, Dewees showed them a vocal harmony and piano part he had come up with. The group had wanted a keyboardist for sometime; with Coalesce having gone on hiatus during this period, Dewees joined as their keyboard player.

==New label and recording==
By April 1999, tired that the negotiations with Mojo Records had taken too long and eventually came to a halt, the band felt it wasn&#x27;t the right time to be signing with a major. Vocalist/guitarist Matthew Pryor later revealed that the label&#x27;s founder Jay Rifkin wanted to treat the band as a new act, own the rights to their music publishing, in addition to being unwilling to buy the band out of their contract with Doghouse. To get out of their Doghouse contract, the band recorded the &quot;Red Letter Day&quot; EP and forfeited the vinyl rights to their following album. That same month, they formed their own record label, Heroes &amp; Villains Records, which signed a deal with Vagrant Records, giving the latter rights to other acts signed to Heroes &amp; Villains, which included the members&#x27; solo projects. At the time, Vagrant was searching for a flagship band on which they could expand their business with.

In June 1999, the band travelled from Kansas City, Missouri to Los Angeles, California to record their next album. Before the group could start, Vagrant Records&#x27; co-owner Jon Cohen had to borrow money from his parents, who mortgaged their house in order to fund the sessions. The album was recorded over the course of six weeks in June and July 1999 at Mad Hatter Studios in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The band would spend the daytime at the studio and spend nights at a friend&#x27;s house. They produced the record themselves, with co-producers Chad Blinman and Alex Brahl, the latter of which did additional engineering. Blinman handled recording, while Dale Lawton served as an assistant. Blinman mixed the recordings, while the album was mastered by Ramon Breton at Oceanview Mastering. Several of the songs included were re-recorded from past releases: &quot;Red Letter Day&quot; from the &quot;Red Letter Day&quot; EP, &quot;Ten Minutes&quot; on a 7&quot; vinyl for the Sub Pop Singles Club and &quot;I&#x27;m a Loner Dottie, a Rebel&quot; for a split release with Braid.

==Composition and lyrics==
&quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; is an emo and pop-punk album that takes influence from 1960s pop and 1980s new wave. Ian Cohen of &quot;Stereogum&quot; described the album in the context of the band&#x27;s contemporaries: &quot;Braid and the Promise Ring were too quirky, Saves The Day hadn’t quite shed their hardcore origins, and Texas Is The Reason and Mineral were too artsy and esoteric&quot;. He added that &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; &quot;occup[ied] that perfect nexus between punk, emo, indie rock, and pure power-pop&quot;. When making the album, the band tried to consciously expand their sound from the harder edge of &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;. Pryor cites Wilco&#x27;s &quot;Summerteeth&quot; (1999), Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Clarity&quot; (1999) and the Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; as primary influences in writing new material. While the group had toyed with keyboards on &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;, they incorporated more of it with the inclusion of Dewees into the band. According to Pryor, they had been listening to Weezer a lot and wanted more synthesizer parts, with Dewees being &quot;such a talented piano player, he just sort of upped the ante.&quot; Dewees&#x27; keyboard parts recalled the work of Duran Duran, which &quot;PopMatters&quot; music critic Dave Meehan said &quot;provide a melodic counterpoint to [...] Suptic&#x27;s thrashing and give the whole album a party-like-its-1983 feel&quot;.

Pryor also began to branch out lyrically, including on “Red Letter Day,” which was written about the bands’ negative experiences with Dirk Hemsmath and Doghouse Records. In writing the album, the band was also more conscious of traditional pop song structure, focusing more on hooks and placing less emphasis on long instrumental sections. Ryan Pope made a conscious effort to restrain his drum parts on the album, emulating Charlie Watts and Jim Keltner, stating that it was more &quot;important to maybe make some sacrifices for the tune instead of pounding away and thinking of yourself as an individual player.&quot; Pryor would later remark that he wished the songs were tuned a half-step or a whole step down as he was yelling at the top of his vocal range throughout the album.

The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, was suggested by Suptic. The opening fast-paced track &quot;Holiday&quot; starts with a guitar pick slide; Meehan said &quot;Action and Action&quot; was &quot;another done-me-wrong, finger-pointing tale&quot;. Niko Stratis of &quot;Spin&quot; referred to &quot;Valentine&quot; as a &quot;perfect snapshot of the way any distance, emotional or physical, feels oceanic in scope&quot;. The acoustic &quot;Out of Reach&quot; crescendos into a piano-led torch song. The power pop song &quot;Ten Minutes&quot; is a homage to be stuck in traffic on the way to a lover&#x27;s residence, and features Suptic on lead vocals. &quot;The Company Dime&quot; features call-and-response vocals during the chorus sections; &quot;My Apology&quot; is a mid-tempo song. &quot;I&#x27;m a Loner Dottie, a Rebel&quot; discusses the aftermath of a one-night stand, while its title is a quote from &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (1985). The country-esque &quot;Close to Home&quot; is followed by the album&#x27;s closing song &quot;I&#x27;ll Catch You&quot;; the latter opens with a piano part and sees a person talking with someone they admire.

==Release and promotion==
In August and September 1999, the group went on a European tour; the tour was planned to last a month, however, the group only got to play six shows over eight days. Following this, the band appeared at the CMJ MusicFest. &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; was released on September 28 through Vagrant and Heroes &amp; Villains Records. The vinyl version was released through Doghouse Records. The Japanese version included &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; and a cover of &quot;Regret&quot; by New Order as bonus tracks, while the European version featured included a re-recorded version of &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; and &quot;Central Standard Time&quot; (taken from a split with the Anniversary). The album&#x27;s artwork is a painting that depicts two robots cuddling on a sofa. In October and November, the group went on a US tour with At the Drive-In. A music video was released for &quot;Action &amp; Action&quot; through music retailer Insound in December 1999.

In February 2000, the Get Up Kids played a one-off show in Kansas before embarking on a Japanese tour. The band then went on a tour of Australia with Jebediah in March and April. The album was released through Epitaph Europe in Europe on March 13. &quot;Action &amp; Action&quot; was released as a single on March 24 in Europe with a demo of &quot;I&#x27;m a Loner Dottie, I&#x27;m a Rebel&quot; and a cover of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Close to Me&quot; as B-sides. The group went on a European tour in May and June with the Anniversary. In September and October, the band went on a headlining US tour with support from the Anniversary, Koufax and Jebediah. It was sponsored by the peer-to-peer file sharing network Napster, who had helped people discover the band and other Vagrant Records&#x27; acts. In January 2001, the group supported Green Day on their US tour, before supporting Weezer in February and March.

===Reissues===

In 2008, Pryor said that the group was in discussions with Vagrant Records to re-release the album as a 10th anniversary package, including a DVD and photo booklet. In February 2009, Doghouse Records re-pressed the album on vinyl. The 10th anniversary edition was released on September 8, which included a DVD with a recording of their first show in a few years and a documentary on the making of the album. In addition, it included 7 downloadable demo recordings from the sessions. Doghouse has since re-pressed the album on vinyl twice more, in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics upon release. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer James Skinner complimented the band members for &quot;how brilliantly [they] play off each other,&quot; coupled with a &quot;healthy dose of longing and you&#x27;re halfway there in terms of understanding its appeal&quot;. Reviewing the album for MTV News, critic Kembrew McLeod wrote that the band are &quot;certainly not purveyors of bubble-punk in the same mold as Green Day or Blink-182, but they never forget the sheer pleasure that the right sequence of notes or the perfect harmony brings&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Rob Browning wrote that the album retaining the &quot;edge of their Doghouse past, but sported cleaner production and more hooks than a tackle box&quot;. He went on to say that these &quot;12 songs are the strongest body of works they had been able to muster prior or since&quot;. Meehan said the band offer &quot;each song enough individual care to let them stand on their own while still bowing to the album&#x27;s coherent feel and rush&quot;. The staff at &quot;Impact Press&quot; considered it superior to the band&#x27;s debut, stating that the &quot;tunes are absolutely absorbing, sucking you into the hooks, the energy, the drive, the music&quot;.

&quot;Spin&quot; writer Andrew Beaujon found the band to be &quot;peppy enough to make even a college sophomore feel old,&quot; adding that they sound &quot;&quot;exactly like&quot; Superchunk&quot;. Elmar Salmutter of &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; said it was a &quot;strong and varied record that&#x27;s just right for the beginning of autumn&quot;. In a review for &quot;Consumable Online&quot;, writer Kerwin So said in order to hear a &quot;few pretty good songs, you have to wade through a deluge of sappy filler&quot;. &quot;LAS Magazine&quot; founder Eric J. Herboth said that like their debut, Something was &quot;complete bunk&quot; aside from the two &quot;great&quot; songs &quot;Red Letter Day&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Loner Dottie, a Rebel&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Brent DiCrescenzo noted a lack of originality in the music, writing that &quot;implementation of keyboards and acoustic guitars is predictable and unimpressive&quot;, calling the release &quot;an entire album of songs which follow the same formula, yet never reach the quasi- memorable qualities of a radio hit.&quot;

AllMusic reviewer Zac Johnson noted that despite the band &quot;struggling with stumbling relationships,&quot; they were still capable of &quot;process[ing] the complexities of their daily lives through music&quot;. Stevie Chick of &quot;NME&quot; said that if the lyrics &quot;sometimes seem a little clumsy or overwrought, that&#x27;s all part of the package&quot;. DiCrescenzo referred to the words as &quot;meaningless lyrics masquerading as poetic insight&quot;; Nude as the News writer Ed Comstock felt the band had &quot;regressed lyrically -- to such an extent that songs that are otherwise great are nearly ruined by lyrical banality&quot;. DiCrescenzo mentioned that the &quot;clinical production scrubs the rock down to a smooth grain of clear sand&quot;. So thought it was a mistake to switch producers as the &quot;entire record has a thoroughly bland, almost adult-contemporary texture to it&quot;. Comstock, on the other hand, noted an improvement of production from their first album. He mentioned that the addition of Dewees made the album come across as &quot;predictable -- while some of the songs seemed more complete and polished, many have simply lost their edge&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Mischa Pearlman of &quot;Record Collector&quot; felt that the album &quot;still holds up, its power and impact remaining as profound as ever&quot;. In a 2017 retrospective of &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;, Vice Media&#x27;s Eduardo Cepeda called &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; &quot;a masterful follow-up to their unfussy debut.&quot; When reviewing the band&#x27;s &quot;Kicker&quot; EP, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Ian Cohen wrote much more fondly about the album:

&quot;Put aside the love songs, and their classic Something to Write Home About can be read as a concept album about the pressure of seeing then-fledgling indie label Vagrant literally bet the farm on their success. But they also wrote concisely and passionately about girls, heartbreak, and trouble with authority, thus setting the norms for 21st-century emo: While the band’s presentation and ethics were overtly punk, their songs harkened back to early rock’n’roll records that functioned as teen pop.&quot;
==Commercial performance and legacy==
===Commercial performance===
&quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; charted at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart. By 2002, the album had sold 150,000 copies. In 2015, it charted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Vinyl Albums chart. The album&#x27;s success was the first major breakthrough for Vagrant Records, and made the Get Up Kids the label&#x27;s &quot;flagship band&quot;, attracting other artists to sign with the company.

===Legacy and influence===
The album has appeared on many best-of lists for the emo and pop-punk genres, by publications such as &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, Junkee, &quot;NME&quot;, and On the A Side, as well as by journalists Leslie Simon and Trevor Kelley in their book &quot;Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture&quot; (2007). Similarly, &quot;Action &amp; Action&quot; appeared on a best-of emo songs list by &quot;Vulture&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; featured both “I’ll Catch You” and “Valentine” on its list of the 40 best Emo love songs of all time. In 2014, as part of 10-year celebrations for Riot Fest, the band performed the album in its entirety. In 2015, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; included it in their 101 Modern Classics list at number 97. They later ranked it at number 102 on the list of best albums in their lifetime. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed ‘’Something to Write Home About’’ as the 19th greatest pop-punk album of all time, and the 42nd best punk album of all time.

&quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; is credited with establishing Vagrant Records as an emo music industry powerhouse. Acts such as Dashboard Confessional, Saves the Day, and Alkaline Trio all signed to the label because of the album&#x27;s success. The album has been viewed as an important release for the second wave of emo, and an influence on the third wave of acts, such as Coheed &amp; Cambria, while Dan Campbell of the Wonder Years has expressed admiration for it.

<doc id="195312" wikidata="Q898834" url="?curid=195312" title="Operation Northwoods">
<text>Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation that originated within the US Department of Defense of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for CIA operatives to both stage and commit acts of terrorism against American military and civilian targets, blame them on the Cuban government, and use them to justify a war against Cuba. The possibilities detailed in the document included the remote control of civilian aircraft which would be secretly repainted as US Air Force planes, a fabricated &#x27;shoot down&#x27; of a US Air Force fighter aircraft off the coast of Cuba, the possible assassination of Cuban immigrants, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating terrorism in U.S. cities. The proposals were rejected by President John F. Kennedy.

Fidel Castro had taken power in Cuba in 1959 and began allowing communists into the new Cuban government, nationalizing U.S. businesses and improving relations with the Soviet Union, arousing the concern of the U.S. military due to the Cold War. The operation proposed creating public support for a war against Cuba by blaming the Cuban government for terrorist acts that would be perpetrated by the U.S. government. To this end, Operation Northwoods proposals recommended hijackings and bombings followed by the introduction of false evidence that would implicate the Cuban government. It stated:
The desired result from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere.

Several other proposals were included within Operation Northwoods, including real or simulated actions against various U.S. military and civilian targets. The operation recommended developing a &quot;Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington&quot;, which involved the bombing of civilian targets, which was to be blamed on the Cuban government to paint a false image of Fidel Castro and misinform the American public.

The plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer and sent to the Secretary of Defense. Although part of the US government&#x27;s anti-communist Cuban Project, Operation Northwoods was never officially accepted; it was authorized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but then rejected by President Kennedy. None of the false flag operations became active under the auspices of the Operation Northwoods proposals.

== Origins and public release ==
The main Operation Northwoods proposal was presented in a document titled &quot;Justification for U.S. Military Intervention in Cuba (TS),&quot; a top secret collection of draft memoranda written by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The document was presented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara on 13 March 1962 as a preliminary submission for planning purposes. The Joint Chiefs recommended that both the covert and overt aspects of any such operation be assigned to them.
The previously secret document was originally made public on 18 November 1997, by the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board, a U.S. federal agency overseeing the release of government records related to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. A total of 1,521 pages of once-secret military records covering 1962 to 1964 were declassified by said Review Board.

&quot;Appendix to Enclosure A&quot; and &quot;Annex to Appendix to Enclosure A&quot; of the Northwoods document were first published online by the National Security Archive on 6 November 1998 in a joint venture with CNN as part of its 1998 &quot;Cold War&quot; television documentary series—specifically, as a documentation supplement to &quot;Episode 10: Cuba,&quot; which aired on 29 November 1998. &quot;Annex to Appendix to Enclosure A&quot; is the section of the document which contains the proposals to stage false flag terrorist attacks. 

The Northwoods document was published online in a more complete form, including cover memoranda, by the National Security Archive on 30 April 2001.

== Provocations ==
Responding to a request for pretexts for military intervention by the Chief of Operations of the Cuba Project, Brig. Gen. Edward Lansdale, the document listed methods, such as false flag provocations, that the authors believed would garner support for U.S. military intervention in Cuba. According to the documents, the plan called for several steps to be taken in an attempt to provoke Cuba into an action against the United States, then blame it for &quot;hostilities&quot; carried out by the U.S. against its military base at Guantanamo; these would be followed by executing offensive operations there against tactical Cuban civilian targets and military emplacements, leading to &quot;large scale United States military operations&quot;:
== Related Operation Mongoose proposals ==

In addition to Operation Northwoods, under the Operation Mongoose program the U.S. Department of Defense had a number of similar proposals for actions to be taken against the Cuban regime of Fidel Castro.

Twelve of these proposals come from a 2 February 1962 memorandum entitled &quot;Possible Actions to Provoke, Harass or Disrupt Cuba,&quot; written by Brig. Gen. William H. Craig and submitted to Brig. Gen. Edward Lansdale, the commander of the Operation Mongoose project.

The memorandum outlines Operation Bingo, a false flag plan to &quot;create an incident which has the appearance of an attack on U.S. facilities (GMO) in Cuba, thus providing an excuse for use of U.S. military might to overthrow the current government of Cuba.&quot;

It also includes Operation Dirty Trick, another false flag plot to blame Castro if the 1962 Mercury crewed space flight carrying John Glenn crashed, saying: &quot;The objective is to provide irrevocable proof that, should the MERCURY manned orbit flight fail, the fault lies with the Communists et al. Cuba.&quot; It continues, &quot;This to be accomplished by manufacturing various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the Cubans.&quot;

Even after General Lemnitzer lost his job as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs still planned false-flag pretext operations at least into 1963. A different U.S. Department of Defense policy paper created in 1963 discussed a plan to make it appear that Cuba had attacked a member of the Organization of American States (OAS) so that the United States could retaliate. The U.S. Department of Defense document says of one of the scenarios, &quot;A contrived &#x27;Cuban&#x27; attack on an OAS member could be set up, and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self-defense and request assistance from the U.S. and OAS.&quot;

The plan expressed confidence that by this action, &quot;the U.S. could almost certainly obtain the necessary two-thirds support among OAS members for collective action against Cuba.&quot;

Included in the nations the Joint Chiefs suggested as targets for covert attacks were Jamaica and Trinidad-Tobago. Since both were members of the British Commonwealth, the Joint Chiefs hoped that by secretly attacking them and then falsely blaming Cuba, the United States could incite the people of the United Kingdom into supporting a war against Castro. As the U.S. Department of Defense report noted:

Any of the contrived situations described above are inherently, extremely risky in our democratic system in which security can be maintained, after the fact, with very great difficulty. If the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation it should be one in which participation by U.S. personnel is limited only to the most highly trusted covert personnel. This suggests the infeasibility of the use of military units for any aspect of the contrived situation.&quot;

The U.S. Department of Defense report even suggested covertly paying a person in Castro&#x27;s government to stage a false flag attack against the United States: &quot;The only area remaining for consideration then would be to bribe one of Castro&#x27;s subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on Guantanamo.&quot;

== Reaction ==
Kennedy rejected the Northwoods proposal. A JCS/Pentagon document, a memo by Lansdale entitled MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, 16 MARCH 1962, reads: &quot;General Lemnitzer commented that the military had contingency plans for U.S. intervention. Also it had plans for creating plausible pretexts to use force, with the pretext either attacks on U.S. aircraft or a Cuban action in Latin America for which we could retaliate. The President said bluntly that we were not discussing the use of military force, that General Lemnitzer might find the U.S. so engaged in Berlin or elsewhere that he couldn&#x27;t use the contemplated 4 divisions in Cuba.&quot; The proposal was sent for approval to the secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, but was not implemented.

Following presentation of the Northwoods plan, Kennedy removed Lemnitzer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, although he became Supreme Allied Commander of NATO in January 1963. U.S. military leaders began to perceive Kennedy as going soft on Cuba, and the President became increasingly unpopular with the military. A rift had already developed during Kennedy&#x27;s disagreements with the service chiefs over the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and flared up again with his June 10, 1963 announcement of a unilateral U.S. Test Ban Treaty.

Physical documentation on Operation Northwoods became declassified through the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. This act declassified a total of four million documents, including Operation Northwoods, and was made available through the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. However, public knowledge of Operation Northwoods did not come until 2001 with the release of a book by the author James Bamford titled &quot;Body of Secrets&quot;.

On 3 August 2001, the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power of Cuba (the main legislative body of the Republic of Cuba) issued a statement referring to Operation Northwoods and Operation Mongoose wherein it condemned such U.S. government plans.

<doc id="195313" wikidata="Q335813" url="?curid=195313" title="James Herriot">
<text>James Alfred Wight (3 October 1916 – 23 February 1995), better known by his pen name James Herriot, was a British veterinary surgeon and author.

Born in Sunderland, Wight graduated from Glasgow Veterinary College in 1939, returning to England to become a veterinary surgeon in Yorkshire, where he practised for almost 50 years. He is best known for writing a series of eight books set in the 1930s–1950s Yorkshire Dales about veterinary practice, animals, and their owners, which began with &quot;If Only They Could Talk&quot;, first published in 1970. Over the decades, the series of books has sold some 60 million copies.

The franchise based on his writings was very successful. In addition to the books, there have been several television and film adaptations of Wight&#x27;s books, including the 1975 film &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;; a BBC television series of the same name, which ran 90 episodes; and a 2020 UK Channel 5 series, also of the same name.

==Life==
James Alfred Wight, who was called &quot;Alf&quot; for short, was born on 3 October 1916 in Sunderland, County Durham, England. The family moved to Glasgow when James was a child, and he lived there happily until leaving for Sunderland, and then Thirsk in North Yorkshire, England, in 1940. He had a &quot;soft, lilting Scottish accent,&quot; according to actor Christopher Timothy, who portrayed James Herriot in the 1978 series.

Wight attended Yoker Primary School and Hillhead High School. When he was a boy in Glasgow, one of Wight&#x27;s favourite pastimes was walking with his dog, an Irish Setter, in the Scottish countryside and watching it play with his friends&#x27; dogs. He later wrote: &quot;I was intrigued by the character and behaviour of these animals... [I wanted to] spend my life working with them if possible.&quot; At age 12, he read an article in &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot; about veterinary surgeons and was captivated with the idea of a career treating sick animals. Two years later, in 1930, he decided to become a vet after the principal of Glasgow Veterinary College gave a lecture at his high school.

Wight married Joan Catherine Anderson Danbury on 5 November 1941 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Thirsk.

After they returned to Thirsk, Wight &quot;carried on TB testing [of] cows in Wensleydale and the top floor of 23 Kirkgate became Joan and Alf’s first home&quot;. The couple had two children.

===Veterinary practice===
Wight took six years to complete the five-year programme at Glasgow Veterinary College. He failed several of his classes on the first try (surgery, pathology, physiology, histology, animal husbandry). His setback was partly because of a recurring gastrointestinal problem, which required multiple operations. He graduated on 14 December 1939.

In January 1940, Wight joined a veterinary practice in Sunderland, working for J. J. McDowall. He decided that he would prefer a rural practice and accepted a position in July, based at 23 Kirkgate in Thirsk, Yorkshire, near the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors. The practice owner, Donald Sinclair, had enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was soon to leave for training; he gave Wight all the practice&#x27;s income in return for Wight&#x27;s looking after it during his absence. (His brother, Brian Sinclair, was not yet a vet.) After Sinclair was discharged from the RAF four months later, he asked Wight to stay permanently with the practice, offering a salaried partnership, which Wight accepted.

Wight enlisted in the RAF in November 1942. He did well in his training and was one of the first in his flight to fly solo. After undergoing surgery on an anal fistula in July 1943, he was deemed unfit to fly combat aircraft and was discharged as a leading aircraftman the following November. He joined his wife at her parents&#x27; house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to a house of their own. In 1953, the family moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk. Wishing for more privacy as the popularity of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; increased, in 1977 Wight and his wife moved again, to the smaller village of Thirlby, about from Thirsk. Wight lived there until his death in 1995.

Wight became a full partner in the Thirsk practice in 1949 and retired from full-time practice in 1980 but continued to work part time. He fully retired in 1989 (or 1990 according to some sources); by then, he had worked in his field for roughly 50 years.

===Death===
In Wight&#x27;s will, his share of the practice passed to his son, Jim Wight, also a vet. Alf Wight had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991 and was treated in the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton. On 23 February 1995, he died at his home in Thirlby as a result of the cancer, leaving an estate valued for probate at £5,425,873 (equivalent to £ in ). His remains were cremated and scattered on Sutton Bank. His wife&#x27;s health declined after his death, and she died on 14 July 1999.

===Remembering Alf Wight===
In 2001, a book by Wight&#x27;s son, Jim, was published. A review of &quot;The Real James Herriot: A Memoir of My Father&quot; noted, &quot;Wight portrays his father as a modest, down-to-earth and generous man, utterly unchanged by fame, a private individual who bottled up his emotions, which led to a nervous breakdown and electroshock therapy in 1960.&quot;

Wight&#x27;s obituary confirmed his modesty and preference to stay away from the public eye. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t give me any kick at all,&quot; he once said. &quot;It&#x27;s not my world. I wouldn&#x27;t be happy there. I wouldn&#x27;t give up being a vet if I had a million pounds. I&#x27;m too fond of animals.&quot; By 1995, some 50 million of the James Herriot books had been sold. Wight was well aware that clients were unimpressed with the fame that accompanied a best-selling author. &quot;If a farmer calls me with a sick animal, he couldn&#x27;t care less if I were George Bernard Shaw,&quot; Wight once said.

==Career as an author==
Although Wight claimed in the preface of &quot;James Herriot&#x27;s Yorkshire&quot; that he had begun to write only after his wife encouraged him when he was 50, he in fact kept copious diaries as a child, as a teenager wrote for his school&#x27;s magazine, and wrote at least one short story during his college years. In the early 1960s he began analysing the books of successful authors that he enjoyed reading, such as P. G. Wodehouse and Conan Doyle, to understand different writing styles. During this time he also began writing more seriously, composing numerous short stories and, in his own words, &#x27;bombarding&#x27; publishers with them. 

Based on the year when he started work in Thirsk, the stories in the first two books would have taken place early during the Second World War. Wight preferred to have them take place in a quieter era so he set them in pre-war years.

The author required a pseudonym because the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons&#x27; regulations prevented vets from any type of advertising. A reliable source states that he &quot;chose the name after attending a football match in which the Scotland internationalist Jim Herriot played in goal for Birmingham City.&quot;

Wight&#x27;s early efforts at having his writing published were unsuccessful, which he later explained by telling Paul Vallely in a 1981 interview for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph Magazine&quot;, &quot;...my style was improving but [...] my subjects were wrong.&quot; Choosing a subject where he was more experienced, in 1969 he wrote &quot;If Only They Could Talk&quot;, a collection of stories about his experiences as a young veterinary surgeon in the Yorkshire Dales. The book was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by Michael Joseph Ltd. Wight followed it up with &quot;It Shouldn&#x27;t Happen to a Vet&quot; in 1972. Sales were slow until Thomas McCormack of St. Martin&#x27;s Press in New York City received a copy and arranged to have both books published as one volume in the United States that year. Wight named this volume &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; from the second line of the hymn &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot;. The book was a huge success.

===Achieving success===
Wight wrote seven more books in the series started by &quot;If Only They Could Talk&quot;. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently. Most of the stories were collected into three omnibus volumes; the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, &quot;Every Living Thing&quot;, sold 650,000 copies in six weeks in the United States and stayed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for eight months.

Recent research indicates that the first two books sold only a few thousand copies in the UK at first. &quot;It was a New York publisher [St. Martin&#x27;s Press] who changed the childish-looking cover art[,] combined the works under the title &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;,&quot; and reaped the benefits when the work achieved best-seller status in the US. Its US editor, Tom McCormack, quoted in a book based on interviews of American publishers, said the title choice was made after he sought suggestions from colleagues, related to nature, and &quot;a British guy in our marketing department, Michael Brooks&quot;, spoke about the hymn, reciting its first verse. However, in a 1976 BBC interview Wight said &quot;this was my daughter&#x27;s title&quot; and &quot;she thought that one out&quot;.

Contrary to widespread belief, Wight&#x27;s books are only partially autobiographical, with many of the stories only loosely based on real events or people. Where stories do have a basis in genuine veterinary cases, they are frequently ones that Wight attended in the 1960s and 70s. Most of the stories are set in the fictional town of Darrowby, which Wight described as a composite of Thirsk, its nearby market towns Richmond, Leyburn, and Middleham, and &#x27;a fair chunk of my own imagination&#x27;. Wight anonymised the majority of his characters by renaming them: Notably, he gave the pseudonyms Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, respectively, to Donald Sinclair and his brother Brian, and used the name Helen Alderson for his wife Joan.

When Wight&#x27;s first book was published, Brian Sinclair &quot;was delighted to be captured as Tristan and remained enthusiastic about all Wight&#x27;s books.&quot; Donald Sinclair was offended by his portrayal and said, &quot;Alfred, this book is a real test of our friendship.&quot; (He never called Wight &#x27;Alf&#x27;, mirrored in the books by Siegfried&#x27;s always referring to Herriot as &#x27;James&#x27; rather than &#x27;Jim&#x27;.) Things calmed down and the pair continued to work together until they retired.

Wight&#x27;s son wrote in &quot;The Real James Herriot&quot; that Donald Sinclair&#x27;s character in the novels was considerably toned down, and in an interview described him as &#x27;hilarious&#x27;, &#x27;a genius&#x27;, and &#x27;chaotic&#x27;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also stated that Donald Sinclair had far more rough edges than the Siegfried character. &quot;Sinclair’s real-life behaviour was much more eccentric. (He once discharged a shotgun during a dinner party to let his guests know it was time to leave.)&quot; When he asked a vet who knew Sinclair if he was eccentric, actor Samuel West (who researched the vet for his role in the Channel 5 TV series) was told, &quot;Oh, no ... he was mad.&quot; The books are novels and most sources agree that about 50 per cent of the content was fiction.

In a BBC interview taped in 1976, Wight recalled his life in Yorkshire, his career, and the success of his books.

==Film and television adaptations==

Wight&#x27;s books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, followed by &quot;It Shouldn&#x27;t Happen to a Vet&quot; in 1976.

The BBC produced a television series based on Wight&#x27;s books titled &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, which ran from 1978 to 1980 and 1988–1990; ninety episodes were broadcast altogether. Wight was often present on set and hosted gatherings for the cast and crew. &quot;After filming we used to go for wonderful evenings in the Wensleydale Heifer with Tim Hardy and Chris Timothy,&quot; said Sandy Byrne, wife of the writer of the television series, Johnny Byrne. &quot;Alf and Joan would come along. It was always immensely exciting. We made very good friends with Alf and Joan. We saw them several times over the years. Alf was still practising then, so his car would be packed with dogs. Joan was a very easy, down-to-earth person, I liked her very much. We also got to know their children, Jim and Rosie, very well.&quot;

In September 2010, the Gala Theatre in Durham presented the world premier professional stage adaptation of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;.

In 2010, the BBC commissioned the three-part drama &quot;Young James Herriot&quot;, inspired by Wight&#x27;s early life and studies in Scotland. The series drew on archives and the diaries and case notes which Wight kept during his student days in Glasgow, as well as the biography written by his son. The first episode was shown on BBC One on 18 December 2011, and drew six million viewers. The BBC announced in April 2012 that the series would not return. A book titled &quot;Young James Herriot&quot; was written by historian and author John Lewis-Stempel to accompany the series.

A new production of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; was produced by Playground Entertainment for Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and PBS in the United States. The production received some funding from Screen Yorkshire. Most of the filming was completed in the Yorkshire Dales, including many exteriors in Grassington as the setting for the fictional town of Darrowby. The first series, of six episodes and a special Christmas episode, premiered in the UK on Channel 5 on 1 September 2020 and in the US on PBS as part of &quot;Masterpiece&quot; on 10 January 2021. &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; has now run four series, also of six episodes plus a Christmas special. A fifth series started on Channel 5 in late 2024 and on PBS in January 2025.

==Recognition and tourist industry==

Thirsk has become a magnet for fans of Wight&#x27;s books. Following his death, the practice at 23 Kirkgate was restored and converted into a museum, The World of James Herriot, which focuses on his life and writings. A local pub renamed itself the &quot;Darrowby Inn&quot;, after the village name that Wight created to represent the locale in which he practised. (By 2020, the pub had been renamed The Red Bear.)

Portions of the surgery sets used in the &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; BBC series are on display at the museum, including the living room and dispensary. Some of the original contents of the surgery can be found at the Yorkshire Museum of Farming in Murton, York.

Grand Central rail company operates train services from Sunderland to London King&#x27;s Cross, stopping at Thirsk. Class 180 DMU No. 180112 was named &#x27;James Herriot&#x27; in Wight&#x27;s honour, and was dedicated on 29 July 2009 by his daughter Rosemary and son James. Actor Christopher Timothy, who played Herriot in the BBC television series, unveiled a statue of Wight in October 2014 at Thirsk Racecourse.

Wight received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1979, and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours. In 1994, the library at Glasgow Veterinary College was named the &#x27;James Herriot Library&#x27; in honour of Wight&#x27;s achievements. Wight was deeply gratified by this recognition, replying in his acceptance letter, &quot;I regard this as the greatest honour that has ever been bestowed upon me.&quot; He was a lifelong supporter of Sunderland A.F.C., and was made an honorary president of the club in 1991.

A blue plaque was placed at Wight&#x27;s childhood home in Glasgow in October 2018. There is also a blue plaque at 23 Kirkgate, Wight&#x27;s former surgery. Another blue plaque was unveiled by his children at his Brandling Street birthplace in Sunderland in September 2021.

Minor planet 4124 Herriot is named in his honour.

<text>U.S. Route 61 or U.S. Highway 61 (U.S. 61) is a major United States highway that extends between New Orleans, Louisiana and the city of Wyoming, Minnesota. The highway generally follows the course of the Mississippi River and is designated the Great River Road for much of its route. As of 2004, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus in Wyoming, Minnesota, is at an intersection with Interstate 35 (I-35). Until 1991, the highway extended north on what is now Minnesota State Highway 61 (MN 61) through Duluth to the Canada–U.S. border near Grand Portage, then continued to Thunder Bay, Canada, as Ontario Highway 61. Its southern terminus in New Orleans is at an intersection with U.S. Route 90 (US 90). The route was an important south–north connection in the days before the interstate highway system.

The highway is often called the Blues Highway because of its long history in blues music; part of the route lies on the Mississippi Blues Trail and is denoted by markers in Vicksburg and Tunica. It is also the subject of numerous musical works, with the route inspiring the album &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; by Bob Dylan.

==Route description==
===Louisiana===
US 61 in Louisiana is four-laned from its southern terminus in New Orleans to the Mississippi state line, where the highway continues to Natchez as a four-lane highway.

The section of US 61 from New Orleans to Baton Rouge is known as the Airline Highway. Although the road fronts the former terminal of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and passes near Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, the name originally referred to the highway&#x27;s straight route in contrast to that of the winding Jefferson Highway, which often paralleled the Mississippi River. Legend has it that former Louisiana Governor Huey Long advocated the construction of the &quot;airline&quot; highway to provide him with a quick means of access from the capitol building in Baton Rouge to the bars and other pleasure establishments in New Orleans. On Airline Highway in Jefferson Parish in 1987, Baton Rouge televangelist Jimmy Swaggart was confronted by rival preacher Marvin Gorman as Swaggart exited the Travel Inn after seeing a prostitute. This incident increased the area&#x27;s reputation as a locale of &quot;seedy motels&quot;. Partly because of that reputation, the section in Jefferson Parish was later renamed Airline Drive.

===Mississippi===

US 61 is divided from the Tennessee state line to U.S. 82 in Leland. The highway south of Vicksburg to Natchez is mostly divided and four-lane; only short sections through Port Gibson are two lane. From Natchez to the Louisiana state line, US 61 is now divided and four lanes. The Mississippi Department of Transportation is now widening the highway between Vicksburg and Leland to four lanes, beginning with replacement of the Yazoo River bridge at Redwood in Warren County.

The road is also known as the Blues Highway because it runs through the Mississippi Delta country, which was an important source of blues music. Highway 61 has been referenced in music by various artists with roots in the region.

The former junction of US 61 and U.S. 49 in Clarksdale (North State Street and Desoto Avenue) is designated as the famous crossroads where, according to legend, Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for mastery of the blues. US 49 and US 61 are currently routed around the city on a freeway bypass. It was on this stretch of highway that blues singer Bessie Smith died as a result of a car crash on September 26, 1937.

Like Route 66 in the Western U.S., the iconic US 61 sign is so strongly identified with the Clarksdale area that it is used to market different products and services. US 61 is defined in Mississippi Code Annotated § 65-3-3.

===Tennessee===
US 61 enters Memphis from Walls as South 3rd Street in South Memphis, continues north to E.H. Crump Boulevard, then turns west, joining US 64, US 70, and US 79, then joins I-55 as they cross the Mississippi River to West Memphis, a distance of approximately .

===Arkansas===
US 61 runs through the state for from West Memphis to just north of Blytheville, near the Missouri border.

The route enters Arkansas in a concurrency with I-55 and US 64, US 70, and US 79 near West Memphis. The route skirts the northwest edge of the city, briefly meeting Interstate 40 before continuing north with I-55, US 63 and US 64. US 61 overlaps I-55 until an area near Turrell, when US 61 branches east but continues to run parallel to I-55. Southbound US 61 appears disconnected after the reconstruction of the Interstate 555/US 63 interchange in the early 2000s. The old alignment of US 61 between West Memphis and Turrell is currently signed as Arkansas Highway 77. The route runs through many small towns in Mississippi County, and becomes a city street in Osceola. Continuing north, the route crosses over I-55, south of Blytheville. In the city, US 61 becomes South Division Street until crossing Main Street (AR 18). The route runs north through the rest of Blytheville and beyond until a junction with AR 150 near Yarbro. After this junction, the route continues due north to Missouri.

===Missouri===
US 61 enters Missouri south of Steele, passing under a concrete arch that was constructed by the Mississippi County, Arkansas highway department in 1924. The alignment of the highway is closely followed by I-55 between there and the St. Louis area, with portions of the two highways overlapping. Between Howardville and Sikeston, US 61 overlaps with US 62. At Sikeston, US 61 also meets US 60. Crossing Route 32 at &quot;one of the oldest French Colonial settlements west of the Mississippi River (1735)&quot;, Ste. Genevieve, the road continues through Ste. Genevieve County. The highway then turns northwest and meets US 67 at Festus. The two highways overlap until separating in the St. Louis area in Ladue, where US 61 meets I-64 and US 40. While in the St. Louis area, US 61 is on Lindbergh Boulevard, which goes by the name of Kirkwood Road while in that municipality.

After meeting I-64 and US 40, US 61 turns west with them and its overlap with the Avenue of the Saints begins. At Wentzville, the overlap with I-64 and US 40 ends when it meets I-70, with the former ending at I-70. It continues in a general northwesterly route, meeting US 54 at Bowling Green and US 36 and I-72 at Hannibal, an intersection which is I-72&#x27;s western terminus. Northwest of Hannibal, US 61 meets US 24 and the two overlap until they separate at Taylor. US 61 continues north until near Wayland, where the highway turns east at Route 27 and the overlap with the Avenue of the Saints ends. Shortly before leaving Missouri, US 61 meets US 136 and the two overlap until entering Iowa. US 61 in Missouri was formerly known as Route 9.

US 61 runs along the western side of the Mississippi River between Memphis, Tennessee, and Dubuque, Iowa, and therefore never enters the state of Illinois.

===Iowa===
US 61 enters Iowa overlapped with US 136 near Keokuk. They separate in Keokuk and US 61 turns north there and meets US 218 in northwestern Keokuk. They overlap for , then US 218 turns northwest. US 61 goes north until crossing Iowa 2 and becomes a four-lane freeway bypass around Fort Madison. US 61 then turns northeast and meets US 34 in Burlington. The highway goes north and overlaps Iowa 92 from Grandview to Muscatine. At Muscatine, the highway turns east to go towards the Quad Cities. At Davenport, US 61 follows I-280 and I-80 around Davenport and meets Business 61.

After I-80, the highway turns back north as a freeway until De Witt, which is where it meets US 30. It continues north from there to Dubuque as an expressway except for a freeway section in the Maquoketa area. The highway joins with US 151 about south of Dubuque. US 61 and US 151 are joined at the Southwest Arterial in Dubuque by US 52, which separates in Key West. Also in Dubuque, a short connecting highway links US 61 and US 151 with US 20. Together, US 61 and US 151 continue through Dubuque, where they cross the Mississippi River and enter Wisconsin via the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge.

A four-lane freeway bypass of Fort Madison was completed and opened to traffic in November 2011. A project to widen a segment between the Louisa–Muscatine county line near Letts and the south junction of Iowa 92 near Grandview to a four-lane expressway was completed in December 2017. Construction on widening US-61 to a divided highway is under way between Burlington and Mediapolis. The remaining segments between Iowa 92 and Mediapolis, and between the northern end of the Keokuk bypass and the Missouri state line have not been programmed yet by the Iowa DOT.

===Wisconsin===

On the opposite bank of the Mississippi, US 61 and US 151 enter Grant County, with US 61 going north through Wisconsin about to La Crosse. US 151 separates from US 61 at Dickeyville, with US 61 proceeding through Lancaster, Fennimore, and Boscobel. At Readstown US 61 and US 14 join and proceed together to La Crosse.
In 2004, a new two-lane Mississippi River Bridge opened in La Crosse, creating a four-lane highway from downtown La Crosse to the Minnesota state line. The new bridge brings traffic into La Crosse, and is located just south of the old Cass Street Bridge which continues to be used by traffic heading towards Minnesota.

===Minnesota===
The four-lane highway continues north to La Crescent.
US 61 follows the Mississippi River through southeast Minnesota through the cities of Winona, Lake City, and Red Wing. It crosses the river at Hastings using the Hastings Bridge and joins US 10 before entering St. Paul. Within the city, the route follows I-94 for a short distance, and then follows Mounds Boulevard, East 7th Street, and Arcade Street through the east side of St. Paul.

The section of US 61 from La Crescent to Cottage Grove is officially designated the Disabled American Veterans Highway.

The portion of US 61 north of Duluth is now part of the Minnesota State Highway system, bearing the designation MN 61 since 1991. Between the city of Wyoming and Duluth, the highway has been turned back to local jurisdiction or supplanted by I-35.

==History==

US 61 once ran from New Orleans through Duluth, Minnesota all the way to the Canada–US border. The road has been shortened to ending now in the city of Wyoming, Minnesota at an intersection with I-35.

The northern section of US 61 in Minnesota was separated when I-35 was constructed, and decommissioned in 1991.

===Mississippi===
The section of US 61 in northwestern Mississippi, between the state line and Clarksdale, has received numerous changes since 1990, when casinos were legalized by the state, in concert with expanding suburban development from Memphis into Mississippi. The resulting boom in casino development in Tunica County, coupled with dramatic population and development growth in DeSoto County south of Memphis has led to relocating most of the highway and expanding to a divided four-lane highway.

===Missouri===
The present-day course of US 61 south of St. Louis largely follows the original course of the Spanish colonial road &quot;El Camino Real&quot;. In 1776, when the Spanish lieutenant governor recognized that the two principal communities of St. Louis and Ste. Genevieve needed an overland connection, he wrote his superior requesting permission. Construction then began, with parts of the Spanish road following old Indian trails. The road had been reportedly constructed by 1779, and then extended further south to the provincial posts at Cape Girardeau and New Madrid, and extended northwest to the post of St. Charles. The sole rationale for the &quot;Camino Real&quot; was a military road to connect the several district posts for defense and administrative purposes. Much of the road was a simple trace for horses and foot travelers, and by 1796 transport large enough to require the use of wagons was largely being moved up the Mississippi River.

The original Spanish name &quot;el camino real&quot; was conferred by Colonel George Morgan in honor of Charles IV of Spain, the reigning King of Spain (1788-1808). The government road was known as &quot;le Chemin du Roi&quot; or &quot;Rue Royale&quot; by the local French-speaking population and known as &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; or the old &quot;King&#x27;s Trace&quot; by early American settlers. Because the road led to the French colonial &quot;Illinois Country&quot;, which also included parts of present-day Missouri, early American settlers sometimes referred to it as the &quot;Illinois Road&quot;. It is also known as the &quot;Royal Road of the King&#x27;s Domain&quot; in St.Charles County, Missouri. &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; or &quot;Kingshighway&quot; continues as street names in present-day St.Charles, St.Louis, Perryville, Cape Girardeau, Sikeston and New Madrid.
When it was designated in 1926, US 61 replaced most of Route 9, which had been established in 1922 between Arkansas and Iowa. The only part that did not become part of US 61 was north of Wayland, where US 61 turned east on Route 4, and Route 9 became Route 4B (now Route 81) to the state line. Since then, US 61 has been moved to a shorter route between Jackson and Festus, replacing much of Route 25; the old alignment is now Route 72 and US 67.

===Iowa===
Prior to 1958, US 61 followed the route now known as Iowa 22 between Davenport and Muscatine. US 61 was then rerouted onto the old Iowa 22 which passed through Blue Grass.

Starting in the early 1980s, US 61 between Davenport and Dubuque was rebuilt as a four-lane highway. The first link, a stretch between Davenport and De Witt, was finished in 1982; a bypass around De Witt, which overlapped US 30, was in use starting in November 1975. Subsequent links were completed to Maquoketa (in 1996) and finally to Dubuque in 1999. When the final link was completed, Dubuque finally had a direct four-lane connection to Interstate 80.

In 1983, two multi-lane one-way routes were designated through Davenport starting at the northern city limits. Southbound traffic used the newly constructed Welcome Way until it merges with Harrison Street just north of 35th Street; northbound traffic use Brady Street (which had been a two-way, four-lane street). Other two-way stretches of the highway through Davenport have four (or more) lanes. In 2010, in large part due to a railroad bridge with a low clearance in downtown Davenport, US 61 through Davenport was moved to Interstates 80 and 280, with signing taking place in the fall of 2011; the highway through Davenport was redesignated as &quot;US 61 Business.&quot;

A bypass around Muscatine was opened in 1984, but other changes on the stretch south of Davenport would not happen for another decade. The changes came as follows:
*1996 – The completion of a , four-lane stretch between Blue Grass and I-280 in Davenport.
*November 2000 — A stretch between Blue Grass and the Muscatine bypass was opened.
*May 2001 — A bypass around Blue Grass.
*July 2002 — A stretch, from the Muscatine bypass to the southern tip of Muscatine County, just north of Letts.
*December 2017 — A new stretch of divided highway from the Muscatine-Louisa county line to near Grandview was opened to traffic, including an interchange with Iowa 92 and County Highway G48.

The final stretch completed a continuous multi-laned link between Dickeyville, Wisconsin south to Grandview.

===Illinois===
Prior to the construction of the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge, US 61 passed through a short distance through Jo Daviess County between Dubuque and Wisconsin, concurrent with US 151. Now both highways cross the Mississippi on the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge, which directly connects Wisconsin and Iowa, with neither US 61 nor US 151 passing through Illinois.

===Minnesota===
US 61 follows the west bank of the Mississippi River from the Wisconsin border through Hastings where it crosses the river and proceeds to St. Paul. North from the city of Wyoming, Old US 61 continues as &quot;Forest Boulevard&quot; in Chisago County, and then as &quot;County 61&quot; through Pine and Carlton counties before ending at MN 210. The original US 61 had continued east along MN 210 to Carlton and north on present-day MN 45 to Scanlon before turning northeast on what is now &quot;County 61 / Old US 61&quot; through Esko.

I-35 has replaced the original US 61 descending Thompson Hill into West Duluth, from which most of the city of Duluth can be seen entering town, including the Aerial Lift Bridge and the waterfront. The original US 61 in the city of Duluth had previously followed Cody Street, Grand Avenue, Superior Street, Second Street, Third Street, and London Road.

The original US 61 between Duluth and Canada was designated as MN 61 in 1991. MN 61, part of the &quot;Lake Superior Circle Tour&quot; route, follows the North Shore of Lake Superior, where it becomes Ontario Highway 61 upon entering Canada. Highway 61 continues to the city of Thunder Bay, where it ends at an intersection with the Trans-Canada Highway.

Starting in 2012 Chisago, Carlton and Pine Counties began placing &quot;OLD US 61&quot; markers along the former routing of US 61 through their respective counties.

<doc id="195322" wikidata="Q609474" url="?curid=195322" title="Joint Chiefs of Staff">
<text>The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is the body of the most senior uniformed leaders within the United States Department of Defense, which advises the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of a chairman (CJCS), a vice chairman (VJCS), the chiefs of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, and the chief of the National Guard Bureau. Each of the individual service chiefs, outside their JCS obligations, works directly under the secretaries of their respective military departments, e.g. the secretary of the Army, the secretary of the Navy, and the secretary of the Air Force.

Following the Goldwater–Nichols Act in 1986, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command authority, either individually or collectively, as the chain of command goes from the president to the secretary of defense, and from the secretary to the regional combatant commanders. Goldwater–Nichols also created the office of vice chairman, and the chairman is now designated as the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council and the president.

The Joint Staff (JS) is a headquarters staff in the Pentagon, composed of personnel from each of the six service branches, that assists the chairman and the vice chairman in discharging their responsibilities and is managed by the director of the Joint Staff (DJS).

The most recent chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was an African-American general, Charles Q. Brown Jr., who was fired on February 21, 2025, by President Trump&#x27;s secretary of defense Pete Hegseth. The position is currently vacant, with a Biden-appointed admiral,Christopher Grady, functioning as acting chairman. Trump&#x27;s own nominee for the position is currently retired Air Force lieutenant general Dan Caine. 

This first-of-its-kind firing of a chairman has been seen by some in the press as &quot;part of a campaign led by [Trump&#x27;s] defense secretary to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks.&quot; This motive was also viewed in Hegseth&#x27;s simultaneous firing of the first woman to serve on the JCS, Admiral Lisa Franchetti, former chief of naval operations, on the same day.

==Role and responsibilities==

After the 1986 reorganization of the Armed Forces undertaken by the Goldwater–Nichols Act, the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not possess operational authority over troops or other units. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the president to the secretary of defense directly to the commanders of the unified combatant commands and thus bypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff completely.

Today, their primary responsibility is to ensure personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective services for the combatant commanders to utilize. In addition, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff acts as the chief military advisor to the president and the secretary of defense. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the third-highest deliberative body for military policy, after the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, which includes the president and other officials besides the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

While serving as the chairman or vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, chief of staff of the Army, commandant of the Marine Corps, chief of naval operations, chief of staff of the Air Force, or commandant of the Coast Guard, basic pay is $18,808.20 a month, plus a $4,000 per year personal money allowance.

===Current members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
====Non-member attendee====

Although it is a branch of the Armed Forces pursuant to , the Coast Guard operates under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Department of Defense, except when the president (e.g., in times of war or national emergency) transfers it to the Department of the Navy. The commandant of the Coast Guard is not a &quot;de jure&quot; member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff but is sometimes regarded as a &quot;de facto&quot; member, being entitled to the same supplemental pay as the Joint Chiefs, and occasionally will attend meetings of the JCS by invitation. Unlike the Joint Chiefs, who are not actually in the military&#x27;s operational chain of command, the commandant is both the administrative and the operational commander of the Coast Guard.

==History==

===Joint Board===

As the U.S. military grew in size following the American Civil War, joint military action between the Army and Navy became increasingly difficult. The Army and Navy were unsupportive of each other at either the planning or operational level and were constrained by disagreements during the Spanish–American War in the Caribbean campaigns. The Joint Army and Navy Board was established in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, comprising representatives from the military heads and chief planners of both the Navy&#x27;s General Board and the Army&#x27;s General Staff. The Joint Board acting as an &quot;advisory committee&quot; was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common rivalry between the two services.

Yet the Joint Board accomplished little since its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the secretaries of war and Navy. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner in which the United States conducted World War I.

After World War I, the two secretaries agreed in 1919 to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General Staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war. In these, the U.S. was always designated &quot;blue&quot; and potential enemies were assigned various other colors.

Now, the Joint Board&#x27;s membership was to include the chiefs of staff, their deputies, and the chief of war plans division for the Army and the director of plans division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board was to be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.

===World War II===
U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and British prime minister Winston Churchill established the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) during the 1942 Arcadia Conference. The CCS would serve as the supreme military body for strategic direction of the joint U.S.–UK war effort.

The UK portion of the CCS would be composed of the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, but the United States had no equivalent body. The Joint Board&#x27;s lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.

As a counterpart to the UK&#x27;s Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better-coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America&#x27;s military effort, Admiral William D. Leahy proposed a &quot;unified high command&quot; in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Modeled on the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, the JCS&#x27; first formal meeting was held on February 9, 1942, to coordinate operations between War and Navy Departments. The official history of the Army Air Forces noted that although there was &quot;no official charter establishing this committee...by the end of February it had assumed responsibilities toward the American war effort comparable to the CCS on the combined level.&quot; On July 20, 1942, Admiral Leahy became the &quot;Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief&quot;, with all individual service chiefs operating under his authority.

The first members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were:

Each of the members of the original Joint Chiefs was a four-star flag or general officer in his service branch. By the end of the war each had been promoted: Leahy and King to fleet admiral; Marshall and Arnold to general of the Army. Arnold was later appointed to the grade of general of the Air Force.

One of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&#x27;s committees was the Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC). The JSSC, &quot;one of the most influential planning agencies in the wartime armed forces&quot;, was an extraordinary JCS committee that existed from 1942 until 1947. Members included Lieutenant General Stanley D. Embick, U.S. Army, chairman, 1942–1946, Vice Admiral Russell Willson, U.S. Navy, 1942–1945, Vice Admiral Theodore Stark Wilkinson, U.S. Navy, 1946, and Major General Muir S. Fairchild, U.S. Army Air Force, 1942–?.

===National Security Act of 1947===
With the end of World War II, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was officially established under the National Security Act of 1947. Per the National Security Act, the JCS consisted of a chairman, the chief of staff of the Army, the chief of staff of the Air Force (which was established as a separate service by the same Act), and the chief of naval operations. The commandant of the Marine Corps was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., Commandant in 1952–55, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General Louis H. Wilson, Jr. (1975–79), making the commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.

===Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986=== 
The position of vice chairman was created by the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman&#x27;s responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).

===Historic appointments and firings=== 
General Colin L. Powell (Chairman, 1989–1993) was the first African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff when he became the 12th Chairman of the JCS in 1989. General Charles Q. Brown Jr., the second African American to serve as chairman, was the first African American appointed to lead a service branch when he became the Chief of Staff of the Air Force in 2020. On May 25, 2023, President Joe Biden nominated General Brown to become the 21st Chairman of the JCS. General Brown was subsequently confirmed and took up the post of chairman on October 1, 2023. Controversially, he was later terminated by President Trump&#x27;s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on February 21, 2025, soon after Hegseth&#x27;s confirmation. 

General Richard B. Myers (Chairman, 2001–2005) was the first vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Peter Pace (Vice Chairman 2001–2005; Chairman, 2005–2007) was the first Marine to serve in either position. 

Admiral Lisa Franchetti became the first woman to serve on the JCS when she took over as Chief of Naval Operations on November 2, 2023. Like African American JCS chairman, General Charles Q. Brown Jr., Franchetti was also fired by Hegseth on February 21, 2025.

Both the firings of Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, Brown, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Franchetti, &quot;mark[ed] the first time that two members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been dismissed from their senior military roles&quot; since the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1947.

===National Defense Authorization Act of 2012===
A provision in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act added the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Guard historians called it the &quot;most significant development&quot; for the National Guard since the Militia Act of 1903.

=== National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 ===
The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act established the U.S. Space Force on December 20, 2019. The Space Force is headed by the chief of space operations, who reports directly to the secretary of the Air Force. Pursuant to , the chief of space operations became a statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on December 20, 2020.
==Organization and leadership positions==

===Chairman===

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is, by law, the highest-ranking military officer of the United States Armed Forces, and the principal military adviser to the president of the United States. He leads the meetings and coordinates the efforts of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, comprising the chairman, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of staff of the United States Army, the commandant of the United States Marine Corps, the chief of naval operations, the chief of staff of the United States Air Force, the Chief of Space Operations (statutory member after December 2020), and the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have offices in the Pentagon. The chairman outranks all service chiefs, but does not maintain authority over them, their branches or the Unified Combatant Commands. All combatant commanders receive their orders directly from the secretary of defense.

On July 20, 1942, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy became Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief (July 20, 1942 – March 21, 1949). He was not technically the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Leahy&#x27;s office was the precursor to the post of &quot;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff&quot;. That post was established and first held by General of the Army Omar Bradley in 1949.

The last chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff was General Charles Q. Brown Jr., who was controversially fired on February 21, 2025 by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The position is currently vacant.

===Vice Chairman===
The position of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was created by the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986. The vice chairman is a four-star-general or admiral and, by law, is the second highest-ranking member of the U.S. Armed Forces (after the chairman). In the absence of the chairman, the vice chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He may also perform such duties as the chairman may prescribe. It was not until the National Defense Authorization Act in 1992 that the position was made a full voting member of the JCS.

The current vice chairman is Admiral Christopher W. Grady, who began his tenure on December 20, 2021. Grady is also simultaneously acting chairman as of February 21, 2025, until a replacement for fired Gen. CQ Brown has been confirmed.

===Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman===

The senior enlisted advisor to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (SEAC) advises on all matters concerning joint and combined total force integration, utilization, development, and helps develop noncommissioned officers related joint professional education, enhance utilization of senior NCOs on joint battle staffs, and support the chairman&#x27;s responsibilities as directed.

Command Sergeant Major William Gainey, was the first SEAC, serving from October 1, 2005. The current SEAC is Troy E. Black, who was sworn in by General Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on November 3, 2023, replacing SEAC Ramón Colón-López.

==Joint Staff==
The Joint Staff (JS) is a military headquarters staff based at The Pentagon (with offices in Hampton Roads, Virginia; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Lackland Air Force Base, Texas; Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington and Fort McNair, District of Columbia) composed of personnel from all the six armed services, assisting the chairman and the vice chairman in discharging their responsibilities. They work closely with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the military department staffs, and the Combatant Command staffs.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) is assisted by the director of the Joint Staff (DJS), a three-star officer who assists the chairman with the management of the Joint Staff, an organization composed of approximately equal numbers of officers contributed by the Army, the Navy and Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Space Force, and the Coast Guard, who have been assigned to assist the chairman in providing to the secretary of defense unified strategic direction, operation, and integration of the combatant land, naval, space, and air forces. The director is assisted by the vice director of the Joint Staff, a two-star officer.

Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper tasked the Joint Staff with developing a Joint Warfighting Concept for the services by December 2020. Developing Joint all-domain command and control (JADC2) as a concept is a key goal of the 20th CJCS. An OSD/Joint Staff Cross-Functional Team for JADC2 is underway. Esper ordered the four services and the Joint Staff to create a new joint warfighting concept for All-domain operations, operating simultaneously in the air, land, sea, space, cyber, and the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The Joint Chiefs and Combatant Commanders witnessed demonstrations of the concept in September 2020.

<doc id="195336" wikidata="Q623066" url="?curid=195336" title="General Agreement on Trade in Services">
<text>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a treaty of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which entered into force in January 1995 as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations. The treaty was created to extend the multilateral trading system to service sector, in the same way the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provides such a system for merchandise trade.

All members of the WTO are parties to the GATS. The basic WTO principle of most favoured nation (MFN) applies to GATS as well. However, upon accession, members may introduce temporary exemptions to this rule.

The agreement aims to recognize the increasing importance of service trade for the growth and development of the global economy and to create a multilateral framework of principles and rules for trading services. The expansion of such trade is expected to be facilitated by market transparency and the progressive liberalization, promoting economic growth of all trading partners and particularly aiding the development of developing countries. The goals are to be achieved through successive rounds of further multilateral negotiations, explicitly aiming to increase the participation of developing countries in service trade and to expand their service exports. The agreement also makes a point of addressing the serious issues faced by the least developed countries given their economic situation and their needs in the areas of development, trade, and finance.

The European Community, in accordance with its competencies, has ratified the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations (1986–1994) and authorized the legal signing of the treaty establishing the World Trade Organization. This enabled GATS, included in Annex 1B of the Marrakesh Agreement, to come into effect across the European Community member states.

==Historical background==

While the overall goal of GATS is to remove barriers to trade, members are free to choose which sectors are to be progressively &quot;liberalised&quot; (i.e. marketised and privatised); which mode of supply would apply to a particular sector; and to what extent that &quot;liberalisation&quot; will occur over a given period of time. Members&#x27; commitments are governed by a ratchet effect: commitments are one-way and are not to be wound back once entered into. The reason for the rule is to create a stable trading climate (i.e. a market). However, Article XXI allows members to withdraw commitments, and so far two members have exercised the option (US and EU). In November 2008, Bolivia gave a notification that it will withdraw its health services commitments.

Some activist groups consider that GATS risks undermining the ability and authority of governments to regulate commercial activities within their own boundaries, with the effect of ceding power to business interests ahead of the interests of citizens. In 2003, the &quot;GATSwatch&quot; network published a critical statement supported by over 500 organisations in 60 countries. At the same time, countries are not under any obligation to enter international agreements such as GATS. For countries that like to attract trade and investment, GATS adds a measure of transparency and legal predictability. Legal obstacles to services trade can have legitimate policy reasons, but they can also be an effective tool for large scale corruption.

==Four modes of supply==
The GATS agreement covers four modes of supply for the delivery of services in cross-border trade:

==Sectors addressed==
Services sector classifications addressed in the GATS are defined in the so-called &quot;W/120 list&quot; or &quot;Services Sectoral Classification List&quot;, which provides a list of all sectors which can be negotiated under the agreement. The title refers to the name of the official WTO document, &quot;MTN.GNS/W/120&quot;. There are twelve service sectors (Business; Communication; Construction and Engineering; Distribution; Education; Environment; Financial; Health; Tourism and Travel; Recreation, Cultural, and Sporting; Transport; and &quot;Other&quot;) divided into sub-sectors.

The agreement&#x27;s &quot;Annex on Movement of Natural Persons Supplying Services Under the Agreement&quot; distinguishes the &quot;movement of natural persons&quot; for the provision of services from natural persons&#x27; movement aiming to secure access to an overseas employment market. Movement of natural persons for services purposes is seen as essentially &quot;temporary&quot;.

== Criticisms ==
The GATS agreement has been criticized for tending to substitute the authority of national legislation and judiciary with that of a GATS Disputes Panel conducting closed hearings. WTO member-government spokespersons are obliged to dismiss such criticism because of prior commitment to perceived benefits of prevailing commercial principles of competition and &#x27;liberalisation&#x27;.

While national governments have the option to exclude any specific service from liberalisation under GATS, they are also under pressure from international business interests to refrain from excluding any service &quot;provided on a commercial basis&quot;. Important public utilities such as water and electricity most commonly involve purchase by consumers and are thus demonstrably &quot;provided on a commercial basis&quot;. The same may be said of many health and education services which are sought to be &#x27;exported&#x27; by some countries as profitable industries.

This definition defines virtually any public service as being &quot;provided on a commercial basis&quot; and is already extending into such areas as police, the military, prisons, the justice system, public administration, and government. Over a fairly short time perspective, this could open up for the privatisation or marketisation of large parts, and possibly all, of what today are considered public services currently available for the whole population of a country as a social entitlement, to be restructured, marketised, contracted out to for-profit providers, and eventually fully privatised and available only to those who can pay for them. This process is currently far advanced in most countries, usually (and intentionally) without properly informing or consulting the public as to whether or not this is what they desire.

<doc id="195337" wikidata="Q199324" url="?curid=195337" title="Zigbee">
<text>Zigbee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs, designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection. Hence, Zigbee is a low-power, low-data-rate, and close proximity (i.e., personal area) wireless ad hoc network.

The technology defined by the Zigbee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or more general wireless networking such as Wi-Fi (or Li-Fi). Applications include wireless light switches, home energy monitors, traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.

Its low power consumption limits transmission distances to line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental characteristics. Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. Zigbee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking. (Zigbee networks are secured by 128-bit symmetric encryption keys.) Zigbee has a defined rate of up to , best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device.

Zigbee was conceived in 1998, standardized in 2003, and revised in 2006. The name refers to the waggle dance of honey bees after their return to the beehive.

== Overview ==

Zigbee is a low-power wireless mesh network standard targeted at battery-powered devices in wireless control and monitoring applications. Zigbee delivers low-latency communication. Zigbee chips are typically integrated with radios and with microcontrollers. 

Zigbee operates in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands, with the band being primarily used for lighting and home automation devices in most jurisdictions worldwide. While devices for commercial utility metering and medical device data collection often use &quot;sub-GHz&quot; frequencies, (902-928 MHz in North America, Australia, and Israel, 868-870 MHz in Europe, 779-787 MHz in China, even those regions and countries still using the 2.4 GHz for most globally sold Zigbee devices meant for home use. With data rates varying from around 20 kbit/s for sub-GHz bands to around 250 kbit/s for channels on the 2.4 GHz band range).

Zigbee builds on the physical layer and media access control defined in IEEE standard 802.15.4 for low-rate wireless personal area networks (WPANs). The specification includes four additional key components: network layer, application layer, &quot;&quot; (ZDOs) and manufacturer-defined application objects. ZDOs are responsible for some tasks, including keeping track of device roles, managing requests to join a network, and discovering and securing devices.

The Zigbee network layer natively supports both star and tree networks, and generic mesh networking. Every network must have one coordinator device. Within star networks, the coordinator must be the central node. Both trees and meshes allow the use of Zigbee routers to extend communication at the network level. Another defining feature of Zigbee is facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting the establishment and transport of cryptographic keys, ciphering frames, and controlling devices. It builds on the basic security framework defined in IEEE 802.15.4.

== History ==
Zigbee-style self-organizing ad hoc digital radio networks were conceived in the 1990s. The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Zigbee specification was ratified on December 14, 2004. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (formerly Zigbee Alliance) announced availability of Specification 1.0 on June 13, 2005, known as the &quot;ZigBee 2004 Specification&quot;.

=== Cluster library ===
In September 2006, the &quot;Zigbee 2006 Specification&quot; was announced, obsoleting the 2004 stack The 2006 specification replaces the message and key–value pair structure used in the 2004 stack with a &quot;cluster library&quot;. The library is a set of standardised commands, attributes and global artifacts organised under groups known as clusters with names such as Smart Energy, Home Automation, and .

In January 2017, Connectivity Standards Alliance renamed the library to &quot;Dotdot&quot; and announced it as a new protocol to be represented by an emoticon (&quot;||:&quot;)&quot;.&quot; They also announced it will now additionally run over other network types using Internet Protocol and will interconnect with other standards such as Thread. Since its unveiling, Dotdot has functioned as the default application layer for almost all Zigbee devices.

=== Zigbee Pro ===
Zigbee Pro, also known as Zigbee 2007, was finalized in 2007. A Zigbee Pro device may join and operate on a legacy Zigbee network and vice versa. Due to differences in routing options, a Zigbee Pro device must become a non-routing Zigbee End Device (ZED) on a legacy Zigbee network, and a legacy Zigbee device must become a ZED on a Zigbee Pro network. It operates using the 2.4 GHz ISM band, and adds a sub-GHz band.

== Use cases ==
Zigbee protocols are intended for embedded applications requiring low power consumption and tolerating low data rates. The resulting network will use very little power—individual devices must have a battery life of at least two years to pass certification.

Typical application areas include:
* Home automation
* Wireless sensor networks
* Industrial control systems
* Embedded sensing
* Medical data collection
* Smoke and intruder warning
* Building automation
* Remote wireless microphone configuration

Zigbee is not for situations with high mobility among nodes. Hence, it is not suitable for tactical ad hoc radio networks in the battlefield, where high data rate and high mobility is present and needed.

== Application profiles ==
The first Zigbee application profile, Home Automation, was announced November 2, 2007. Additional application profiles have since been published.

The specifications define an Internet Protocol-based communication protocol to monitor, control, inform, and automate the delivery and use of energy and water. It is an enhancement of the Zigbee Smart Energy version 1 specifications. It adds services for plug-in electric vehicle charging, installation, configuration and firmware download, prepay services, user information and messaging, load control, demand response and common information and application profile interfaces for wired and wireless networks. It is being developed by partners including:
* HomeGrid Forum responsible for marketing and certifying ITU-T G.hn technology and products
* HomePlug Powerline Alliance
* International Society of Automotive Engineers SAE International
* IPSO Alliance
* SunSpec Alliance
* Wi-Fi Alliance
Zigbee Smart Energy relies on Zigbee IP, a network layer that routes standard IPv6 traffic over IEEE 802.15.4 using 6LoWPAN header compression.

In 2009, the Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics Consortium (RF4CE) and Connectivity Standards Alliance (formerly Zigbee Alliance) agreed to deliver jointly a standard for radio frequency remote controls. Zigbee RF4CE is designed for a broad range of consumer electronics products, such as TVs and set-top boxes. It promised many advantages over existing remote control solutions, including richer communication and increased reliability, enhanced features and flexibility, interoperability, and no line-of-sight barrier. The Zigbee RF4CE specification uses a subset of Zigbee functionality allowing to run on smaller memory configurations in lower-cost devices, such as remote control of consumer electronics.

== Radio hardware ==
The radio design used by Zigbee has few analog stages and uses digital circuits wherever possible. Products that integrate the radio and microcontroller into a single module are available.

The Zigbee qualification process involves a full validation of the requirements of the physical layer. All radios derived from the same validated semiconductor mask set would enjoy the same RF characteristics. Zigbee radios have very tight constraints on power and bandwidth. An uncertified physical layer that malfunctions can increase the power consumption of other devices on a Zigbee network. Thus, radios are tested with guidance given by Clause 6 of the 802.15.4-2006 Standard.

This standard specifies operation in the unlicensed 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz (worldwide), 902 to 928 MHz (Americas and Australia) and 868 to 868.6 MHz (Europe) ISM bands. Sixteen channels are allocated in the 2.4 GHz band, spaced 5 MHz apart, though using only 2 MHz of bandwidth each. The radios use direct-sequence spread spectrum coding, which is managed by the digital stream into the modulator. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) is used in the 868 and 915 MHz bands, and offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) that transmits two bits per symbol is used in the 2.4 GHz band.

The raw, over-the-air data rate is 250 kbit/s per channel in the 2.4 GHz band, 40 kbit/s per channel in the 915 MHz band, and 20 kbit/s in the 868 MHz band. The actual data throughput will be less than the maximum specified bit rate because of the packet overhead and processing delays. For indoor applications at 2.4 GHz transmission distance is 10–20 m, depending on the construction materials, the number of walls to be penetrated and the output power permitted in that geographical location. The output power of the radios is generally 0–20 dBm (1–100 mW).

== Device types and operating modes ==
There are three classes of Zigbee devices:
* Zigbee coordinator (ZC): The most capable device, the coordinator forms the root of the network tree and may bridge to other networks. There is precisely one Zigbee coordinator in each network since it is the device that started the network originally (the Zigbee LightLink specification also allows operation without a Zigbee coordinator, making it more usable for off-the-shelf home products). It stores information about the network, including acting as the trust center and repository for security keys.
* Zigbee router (ZR): As well as running an application function, router devices can act as intermediate routers, passing data on to other devices. These types of Zigbee products are typically mains-powered so they are always available on the network. Zigbee Router devices are sometimes called Zigbee repeaters or Zigbee range extenders. 
* Zigbee end device (ZED): Contains just enough functionality to talk to the parent node (either the coordinator or a router); it cannot relay data from other devices. This relationship allows the node to be asleep a significant amount of the time thereby giving long battery life. These types of Zigbee device products are often battery-powered. A ZED requires the least amount of memory and thus can be less expensive to manufacture than a ZR or ZC.

The current Zigbee protocols support beacon-enabled and non-beacon-enabled networks.

In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, Zigbee routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring additional power. However, this allows for heterogeneous networks in which some devices receive continuously while others transmit when necessary. The typical example of a heterogeneous network is a wireless light switch: The Zigbee node at the lamp may constantly receive since it is reliably powered by the mains supply to the lamp, while a battery-powered light switch would remain asleep until the switch is thrown. In this case, the switch wakes up, sends a command to the lamp, receives an acknowledgment, and returns to sleep. In such a network the lamp node will be at least a Zigbee router, if not the Zigbee coordinator; the switch node is typically a Zigbee end device.

In beacon-enabled networks, Zigbee routers transmit periodic beacons to confirm their presence to other network nodes. Nodes may sleep between beacons, thus extending their battery life. Beacon intervals depend on data rate; they may range from 15.36 milliseconds to 251.65824 seconds at 250 kbit/s, from 24 milliseconds to 393.216 seconds at 40 kbit/s and from 48 milliseconds to 786.432 seconds at 20 kbit/s. Long beacon intervals require precise timing, which can be expensive to implement in low-cost products.

In general, the Zigbee protocols minimize the time the radio is on, so as to reduce power use. In beaconing networks, nodes only need to be active while a beacon is being transmitted. In non-beacon-enabled networks, power consumption is decidedly asymmetrical: Some devices are always active while others spend most of their time sleeping.

Except for Smart Energy Profile 2.0, Zigbee devices are required to conform to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Low-rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN) standard. The standard specifies the lower protocol layers—the physical layer (PHY), and the media access control portion of the data link layer. The basic channel access mode is carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). That is, the nodes communicate in a way somewhat analogous to how humans converse: a node briefly checks to see that other nodes are not talking before it starts. CSMA/CA is not used in three notable exceptions: 
* Message acknowledgments.
* Beacons are sent on a fixed-timing schedule.
* Devices in beacon-enabled networks that have low-latency, real-time requirements may also use guaranteed time slots.

=== Network layer ===
The main functions of the network layer are to ensure correct use of the MAC sublayer and provide a suitable interface for use by the next upper layer, namely the application layer. The network layer deals with network functions such as connecting, disconnecting, and setting up networks. It can establish a network, allocate addresses, and add and remove devices. This layer makes use of star, mesh and tree topologies.

The data entity of the transport layer creates and manages protocol data units at the direction of the application layer and performs routing according to the current topology. The control entity handles the configuration of new devices and establishes new networks. It can determine whether a neighboring device belongs to the network and discovers new neighbors and routers.

The routing protocol used by the network layer is AODV. To find a destination device, AODV is used to broadcast a route request to all of its neighbors. The neighbors then broadcast the request to their neighbors and onward until the destination is reached. Once the destination is reached, a route reply is sent via unicast transmission following the lowest cost path back to the source. Once the source receives the reply, it updates its routing table with the destination address of the next hop in the path and the associated path cost.

=== Application layer ===
The application layer is the highest-level layer defined by the specification and is the effective interface of the Zigbee system to its end users. It comprises the majority of components added by the Zigbee specification: both ZDO (Zigbee device object) and its management procedures, together with application objects defined by the manufacturer, are considered part of this layer. This layer binds tables, sends messages between bound devices, manages group addresses, reassembles packets, and transports data. It is responsible for providing service to Zigbee device profiles.

=== Main components ===
The &quot;ZDO&quot; (Zigbee device object), a protocol in the Zigbee protocol stack, is responsible for overall device management, security keys, and policies. It is responsible for defining the role of a device as either coordinator or end device, as mentioned above, but also for the discovery of new devices on the network and the identification of their offered services. It may then go on to establish secure links with external devices and reply to binding requests accordingly.

The application support sublayer (APS) is the other main standard component of the stack, and as such it offers a well-defined interface and control services. It works as a bridge between the network layer and the other elements of the application layer: it keeps up-to-date binding tables in the form of a database, which can be used to find appropriate devices depending on the services that are needed and those the different devices offer. As the union between both specified layers, it also routes messages across the layers of the protocol stack.

=== Communication models ===
An application may consist of communicating objects which cooperate to carry out the desired tasks. Tasks will typically be largely local to each device, such as the control of each household appliance. The focus of Zigbee is to distribute work among many different devices which reside within individual Zigbee nodes which in turn form a network.

The objects that form the network communicate using the facilities provided by APS, supervised by ZDO interfaces. Within a single device, up to 240 application objects can exist, numbered in the range 1–240. 0 is reserved for the ZDO data interface and 255 for broadcast; the 241-254 range is not currently in use but may be in the future.

Two services are available for application objects to use (in Zigbee 1.0):
* The &quot;key-value pair service&quot; (KVP) is meant for configuration purposes. It enables the description, request and modification of object attributes through a simple interface based on get, set and event primitives, some allowing a request for a response. Configuration uses XML.
* The &quot;message service&quot; is designed to offer a general approach to information treatment, avoiding the necessity to adapt application protocols and potential overhead incurred by KVP. It allows arbitrary payloads to be transmitted over APS frames.

Addressing is also part of the application layer. A network node consists of an IEEE 802.15.4-conformant radio transceiver and one or more device descriptions (collections of attributes that can be polled or set or can be monitored through events). The transceiver is the basis for addressing, and devices within a node are specified by an &quot;endpoint identifier&quot; in the range 1 to 240.

=== Communication and device discovery ===
For applications to communicate, the devices that support them must use a common application protocol (types of messages, formats and so on); these sets of conventions are grouped in &quot;profiles&quot;. Furthermore, binding is decided upon by matching input and output unique within the context of a given profile and associated to an incoming or outgoing data flow in a device. Binding tables contain source and destination pairs.

Depending on the available information, device discovery may follow different methods. When the network address is known, the IEEE address can be requested using unicast communication. When it is not, petitions are broadcast. End devices will simply respond with the requested address while a network coordinator or a router will also send the addresses of all the devices associated with it.

This permits external devices to find out about devices in a network and the services that they offer, which endpoints can report when queried by the discovering device (which has previously obtained their addresses). Matching services can also be used.

The use of cluster identifiers enforces the binding of complementary entities using the binding tables, which are maintained by Zigbee coordinators, as the table must always be available within a network and coordinators are most likely to have a permanent power supply. Backups, managed by higher-level layers, may be needed by some applications. Binding requires an established communication link; after it exists, whether to add a new node to the network is decided, according to the application and security policies.

Communication can happen right after the association. &quot;Direct addressing&quot; uses both radio address and endpoint identifier, whereas indirect addressing uses every relevant field (address, endpoint, cluster, and attribute) and requires that they are sent to the network coordinator, which maintains associations and translates requests for communication. Indirect addressing is particularly useful to keep some devices very simple and minimize their need for storage. Besides these two methods, &quot;broadcast&quot; to all endpoints in a device is available, and &quot;group addressing&quot; is used to communicate with groups of endpoints belonging to a specified set of devices.

== Security services ==
As one of its defining features, Zigbee provides facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting the establishment and transport of cryptographic keys and encrypting data. It builds on the basic security framework defined in IEEE 802.15.4.

=== Basic security model ===
The basic mechanism to ensure confidentiality is the adequate protection of all keying material. Keys are the cornerstone of the security architecture; as such their protection is of paramount importance, and keys are never supposed to be transported through an insecure channel. A momentary exception to this rule occurs during the initial phase of the addition to the network of a previously unconfigured device. Trust must be assumed in the initial installation of the keys, as well as in the processing of security information. The Zigbee network model must take particular care of security considerations, as ad hoc networks may be physically accessible to external devices. Also, the state of the working environment cannot be predicted.

Within the protocol stack, different network layers are not cryptographically separated, so access policies are needed, and conventional design assumed. The open trust model within a device allows for key sharing, which notably decreases potential cost. Nevertheless, the layer which creates a frame is responsible for its security. As malicious devices may exist, every network layer payload must be ciphered, so unauthorized traffic can be immediately cut off. The exception, again, is the transmission of the network key, which confers a unified security layer to the grid, to a new connecting device.

=== Security architecture ===
The Zigbee security architecture is based on CCM*, which adds encryption- and integrity-only features to CCM mode. Zigbee uses 128-bit keys to implement its security mechanisms. A key can be associated either to a network, being usable by Zigbee layers and the MAC sublayer, or to a link, acquired through pre-installation, agreement or transport. Establishment of link keys is based on a master key which controls link key correspondence. Ultimately, at least, the initial master key must be obtained through a secure medium (transport or pre-installation), as the security of the whole network depends on it. Link and master keys are only visible to the application layer. Different services use different one-way variations of the link key to avoid leaks and security risks.

Key distribution is one of the most important security functions of the network. A secure network will designate one special device, the &quot;trust center&quot;, which other devices trust for the distribution of security keys. Ideally, devices will have the trust center address and initial master key preloaded; if a momentary vulnerability is allowed, it will be sent as described above. Typical applications without special security needs will use a network key provided by the trust center (through the initially insecure channel) to communicate.

Thus, the trust center maintains both the network key and provides point-to-point security. Devices will only accept communications originating from a key supplied by the trust center, except for the initial master key. The security architecture is distributed among the network layers as follows:
* The MAC sublayer is capable of single-hop reliable communications. As a rule, the security level it uses is specified by the upper layers.
* The network layer manages routing, processing received messages and is capable of broadcasting requests. If available, outgoing frames use the appropriate link key according to the routing. Otherwise, the network key is used.
* The application layer offers key establishment and transport services to both ZDO and applications.

According to the German computer e-magazine &quot;Heise Online&quot;, Zigbee Home Automation 1.2 uses fallback keys for encryption negotiation which are known and cannot be changed. This makes the encryption highly vulnerable. The Zigbee 3.0 standard features improved security features and mitigates the aforementioned weakness by giving device manufacturers the option of using a custom installation key that is then shipped together with the device, thereby preventing the network traffic from ever using the fallback key altogether. This ensures that all network traffic is securely encrypted even while pairing the device. In addition, all Zigbee devices need to randomize their network key, no matter which pairing method they use, thereby improving security for older devices. The Zigbee coordinator within the Zigbee network can be set to deny access to devices that do not employ this key randomization, further increasing security. In addition, the Zigbee 3.0 protocol features countermeasures against removing already paired devices from the network with the intention of listening to the key exchange when re-pairing.

== Simulation ==
Network simulators, like ns-2, OMNeT++, OPNET, and NetSim can be used to simulate IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee networks. These simulators come with open source C or C++ libraries for users to modify. This way users can determine the validity of new algorithms before hardware implementation.

<text>Paderborn () is a Kreis (district) in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Gütersloh, Lippe, Höxter, Hochsauerland, and Soest.

==History==
Paderborn was part of the Bishopric of Paderborn until it was included into Prussia in 1802. After the Napoleonic wars when Prussia created the province Westphalia it also created five districts roughly covering the area of the previous state - Brakel, Büren, Höxter, Paderborn and Warburg. In 1975 Paderborn and Büren districts were merged to the current Paderborn district. At the same time the towns and municipalities in the district were merged to form today&#x27;s ten towns and municipalities. It is a rural district with urban municipalities.

==Geography==
The Paderborn district is located at the western slope of the Teutoburg Forest, west of the Eggegebirge. The highest elevation is on the side of the Totenkopf (498 m) at the district border near Bleiwäsche (Bad Wünnenberg), the lowest near Delbrück at 77 m. The main river in the district is the Lippe, which has its source in Bad Lippspringe.

==Coat of arms==
The red cross in chief of the coat of arms symbolizes the clerical state Paderborn, the historic precursor of today&#x27;s district. The wave line below stands for the rivers in the district, especially the Lippe River. The symbol in the field derives from the Lords of Büren.

<text>The Christian Classics Ethereal Library (CCEL) is a digital library that provides free electronic copies of Christian scripture and literature texts.

== Description ==

CCEL is a volunteer-based project founded and directed by Harry Plantinga, a professor of computer science at Calvin College. It was initiated at Wheaton College in 1993 and is currently supported by Calvin University. It includes Hymnary.org.

The purpose of the CCEL is &quot;To build up Christ&#x27;s church by making available classic Christian books and promoting their use.&quot; The documents in the library express a variety of theological views, sometimes conflicting with those of Calvin University.

CCEL stores texts in Theological Markup Language (ThML) format and automatically converts them into other formats such as HTML or Portable Document Format (PDF). Although they use mainly Public Domain texts, they claim copyright on all their formatting. Users must log into their website to download all formatted versions of the text.

CCEL is funded by online advertisements, sales of CD-ROMs (available from 1997 to 2019), sales of some books not freely downloadable, and individual gifts. Calvin University has also provided them with space, network access, and significant financial support.

As of 2006, the library was recording about 200,000 page views per day and providing about 2 TB of information (equivalent to over a million books) in a month.

A 2002 reviewer acknowledged that while the site is &quot;intended to be a basic online theological library,&quot; it was actually much more valuable than that: it is &quot;a treasure of primary sources for anyone teaching Western Civilization or more specialized courses in medieval or Reformation history.&quot; They also specifically noted that the ability to search the music &quot;for specific note patterns&quot; was valuable to musicologists.

As of 2005, the primary users of the library fell into three main categories. These are university professors and their students using texts from the library as required reading without running up the students&#x27; bill for textbooks, people preparing sermons and Bible studies, and those reading for individual edification.

<doc id="195346" wikidata="Q181811" url="?curid=195346" title="Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)">
<text>The Great Northern Railway (GNR) was a British railway company incorporated in 1846 with the object of building a line from London to York. It quickly saw that seizing control of territory was key to development, and it acquired, or took leases of, many local railways, whether actually built or not. In so doing, it overextended itself financially.

Nevertheless, it succeeded in reaching into the coalfields of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire, as well as establishing dominance in Lincolnshire and north London. Bringing coal south to London was dominant, but general agricultural business, and short- and long-distance passenger traffic, were important activities too. Its fast passenger express trains captured the public imagination, and its Chief Mechanical Engineer Nigel Gresley became a celebrity.

Anglo-Scottish travel on the East Coast Main Line became commercially important; the GNR controlled the line from London to Doncaster and allied itself with the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway so as to offer seamless travel facilities.

The main line railways of Great Britain were &quot;grouped&quot; following the Railways Act 1921 into one or other of four new larger concerns. The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the London and North Eastern Railway, which took control at the beginning of 1923. Although many local lines have been closed, much of the network is active today.

==Getting parliamentary authorisation==
In 1836, a railway to be called the Great Northern Railway was proposed. It was to run from Whitechapel in east London via Cambridge and Lincoln to York. However, this was a stupendously ambitious project for such an early date, and Parliament turned it down.

By 1844 there was only one trunk railway from London to the north of England: the London and Birmingham Railway was in an uneasy alliance with the Grand Junction Railway, which in turn connected with the North Union Railway which connected to Preston and Fleetwood. Scottish travellers made use of a steamer service from Fleetwood to Ardrossan.

This was the period of the Railway Mania, when myriad schemes, not all of them realistic, were promoted, and anyone could get rich quickly if they were not caught with a failed scheme. At this time George Hudson, a railway financier, was exceptionally skilled in promoting railways and having them built, and most particularly of neutralising or destroying any opposition or competition to his lines. His methods were not always respectable.

Some promoters wanted to build a railway from London to York, and after much negotiation with promoters of other lines that might connect or compete, a London and York Railway was submitted to the 1845 session of Parliament. There were 224 railway bills in that session, and the Board of Trade was instructed to set up a committee to assess groups of proposed lines; the committee became known as the Five Kings. When the London and York Railway scheme came before the parliamentary committees, Hudson set up such a protracted series of objections that the project ran out of parliamentary time in that session.
The London and York Railway scheme was submitted to the 1846 session of Parliament; some other schemes for railways to the north had by now fallen by the wayside, and their supporters joined the London and York project; reflecting that, the proposed company name was altered to the &quot;Great Northern Railway&quot;. George Hudson continued to use his dubious methods to frustrate the scheme, but on 26 June the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. lxxi) was given royal assent. Numerous branches earlier proposed had been deleted, but the main line was approved. Authorised capital was £5.6 million. The company had spent £590,355 on parliamentary expenses.

The authorised line was from London (&quot;Pentonville&quot;) via Huntingdon, Peterborough, Grantham, Retford, Doncaster and Selby to a junction with the Great North of England Railway, just south of York Station. Also included in the act was a loop from Werrington Junction, north of Peterborough, via Spalding to Boston, Lincoln to Gainsborough and back on to the main line at Bawtry.

Land acquisition proved to be difficult; in particular, the King&#x27;s Cross site was occupied by a smallpox hospital. The freeholder demanded an impossibly large price to vacate, and the matter had to go before a jury. This, and the subsequent removal of the hospital to new premises, would incur a huge delay. The GNR board decided to make a temporary London terminal at Maiden Lane.
The company undertook some extraordinary commitments at this time. It arranged to purchase the Stamford and Spalding Railway; this would form a loop from north of Peterborough back on to the GNR Loop Line near Crowland; and leases at 6% of the Royston and Hitchin Railway, the East Lincolnshire Railway (Boston to Great Grimsby; both authorised, but neither yet built) and the Boston, Stamford and Birmingham Railway (never built). It also took about a third-of-a-million-pounds-worth of shares in the South Yorkshire Railway.

==Getting started==
1846 was a peak year for railway scheme authorisations, fuelled by the feverish hunt for quick riches in railway shares. For a number of reasons, not all connected with railways, there was a massive slump in the following year, and investment money, especially for railway projects already authorised, became almost impossible to get.

The Great Northern Railway directors had a dauntingly large railway network to build, and they had to prioritise the parts of their authorised network which they would start to construct. In the second half of 1847, the directors,

owing to the state of the Money Market... decided to abstain from letting the works from Doncaster to York. But at the end of July a further small contract was let to Messrs. Peto &amp; Betts for the works from ... Doncaster, northwards to Askern, with the object of forming an &quot;end-on&quot; junction there with the branch of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company, over which... the Great Northern had just obtained power to run its trains to Wakefield and to Methley on the way to Leeds.

The directors decided to build the Loop Line first, as that was the easiest to complete in order to start earning income.

==Construction==
The first portion of the Great Northern Railway was opened on 1 March 1848. It was actually on the leased East Lincolnshire Railway line, from Great Grimsby to Louth. Five trains ran each way every weekday, and on from Grimsby to New Holland on the River Humber, by alliance with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. This was followed by the opening from Louth to Firsby on 3 September 1848. On 2 October 1848, the line was opened from Firsby to a temporary station at Boston.

The GNR opened a section of its own line from Stockbridge and Askern, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway opened from Knottingley. There was a formal opening on 5 June 1848 and a public opening two days later; at that stage the L&amp;YR operated the passenger trains. On 5 August 1848 the GNR section was extended south to a temporary Doncaster station, and a goods service was operated.

Part of the Loop Line was soon ready, and 58 miles from Walton Junction (near Peterborough, on the newly opened Midland Railway) to Lincoln opened on 17 October 1848. The line was double except for a mile at Boston, which was made double track by a deviation on 11 May 1850.

Captain Wynne viewed the line from Lincoln to Gainsborough on 29 March 1849, but refused permission to open until signals were provided at the swing bridge at Brayford Mere (Lincoln); the line opened on 9 April 1849 when they had been provided. The route made a junction with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Gainsborough; GNR trains reversed at the junction and used the MS&amp;LR station at Gainsborough. A junction was made with the MS&amp;LR line at Durham Ox Junction, Lincoln, some time after 3 April 1848, and sanctioned by Parliament retrospectively.

The direct line between Peterborough and Doncaster was known as the Towns Line. The first part of it was opened between the MS&amp;LR station at Retford and Doncaster on 4 September 1849. A proper station at Doncaster was built and ready by the middle of 1851.

By this means, the GNR was able to start a service between London and Leeds using running powers and agreements over other lines in a roundabout routing northward from Retford; George Hudson tried to repudiate his earlier undertaking to permit this, but at this time his disgraceful methods had come to light, and he had resigned from the Midland Railway and several other boards; the train service started on 1 October 1848.

The York and North Midland Railway was urging the GNR to use the Y&amp;NMR line from Knottingley to York, shortly to be opened, and to abandon the GNR&#x27;s plans for its own line to York. After considerable deliberation, the GNR agreed to this on 6 June 1850.

By arrangement with the MS&amp;LR the GNR started running trains between Lincoln and Sheffield on 7 August 1850; the trains were routed over the MS&amp;LR from Sykes Junction, a few miles north of Lincoln.

==London opening at last==
The London (Maiden Lane) to Peterborough line was ready for a demonstration opening run on 5 August 1850, and it was opened to the public on 7 August 1850; eight passenger trains were run each way daily, with three on Sundays. On 8 August 1850 trains started running through from London to York. The Maiden Lane terminal was referred to by the company as &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot;. A through train to Edinburgh was run from 2 September 1850; the train ran via Peterborough, Boston, Lincoln, Retford, Doncaster, Knottingley, Milford Junction and York, thence by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway (not yet open on a direct route).

Goods traffic started on the main line from 12 December 1850, and the Hitchin to Royston line was opened on 21 October 1850; this was extended to Shepreth on 3 August 1851. Captain Mark Huish had been appointed General Manager of the London and North Western Railway on its formation in 1846. Huish was a skilful railway diplomat, and while his methods were generally more proper than Hudson&#x27;s, they were aggressive in finding means of disadvantaging competitors, such as the GNR.

From the outset the Great Northern Railway had been anxious to acquire local railways or at least make arrangements with them, in order to expand the company&#x27;s territory. In 1852 the shareholders expressed their displeasure at the volume of financial commitments implied by these, but the Chairman Edmund Denison continued his policy, without showing his hand.

==Opening of the Towns Line==
The company had prioritised construction of the Loop Line via Lincoln at the expense of the so-called Towns Line, the direct line from Peterborough to Doncaster. When this work was pressed forward, a number of difficulties presented themselves, including failure of a contractor. However, the line opened for goods traffic on 15 July 1852, and for passengers on 1 August 1851. The Towns Line ran from Werrington Junction north of Peterborough to Retford, where the MS&amp;LR connected by a spur, known as the Lincoln Curve. There were flat crossings at Newark with the Midland Railway and at Retford with the MS&amp;LR main line. A south to west curve was laid in at Retford, enabling a GNR service to Sheffield.

==Reaching Nottingham==

The Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway had been formed to connect the manufacturing districts of Manchester with the port of Boston, and had opened in 1850 between Colwick Junction, near Nottingham, and a temporary station at Grantham. It now connected into the GNR at Grantham, opening the connection on 2 August 1852; it was worked by the GNR. The Ambergate company relied on running powers into the Midland Railway station at Nottingham, but there were considerable disputes about the matter for many years, and the GNR had difficulty in getting access.

To resolve the situation the Ambergate company built its own line into a separate terminal at London Road, Nottingham. This opened on 3 October 1857. The GNR leased the Ambergate company from 1 August 1861.

==King&#x27;s Cross station==

On 14 October 1852 King&#x27;s Cross station was at last brought into use, and the Maiden Lane temporary station was closed. King&#x27;s Cross had two large sheds, familiar to the present day, but only two passenger platforms, the later platforms 1 and 8. The intervening space was occupied by carriage sidings.

==Completion of the first phase==
At the end of 1852 it was considered that the company had achieved its objectives as originally conceived, with the line opened from King&#x27;s Cross over both the Towns Line and the Loop, into Yorkshire. Four passenger trains ran from Kings Cross to York, one of them first class only and one parliamentary train.

The directors of the company continued to seek to consolidate occupation of territory, without necessarily building new lines. The capitalisation of the company was already considerable, and a further million of money was authorised by an act of 1853. Another demand on financial resources was willingly undertaken: the installation of the electric telegraph, at first at the southern end of the system. It was soon used for signalling trains through the tunnel sections, and by 1856 it was used throughout as far north as Hitchin.
Reflecting the anticipated focus of operations, the GNR opened a new locomotive works at Doncaster in 1853, replacing earlier facilities at Boston.

==Into Yorkshire==
===York main line===
The authorised network of the GNR had included the line from Doncaster to York. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was building from Knottingley to a junction at Askern, near the present-day Shaftholme Junction north of Doncaster, and mutual running powers had been agreed. The line was opened to the public on 6 June 1848, between Knottingley and Askern. This was extended on 7 June 1848 over the GNR to Stockbridge, a place on the Bentley Road between Askern and Doncaster. The GNR stretch amounted to 2 miles 45 chains. Stockbridge was later renamed Arksey. The GNR further extended southwards to a temporary station immediately north of the River Don at Doncaster; it opened on the following 5 August in time for the St Leger race meeting.

===West Yorkshire===
It was a priority for the GNR to get access to the great manufacturing towns of West Yorkshire, to which it had been denied its own connection in Parliament. Leeds was the first to be reached.

A Central station at Leeds was authorised on 22 July 1848. It was joint with three other companies, and GNR trains first reached it on 1 October 1848. GNR trains ran from Doncaster to Leeds over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (between Askern Junction and Methley), and the Midland Railway (between Methley and Leeds). On reaching Leeds the trains ran forward onto the Leeds and Thirsk Railway, and then reversed into the central station at Leeds.

The South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway opened its line from Doncaster to Barnsley on 1 January 1851. The GNR had running powers over the line, and started running passenger trains to Barnsley, and mineral trains to and from Horbury.

On 1 August 1854, the independent Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway (LB&amp;HJR) opened its line between Leeds and Bowling Junction, close to Bradford, where it made a connection with the L&amp;YR. The LB&amp;HJR had running powers over the L&amp;YR to Halifax, and the GNR were granted running powers over this line, so the GNR got access to Bradford and Halifax.

Another independent railway, the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway opened its line between Wakefield (the present-day Kirkgate station) and junctions near Leeds, on 3 October 1857. The GNR and the L&amp;YR had running powers over the new line, and this enabled the Great Northern Company to route its Doncaster to Leeds trains by this route, using the L&amp;YR from Askern to Wakefield. The junctions near Leeds were with the LB&amp;HJR at Wortley, forming a triangle and enabling through running towards either Leeds or Bradford. This development allowed the GNR to avoid using the hostile Midland Railway track at all, and allowed a direct entry to Leeds Central station, avoiding the awkward reversal on the Thirsk line.

A week after the opening of the BW&amp;LR, on 10 October 1857, the LB&amp;HJR opened a direct line from Ardsley on the BW&amp;LR to Laisterdyke, near Bradford. This was an extension of its Gildersome mineral line; although steeply graded this formed an additional through route for GNR trains.

Both the LB&amp;HJR and the BW&amp;LR constructed (or obtained approval to construct) some branches within their area of influence. There were branches to Batley, opened by each company separately in 1864. Perhaps more significant was the decision to connect to the L&amp;YR station at Bradford (later Bradford Exchange). The LB&amp;HJR station was a terminus, called Adolphus Street, and the connection towards Halifax by-passed it. A new curve was built of that connecting line to allow trains to enter the L&amp;YR terminus; this started on 7 January 1867. Train movements at the throat of the L&amp;YR station were frequent, and congestion became a problem.

In 1863 the BW&amp;LR changed its title to the West Yorkshire Railway, and in that year both it and the LB&amp;HJR agreed to be absorbed by the GNR; this was authorised by an act of Parliament in 1865.

The GNR was therefore able to consolidate a substantial network in West Yorkshire, bringing Wakefield, Leeds, Bradford and Halifax into its area of influence. However, trains from Doncaster still had to rely on running powers over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway between Askern Junction and Wakefield. The solution was on the horizon, when the West Riding and Grimsby Railway opened its line between Wakefield and Doncaster. It was to make an eastward branch to Thorne, justifying the Grimsby reference in its title. It opened its line on 1 February 1866 and on the same day the hitherto independent concern became the joint property of the GNR and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Now at last the GNR had the line it sought.

===Sheffield===
On 1 January 1847 the Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway came into existence by the merger of some smaller lines. The GNR had been granted running powers from Retford to Sheffield and in 1850 it informed the MS&amp;LR that it was to run passenger trains from Lincoln from 7 August 1849. The GNR was not made welcome at Sheffield, but a change of policy from 1856 brought some changes. In particular from 1 August 1857 the GNR &quot;Manchester fliers&quot; started running. They were worked by GNR locomotives through to Sheffield, and covered the 203 miles (325 km) from King&#x27;s Cross to Manchester London Road via Sheffield in 5hr 20min, soon to be cut to an even five hours. Until February 1859 the GNR paid £1,500 per annum for the use of Victoria, but then made an outright payment of £25,000 to secure permanent half-rights to the station.

From 1859 GNR trains also ran to Huddersfield via Sheffield and Penistone.

===Halifax and the Queensbury lines===

From 1866 the Great Northern Railway had the control it wanted in West Yorkshire. A number of additional branches were built; perhaps the most important was the Dewsbury branch. A Dewsbury terminus opened in 1874, but this was followed by a through line to Batley via a new Dewsbury through station, opened in 1880.

From 1867, the GNR launched into an expensive and ultimately unremunerative entry into the hilly terrain west of Bradford and north of Halifax. This started with the Halifax and Ovenden Junction Railway, a short line in the northern heights of Halifax, opened in 1874, jointly with the L&amp;YR. This was followed by the Bradford and Thornton Railway and the associated Halifax, Thornton and Keighley Railway. These were built by the GNR at huge expense, with daunting engineering features. They opened progressively from 1876 to 1884.

===Pudsey===
A loop line through Pudsey from Bramley to Laisterdyke was created, opening in 1893, as an extension of an earlier dead end line.

==Lincolnshire==
In 1848 the East Lincolnshire Line (leased from the East Lincolnshire Railway) was opened, as was the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s own route from Peterborough (Werrington Junction) via Spalding and Boston to Lincoln. The GNR had decided not to build the authorised line from Lincoln to Bawtry, for its intended Bawtry-to-Sheffield branch had been cut out of the authorising act. The GNR extended to Gainsborough, but was unable for some years to get authorisation for a different approach to Doncaster from there to Rossington. In the meantime, the GNR used the MS&amp;LR line from Gainsborough to Retford.

The Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway opened from near Grantham to Sleaford in June 1857, and on to Boston in April 1859. The GNR acquired that company in 1864, and that completed a through west-to-east route from Nottingham to Boston.

For some years the GNR avoided building numerous branch lines within the territory it had secured in Lincolnshire, but a series of independent branches were built, and many of these turned to the GNR for financial help. Most notable among these were the seaside branches, of Skegness (opened in 1873), Mablethorpe (1877) and Sutton on Sea (1886). These resorts generated very considerable traffic, much of it day-trip traffic from the Midlands industrial towns.

In later years, the GNR itself built some branch lines. In many cases these were built through sparsely populated agricultural terrain, and little commercial development followed. The large Lincolnshire towns of Louth, Boston and Lincoln also failed to develop greatly.

The Lincolnshire lines in general declined steadily from the 1930s onwards, and the process culminated in a major closure programme in 1970, after which only the Nottingham - Grantham - Boston - Skegness line and the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Line between Spalding and Doncaster via Lincoln (together with the GNR Peterborough to Spalding line) remained open among the GNR routes.

==Hertfordshire branches==
In the same parliamentary session as the authorisation of the Great Northern Railway itself, the &quot;Royston and Hitchin Railway&quot; was authorised. The GNR encouraged it, hoping it would provide a springboard for a connection to Cambridge. The R&amp;HR opened in 1850, continuing to Shepreth in 1851. The Eastern Counties Railway opened a line from a junction near Cambridge to Shepreth in 1852, and the line from Hitchin to Cambridge was worked on a lease basis as a single entity.

The R&amp;HR was acquired by the GNR in 1897, but the Cambridge end of the line, from Shepreth, remained in Great Eastern Railway (as successor to the ECR) hands until the Grouping of 1923. The line was electrified throughout in 1987 and forms an important passenger corridor.

The &quot;Hertford and Welwyn Junction Railway&quot; opened in 1858; it was operated jointly by the GNR and the Eastern Counties Railway. It gave access to the London docks over the Eastern Counties line. This developed into the formation of the &quot;Hertford, Luton and Dunstable Railway&quot; of 1860, which connected with the GNR at Hatfield, and the company was acquired by the GNR in 1861.

The London and North Western Railway opened a branch line from Watford to St Albans in 1858. Independent promoters supported by the GNR obtained powers to make a branch from Hatfield to the LNWR station; it opened in 1865, worked by the GNR, which absorbed the St Albans company in 1883.

==Midland Railway at Hitchin==
George Hudson&#x27;s Midland Railway was progressing south from its original base in Derby; for tactical reasons it proposed to reach London over the GNR from Hitchin, by building a line from Leicester via Bedford. This opened in 1857 and through passenger trains from the Midland Railway system to King&#x27;s Cross started on 1 February 1858.

The Midland Railway later built its own line from Leicester to St Pancras, opening in 1867 (goods) and 1868; from that time the line between Bedford and Hitchin became a branch line of the MR.

==Cheshire Lines Committee==

In 1863 the Great Northern Railway made an agreement with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway regarding the joint management of four railways in Cheshire; this was ratified by the Great Northern Railway (Cheshire Lines) Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxlvii) of 13 July. This was followed by joint construction in Liverpool and Manchester, and later Chester. The GNR had access to the Cheshire Lines over the MS&amp;LR from Retford. The Midland Railway later joined the partnership, and the Cheshire Lines Committee continued as a management entity until nationalisation at the end of 1947.

==East Coast collaboration==
The GNR&#x27;s role in the establishment of an Anglo-Scottish East Coast route was confirmed by establishment of the East Coast Joint Stock in 1860, whereby a common pool of passenger vehicles was operated by the GNR, the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway. The main express trains were the 10am departures from King&#x27;s Cross and Edinburgh, which began running in June 1862. By the 1870s these trains were known as the &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;.

==City Widened Lines==

On 1 October 1863, the GNR began a shuttle service from King&#x27;s Cross to Farringdon Street via the City Widened Lines, but through suburban services did not use this line until 1 March 1868, and then were extended to Moorgate Street on 1 June 1869.

==Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway==

On 1 August 1866, the GNR made an agreement with the Midland to jointly work the Eastern &amp; Midland Railway, comprising a line from Bourne to King&#x27;s Lynn via Spalding. The GNR gave the Midland running powers from Stamford to Bourne via Essendine in return for the Midland dropping a proposed line from Saxby to Bourne.

The main line of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway ran from Peterborough to Great Yarmouth via South Lynn (with running powers to King&#x27;s Lynn) and Melton Constable. Branches ran from Sutton Bridge to the Midland Railway near Little Bytham, from Melton Constable to Cromer, and from Melton Constable to Norwich.

In addition, the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway was a joint line owned by the M&amp;GNR and the Great Eastern Railway. This ran between Cromer and North Walsham and between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft.

==Highgate lines in North London==
The Edgware, Highgate and London Railway was authorised independently in 1862 to build a suburban line from Seven Sisters Road (renamed Finsbury Park in 1869) to Highgate and Edgware. Before opening, branches to Muswell Hill and High Barnet were authorised too. The Edgware main line was opened on 22 August 1867, by which time the GNR had taken over the company. The High Barnet branch opened in 1872, and greater population growth caused it to become the main line. The dominant business was residential travel, and the southern terminals used included Blackfriars, Loughborough Road, and later Moorgate and Broad Street.

The Muswell Hill Estate and Railways Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. ccxc) of 30 July authorised the Muswell Hill and Palace Railway from near Highgate station to Alexandra Palace; it opened on 24 May 1873, the same day as Alexandra Palace itself. On 9 June 1873 the Alexandra Palace was totally destroyed by fire. The Muswell Hill and Palace Railway was taken over by the GNR in 1911.

The Highgate lines became overwhelmed with passenger business, which encouraged the development of the Underground (urban rapid transit) network, and the Edgware trains were diverted to what became the Northern line of the London Passenger Transport Board.

Passenger services between Edgware and Finchley Central were terminated at the outbreak of the Second World War, and the majority of the residual passenger services were transferred to the London Underground network. In 1954 the Alexandra Palace line discontinued passenger operation. Some special train movements continued on the Highgate line until 1970.

==Profitability and investment==
The GNR was most profitable in 1873, running a more intensive service of express trains than either the LNWR or the MR. Hauled by Patrick Stirling&#x27;s single-driving-wheel locomotives, its trains were some of the fastest in the world.

However, in 1875, the increase in revenue was outpaced by investment, which included items such as block signalling systems and interlocking, and improvements to stations and goods sidings.

==Derbyshire and Staffordshire==

Frustrated by Midland Railway obstruction of GNR access to coal traffic, the GNR decided to build its own line from Colwick, east of Nottingham, through to the Derbyshire coalfields. The line circled round the north of Nottingham and then west to Kimberley, before it struck north to Pinxton, in the Erewash Valley, opening in 1875, followed by a westward line through Derby and on from there to a junction with the North Staffordshire Railway at Egginton, giving access to Burton-on-Trent. This line opened in 1878.

The terrain crossed at the Nottingham end of the line was exceptionally difficult, and costly, but it undoubtedly paid off, as lucrative coal traffic expanded enormously. Colwick was made a distribution and marshalling centre for the GNR&#x27;s Derbyshire colliery traffic. A large group of sorting sidings were installed, and engine shed and wagon repair facilities; the Colwick yard was expanded repeatedly over later years, eventually having a capacity for 6,000 vehicles. The GNR had given the London and North Western Railway running powers over the Derbyshire lines, and this proved extremely profitable for the LNWR, which made a connection over the Great Northern and LNWR joint line.

By contrast the line beyond Derby was agricultural, and correspondingly more moderate commercially, but through freight on the line towards Burton was considerable. The construction of the line through Derby caused considerable demolition of housing, but the station was more central than the Midland station.

Not far from Egginton, near the western extremity of the line, was the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway. The GNR purchased the S&amp;UR for £100,000 in 1882; it was a moribund company, and the purchase was not advantageous.

Road competition hit the part of the extension line west of Derby, and in 1939 the passenger service was withdrawn because of the war emergency.

Coalowners in the Leen Valley petitioned the GNR for a line in their area, as they were dissatisfied with the service offered by the monopoly Midland Railway. The Leen Valley line was opened from Bulwell to Annesley in 1881, soon conveying extraordinary volumes of coal. Pits further north wanted a connection too, and this was supplied by the Leen Valley Extension line, opened from 1898.

==Strikes and losses==
The early 1880s began badly for the GNR for a number of reasons: Coal strikes and poor harvests reduced income from goods traffic. Floods forced the complete closure of the Spalding to Bourne line from 9 October 1880 until 1 February 1881, this was a Midland &amp; Eastern line worked by the GNR, and the GNR found themselves paying the lease on a line they could derive no revenue from; and worst of all, Sutton Bridge Docks opened on 14 May 1881, into which the GNR had invested £55,000, but within a few days the docks began to subside due to being built on unstable ground. The engineers could find no remedy and the investment was written off.

==Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway==
Throughout the 1870s the Great Eastern Railway made attempts to get access to the coalfields of the East Midlands and Yorkshire. The Great Northern Railway consistently resisted this in Parliament, but finally decided that it was only a matter of time before the GER got what it wanted. The outcome was a joint parliamentary bill, which obtained royal assent on 3 July as the Great Northern and Great Eastern Railway Companies Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. cx). Existing GNR lines from near Doncaster to Lincoln, and from Spalding to March would be transferred to Joint ownership, as would the GER lines from Huntingdon to St Ives, and from St Ives to March. A new line was to be built from Spalding to Lincoln, and a joint committee was to be established to manage the line; it was not to be a corporate entity.

The Spalding to Lincoln line opened in 1882. The GER got the coalfield access it wanted. The GNR had a line which in part relieved the main line, although the Spalding–March–Huntingdon section was hardly suitable for running mineral trains in any quantity. Lord Colville, chairman of the GNR, said that it was better to have half the receipts of a joint line than to have to compete with a new entirely foreign through line.

==GN and LNW Joint Line, and the Leicester branch==
After some false starts, the GNR and the London and North Western Railway were authorised by the Great Northern and London and North Western Railways (Joint Powers and New Lines) Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. clvii) to build railways in Leicestershire. These became the GN and LNWR Joint Line from Bottesford (on the Grantham to Nottingham line), to Market Harborough. The act also authorised two sections of GNR new line: from Newark to Bottesford (opened in 1878) and from Marefield (near the southern end of the joint line) to Leicester (opened in 1882). The joint line itself opened in stages between 1879 and 1883.

The LNWR did well from the joint line, getting access to the Nottinghamshire coalfield formerly in the hands of the GNR alone; and when the Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension was ready, they got even better access. The advantage to the GNR was much less; the joint line was never busy, and passenger traffic at the GNR Leicester station was disappointing.

==Quadrupling in the south==

Widening of the London end of the main line was completed in the 1890s.

==Enfield Railway and the Hertford Loop==
Work started in 1905 to extend the Enfield Branch Railway in order to relieve congestion on the East Coast Main Line. Cuffley was reached on 4 April 1910, but construction of two major viaducts and the Ponsbourne Tunnel combined with wartime shortages of men and materials, delayed the opening of the route to Stevenage until 4 March 1918 for goods services. The line finally opened to passengers on 2 June 1924 as the Hertford Loop Line.

==First World War==

During World War I, economies were made, beginning on 22 February 1915 with a general reduction of train services. Passenger trains generally become fewer, but longer. An agreement was reached with the Great Central Railway and the Great Eastern Railway regarding the common use of wagons. Further economies were made in 1916 when the Nottingham to Daybrook and Peterborough to Leicester passenger services were withdrawn; they were never reinstated.

==1920s==
Under the 1923 Grouping, the Great Northern became part of the London and North Eastern Railway.

==Train services==
The GNR operated services from London King&#x27;s Cross to York together with many secondary lines and branches. The Great Northern was a partner (with the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway) in the East Coast Joint Stock operation from 1860.

The GNR was a considerable user of slip coaches when this was fashionable. Stamford had four slips per day, either at Essendine or Peterborough. The 5.30 pm from Kings Cross had slips at Huntingdon, Peterborough, Newark and Worksop. The company went to great pains to enable people to stay in their carriages; at one time around 1905 two carriages were taken off a train from the North at Kings Cross and sent by way of York Road and the Metropolitan Railway and SE &amp; CR to Clapham Junction, where, attached to some LNWR carriages, they were worked forward to Weymouth by the London and South Western Railway.

==Accidents==
* On 21 January 1876, an express passenger train ran into the rear of a freight train at , Huntingdonshire, when signals became frozen in the &quot;clear&quot; position during a blizzard. Thirteen people were killed and 59 were injured.
*On 14 April 1876, an express train ran into the rear of a mail train at Corby, Northamptonshire, when signals froze in the &quot;clear&quot; position during a blizzard.
*On 23 December 1876, an express train overran signals and collided with a number of wagons at Arlesey Sidings, Bedfordshire. Six people were killed.
*On 7 March 1896, a passenger train derailed at Little Bytham, Lincolnshire, when a speed restriction was removed prematurely after track renewal. Two people were killed.
* On 19 September 1906, a sleeping-car train derailed at , Lincolnshire, when it passed signals at danger and ran through the station at excessive speed. Fourteen people were killed and seventeen were injured.

<text>In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix (, ) of a vector-valued function of several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. When this matrix is square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as input as the number of vector components of its output, its determinant is referred to as the Jacobian determinant. Both the matrix and (if applicable) the determinant are often referred to simply as the Jacobian in literature. They are named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.

== Motivation ==
The Jacobian can be understood by considering a unit area in the new coordinate space; and examining how that unit area transforms when mapped into xy coordinate space in which the integral is visually understood. The process involves taking partial derivatives with respect to the new coordinates, then applying the determinant and hence obtaining the Jacobian.

== Definition ==
Suppose is a function such that each of its first-order partial derivatives exists on . This function takes a point as input and produces the vector as output. Then the Jacobian matrix of , denoted , is defined such that its entry is formula_1, or explicitly 
formula_2 where formula_3 is the transpose (row vector) of the gradient of the formula_4-th component.

The Jacobian matrix, whose entries are functions of , is denoted in various ways; other common notations include , formula_5, and formula_6. Some authors define the Jacobian as the transpose of the form given above.

The Jacobian matrix represents the differential of at every point where is differentiable. In detail, if is a displacement vector represented by a column matrix, the matrix product is another displacement vector, that is the best linear approximation of the change of in a neighborhood of , if is differentiable at . This means that the function that maps to is the best linear approximation of for all points close to . The linear map is known as the &quot;derivative&quot; or the &quot;differential&quot; of at .

When , the Jacobian matrix is square, so its determinant is a well-defined function of , known as the Jacobian determinant of . It carries important information about the local behavior of . In particular, the function has a differentiable inverse function in a neighborhood of a point if and only if the Jacobian determinant is nonzero at (see inverse function theorem for an explanation of this and Jacobian conjecture for a related problem of &quot;global&quot; invertibility). The Jacobian determinant also appears when changing the variables in multiple integrals (see substitution rule for multiple variables).

When , that is when is a scalar-valued function, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the row vector formula_7; this row vector of all first-order partial derivatives of is the transpose of the gradient of , i.e.
formula_8. Specializing further, when , that is when is a scalar-valued function of a single variable, the Jacobian matrix has a single entry; this entry is the derivative of the function .

These concepts are named after the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804–1851).

== Jacobian matrix ==

The Jacobian of a vector-valued function in several variables generalizes the gradient of a scalar-valued function in several variables, which in turn generalizes the derivative of a scalar-valued function of a single variable. In other words, the Jacobian matrix of a scalar-valued function in several variables is (the transpose of) its gradient and the gradient of a scalar-valued function of a single variable is its derivative.

At each point where a function is differentiable, its Jacobian matrix can also be thought of as describing the amount of &quot;stretching&quot;, &quot;rotating&quot; or &quot;transforming&quot; that the function imposes locally near that point. For example, if is used to smoothly transform an image, the Jacobian matrix , describes how the image in the neighborhood of is transformed.

If a function is differentiable at a point, its differential is given in coordinates by the Jacobian matrix. However, a function does not need to be differentiable for its Jacobian matrix to be defined, since only its first-order partial derivatives are required to exist.

If is differentiable at a point in , then its differential is represented by . In this case, the linear transformation represented by is the best linear approximation of near the point , in the sense that

formula_9

where is a quantity that approaches zero much faster than the distance between and does as approaches . This approximation specializes to the approximation of a scalar function of a single variable by its Taylor polynomial of degree one, namely

formula_10

In this sense, the Jacobian may be regarded as a kind of &quot;first-order derivative&quot; of a vector-valued function of several variables. In particular, this means that the gradient of a scalar-valued function of several variables may too be regarded as its &quot;first-order derivative&quot;.

Composable differentiable functions and satisfy the chain rule, namely formula_11 for in .

The Jacobian of the gradient of a scalar function of several variables has a special name: the Hessian matrix, which in a sense is the &quot;second derivative&quot; of the function in question.

== Jacobian determinant ==

If , then is a function from to itself and the Jacobian matrix is a square matrix. We can then form its determinant, known as the Jacobian determinant. The Jacobian determinant is sometimes simply referred to as &quot;the Jacobian&quot;.

The Jacobian determinant at a given point gives important information about the behavior of near that point. For instance, the continuously differentiable function is invertible near a point if the Jacobian determinant at is non-zero. This is the inverse function theorem. Furthermore, if the Jacobian determinant at is positive, then preserves orientation near ; if it is negative, reverses orientation. The absolute value of the Jacobian determinant at gives us the factor by which the function expands or shrinks volumes near ; this is why it occurs in the general substitution rule.

The Jacobian determinant is used when making a change of variables when evaluating a multiple integral of a function over a region within its domain. To accommodate for the change of coordinates the magnitude of the Jacobian determinant arises as a multiplicative factor within the integral. This is because the -dimensional element is in general a parallelepiped in the new coordinate system, and the -volume of a parallelepiped is the determinant of its edge vectors.

The Jacobian can also be used to determine the stability of equilibria for systems of differential equations by approximating behavior near an equilibrium point.

== Inverse ==

According to the inverse function theorem, the matrix inverse of the Jacobian matrix of an invertible function is the Jacobian matrix of the &quot;inverse&quot; function. That is, the Jacobian matrix of the inverse function at a point is

formula_12

and the Jacobian determinant is

formula_13

If the Jacobian is continuous and nonsingular at the point in , then is invertible when restricted to some neighbourhood of . In other words, if the Jacobian determinant is not zero at a point, then the function is &quot;locally invertible&quot; near this point.

The (unproved) Jacobian conjecture is related to global invertibility in the case of a polynomial function, that is a function defined by &quot;n&quot; polynomials in &quot;n&quot; variables. It asserts that, if the Jacobian determinant is a non-zero constant (or, equivalently, that it does not have any complex zero), then the function is invertible and its inverse is a polynomial function.

== Critical points ==

If is a differentiable function, a &quot;critical point&quot; of is a point where the rank of the Jacobian matrix is not maximal. This means that the rank at the critical point is lower than the rank at some neighbour point. In other words, let be the maximal dimension of the open balls contained in the image of ; then a point is critical if all minors of rank of are zero.

In the case where , a point is critical if the Jacobian determinant is zero.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===

Consider a function with given by

formula_14

Then we have

formula_15

and

formula_16

The Jacobian matrix of is

formula_17

and the Jacobian determinant is

formula_18

=== Example 2: polar-Cartesian transformation ===

The transformation from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), is given by the function with components

formula_19

formula_20

The Jacobian determinant is equal to . This can be used to transform integrals between the two coordinate systems:

formula_21

=== Example 3: spherical-Cartesian transformation ===

The transformation from spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), is given by the function with components

formula_22

The Jacobian matrix for this coordinate change is

formula_23

The determinant is . Since is the volume for a rectangular differential volume element (because the volume of a rectangular prism is the product of its sides), we can interpret as the volume of the spherical differential volume element. Unlike rectangular differential volume element&#x27;s volume, this differential volume element&#x27;s volume is not a constant, and varies with coordinates ( and ). It can be used to transform integrals between the two coordinate systems:

formula_24

=== Example 4 ===

The Jacobian matrix of the function with components

formula_25

is

formula_26

This example shows that the Jacobian matrix need not be a square matrix.

=== Example 5 ===

The Jacobian determinant of the function with components

formula_27

is

formula_28

From this we see that reverses orientation near those points where and have the same sign; the function is locally invertible everywhere except near points where or . Intuitively, if one starts with a tiny object around the point and apply to that object, one will get a resulting object with approximately times the volume of the original one, with orientation reversed.

== Other uses ==

=== Dynamical systems ===

Consider a dynamical system of the form formula_29, where formula_30 is the (component-wise) derivative of formula_31 with respect to the evolution parameter formula_32 (time), and formula_33 is differentiable. If formula_34, then formula_35 is a stationary point (also called a steady state). By the Hartman–Grobman theorem, the behavior of the system near a stationary point is related to the eigenvalues of formula_36, the Jacobian of formula_37 at the stationary point. Specifically, if the eigenvalues all have real parts that are negative, then the system is stable near the stationary point. If any eigenvalue has a real part that is positive, then the point is unstable. If the largest real part of the eigenvalues is zero, the Jacobian matrix does not allow for an evaluation of the stability.

=== Newton&#x27;s method ===

A square system of coupled nonlinear equations can be solved iteratively by Newton&#x27;s method. This method uses the Jacobian matrix of the system of equations.

===Regression and least squares fitting===
The Jacobian serves as a linearized design matrix in statistical regression and curve fitting; see non-linear least squares. The Jacobian is also used in random matrices, moments, local sensitivity and statistical diagnostics.

<text>Mellow Gold is the third studio album by American musician Beck, released on March 1, 1994, by DGC Records as Beck&#x27;s major label debut album. Critics noted the album&#x27;s hybrid of various styles including rock, hip hop, folk, blues, psychedelia, and country, as well as ironic, witty lyrics. Its decidedly anti-commercial attitude led to it becoming an unexpected commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the United States and eventually being certified platinum. As of July 2008, &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; has sold over 1.2 million copies in the United States.

==Background==
In a 1994 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Beck said of the album: The whole concept of &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; is that it&#x27;s like a satanic K-tel record that&#x27;s been found in a trash dumpster, quite matter-of-factly. A few people have molested it and slept with it and half-swallowed it before spitting it out. Someone played poker with it, someone tried to smoke it. Then the record was taken to Morocco and covered with hummus and tabouli. Then it was flown back to a convention of water-skiers, who skied on it and played Frisbee with it. Then the record was put on the turntable, and the original K-Tel album had reached a whole new level. I was just taking that whole &quot;Freedom Rock&quot; feeling, you understand.

According to the album&#x27;s liner notes, &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; was recorded at Carl Stephenson and Rob Schnapf&#x27;s houses, predominantly utilizing a four-track.

==Album cover==
The robot on the cover of &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; was created by artist Eddie Lopez, who made a cameo in the music video for the hit song &quot;Loser&quot;. The sculpture was named &quot;Survivor from the Nuclear Bomb&quot;. The shot was originally taken in Lopez&#x27;s garage space by Beck&#x27;s friend as well as early collaborator Ross Harris. The last image was reshot in a studio where Harris was able to control the environment and also add visual effects to make the cover look more apocalyptic.

==Title==
The album was originally going to be titled &quot;Cold Ass Fashion&quot;, sharing its name with an earlier song of Beck&#x27;s. The final title used, &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;, was named after a potent strain of California marijuana.

==Reception==

&quot;Mellow Gold&quot; received general acclaim from music critics. AllMusic and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it five out of five stars (the latter originally giving it only three and a half).

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;although his inspired sense of humor occasionally plays like he&#x27;s a smirking, irony-addled hipster, his music is never kitschy, and his wordplay is constantly inspired.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a dizzying demonstration of musical skills, yet it&#x27;s all tied together by a simple yet clever sense of songcraft and a truly original lyrical viewpoint, one that&#x27;s basic yet as colorful as free verse.&quot;

&quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine included &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

<doc id="195353" wikidata="Q1139814" url="?curid=195353" title="Rube Goldberg machine">
<text>A Rube Goldberg machine, named after American cartoonist Rube Goldberg, is a chain reaction–type machine or contraption intentionally designed to perform a simple task in an indirect and (impractically) overly complicated way. Usually, these machines consist of a series of simple unrelated devices; the action of each triggers the initiation of the next, eventually resulting in achieving a stated goal.

The design of such a &quot;machine&quot; is often presented on paper and would be impossible to implement in actuality. More recently, such machines have been fully constructed for entertainment (for example, a breakfast scene in &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;) and in Rube Goldberg competitions.

==Origin==
The expression is named after the American cartoonist Rube Goldberg, whose cartoons often depicted devices that performed simple tasks in indirect convoluted ways. The cartoon above is Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin&quot;, which was later reprinted in a few book collections, including the postcard book &quot;Rube Goldberg&#x27;s Inventions!&quot; and the hardcover &quot;Rube Goldberg: Inventions&quot;, both compiled by Maynard Frank Wolfe from the Rube Goldberg Archives.

The term &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; was being used in print to describe elaborate contraptions by 1928, and appeared in the &quot;Random House Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in 1966 meaning &quot;having a fantastically complicated improvised appearance&quot;, or &quot;deviously complex and impractical&quot;. Because Rube Goldberg machines are contraptions derived from tinkering with the tools close at hand, parallels have been drawn with evolutionary processes.

Many of Goldberg&#x27;s ideas were utilized in films and TV shows for the comedic effect of creating such rigamarole for such a simple task, such as the front gate mechanism in &quot;The Goonies&quot; and the breakfast machine shown in &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. In &quot;Ernest Goes to Jail&quot;, Ernest P. Worrell uses his invention simply to turn his TV on. Other films such as &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, the end credits of &quot;Waiting...&quot;, &quot;Diving into the Money Pit&quot;, and &quot;Back to the Future&quot; have featured Rube Goldberg–style devices as well.

Wallace from &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; creates and uses many such machines for numerous, oft trivial tasks and productivity enhancements (e.g. getting dressed). The inspiration for these contraptions, however, is the British cartoonist W. Heath Robinson.

&quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; is a series of video games in which players create a series of Rube Goldberg devices. The board game &quot;Mouse Trap&quot; has been referred to as an early practical example of such a contraption.

==Competitions==

In early 1987, Purdue University in Indiana started the annual National Rube Goldberg Machine Contest, organized by the Phi chapter of Theta Tau, a national engineering fraternity. In 2009, the Epsilon chapter of Theta Tau established a similar annual contest at the University of California, Berkeley.

Since around 1997, the kinetic artist Arthur Ganson has been the emcee of the annual &quot;Friday After Thanksgiving&quot; (FAT) competition sponsored by the MIT Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Teams of contestants construct elaborate Rube Goldberg style chain-reaction machines on tables arranged around a large gymnasium. Each apparatus is linked by a string to its predecessor and successor machine. The initial string is ceremonially pulled, and the ensuing events are videotaped in closeup, and simultaneously projected on large screens for viewing by the live audience. After the entire cascade of events has finished, prizes are then awarded in various categories and age levels. Videos from several previous years&#x27; contests are viewable on the MIT Museum website.

The Chain Reaction Contraption Contest is an annual event hosted at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in which high school teams each build a Rube Goldberg machine to complete some simple task (which changes from year to year) in 20 steps or more (with some additional constraints on size, timing, safety, etc.).

On the TV show &quot;Food Network Challenge&quot;, competitors in 2011 were once required to create a Rube Goldberg machine out of sugar.

An event called &#x27;Mission Possible&#x27; in the Science Olympiad involves students building a Rube Goldberg-like device to perform a certain series of tasks.

The Rube Goldberg company holds an annual Rube Goldberg machine contest.

* France – A similar machine is called , or &#x27;gasworks&#x27;, suggesting a very complicated factory with pipes running everywhere and a risk of explosion. It is now used mainly among programmers to indicate a complicated program, or in journalism to refer to a bewildering law or regulation (&quot;cf&quot;. Stovepipe system). Similar convoluted machines were instrumental in the old popular French TV series &quot;Les Shadoks&quot;.
* Germany – Such machines are often called (&#x27;What-happens-next machine&#x27;), for the German name of similar devices used by Kermit the Frog in the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.
* India – The humorist and children&#x27;s author Sukumar Ray, in his nonsense poem &quot;Abol tabol&quot;, had a character (Uncle) with a Rube Goldberg-like machine called &quot;Uncle&#x27;s contraption&quot;(). This word is used colloquially in Bengali to mean a complicated and useless object.
* Italy – Italian Renaissance artist and scientist Leonardo da Vinci described an alarm clock-esque device which, utilizing a slow drip of water, would fill a vessel which then operated a lever to wake the sleeper.
* Japan — Such devices are often called &quot;Pythagorean devices&quot; or &quot;Pythagoras switch&quot;. is the name of a TV show featuring such devices. Another related genre is the Japanese art of , which involves inventions that are hypothetically useful but of limited actual utility.
* Norway – The Norwegian artist and author Kjell Aukrust (1920–2002) was famous for his drawings of over-intricate and humorous constructions, which he often attributed to his fictive character, inventor-cum-bicycle repairman Reodor Felgen. Eventually Reodor Felgen became one of the protagonists of the successful animated movie &quot;Flåklypa Grand Prix&quot; (English: &quot;The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot;), in which Felgen&#x27;s inventions were in fact props constructed in accordance with Aukrust&#x27;s drawings by Bjarne Sandemose of the animation studio run by film director Ivo Caprino.
* Spain – Devices akin to Goldberg&#x27;s machines are known as , named after those that several cartoonists (Nit, Tínez, Marino Benejam, Francesc Tur and finally Ramón Sabatés) made up and drew for a section in the comic book magazine &quot;TBO&quot;, allegedly designed by some &quot;Professor Franz&quot; from Copenhagen in Denmark.
* Switzerland – Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss, Swiss artists known for their art installation movie &quot;Der Lauf der Dinge&quot; (&quot;The Way Things Go&quot;, 1987). It documents a 30-minute-long causal chain assembled of everyday objects, resembling a Rube Goldberg machine.
* Turkey – Such devices are known as , allegedly invented by a certain Professor Zihni Sinir (&quot;Crabby Mind&quot;), a curious scientist character created by İrfan Sayar in 1977 for the cartoon magazine . The cartoonist later went on to open a studio selling actual working implementations of his designs.
* United Kingdom – The term &quot;Heath Robinson&quot; was in use by 1917, referring to the fantastical comic machinery drawn by British cartoonist and illustrator W. Heath Robinson. See also Rowland Emett, active in the 1950s. The TV show &quot;The Great Egg Race&quot; (1979 to 1986) also involved making physical contraptions to solve set problems, and often resulted in Heath-Robinsonian devices. 
* United States – Tim Hawkinson has made several art pieces that contain complicated apparatuses that are generally used to make abstract art or music. Many of them are centered on the randomness of other devices (such as a slot machine) and are dependent on them to create some menial effect.

<text>Pelagius (; c. 354–418) was a British (Brittonic) theologian known for promoting a system of doctrines (termed Pelagianism by his opponents) which emphasized human choice in salvation and denied original sin. Pelagius was accused of heresy at the synod of Jerusalem in 415 and his doctrines were harshly criticized by Augustine of Hippo, especially the Pelagian views about mankind&#x27;s good nature and individual responsibility for choosing asceticism. Pelagius especially stressed the freedom of human will. Very little is known about the personal life and career of Pelagius.

== Beginnings ==
Pelagius was active between about 390 and 418. He was said by his contemporaries, such as Augustine of Hippo, Prosper of Aquitaine, Marius Mercator, and Paul Orosius, to have been of Celtic British origin. Jerome apparently thought that Pelagius was Irish, suggesting that he was &quot;stuffed with Irish porridge&quot; (). He was tall in stature and portly in appearance. Pelagius was also highly educated, spoke and wrote Latin and Greek with great fluency, and was well versed in theology. His name has traditionally been understood as a Graecized form (from , &quot;sea&quot;) of the Welsh name Morgan (&quot;sea-born&quot;), or another Celtic equivalent.

Pelagius became better known around 380 when he moved to Rome. There he enjoyed a reputation of austerity; he also corresponded with Paulinus of Nola. Twenty-five years after the fact, Augustine related that Pelagius had reacted strongly to the statement from Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; (397–401) &quot;Give what you command and command what you will&quot;, as he believed that it undermined human responsibility. However, this incident&#x27;s historicity is questioned by scholars.

When Alaric sacked Rome in 410, Pelagius and his follower Caelestius fled to Carthage, where he continued his work.

== Opponents ==
=== Augustine of Hippo ===
Pelagianism quickly spread, especially around Carthage. Augustine wrote (&quot;Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins&quot;) in 412, and (&quot;On the Spirit and the Letter&quot;) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called , said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, . In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ&#x27;s grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.

=== Jerome ===
Pelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved as well. Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians. Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his Letter to Ctesiphon and . With Jerome at the time was Orosius, a visiting pupil of Augustine, who had similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop John of Jerusalem, a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius&#x27; lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John&#x27;s Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.

===Diospolis===
A few months later in December of 415, at the synod of Diospolis (Lydda) under the bishop of Cæsarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. For unrelated reasons, neither bishop attended, and Orosius left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of Celestius did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures, including Augustine himself — who, for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius&#x27;s character.

The Synod of Diospolis therefore concluded: &quot;Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence, and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.&quot;
== Teachings ==
Manichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that Pelagius&#x27;s purported views were in part an &quot;over-reaction&quot; to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he &quot;could not see&quot; how God had made humans fallen creatures. The Pelagians accused Augustine of bringing Manichaeian theology into the Christian church, which Augustine himself denied.

The view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God&#x27;s commandments, is held to have stood at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will; an illustration of Pelagius&#x27; views on man&#x27;s &quot;moral ability&quot; not to sin can be found in his Letter to Demetrias.

For Pelagius, &quot;grace&quot; consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus. According to Augustine, Pelagians saw baptism of infants as useless because they had no sin. Celestius, who was a disciple of Pelagius, also was to have denied original sin and the necessity of infant baptism for salvation.

==Pope Zosimus ==
Seeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to Pope Zosimus, Innocent I&#x27;s successor, arguing that he was orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned. Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and Emperor Honorius forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.

Pelagianism was condemned at the Council of Carthage in 418. Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, had called the Council of Carthage in 418.

== Death and aftermath ==
After his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint Cyril of Alexandria allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.

His death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings. Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius&#x27; actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).

Pelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the First Council of Ephesus in 431.

Belief in Pelagianism and Semipelagianism was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, Palestine and North Africa. St Germanus visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around 429 AD. In Wales, Saint David was credited with convening the Synod of Brefi and the Synod of Victory against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.

==Evaluation==
Because of the fifth-century condemnations of him, Pelagius became known as &quot;a heresiarch of the deepest dye&quot;. Evaluation of him changed after the publication of a 1943 biography by and more recent scholars have viewed him as an orthodox Christian theologian who was a victim of denunciation. His Pauline commentaries were popular during the Middle Ages but frequently claimed to be the work of other authors.

An objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers. Ronald Hutton describes him as &quot;a first-rate theologian&quot;.

The theologian Carol Harrison commented that Pelagius presented &quot;a radically different alternative to Western understandings of the human person, human responsibility and freedom, ethics and the nature of salvation&quot; which might have come about if Augustine had not been victorious in the Pelagian controversy. According to Harrison, &quot;Pelagianism represents an attempt to safeguard God&#x27;s justice, to preserve the integrity of human nature as created by God, and of human beings&#x27; obligation, responsibility and ability to attain a life of perfect righteousness.&quot; However, this is at the expense of downplaying human frailty and presenting &quot;the operation of divine grace as being merely external&quot;. According to the scholar Rebecca Weaver, &quot;what most distinguished Pelagius was his conviction of an unrestricted freedom of choice, given by God and immune to alteration by sin or circumstance.&quot;
In 1956, John Ferguson wrote: 

== Writings==
Of his surviving works, only few are known in full. These are:

* (&quot;On Faith in the Trinity: Three Books&quot;)
* (&quot;Excerpts out of Divine Scriptures: Book One&quot;)
* (&quot;Commentary on the Epistles of Saint Paul&quot;)

Unfortunately, most of his work survives only in the quotations of his opponents. Only in the past century have works attributable to Pelagius been identified as such.

Other writings include &quot;On Nature&quot;, parts of which are quoted in Augustine&#x27;s &quot;On Nature and Grace&quot;, and &quot;Defense of the Freedom of the Will&quot;, quoted in Augustine&#x27;s &quot;On the Grace of Christ&quot;. Also surviving are his letter to Demetrias, along with fragments of other letters, and the written statement of faith which was received by Pope Zosimus.

<doc id="195361" wikidata="Q3427834" url="?curid=195361" title="Anti-French sentiment in the United States">
<text>Anti-French sentiment in the United States has consisted of unfavorable estimations, hatred, dislike, and fear of, and prejudice and discrimination towards, the government, culture, language or people of France by people in the United States of America, sometimes spurred on by media and government leaders.

==18th century==

The Patriot victory in the American Revolutionary War, which resulted in the Thirteen Colonies declaring their independence from British rule as the United States, was heavily dependent on French assistance. After the conflict, late 18th-century American politics was contested between the pro-French Democratic-Republican Party and the pro-British Federalist Party, the latter of whom were frequently hostile to France. Leading Federalist politicians, including John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, denounced the French Revolution as excessively radical and violent. Historians Pierre Bourdieu and Stanley Hoffmann have argued that the root of anti-French sentiment in the U.S. dates back to 18th-century American perceptions of French sociopolitical systems as threats to republicanism in the United States. The Federalist Party in particular was hostile to secularism in France. 

After the French Revolution, the U.S. government refused to pay debts owed to France, arguing that they were owed to the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, which no longer existed. The infuriated government of the French First Republic responded by ordering the seizure of American merchantmen bound for British ports to collect the debts. Attempts at diplomatically resolving Franco-American issues led to the XYZ Affair in 1797, which resulted in the Quasi-War breaking out between France and the U.S. a year later. The war led to a wave of anti-French sentiment among Americans, greatly straining France–United States relations.

==20th century==

In the Southern United States, some Americans were anti-French for white supremacist reasons. For example, John Trotwood Moore, a Southern novelist and local historian who served as the State Librarian and Archivist of Tennessee from 1919 to 1929, lambasted the French for &quot;intermarrying with the Indians and treating them as equals&quot; during the French colonization of the Americas. 

In 1945, the United States Army issued a handbook titled &quot;112 Gripes about the French&quot; in an attempt to defuse the hostility of some American soldiers stationed in France, who typically perceived Stereotypes of French people.

In 1990s popular culture, the derogatory phrase &quot;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&quot; began as a joke on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1995, used by Groundskeeper Willie. &quot;National Review&quot; contributor Jonah Goldberg claimed credit for making the term known. It is a reference to the defeat of the French Army against Nazi Germany during World War II, the ensuing Armistice of 22 June 1940 being often misconstrued as an unconditional surrender.

==Allegation of missing French-American lobby==

French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of public hostility in the US is the small number of Americans of direct or recent French descent. Most Americans of French descent are descended from 17th- and 18th-century colonists who settled in Quebec, Acadia, or Louisiana before migrating to the United States or being incorporated into American territories. French Americans of colonial era Huguenot descent, French Protestant emigrants, have often ceased identification with France.

== Iraq war ==
Anti-French sentiment was strong in the wake of France&#x27;s refusal to support US proposals in the UN Security Council for military action to invade Iraq. While other nations also opposed the US proposals (notably Russia; China; and traditional US allies, such as Germany, Canada, and Belgium), France received particularly ferocious criticism. In a New York Times article in 2003 Friedman said France&#x27;s permanent seat at the U.N. Security Council should be given to India because &quot;India is just so much more serious than France these days. France is so caught up with its need to differentiate itself from America to feel important, it&#x27;s become silly&quot;.

In early 2003, George Will from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described retreat as &quot;an exercise for which France has often refined its savoir-faire since 1870.&quot; Anti-French displays also came in the form of bumper stickers, and t-shirts calling for the United States to invade: &quot;Iraq first, France next!&quot; and &quot;First Iraq, then Chirac!&quot; Freedom fries became a political euphemism for french fries. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France&#x27;s opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq.

<doc id="195367" wikidata="Q457275" url="?curid=195367" title="Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols">
<text>Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols (often shortened to Never Mind the Bollocks) is the only studio album by English punk rock band the Sex Pistols, released on 28 October 1977 through Virgin Records in the UK and on 11 November 1977 through Warner Bros. Records in the US. As a result of the Sex Pistols&#x27; volatile internal relationships, the band&#x27;s lineup saw changes during the recording of the album. Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only played bass and sang backing vocals on one track, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs written by the band after he joined. While Vicious&#x27;s bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead. Drummer Paul Cook, Jones and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track. The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.

By the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having spoken profanity on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word &quot;bollocks&quot; offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017.

The album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album&#x27;s raw energy, and Johnny Rotten&#x27;s sneering delivery and &quot;half-singing&quot;, are often considered game-changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The same magazine ranked it 73rd on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever.

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
John Lydon, Steve Jones and Paul Cook wrote the album&#x27;s 12 tracks between August of 1975 and June of 1976, with Glen Matlock acting as a co-writer on most of the tracks, written before his departure in February of 1977, and Sid Vicious co-writing the two written after his entry into the group.

The first track written by the group was &#x27;Pretty Vacant,&#x27; and by their 6 November 1975 concert at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design they had written &#x27;Seventeen&#x27;, which closed their set. The next day the group performed at The Holborn Central School of Art and debuted &#x27;Pretty Vacant&#x27; and &#x27;Submission&#x27;. On the 21st, they debuted the song &#x27;New York&#x27;. By February 1976, the group had gained traction and debuted the song &#x27;Problems&#x27; for their second encore on 14 February. Their setlists at this time were becoming more filled with their material and less reliant on covers, as their earlier shows had been. By 3 April, they were playing &#x27;No Feelings&#x27; in concert, and on 20 July, debuted &#x27;Anarchy In the U.K&#x27;, which was seemingly influenced by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, the latter of which had begun creating publicity material for the group that spring. By 14 August the group were performing &#x27;Liar&#x27; live.

=== Recording ===
On 8 October 1976, EMI signed the group into a two-year contract. For EMI, they recorded &#x27;Anarchy In the U.K&#x27; and began sessions for the newly written &#x27;God Save The Queen&#x27; that month. On 26 November 1976, the group&#x27;s first single was released to great commercial success. But due to the nature of the material and the band&#x27;s image, they caused heavy controversy, and were dropped from the label on 6 January 1977.

In February of 1977, founding member and original bassist Glen Matlock quit, reportedly over the lyrics to God Save The Queen. Matlock had co-written a majority of the album&#x27;s tracks and was replaced by Sid Vicious.

Close to completing a deal with A&amp;M Records, in March 1977 the Sex Pistols entered Wessex Sound Studios to record with producer Chris Thomas and engineer Bill Price. New bassist Sid Vicious played on the tracks &quot;Bodies&quot; and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, but his performing skills were not considered fit to record the full album, so the band asked manager Malcolm McLaren to convince previous bassist Glen Matlock to perform the instrument for the sessions. Matlock agreed on the condition that he was paid beforehand. When payment was not received, he declined to attend. As a result, Thomas asked guitarist Steve Jones to play bass so work could begin on the basic tracks. Jones&#x27; playing was so satisfactory that Thomas had him play the bass tracks for all the remaining songs recorded during the sessions.

Four tracks—writer Clinton Heylin suspected they were &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (Thomas stated he and Price &quot;gave up&quot; trying to use Vicious&#x27; bass track), &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;, &quot;E.M.I.&quot; and possibly &quot;Did You No Wrong&quot;—were recorded during the two days at Wessex, with &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; receiving vocal tracking from Johnny Rotten and final mixing during the period. As a result of these sessions, Thomas and Price began work in earnest on what would become the Sex Pistols&#x27; full-length album. Four days after recording was completed, the Sex Pistols signed with A&amp;M, yet on 16 March the label terminated the contract, and several thousand pressed copies of the forthcoming &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; single were destroyed.

Despite being dropped by A&amp;M, McLaren instructed the Sex Pistols to continue work on the album. While McLaren pondered whether or not to sign the offer presented by Virgin Records, he signed a French deal for the group with Barclay Records in early May 1977. At the same time, the group resumed work with Thomas and Price. Thomas temporarily departed the session partway through (a timeframe Heylin places as sometime in late April and early May), leaving Price to produce what Thomas estimated as five songs. Heylin narrowed down the potential &quot;Bollocks&quot; tracks Price may have produced to &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;No Feelings&quot;, &quot;Problems&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Submission&quot;, in addition to the non-album track &quot;Satellite&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Sex Pistols had been rejected by labels including CBS, Decca, Pye and Polydor, leaving only Virgin&#x27;s offer. McLaren still hoped to sign with a major label, and posited issuing a one-off single with Virgin to increase the band&#x27;s appeal to the larger record companies. Virgin owner Richard Branson refused, so on 18 May the Sex Pistols finally signed with Virgin. Two weeks later, the label rush-released &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as a single. During promotion of the single, Rotten stated that work on the album was ongoing, and, obscuring Jones&#x27;s assumption of bass duties, insisted that the bass performances on the in-progress album were split between Matlock &quot;on the Chris Thomas tracks&quot; and Vicious.

The band returned to the studio with Thomas and Price on 18 June to record &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot;, the first song they had written without Matlock. That night after visiting a nearby pub, Rotten, Thomas and Price were attacked by a group of men, and the incident made newspaper headlines the following Tuesday. That month an eleven-track preview of the album began circulating, first reviewed in the fanzine &quot;48 Thrills&quot;. At this point, Rotten maintained that the forthcoming album would include no cover songs, and none of the Sex Pistols&#x27; previously released singles bar &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, which was out of print. With &quot;Pretty Vacants release as a single, it was due to be replaced on the track list. The Sex Pistols returned to Wessex once more that August to record a new song, &quot;Bodies&quot;, that had Vicious on bass. &quot;Bodies&quot; contained a second bass track played by Steve Jones, with the final version of the song &quot;leaving Sid&#x27;s down low&quot;.

The time spent in the studio recording the album was, for Steve Jones, the &quot;best part of being in the Pistols&quot;. Jones spent many hours doing guitar overdubs with producer Chris Thomas and—repudiating punk&#x27;s occasional embrace of musical sloppiness—has stated that both he and drummer Paul Cook &quot;weren&#x27;t just having a laugh&quot; and were &quot;really dedicated in the studio&quot;.

During this time period, bassist Sid Vicious stumbled into the same recording room as rock band Queen. Vicious aimed an insult at lead singer Freddie Mercury, saying &quot;Have you brought ballet to the masses, yet?&quot; Mercury got up and responded, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you Simon Ferocious or something? What&#x27;re you gonna do about it?&quot;, took him by the collar and threw him out of the room. Later, Queen&#x27;s producer Roy Thomas Baker, had a word with the Pistols&#x27; engineer over an interruption by Johnny Rotten, saying, &quot;One of the band members just crawled on all fours across our studio up to the side of the piano, said, &#x27;Hello Freddie,&#x27; and left on all fours. Could you make sure he doesn&#x27;t do it again?&quot;

== Release ==
With the completion of &quot;Bodies&quot;, the time came to finalise the album&#x27;s track list. Though Jon Savage wrote there were three versions of each track available, Heylin states that alternative versions for only five tracks (&quot;E.M.I.&quot;, &quot;No Feelings&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Submission&quot;, plus an &quot;album&quot; mix of &quot;Satellite&quot;) existed. It was not until 20 September that the track list was finalised, which Heylin said &quot;suggests just how bogged down by the process they had become&quot;. Richard Branson spent the night deciding the track list and which versions to use, and included all the hits on the record, despite the objections of the band, McLaren&#x27;s management company Glitterbest and most of Virgin. Due to the album&#x27;s long completion time, the Sex Pistols and McLaren decided to release &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot; backed with &quot;Satellite&quot; as the band&#x27;s fourth single. &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot; was not as successful as past singles—it charted at number eight and dropped out of the top 20 after four weeks—which Heylin attributed to the group&#x27;s announcement that their album would be released on 4 November and that the single would be included on the LP, despite previous statements to the contrary. In an attempt to stem criticism over the decision to include all four previously released Sex Pistols singles on the forthcoming LP, Virgin indicated the possibility of an &quot;alternative album&quot; being issued simultaneously, featuring a new title and two new songs replacing &quot;two of the former hit singles&quot;. A label spokesman stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve put the singles on the LP because most people wanted it that way. But the alternative set would enable us to overcome the multiple stores&#x27; ban&quot;. A ten-song test pressing was made, though no new cuts were included, with &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;Submission&quot; being added as bonus tracks.

The Sex Pistols&#x27; contract with Virgin stated that its music would be distributed by Virgin in the United States provided Branson matched any competing offers McLaren received. However, McLaren wanted to negotiate separate deals in every territory, regardless of what the contract stipulated, which angered Branson, as the clause for American distribution was an important one he had fought for. Branson knew he had been outmanoeuvred by McLaren, for he could not sue to enforce the contract or else be perceived as acting like EMI or A&amp;M. Competition for the band in the United States narrowed down to Warner Bros., Arista, Columbia and Casablanca Records, with Warner Bros. signing the band on 10 October for £22,000.

Before Virgin could release &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;, Branson discovered that two other Sex Pistols albums were competing with his label&#x27;s. In October, a bootleg named &quot;Spunk&quot; featuring high-quality recordings of Sex Pistols demos and recording sessions with Dave Goodman was released on a label called Blank. Among the rumours of who was behind the release of the tapes included Goodman, Glen Matlock and McLaren, who has always considered Goodman&#x27;s versions to be a more accurate representation of the band. Meanwhile, the French pressing of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; on Barclay had added &quot;Submission&quot; to the slated 11-song track list, and was due for release a week before Virgin&#x27;s edition. As McLaren&#x27;s separate deal with Barclay meant that the French release could not be halted and given the Virgin head was aware of how easy it was for import records to arrive in Britain, Branson rushed production of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; to ensure it would come out a week earlier than intended. Nevertheless, the Barclay version was already available in the UK at the time Virgin had its version ready. Ten thousand copies of Virgin&#x27;s pressing erroneously only listed 11 tracks on the sleeve yet contained 12 on the actual record.

Even with the availability of &quot;Spunk&quot;, the release of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; was eagerly awaited in the United Kingdom. With advance orders of 125,000 copies, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts the week after its release. A ban of the album enacted by major retailers resulted in the record selling well through independent vendors instead.

==Title, packaging and obscenity case==
The album was originally going to be titled &quot;God Save Sex Pistols&quot;. Jamie Reid&#x27;s cover concept refrained from including a picture of the group and instead was dayglo red and yellow in colour with cutout lettering and a finish resembling crude screen-prints while the US version was pink with a green Sex Pistols logo. The album&#x27;s title changed in mid-1977, based on a phrase supplied by Steve Jones. Jones said he picked up the phrase &quot;Never mind the bollocks&quot; from two fans who would always say it to one another. Johnny Rotten explained its meaning as a working-class expression to &quot;stop talking rubbish&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the album was subject to what Heylin described as &quot;blatant acts of censorship exercised by media and retail outlets alike&quot;. London police visited the city&#x27;s Virgin record store branches and told them they faced prosecution for indecency as stipulated by the 1899 Indecent Advertisements Act if they continued to display posters of the album cover in their windows. The displays were either toned down or removed. However, on 9 November 1977 (just two days before the album was released in the US), the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; announced on its front-page headline &quot;Police Move in on Punk Disc Shops&quot;, and reported how a Virgin Records shop manager in Nottingham was arrested for displaying the record after being warned to cover up the word &quot;bollocks&quot;. Chris Seale, the shop&#x27;s manager, &quot;it would appear, willingly set himself up as a target, possibly at Branson&#x27;s behest&quot;, according to Heylin, who noted that he had been visited by the police on four occasions and resumed displaying copies of the record in the store windows after they had left on each occasion. After Seale&#x27;s arrest, Branson announced that he would cover the manager&#x27;s legal costs and hired Queen&#x27;s Counsel John Mortimer as defence. Meanwhile, advertisements for &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; appearing in music papers attempted to politicise the issue, showing newspaper headlines about Sex Pistols controversies that were underlined with the message &quot;THE ALBUM WILL LAST. THE SLEEVE MAY NOT.&quot;

The obscenity case was heard at Nottingham Magistrates&#x27; Court on 24 November. Mortimer presented the case as a matter of police discrimination. During his cross-examination of the arresting officer, he asked why the newspapers &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (which had referred to the album&#x27;s name) had not been charged under the same act. When the overseeing magistrate inquired about his line of questioning, Mortimer stated that a double standard was apparently at play, and that &quot;bollocks&quot; was only considered obscene when it appeared on the cover of a Sex Pistols album. The prosecutor conducted his cross-examination &quot;as if the album itself, and not its lurid visage, was on trial for indecency&quot;, according to Heylin. Mortimer produced an expert witness, Professor James Kinsley, Head of the School of English at the University of Nottingham, who argued that the word &quot;bollocks&quot; was not obscene, and was actually a legitimate Old English term formerly used to refer to a priest, and which, in the context of the title, meant &quot;nonsense&quot;. Lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, who appeared with Mortimer, recalled the professor saying that early English translations of the Bible used &quot;bollocks&quot; to refer to testicles, this being replaced by the word &quot;stones&quot; in the King James Version of the Bible, at which point Rotten handed Robertson a note saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. If we lose the case, we&#x27;ll retitle the album &quot;Never Mind the Stones, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;&quot;. The chairman of the hearing concluded:

Much as my colleagues and I wholeheartedly deplore the vulgar exploitation of the worst instincts of human nature for the purchases of commercial profits by both you and your company, we must reluctantly find you not guilty of each of the four charges.

== Legacy ==

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot;, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau reviewed &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;:

In 1983, the Bollock Brothers released a track-by track-cover version of the album, called &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks 1983&quot;.

In 1985, &quot;NME&quot; writers voted &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; the thirteenth greatest album of all time. In 1993, &quot;NME&quot; writers voted the album the third greatest of all time. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named it the second best album of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The same magazine named it 41st on their list of the five-hundred greatest albums ever in 2003, maintaining the position in its updated 2012 list, but dropped to number 73 in a 2020 revision. In an interview during 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Charles M. Young stated:

&quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; changed everything. There had never been anything like it before and really there&#x27;s never been anything quite like it since. The closest was probably Nirvana, a band very heavily influenced by the Sex Pistols.

Kurt Cobain from Nirvana listed the album on his Top 50 favourite albums, and the title of Nirvana&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, was inspired by the Sex Pistols&#x27; album, which angered Rotten at the time.

In 1997, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; was named the 24th greatest album of all time in a Music of the Millennium poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM.

In 2000 it was voted number 29 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

In 2005, the album was ranked number 276 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2006, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever, and in the same year &quot;NME&quot; voted the album the fourth greatest British album.

Noel Gallagher was interviewed for a television programme called &quot;When Albums Ruled the World&quot; for the BBC, aired in early 2013. He said, of the album&#x27;s opening with &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot;, &quot;That is extremely provocative, what we can only assume is jackboots&quot;, which he followed by saying, &quot;As soon as that starts, everything that has gone on before is now deemed fucking irrelevant, as soon as he (John Lydon) starts anti singing.&quot; He then said of &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;, &quot;One of the 1st things you learn when you pick up the electric guitar is that riff.&quot; He then further commented, &quot;I made 10 albums and in my mind they don&#x27;t match up to that, and I&#x27;m an arrogant bastard. I&#x27;d give them all up to have written that, I truly would.&quot;
In 2015, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

== Reissues ==
In 1996, Virgin reissued &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; as a double CD with the original &#x27;Spunk&#x27; bootleg album as Spunk/This Is Crap.

On 29 October 2007, Virgin released a special 30th-anniversary edition of the album in 180-gram vinyl LP format. The set included a 7-inch insert of &quot;Submission&quot; and poster, as originally released on 28 October 1977. Virgin also reissued the group&#x27;s four singles, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; and &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot;, on 7-inch vinyl, before the album reissue.

In the US and Canada, these re-releases were handled by Warner Bros., which originally released the album in North America and (as of 2017) still owns the regional copyright to the album.

A four-disc boxed set reissue occurred on 24 September 2012. The set includes the original album, which for the first time was digitally remastered from the original master tapes, on disc one. The sound quality of this remaster is thus a significant improvement over all other reissues. The remastering process was overseen by original producer Chris Thomas. The second disc comprises all but one of the band&#x27;s officially released B-sides (omitting &quot;I Wanna Be Me&quot;), which were also remastered. This disc also includes outtakes and demos from the recording sessions for &#x27;NMTB&#x27;, most notably the studio demo of &quot;Belsen Was A Gas&quot;, which had been recently rediscovered and was previously thought lost forever. The third disc contains two live recordings from 1977 (Including the previously unreleased complete soundboard recording of their performance at the Happy House in Stockholm, Sweden on 28 June 1977). The fourth and final disc is a DVD of live and studio videos – as well as audio interviews from 1977. Also included is a full size 100 page hard cover, full color coffee table book which contains rare pictures, articles, and interviews that provides a timelime of the band throughout 1977. Additionally the set includes a full size replica &quot;subway&quot; promotional &#x27;NMTB&#x27; poster, replicas of original promo stickers, a re-print of John Lydon&#x27;s original hand-written lyrics to &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;, and a replica of the original A&amp;M copy of the &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; single. This UMG box set (SEXPISSBOX1977) and the 2002 Virgin box set (SEXBOX1) together contain almost the entire Sex Pistols studio/demo sessions – omitting only three of the June 1976 Dave Goodman demos which can be found on the 2006 officially released remaster of the &quot;Spunk&quot; bootleg.

In 2015, as part of Record Store Day, the album was re-issued as a picture disc, reaching number 7 in the UK&#x27;S Top 40 Vinyl Album Chart.

<text>Urban Hymns is the third studio album by English rock band the Verve, released on 29 September 1997 on Hut Records. The group had broken up while promoting &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; in August 1995, though they reformed two weeks later without guitarist Nick McCabe. Frontman Richard Ashcroft moved to Bath, Somerset, where he made demos; Simon Tong joined the group soon afterwards. Following aborted recording sessions with producers John Leckie and Owen Morris, the band sought a new guitarist, contacting former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, who played with them for a week before departing amidst creative differences. In 1996, The Verve started recording at Olympic Studios in London, first with producer Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover, followed by engineer Chris Potter. Ashcroft contacted McCabe in early 1997, inviting him back into the band, which McCabe accepted. Several songs were re-recorded to allow for the inclusion of McCabe&#x27;s guitar parts, with sessions continuing into May 1997.

&quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; in June 1997; the track suffered from a debate over its writing credits with the use of a sample. &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; followed as the second single from the album in September 1997, which was promoted with three supporting dates for Oasis in London. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; appeared as the third single from the album in November 1997. Nike, Inc. used &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; in an advertisement for three months, which in turn helped promote &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. &quot;Sonnet&quot; was released as the fourth single from the album in March 1998. The Verve played a hometown show at the Haigh Hall in Wigan to an audience of 40,000 in May 1998. The following month, &quot;The Rolling People&quot; was issued as the fifth and final single from the album as a US radio-only release. Citing stress, McCabe sat out of further touring commitments and was replaced by B. J. Cole. They went on a US tour in July and August 1998, leading up to a show at Slane Castle in Dublin, Ireland, before breaking up.

&quot;Urban Hymns&quot; received widespread praise from music critics, many of whom praised Ashcroft&#x27;s role in making the album; several saw it in the context of Britpop; and others touched on the overall quality of the writing. Retrospective reviews focused on how the Verve mixed their new sound with their old sound and on McCabe&#x27;s role in the album. It peaked at number one in Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK and reached the top 10 in Australia, Austria, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, and Portugal. Initially selling 250,000 copies in its first week of release, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; went on to become the fifth fastest-selling album in the UK and has been certified 11-times platinum in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album&#x27;s first three singles peaked within the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; peaking the highest at number one. The BPI have subsequently certified the album&#x27;s songs: &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; at quadruple platinum; &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; at platinum; and &quot;Sonnet&quot; at gold.

At the 1998 Brit Awards, the Verve won Best Album for &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; and Best Producer alongside Youth and Potter. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME,&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; included the album on their lists of the year&#x27;s best releases; &quot;NME&quot; also included it on their list of the 500 best albums of all time, while author Colin Larkin featured it in his book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). It has appeared on best-of lists for the Britpop genre by &quot;Musikexpress&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, alongside &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997) by Radiohead, is seen as leading to the end of Britpop and influencing acts such as Travis. &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was the genre&#x27;s last anthem, while &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; has become a cross-generational song.

==Background==

The Verve released their second studio album, &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, in July 1995 through Hut Records, peaking at number 13 in the UK Albums Chart. Its three singles – &quot;This Is Music&quot;, &quot;On Your Own&quot;, and &quot;History&quot; – all charted within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;History&quot; reaching the highest at number 24. In the lead-up to the album, the culture of the 1990s had shifted with the emergence of new lad and &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine, as well as the continual evolution of football culture and Britpop becoming a mainstream movement. Initial promotion consisted of a one-off show in Newcastle, a supporting slot for Oasis in Scotland, a performance at Phoenix Festival, and a US tour. The strained relationships between the band members came to a head when they performed at T in the Park in August 1995; at its conclusion, frontman Richard Ashcroft announced his departure from the band. Bassist Simon Jones saw the situation as an argument rather than a breakup, though the event was reported in press outlets as the latter.

When the departure was made public, the press could not reach Ashcroft as he was on a camping trip in Cornwall. Unlike the other members of the Verve, Ashcroft was not concerned about his future career path. Being known as the main songwriter in the band, he was seen as a viable option by Hut. Ashcroft&#x27;s reputation for offering soundbites to publications appealed to even people who had no interest in the Verve, giving the label an ideal starting point for a solo career. Following the breakup, Ashcroft spent time in hotels, at friends&#x27; residences, and at his mother&#x27;s home. Co-manager Jane Savage said Ashcroft showed up at the offices of their PR company, Savage &amp; Best, saying that he was going to work with different people and at one point planned to form a six-person band. Within two weeks of the split, Ashcroft started collaborating with Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury again. Author Trevor Baker, in his book &quot;Richard Ashcroft – The Verve, Burning Money &amp; The Human Condition&quot; (2008), said this made the public think that the reported breakup was nothing more than a method to get guitarist Nick McCabe out of the band.

==Development and aborted sessions==
Ashcroft and his wife Kate Radley relocated to Bath, Somerset, renting a flat not far from the residence of Radley&#x27;s parents, where Ashcroft began to get creative. Jones, Salisbury, and Tong moved to London, where they waited for Ashcroft to say he was ready to start recording. In the meantime, Ashcroft made nine demos, which included versions of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, &quot;Sonnet&quot;, and &quot;Space and Time&quot;. Ashcroft asserted that they were not the Verve without McCabe, deciding that the studio time would be for his debut solo album or they would name themselves something else. They drafted Simon Tong, a friend they met at Winstanley College, who was expected to play a keyboard and to accompany Ashcroft&#x27;s guitar parts. Tong had taught Ashcroft and Jones their first chords on guitar some years prior. Co-manager John Best said Ashcroft had accumulated enough songs, that by September 1995, recording was already underway. Sessions were held at Real World Studios in Bath, Somerset, with producer John Leckie, where they made 32 demo recordings, albeit in unfinished states. Leckie explained that nothing was completed because they were too familiar with one another. Ashcroft did not give Hut permission to release the songs, as he was unhappy with them.

Due to the absence of McCabe, who was previously the foundation of the band&#x27;s sound, Ashcroft had to learn how music worked. One such idea saw him coming up with tempos with hand clapping or using a piano and going from there. He struck the instrument, from which he built rhythms. Throughout 1996, Ashcroft hung out with Oasis, becoming interested in how the members worked together. He solely supported Oasis at the Madison Square Garden in New York City; the reception from the crowd convinced him that he could not handle being a solo musician and that he needed a band backing him. MTV reported that the Verve were recording in February 1996. In May 1996, the band started working with producer Owen Morris, who produced &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, at Rockfield Studios in Wales, though they were unable to remake the chemistry that fuelled the &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; sessions. It was expected to last a week, but they only made it to two days. As Best noted, they lacked a guitarist. When he later asked who they were going to get, the four of them responded, It&#x27;s got to be an amazing guitarist!&#x27; And I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Who are the best guitarists? It&#x27;s [former Stone Roses member] John Squire, [former Suede member] Bernard Butler, these sort of people. Both of these had left their previous acts, giving the Verve the opportunity to ask either of them. Ashcroft and Best were later at a party with Squire in attendance, though Ashcroft did not wish to approach him.

Ashcroft then met with Butler, at Best&#x27;s suggestion; Butler had previously collaborated with David McAlmont until that partnership dissolved. Best knew him through his prior work with Suede and asked Geoff Travis of Rough Trade Records about getting him for the quartet. Travis did not think Butler would be interested in the endeavour, but to Best&#x27;s surprise, he agreed. Ashcroft was unsure about the situation, as he had only previously played with childhood friends and saw Butler, despite his reputation, as a stranger. After a week, Butler contacted Best about what was happening, prompting him to get a taxi for Ashcroft in order to meet Butler. The band and Butler jammed for a week, working on &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; and &quot;Sonnet&quot;, though Ashcroft brushed aside these sessions, saying that it was only two days in a practice room and that there was no chemistry between them and Butler. Despite him considering Butler a perfect guitarist, the arrangement was deemed a disappointment as Butler wished to contribute his songs in addition to working on Ashcroft&#x27;s own. Best, putting the lack of a guitarist situation aside, set about finding another producer for them. He thought that Ashcroft&#x27;s bohemian, devotional personality could work well with Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover from Killing Joke. Youth owned The Butterfly studio, which was located in Brixton, London; they met him at the location, chalking up a rapport with him. Ashcroft played the recently-written &quot;Lucky Man&quot; for Youth, who was enthusiastic about it.

==Recording==
===Youth sessions and Big Life management===
By mid-1996, the quartet were recording at Olympic Studios in London. Youth set a condition that they would all arrive at the studio by 10 a.m., and work through until the evening; by then, they would go home. Youth convinced Ashcroft to abandon the Stone Roses influences in their sound and aim for a traditional, classic rock direction. In addition to this, he wanted Ashcroft to continue working on a track known as &quot;Stones Song&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. Ashcroft liked Youth&#x27;s restrictions and was relieved that his hedonistic tendencies were reined in when they were working, though he eventually started showing up later to the studio. Throughout the sessions, the recording tapes were designated as &quot;Richard Ashcroft&quot;, while Youth wrote &quot;The Verve&quot; on boards, and Ashcroft had to correct him. Ashcroft did not plan to reuse the Verve&#x27;s name, though he knew that it would sell more if it was labelled as such. He saw it as an act of fraud to use the Verve moniker, similar to the Doors without Jim Morrison or the Clash without Mick Jones. Youth said that Ashcroft wished to preserve the memory of the band prior to their breakup. He was aware that McCabe had served as a foil for Ashcroft, acting akin to an alter ego. While there was not a name for the band, Ashcroft planned to title the album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. &quot;Space and Time&quot; was the first song they attempted to record; the initial run-through ended up too fast, while a subsequent iteration the next day produced a version too slow.
During this time, Oasis performed at Knebworth, which was viewed as the zenith of Britpop. Ashcroft was frustrated with the Verve&#x27;s success beyond the UK, debating if Best could give them a Knebworth-like moment. Best was occupied managing three separate companies and was unable to fulfil Ashcroft&#x27;s desire to be his main priority as he was busy working with vocalists Brett Anderson from Suede and Jarvis Cocker from Pulp. Best had unintentionally put Ashcroft in contact with his future management team when the band were working with Youth. The latter was being managed by Big Life, which was operated by Jazz Summers. Upon hearing the new material, Summers told Ashcroft that he could make them the most popular act on the planet. Ashcroft appreciated Summers&#x27; enthusiasm for his songs, and he liked him on a personal level, referring to him as a maverick like himself. By this point, Summers was known for helping to break British acts in the US, such as Lisa Stansfield and Wham!. This became the catalyst for Ashcroft wanting to work with Big Life. Baker said that though Savage &amp; Best had success with Britpop acts Pulp and Suede, Summers&#x27; company gave Ashcroft the opportunity to move beyond the indie credibility they had ascertained.

While the material was taking shape, Ashcroft was concerned that there was something missing. Youth&#x27;s orders gave them focused recording sessions, which at times were creatively stifling, in contrast to the free-form jam sessions they used to have. Over several months, Ashcroft had been thinking of McCabe. Youth recounted that Ashcroft often mentioned how good of a musician McCabe was during the sessions. Simon Clarke of the Kick Horns, who had previously worked with the Verve on &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, said that the sessions had a different atmosphere. Kick Horns went into the studio, recorded their parts, and left, feeling like they had less of a rapport with the Verve. Saxophonist Tim Sanders, also acknowledging the tonal shift, said it was an Ashcroft-led environment and was unsure if anything they made ended up on the finished album. He was aware they were repeating parts they employed on &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, contemplating if they were needed as they were &quot;just fattening things out.&quot;

In the run-up to Christmas 1996, strings were recorded for &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. Ashcroft and string arranger Wil Malone came up with two separate arrangements for it, both centred around the chord progression of &quot;The Last Time&quot;, which was chopped and looped. Ashcroft intended for the arrangement to be cinematic, a modern take on the work of Ennio Morricone. Complex vocal arrangements were recorded for the track, where Ashcroft sang in different styles for different takes, such as staccato in one and a gruffer vocal in another. Egan likened this approach to something listeners could hear on old Motown singles instead of a typical indie band. Youth first saw the song&#x27;s potential as a single, despite Potter and other people doubting his vision, until they heard the final recording. Over time, Youth slowly withdrew from the proceedings, allowing Potter to take more control, until Youth left altogether after Christmas.

===Potter sessions and McCabe&#x27;s return===
Virgin Records had spent £2 million on the recording sessions at this stage. Potter contributed more to the production direction with the band, who were aware of his lack of credentials as a studio worker. Ashcroft was satisfied with this, as he did not want a controlling person in charge. Ashcroft felt that what they were working on did not sound like the Verve, missing what Baker saw as the chemistry that prior sessions had with McCabe. It ultimately dawned on him that he needed McCabe for the album. After reaching this conclusion, there was initially trouble contacting McCabe in early January 1997. Ashcroft called McCabe&#x27;s flat in Wigan and then his mother, eventually finding him at a friend&#x27;s place. Ashcroft reportedly said that he would quit music if McCabe did not rejoin them, while McCabe told Ashcroft that he wanted to tell him to go away but was pleased about the contact. McCabe&#x27;s return was met with an air of hostility from people at Virgin Records, as they, in his words, had the notion that the Verve had a strong album and were worried that McCabe was going to change it into something akin to krautrock.

Tong stayed in the Verve, being able to provide guitar and keyboard parts. Up to this point, they had tracked 15 songs. McCabe&#x27;s arrival did not mean they needed to scrap any of this material. He complimented the material, though mentioning that the proceedings had stalled. McCabe said that a few of the tracks were created by using loops, which had the side effect of forcing the music into segments of four bars that had minimal changes between them. He subsequently had Potter, who he thought was acting in the engineering role instead of as a producer, rent a Pro-Tools rig, which the pair used for improvisational purposes. Several of the tracks that were deemed finished were re-recorded in order for McCabe to add his guitar parts, such as &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;. When he heard &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, he decided to add a guitar part similar to the one heard in &quot;The Calvary Cross&quot; (1974) by Richard Thompson. McCabe listened to the material they did with Leckie, such as &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; and an early iteration of &quot;A Song for the Lovers&quot; (2000) with Tong on guitar, which he praised. While the songs benefitted from McCabe&#x27;s playing, there was some discussion about his return in a personal way, with Salisbury initially being hesitant about the situation; Ashcroft found it easier to communicate when working together with McCabe.

With the shift in the producer role, the sessions became more fruitful. Youth said Ashcroft came across as claustrophobic when he was working with them, despite how productive his strict methods were. At this point, Ashcroft felt they needed more tracks to work with. Before any further work commenced, the band were perplexed to find that recordings from the initial sessions at Olympic had surfaced on the internet. Baker said that barely two years prior, it was very uncommon for people to be trading audio files online, and this had become prevalent by this point. They returned to recording in February 1997, tracking re-recorded versions of &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; outtakes &quot;The Rolling People&quot; and &quot;Come On&quot;. Baker said these new renditions were a noticeable improvement to the extent that they influenced the Verve to try and reclaim the energy they had in 1994. As such, there was a return to the improvisational style that the band were more familiar with. A ten-day session in May 1997 at Olympic saw the creation of &quot;Weeping Willow&quot;, &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Stamped&quot;, &quot;Three Steps&quot;, and &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. Baker said the band played together with no direction in mind as Ashcroft sang &quot;whatever came into his head over the top and Nick tore strange sounds out of his guitar.&quot;

&quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; evolved from the rest of the band listening to McCabe as he messed around with a guitar that was enhanced by an effects unit. They spent the next 30 minutes jamming around this, finishing the song. It initially lasted half an hour until it was edited down to over six minutes. The bulk of &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; was done while McCabe attended a wedding, and when he came back, Baker said he contributed a powerfully psychedelic, effects-enhanced guitar part to what the band had recorded. As the recording lasted for longer than was planned, the band were under pressure to finish it up. For the mixing sessions, Potter worked from partway through the morning one day until 4 a.m. the following morning. Hut was content with the material they listened to, though they were bemoaning how long the sessions were lasting and gave the band a deadline. As mixing was wrapping up, &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; was recorded at the last minute when McCabe began playing with a loop. It was started and completed over the course of 11 hours, finishing at 7 a.m. on the last booked studio day. Nine months were spent recording and mixing the album, collectively.

==Composition==
===Music===
The music of &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; has been described as Britpop, indie rock, orchestral rock, psychedelic, and post-Britpop, in the vein of Big Star and Oasis. Author Velimir Ilic noted in his book &quot;The Verve: Mad Urban Soul&quot; (1997) that mid-tempo compositions that owed their debts to Roxy Music, alongside giving it references, points to the likes of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; (1968) by Van Morrison, &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979) by Pink Floyd, and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972) by the Rolling Stones. Max Pilley of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; commented that with McCabe and Potter working on the album, the work of Amon Düül II and Spacemen 3 acted as influences in its creation. Ashcroft&#x27;s vocals have been compared to those of U2 frontman Bono during the &quot;October&quot; (1981) era. &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; string-laden ballad &quot;History&quot; acted as a prototype for the material on &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. On the latter album, the songs did not feature the typical publishing credit attributed to all of the band members. Indicative of the album&#x27;s phases of recording, some of the tracks were credited solely to Ashcroft, the Verve collectively, or in one case, to McCabe and the Verve. McCabe said in 2017 that these credits were a form of revisionism as every member of the band contributed ideas to the songs, adding that their manager pushed to have Ashcroft as the writer. Baker said a difference was noticeable in the material Ashcroft wrote before, like &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, and after marrying Radley, with &quot;Sonnet&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; touching on contentment in the music.

Author Martin Clarke wrote in his book &quot;The Verve: Crazed Highs + Horrible Lows&quot; (1998) that &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;″ strength lies in the material Ashcroft wrote on his own without McCabe, such as &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, &quot;Sonnet&quot;, &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. Upon McCabe&#x27;s reappearance, Clarke noted a shift towards the improvisation style of the Verve&#x27;s older material. He saw a stark contrast with the common factor being Ashcroft, as he wrote: &quot;To put it bluntly, The Verve&#x27;s balladry is currently unparalleled, but their rockier songs are more ordinary.&quot; Baker wrote that the album was accessible to people who had little regard for popular music, while at the same time, it came across as their most mature work. He gave the string section in &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; as an example, stating that if the prior releases from the band &quot;had worn jeans and a t-shirt, this one was dressed up like James Bond.&quot; Author Philip Wilding, in his book &quot;The Verve: Bitter Sweet&quot; (1998), remarked that the album sounded as if it were from a different decade than it was released in, highlighting the elements of psychedelia, the loud–quiet dynamic, and Ashcroft&#x27;s boisterous taunting. Baker saw it as the Verve trying to merge two separate sides of themselves, mentioning the classic pop writing of &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; and the urge to create contemporary rock music. He added that the Verve were proud that they did not need to make songs that harkened to music from the past, in contrast to Britpop acts like Oasis. Clarke wrote that Ashcroft shone as a vocalist on the album, conveying his emotions on the acoustic songs while also being able to be aggressive when needed.

===Lyrics and themes===
Journalist Neil Strauss, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, summarised &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; as tackling depression while smiling; appreciating the dark days in life as a positive day was probably to follow it. With the album&#x27;s lyrics, Ashcroft became more open, as he reached a point where he no longer felt that he had to hide behind unnecessary imagery in his words. He intentionally altered his lyrical style for &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. Egan said the lyrical transformation of leaving behind such allusions that had started with &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was completed by &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. Ashcroft commented that the most difficult thing for him to comprehend lately was that it was difficult to fully know a person and for a person to fully know him: &quot;When you grow up you learn to belong by covering yourself up. We&#x27;re not allowed to break through those doors and shout, &#x27;This is me! Who are you, for fuck&#x27;s sake!&#x27; You&#x27;ve got to open up yourself and that&#x27;s why, lyrically, after five years, I&#x27;ve opened up in this new album.&quot;

Egan said one thematic element of the album stemmed from Ashcroft witnessing that they lacked &quot;one &#x27;self&#x27;, that they are so complex as to make the notion of a single self ridiculous (hence &#x27;I&#x27;m a million different people from one day to the next,&#x27; from &#x27;Bitter Sweet Symphony&#x27;). It wasn&#x27;t realisation which produced a comfortable feeling.&quot; Andrew Rumsey of &quot;Third Way&quot; wrote about a trend in popular music that revolved around the theme of despair, singling out &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995) by Radiohead and &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; as two releases that were partially hopeful despite this. Clarke noted the emphasis on love in the majority of the songs, which he attributed to Ashcroft&#x27;s marriage to Radley. Wilding also pointed out the love theme, adding that it also discussed the human condition, understanding that life is an enigma. He said it was not simply about Ashcroft being direct; &quot;It was going to be bigger than that.&quot;

==Songs==
===Tracks 1–7===
The opening track of &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, is centred around an orchestral arrangement of &quot;The Last Time&quot; by the Rolling Stones. It was taken from &quot;The Rolling Stones Songbook&quot; (1966), which that band&#x27;s manager Andrew Loog Oldham had created. Upon hearing the reworking, Ashcroft wanted to reimagine it as a piece of pop-art. He focused on one orchestral lick that stood out to him. Ashcroft thought that he could change it into another song; he started to loop four bars that included its strings and bells instrumentation and made a new track from it. Baker said Ashcroft repeated a process that he employed on the songs found on &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, monologuing the entire vocal section over an existing piece of music. The song&#x27;s lyrics were influenced by a work he read at school, &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1949), by Arthur Miller and its main character, Willy Loman. Baker said the latter was a typically average man, trying to make a living and yearning for money before ultimately dying without any fortune. Despite this origin, Baker said &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; appeared substantially more positive. The final album version merged Britpop with boom bap, backed by a trip hop beat, with vocals that were layered in order to make it appear like an angelic choir. Malone&#x27;s looped strings served as an inverse of Ashcroft&#x27;s sermon-esque lyrics. Baker said McCabe offered these peculiar &quot;swirling guitar sounds&quot;, which appear shortly prior to Ashcroft&#x27;s voice.

&quot;Sonnet&quot; had a stripped-back atmosphere compared to &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and was one of many tracks on the album that encapsulated Ashcroft&#x27;s life in the preceding few years. Baker said it could be about the start or the demise of a relationship, backed by string parts and an acoustic guitar, the latter of which he felt was subdued compared to its appearance in the later track on the album, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. &quot;Sonnet&quot; employed one of Ashcroft&#x27;s new songwriting techniques, which Egan described as &quot;pulsing textures&quot; in the form of handclaps under the vocal melody. Egan wrote that the lyrics showcase a man who is trying to romance a potential lover, despite being self-aware as to how he is unsuccessfully coming across to them. He compared the minor electric guitar parts to what a listener could hear on FM stations in the US. &quot;The Rolling People&quot; evokes the Verve&#x27;s earlier work, opening with what Baker described as gale sounds, &quot;as though it&#x27;s being recorded in a desolate wilderness somewhere.&quot; Egan said it was about making sacrifices when trying to survive day-to-day, such as telling white lies while being polite. It takes elements of &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; (1972) by Aphrodite&#x27;s Child and &quot;I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody&#x27;s Got a Thing&quot; (1970) by Funkadelic, while evoking &quot;Ramble On&quot; (1969) by Led Zeppelin and &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1969) by the Rolling Stones.

&quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; dates back to 1995, when Ashcroft revealed the song&#x27;s existence in an interview with &quot;Select&quot;. In this, he explained that he took drugs despite them making him feel dreadful, as a way of coping with irritation and boredom. Ashcroft changed one of the pronouns from &quot;me&quot; to &quot;you&quot; in the released rendition of the track, which Baker noted led to speculation about the song&#x27;s backstory, such as one analysis saying it was about his deceased father. Ashcroft himself viewed it as a love song about how drugs did not have the same effectiveness they previously had. Egan suggested that the song&#x27;s protagonist attempts to escape his misery through other means until he realises that he can no longer suppress the pain he is experiencing. Egan said Ashcroft was conscious that a few of the lyrics appeared contradictory, though he did not substantially edit them so as to appear deceitful when he wrote them in a specific headspace, along with liking the ambiguity afforded to other musicians, such as Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and John Lennon of the Beatles. Baker attributed the rawness of Ashcroft&#x27;s voice to it being the first take he recorded for the song.

The introduction to &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; was compared to the Beatles during their Eastern music period, with a guitar riff heard in the distance. Baker saw it as a strange blend of &quot;bucolic psychedelia and something much more brutal and industrial.&quot; Matthew Horton of &quot;NME&quot; saw it as a mix of 1980s acts Cocteau Twins and Happy Mondays. The song discusses lucid dreaming; Egan said the lyrics shared a similar sentiment as &quot;One Day&quot; in that they place importance on the perspective of children. He explained that Ashcroft focused on rediscovering his younger self in his mind and leaning from them as he entered adulthood. Egan pointed out one aspect of Ashcroft&#x27;s childhood that influenced the track: a family event where Ashcroft was chided for speaking out of turn. Clarke felt that the track&#x27;s music and lacklustre lyrics made it more appropriate for &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; than &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;.

Baker considered &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; to be a musical counterpart to the &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; track &quot;Brainstorm Interlude&quot;, acting as a break in the album. It lacked any form of chorus section or hook, serving as an extended outro, with Ashcroft&#x27;s voice being placed lower in the mix while McCabe can be heard contributing ambient guitar parts, recalling the work of Jeff Buckley. Horton wrote that the atonal change in the track shifts the mood from hazy to eerie, divulging &quot;something ugly beneath the stoner bliss.&quot; Egan said the lyrics made it appear as a follow-up to &quot;History&quot;, with it dwelling on the nighttime and a person being lonely. Wilding suggested that these themes were possibly the result of the song&#x27;s creation in the early hours of the morning. &quot;Space and Time&quot; is the oldest song to appear on the album, having been performed by Ashcroft while in New York with Oasis, where Ashcroft demonstrates his vocal range. The track deals with an unsuccessful love affair. Baker thought that the band seemed unsure of themselves, as the track is unclear in its direction, acting as a ballad interspersed with abrupt moments of rock. &quot;Space and Time&quot; and &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; showcase the band aping the sound of U2, a direction that Ryan Leas of Stereogum commented was not previously possible because of the Verve&#x27;s former tendency to use lots of guitars altered by effects units.

===Tracks 8–13===
&quot;Weeping Willow&quot; is a personal song that includes allusions to drugs and guns. Egan said it had a refrain where the narrator needs to be saved, a frequent topic in Ashcroft&#x27;s material from this time period. Ashcroft said the guitars in it came across as the work of Neil Young playing in Hell; Clarke suggested that the Verve&#x27;s previous tours with Oasis had influenced them as he compared the track to the 1995 Oasis songs &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; and &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is a simpler-sounding track that differs from the rest of the rock tracks heard on the album. Baker remarked that it appeared as a duet with the string parts and Ashcroft, going as far as to say it was a direct collaboration between Ashcroft and Malone, as much as it was a song by the rest of the Verve. McCabe&#x27;s role on the track was instead played by Tong, whose style Baker dubbed &quot;much cleaner and brighter.&quot; The lyrics discuss Ashcroft&#x27;s involvement with Radley, with the level of affection increasing by the song&#x27;s conclusion. Wilding said Ashcroft commented on the positive experiences to be had in life. Egan compared the influence of Radley on Ashcroft to that of Sara Dylan for &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot; (1966) by Bob Dylan and Patti Boyd for &quot;Something&quot; (1969) and &quot;Layla&quot; (1970) by Derek and the Dominos.

&quot;One Day&quot; is a ballad that has Ashcroft duetting with himself through the use of multi-tracking. The lyrics were influenced by a newspaper story that he saw where a man discusses journeying around the world in a tiny boat. During one section of his trek, the man consumed alcohol and was tied to the mast, thinking that he was going to die. Egan said the lyric that alludes to this in the song touches on the &quot;fundamentals of existence [...] implying the passing of all things - good and bad - over time.&quot; He added that it also refers to Ashcroft talking about artists that involve themselves in drama &quot;of the raging elements&quot;, while other lyrics of the song detail individuals being unable to find the happiness they experienced when they were children. Clarke thought it was derivative and too dissimilar to &quot;Lucky Man&quot;; Ashcroft explored the sound of &quot;One Day&quot; on his subsequent solo albums.

In &quot;This Time&quot;, Ashcroft declares that in the future, he would be able to fly; it was initially titled &quot;Discordant&quot;, which Baker attributed to the combination of piano and drum parts. The noise heard in the background came about from the band using coat hangers against the recording tape. Egan called this improvisation method akin to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, whom Ashcroft highly admired. The hypnotic atmosphere stemming from this earned it a comparison to the material on &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;. Clarke thought the track sounded like something from 1989, highlighting Ashcroft&#x27;s spoken-word voice, guitars in the vein of Squire, and a shuffling drum pattern. The song depicts a man pondering the mistakes he has made throughout his life and agreeing with himself not to lament them but to better himself by learning from what he has done. Egan said he was surprised by how direct the lyrics were, featuring largely the evocative imagery previously associated with Ashcroft&#x27;s songs. The sole line that is closest to this, &quot;Gonna rise into the light&quot;, acts as a statement of self-improvement without needing to stick to a firm philosophy or religion.

The title of &quot;Velvet Morning&quot; was a tribute to Lee Hazlewood, who gave Nancy Sinatra the song &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; (1967). Egan said the character in Ashcroft&#x27;s song had a different issue from Hazlewood&#x27;s song, acknowledging that no single person had a useful method of fixing the problems in the world. Ashcroft wished to have a similar raw vocal effect that Hazlewood employed when he sang with Sinatra. Subsequently, his voice was treated with a loudhailer that he got from a car boot sale a week prior to recording, which was promptly stuck to his microphone. As they felt the song was missing something, Tong went upstairs in the studio to borrow a pedal steel guitar from Eric Clapton, who was recording at the time. The guitars eventually earned a comparison to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, while the song overall evoked Neil Diamond.

Clarke suggested that the closing track on &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, &quot;Come On&quot;, was named after the phrase Ashcroft frequently shouts while on a stage. Ashcroft referred to the song as a battle cry for those that need to hear it; part of the lyrics have him trying to contact God using a phonebox. Ashcroft can be heard saying &quot;fuck you!&quot; which ends the album. Egan reasoned that the phrase was not intended to be said negatively, instead serving as an extension of the song itself: &quot;linked to the galvanising nature of the instrumentation, a &#x27;fuck you&#x27; of joy shouted by a man riding on a sea of raging guitars.&quot; Liam Gallagher of Oasis does the backing vocals on the track, screaming the titular phrase. The song was compared to the material on &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; due to its aggression. Baker said it shared qualities with &quot;The Rolling People&quot;, such as Ashcroft&#x27;s ranting vocal style and guitars sounding like rottweilers. The backing track was done in a single day, which Baker said lent it a &quot;ferocious energy&quot; to conclude the album with; it recalled the works of Led Zeppelin, MC5, and the Stooges. Following &quot;Come On&quot; is the hidden track &quot;Deep Freeze&quot;, which consists of noise from a radio, incomprehensible dialogue, jangly guitar parts, and a baby crying.

==Artwork and packaging==
To usher in this new period for the Verve, designer Brian Cannon set about to make a template for the band&#x27;s releases. Egan said the previous way of making elaborate set pieces was ditched. For the album, Ashcroft told Cannon that he did not want anything too complex for the artwork, wanting the music to speak for itself. The cover photo was a group shot that Egan said was peculiar, as the members did not want to intentionally pose for it. To compromise, the band, Cannon, and photographer Michael Spencer Jones visited Richmond Park in London solely to see what a photography session might result in. Another photographer was present to also take some images, which made Jones feel awkward. The Verve was sitting on the grass as they were waiting for a lighting set-up to be finished when they witnessed a deer herd roaming around the park.

When Jones observed that the members of the Verve had relaxed, he decided to take an image, though none of the band were aware at the session. The subsequent photograph shows nearly all of the members, bar McCabe, facing left. Rumours, which were dismissed by Baker, Cannon, and Egan, were posted on the Internet where the word &quot;love&quot; was allegedly hidden in the front cover while looking at the sky, trees, and Ashcroft&#x27;s hat. Cannon retrospectively told Baker that it was his least favourite cover design he helped create. In the album&#x27;s inner sleeve, a black Labrador Retriever can be seen playing with the band, who are laughing at it; the dog, which was named Charlie, belonged to Ashcroft. Wilding saw this as a big contrast to how the band are seen in the artwork for &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, which, to him, seemed like a dissimilar band of people.

==Release==
===&quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; single and sample dispute===

The Verve&#x27;s return was not formally announced until May 1997, the reveal of which was met with scepticism; critics had diverted their prospects to the likes of Radiohead and Stereophonics. During the time the Verve were absent, Britpop started to decline in popularity as electronica and its associated acts, such as the Chemical Brothers, the Prodigy, and Underworld, grew in prominence. Prior to &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; being issued, the Oldham sample had to be cleared. The band were hopeful about it, having learnt that Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards enjoyed the song. The copyright for the sample was owned by businessman Allen Klein and his company, ABKCO Records. Before the single&#x27;s planned release date, ABCKO declined clearance for it. Klein said he did not like sampling as a concept and would not allow it for a Rolling Stones song. Summers set about to persuade Klein, as he felt the track had the chance to make a lot of money for both parties. Annoyed by it, Summers contacted the US offices of Virgin Records, asking for assistance in the situation. Virgin&#x27;s vice chairman Nancy Berry contacted Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both of whom wrote &quot;The Last Time&quot;, and played them &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. Though the pair liked the song, they did not want to be involved with the dispute as it meant crossing Klein.

Summers sought EMI president Ken Berry; EMI controlled Virgin, and by extension, albums by the Rolling Stones and the Verve. Berry, who liked the song, promptly went to Klein&#x27;s office and played it for him. Upon hearing the track, Klein enjoyed the song and gave permission for the sample. His terms of agreement were for 50% of all royalties, the standard percentage for samples, which the Verve agreed to. ABKCO contacted them again shortly before the song&#x27;s release, demanding 100%, though this bid was too late to have an effect. &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was eventually released as a single on 16 June 1997, while a version remixed by James Lavelle was released on 28 July 1997. Egan said the song listed &quot;farcically complicated credits&quot;, denoting a performance by the Andrew Oldham Orchestra, production credit to Oldham, with vocals from Ashcroft. The writing credits were changed to Jagger–Richards and lyrics from Ashcroft, with publishing going to ABCKO. The song became an unanticipated success, with a significant portion of the money going towards Klein&#x27;s company.

As the song was longer than three-and-a-half minutes, the typical length of a pop song, several American radio stations did not play the song. Ashcroft was told that he should edit the track&#x27;s length, being warned that if they did not, radio stations would and it would not be registered as a &quot;play&quot; in their systems. Baker said the music video propelled the song&#x27;s success, becoming one of the most-watched and parodied videos of the 1990s. The video, which was filmed as the recording sessions for the album were concluding, has Ashcroft walking down a pavement as he mimed the song&#x27;s lyrics. Ashcroft came into contact with other pedestrians along the way, appearing oblivious as he bumped into them or knocked them to the floor. It was shot on Hoxton Street in North London over several days due to the inclement weather. It was directed by Walter Stern, who previously directed the videos for &quot;Breathe&quot; (1996) and &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1996), both by the Prodigy. The video served as a tribute to the video for &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; (1991) by Massive Attack; their vocalist Shara Nelson is seen in a street in Los Angeles, California, also disregarding people that were close by. Baker remarked that while Nelson appeared to be lost in her thoughts, Ashcroft had &quot;more belligerence and aggression&quot; time, accurately depicting his &quot;single-mindedness, not to mention his ability to brush aside people who got in his way or who couldn&#x27;t keep up.&quot; Ashcroft loathed that his stare was becoming a defining aspect of his personality and explained he was seriously angry while filming it. Following the success of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, people that had not heard of the band&#x27;s name were now recognising Ashcroft when he went out.

===&quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; singles and album release===
&quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; was released as a single on 1 September 1997. The music video for the song was directed by Andy Baybutt and George Hanson and filmed at the flat of Hut Records boss Dave Boyd in London. The band wanted the music video to appear on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Chart Show&quot; without the standard captions that were superimposed on other videos it showed. &quot;The Chart Show&quot; alleged that one of its employees revealed that Ashcroft&#x27;s illness, which resulted in a cancelled UK tour, was fake as he saw Ashcroft at a Spiritualized show at that time. They said the band were being petty in retaliation with the captions. Summers did not like the show&#x27;s stance on the matter and withheld a tape copy of the video from them. As a result, the show aired a portion of the &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; video and gave more airtime to a Portishead video.

Ashcroft assumed part of the album&#x27;s success came from radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, who had previously ignored &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; and, in particular, its track &quot;History&quot;. He saw it as stations, coupled with British press outlets, feeling guilty for not backing &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;. &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations in the US in September 1997 and pushed to mainstream radio the following month. Support for the US airplay came from music publicist Scott Piering; MTV writer Chris Nelson said the track was a leftfield choice as radio stations were enamoured with the ska revival and summer-themed songs from the likes of Smash Mouth and Sugar Ray, in addition to post-grunge. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was released in the UK on 29 September 1997 and issued in the US the following day.

&quot;Lucky Man&quot; released as a single on 24 November 1997. The song&#x27;s music video was directed again by Baybutt and Henson. Another video, subtitled the US version, was directed by Jamie Thraves. In the video, the band are seen in an apartment, which is looking out to the water below. Ashcroft is holding a guitar and singing the song while pacing around the room as the other members can be seen looking unfazed by him. Baker suggested that this could have stemmed from the members not wishing to be in the spotlight like Ashcroft. It was released to modern rock radio stations in the US in April 1998. They did not wish to put out any further singles after &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, wanting to instead focus on performing live. Near the end of 1997, Ashcroft stepped down from doing interviews, saying he was annoyed with having to defend and explain himself all the time.

===Nike advert and later promotion===
Though the Verve had been sent substantial offers, none of their music had featured in advertising placements. Numerous advertising agencies wanted to use &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, but they were denied. While the band had power over the recording, they did not over the publishing. If they wished, ABKCO could have musicians make a different recording since the Verve did not want to use their own. Summers cautioned the band that it could end up to advertise the likes of General Motors and Nike, Inc. Nike initially contacted ABKCO about using Oldham&#x27;s version of &quot;The Last Time&quot;. The advert&#x27;s targeted audience of younger people would not be familiar with the Oldham rendition, and despite this, they picked it as they thought the Verve would not let them use &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;. When Nike finished making a deal with Klein, they explained to Summers that he should let them use &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; as everyone would think it was the Verve anyway if they went with the Oldham recording.

Summers discussed the matter with the band, who reluctantly let Nike use the song for three months with the view that it could stop others from using it, acknowledging that Nike had a positive past of making creative advertising plans. Baker suggested that, in the US, the commercial gave the song considerably more reach than airplay could have. The Verve earned $700,000 from the deal, which was split between Red Cross Landmines and the homeless shelter charity Youth 2000. Ashcroft watched two videos of the commercial that he was sent and did not like them. Despite this, when the advertisement started airing, there was an uptick in sales of the album in the US. Egan said the Nike commercial was essentially a free advertisement for the album, with it playing multiple times a day across the country. The band&#x27;s issued a statement, explaining that had they not lost the publishing to Klein, the commercial would not have happened in the first place.

Following this, they said they were not giving any further interviews to press outlets, with the exception of cover stories. Clarke noted that with how popular the Verve were at this stage, instead of forcing publications to give them front page stories, the magazine editors picked other acts instead, such as &quot;Spin&quot; with Travis, ignoring the Verve altogether. Journalists could only enquire about the Verve&#x27;s live performances, as other topics were off-limits. As a result, the band alienated a significant portion of the media in the US. Hut Records asked the Verve to issue another single in early 1998. Despite their reluctance, &quot;Sonnet&quot; was released as a single on 2 March 1998, albeit in a format that made it ineligible for charting: a collection of four 12-inch vinyl records with the song and its B-sides, &quot;Stamped&quot;, &quot;So Sister&quot;, and &quot;Echo Bass&quot;, spread across each disc. Limited to 5,000 copies, it was packaged into a cardboard mailer; the previous three singles were reissued on the same day, with the intention of them fitting into the mailer. The music video for &quot;Sonnet&quot; was filmed by Chris Palmer. Shortly afterwards, the band earned the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;; the cover story discussed the band&#x27;s presence in the US.

After long-form documentary videos by Black Grape and Radiohead, the Verve announced they would be doing the same thing with the tentatively titled &quot;This Is The Verve: Do Not Panic&quot;. Filmed by Hanson and Baybutt, it contained footage of their UK and US tours throughout 1997, live performances, and interviews. &quot;The Rolling People&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations in the US in June 1998, followed by &quot;Sonnet&quot; in July 1998. On 27 April 1999, the band&#x27;s management released a statement detailing their decision to breakup; Ashcroft said the band could have kept working had their situation been different. Though Ashcroft did not explain the circumstances, commenters suggested a rift between Ashcroft and McCabe. McCabe said no conversation was held about the break-up, which he learnt through a relative, who in turn said they heard the announcement on the radio.

&quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, &quot;Sonnet&quot;, &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s second compilation album, &quot;This Is Music: The Singles 92–98&quot; (2004), while music videos for all of them were featured on the video album of the same name. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was re-pressed on vinyl in 2008, 2016, 2018, and 2022. In 2017, an expanded version of the album was issued, including B-sides, outtakes, BBC Radio 1 session material, and live recordings from several shows. A CD of unreleased material for it was vetoed by Ashcroft; McCabe was frustrated by this, saying Ashcroft was the last person to contribute to the box set, adding: &quot;It runs counter to his narrative. I think he&#x27;s so wrapped up in this notion of Urban Hymns being his solo album and the existence of that CD probably rankles with him.&quot; Ashcroft did not involve himself in the reissues of their prior two albums; McCabe said Ashcroft only got involved with the one for &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; as he saw it as his debut solo album. Despite this, only Simon Jones and McCabe handled the press interviews for the reissue. In the same month of the box set&#x27;s release, several unreleased tracks, demos, and different mixes that were omitted from it were leaked on YouTube. The person behind the uploads had received the songs from a friend that handled distribution at UMC.

==Touring==
===Initial treks and Haigh Hall===
In the lead-up to the Verve&#x27;s first live show in nearly two years, Ashcroft was in pain while they rehearsed. The gig at The Leadmill in Sheffield on 14 June 1997 was cancelled a few days before it took place. It was discovered that because of the stress of the recording sessions, Ashcroft had swollen lymph glands in his neck, which caused issues when he tried to sing, eventually leading to him collapsing. He told the &quot;NME&quot; that he was not interested in the show to start with, while the rest of the band were. When he went to a doctor, he was recommended to cease working for six weeks, resulting in the cancellation of other shows in June 1997 and forcing new shows to be booked for later in the year. The band finally returned to live performances on 9 August 1997 at The Leadmill. After some more shows, they performed at the Reading Festival, where they headlined the Melody Maker stage.

Following a month&#x27;s break, they supported Oasis for three shows at Earls Court in London, between 25 and 27 September 1997, to a collective crowd of 60,000. Egan said that after the success of both &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, it turned the perception of these support dates into special events. He saw it as a form of Battle of the Bands between two popular British rock bands vying to win over support from critics and the general public. Ashcroft felt that, given the Verve&#x27;s recent increase in popularity, they were able to hold their own against Oasis.

After another month&#x27;s break, the Verve embarked on a US tour; around this time, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; became a hit in the country, with its success owed to MTV for keeping the video in constant rotation. The trek consisted of 12 dates, ending in late November 1997. They played at a WHFS-sponsored Christmas festival and were due to appear at the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas festival, but had to pull out because of a death in Ashcroft&#x27;s family. US dates in a few months&#x27; time were postponed as Ashcroft wanted to recuperate. Tickets for European shows, which went on sale by the end of the year, had sold out within two hours. To avoid the excess of previous treks, Ashcroft went on a detoxing holiday in Spain for two weeks. At the start of 1998, the band went on a UK tour of mid-sized venues, despite being able to fill arenas at this stage. In lieu of appearing at the Brit Awards, they instead played at a homelessness benefit that same night. As a result of the Nike advert, a tour of theatre venues was moved to bigger locations.

A one-off show was held at Haigh Hall in Haigh, Wigan, Greater Manchester, on 24 May 1998 to a crowd of nearly 40,000. They were supported by John Martyn and Beck, both of whom did not impress the audience. McCabe did not wish to continue touring; at Summers&#x27; suggestion, he saw a doctor, who told him that he was suffering from glandular fever. It was recommended that he take a two-month break, and when he told the rest of the band, the members individually talked him into continuing with the touring. During a performance in France, Ashcroft threw a bottle at McCabe, who reacted angrily. Later in the evening, he threw objects around a room in frustration. Summers called McCabe repeatedly in an attempt to get a rise out of him, in order for him to say I quit&#x27;, but I never did.&quot; The Verve planned to appear at the Tibetan Freedom Concert festival in the US in June 1998 but had to cancel when Jones became ill while on tour in Germany. This subsequently saw the cancellation of three further shows in the country, one festival appearance in Sweden, and another in Italy.

===Second US tour and Slane Castle===
The US shows that were planned earlier in 1998 were shifted to July and August of that year, swapping the initial 3,000 capacity venues for 10,000 capacity venues. To make up for any disappointment, the Verve donated $10,000 to charities. Before the trek was underway, some shows were downsized to smaller venues. &quot;Pollstar&quot; editor Gary Bongiovanni said that the band&#x27;s decision to play larger venues in the country was seemingly ambitious, noting that they were more popular in the UK and suggesting that they had a British mindset when securing US dates. On 7 July 1998, McCabe said he would not be touring for the remainder of the year, citing stress as a factor. At first, he was fine with playing on festival dates but did not look forward to another stint in the US. He was aware that the majority of the crowd would be less familiar with the pre-&quot;Urban Hymns&quot; material. The following day, Massive Attack, who were planned to be the support act on their US next tour, pulled out, wanting to embark on their own trek in the country later in the year.

Radley suggested B. J. Cole, who was known as an expert pedal steel guitarist, to fill in McCabe&#x27;s position. Baker said Cole was a founding member of Cochise, where he took typical country forms and &quot;given them a psychedelic, hippyish flavour&quot;, which Ashcroft was aiming for, while a typical guitarist that could perform &quot;&#x27;licks&#x27; or riffs in the conventional sense, [that] just wouldn&#x27;t work.&quot; Cole said Ashcroft invited him to a rehearsal, where he was fascinated by the Verve. Alongside Cole, percussionist Steve Sidelynk accompanied the band, having previously worked with the Rolling Stones and Madonna. The rest of the Verve were hesitant to tour again; Baker said they were conscious of the fact that &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; were &quot;slowly permeating into the public consciousness, they had a great chance to break America.&quot; A Spanish festival performance was cancelled to give the band more time to rehearse.

The day before the US tour started, another date was cancelled and the Michigan show was downsized, marking the fifth venue to have done so since the tour&#x27;s initial announcement earlier in the year. Upon arriving in the country, a week was spent in Chicago, Illinois, where they tried to mesh Cole&#x27;s playing style into the band&#x27;s material. The trek was intended to start 29 July 1998 and end in mid-August. Ashcroft said the shows did not meet the band&#x27;s expectations, and he was concerned about the band&#x27;s future. On 3 August 1998, the band performed &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;; the band had been requested by the show to half the song&#x27;s runtime, which meant playing it from partway through. They rejected this demand, resulting in the show&#x27;s credits starting as they were partway into the track. After returning to the UK, they performed at Slane Castle in Dublin, Ireland, on 29 August 1998. Cole said it was a highlight of his career, and while the rest of the band felt fatigued, he did not. Ashcroft was aware that the show would be the band&#x27;s last, even if no one else did. He was highly stressed during this time and nearly had a nervous breakdown on the US trek prior to the Dublin show.

==Reception==

&quot;Urban Hymns&quot; received widespread critical praise upon its release.

Many critics latched on to Ashcroft&#x27;s role, in particular his voice. Tom Lanham of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Ashcroft conveys his voice &quot;like churchworthy gospel. Or at least a tidy sermon for jaded MTVers.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Sara Scribner found Ashcroft to be oddly &quot;detached yet brimming over with pathos all at once.&quot; McCormick mentioned that Ashcroft had a knack for detailing his &quot;despair without self-pity, and the Verve beautifully shrouds his musings in shimmering guitars.&quot; Serge Truffant of &quot;Le Devoir&quot; highlighted &quot;Sonnet&quot; as a prime example of how Ashcroft&#x27;s lyrics can stand apart even without the use of an orchestra. The staff at &quot;Select&quot; said Ashcroft triumphally managed to subvert the loathsome topics of music and love, &quot;and gets away with a track called &#x27;Neon Wilderness&#x27;. Some feat.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; writer John McCready did not like the band beforehand but was won over by &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, largely in part to Ashcroft&#x27;s earnestness as a lyricist, suppling listeners with their demand for music to &quot;express some universal humanity&quot;. The staff at &quot;Music Week&quot; shared a similar sentiment, adding that his participation helped make for an &quot;overwhelming and intense listening experience.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Martin James said Ashcroft&#x27;s vocals evolved past basic &quot;melody and flies with the greats. The ethereal passion and almost spiritual loneliness in his voice underlining the enormous sense of emotional breakdown that runs throughout these songs.&quot; Brent Dicrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; echoed this, saying he &quot;even looks and sounds like a ghost.&quot; Pete Chakerian of &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot;, like with Wener, said the album&#x27;s strength came from Ashcroft reuniting with McCabe; Wener added that aside from Ashcroft&#x27;s frontman position, &quot;this sounds like the work of a focused unit, not one or two people.&quot;

Several reviewers touched on the album against the context of Oasis and the Britpop scene as a whole. &quot;Boca Raton News&quot; writer Ben Wener wrote that the Verve understood the urge to take inspiration from the past instead of outright copying an artist&#x27;s work, unlike Oasis. He said the Verve, with &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, managed to become a bastion of British rock music, despite taking attributes from Oasis, &quot;But where the Gallagher boys are busy sloganeering and recapitulating dead ideologies, The Verve&#x27;s Richard Ashcroft pens thoughtful mini-epics that are as pointed and intuitive about human nature as they are flowery and sweeping.&quot; DJ Bee of &quot;The Nation&quot; felt that from his first listen of &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, it deserved considerably more appraisal than Oasis were receiving, going as far as to inform readers to &quot;imagine what Oasis would sound like if they were as good as they proclaimed. The Verve&#x27;s &quot;Hymn&quot; is certainly worth lighting a candle to.&quot; Journalist Neil McCormick said &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was &quot;deliciously downbeat&quot; in contrast to the upbeat nature of Oasis&#x27; &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, though he struggled to pretend that its stark soul-searching could beat the populist sales of Oasis. &quot;NME&quot; Ted Kessler remarked that the album pushes the Verve next to Oasis in &quot;history&#x27;s grand ledger. It insists, however, that they&#x27;ll be the ones writing the next chapter.&quot; The staff at &quot;Gavin Report&quot; wrote that if a listener trusted the British music outlets, they would be led to believe the Verve had a spot next to Oasis and Blur as a flagship act for Britpop, &quot;And if, like me, you let your own ears do the judging, you&#x27;ll still hear song after song of something truly special going down.&quot; Tracey Bleile, writing for &quot;Consumable Online&quot;, said the Verve carved their own spin on Britpop with the second portion of the album, as it leaves the listener &quot;stunned with their ability to do so much with so little.&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; writer Ed Masley, meanwhile, said the Verve were the main motivation in ushering a new music scene to displace Britpop, alongside Radiohead, via evoking the sound of U2.

Other commentators talked about the overall quality of the writing. James summarised his peers when he felt that the Verve had finally become consistent with their aesthetic. He said that there was an unspoken mandate about having to find the superior tracks after suffering through the more difficult ones, adding that &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was a release of exceptional &quot;beauty so intent on grabbing at the strands of music&#x27;s multi-hued history; so bloody-minded in its need to make its mark that it turns that tapestry into epic film in full-blown technicolour and sound with a scratch&#x27;n&#x27;sniff blotting paper thrown in for good measure.&quot; McCready said that with the album, the band became the best act in Britain, which he thought would have been an absurd declaration a mere four years prior, adding that its core ability to obtain &quot;heights in a way which not only sets the standard for the rest of the year, but the decade, too.&quot; &quot;The Carillon&quot; writer Tricia Kuss saw the confident lyricism and &quot;terrific arrangements [as producing] a terrific gem from the first to the last track proving that you can achieve machine gun rhythms while still having a positive outlook.&quot; Strauss noted that the Verve were not as highly regarded in the US as they were in the UK; the album &quot;shows that music fans in neither country are wrong. On one hand, the album is not a perfect or even an important one. But its best songs are instant classics capable of holding up at least until the band breaks up again.&quot; &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; Bernard Zuel saw &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; as a &quot;more organic, more simpleminded (in a non-pejorative sense)&quot; counterpart to &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997) by Radiohead and noted that they used the &quot;we-have-strings-and-we-know-how-to-use-them approach&quot; set by Oasis, giving the material a &quot;strangely vibrant melancholy.&quot; However, when they were not in that mindset, he said they were dissimilar to any other number of groups from the UK: &quot;When they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re very, very good, but when they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re arid.&quot; Klaus Winninger of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; found that the &quot;quality and appeal of the remaining eleven songs&quot; did not live up to the first two singles, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot;, adding that &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, for example, seemed out of place on the album. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, which denotes a solid track on an otherwise unworthy album.

==Retrospective reviews==

Retrospective reviews focused on the Verve melding their older sound with their new sound. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the band had softened their psychedelic edge without leaving it beyond, making themselves &quot;sound more muscular than before,&quot; highlighting &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; and Come On&quot; as examples. He added that the tracks like those put the ballads here into context, &quot;which give Urban Hymns its hurt.&quot; &quot;musicOMH&quot; contributor Graeme Marsh complimented the album for meshing McCabe&#x27;s psychedelic, electric guitar work with acoustic instrumentation. He mentioned that psychedelic music was the album&#x27;s foundation, with &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; and &quot;Sonnet&quot; seemingly misplaced. Baker said &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was widely misunderstood, explaining that a significant portion of it was &quot;every bit out-there&quot; as the material on their first two albums. He commented that it takes a bitter mindset to disregard the quality of the singles. Baker wrote that their decision to make classic-sounding tracks and contemporary rock music was an issue that was not &quot;entirely solve[d] on &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;.&quot; To him, on many of the tracks, these two sides are placed next to each other rather than being fused together, though the band proved themselves that they were able to make wonderful music in either side. Clarke said &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was easily superior to their earlier albums, saying that where &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was distinctly pretentious and exaggerated, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; &quot;aimed high and, in the case, made it.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; Jamie Atkins felt that the non-single songs offered the album &quot;an edge that the arena-filling anthems (Lucky Man, Sonnet) may have made you forget.&quot;

Some critics discussed McCabe&#x27;s role, while others mentioned Ashcroft&#x27;s writing directly. While McCabe was the driving force for their first two albums, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Stuart Berman said the band expertly widened their sonic palette with &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. He explained that &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; would have been made much longer if it had originated from their early period and instead ended up as an interlude on the album, and jams such as &quot;The Rolling People&quot; were rare exceptions. Berman remarked that in lieu of McCabe&#x27;s guitar parts, string sections and ambient music rounded out pieces such as &quot;Sonnet&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. Paul Moody of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; wrote that the album could still throw a punch, mostly because of McCabe&#x27;s parts on the songs, highlighting his playing as enhancing &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, and &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot;. McCabe&#x27;s role was most prominent on &quot;The Rolling People&quot;, &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot;, and &quot;Come On&quot;, which &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot; writer Joe Goggins dubbed epics in the vein of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;. The staff at &quot;The Observer&quot; praised the Verve&#x27;s decision to mix their out-there material with Ashcroft&#x27;s open lyrics, as it &quot;showed up most of their alleged peers as the Britpop chancers they were.&quot; Erlewine said that despite the material earmarked for an Ashcroft solo act, the album &quot;unmistakably sounds like the work of a full band, with its sweeping, grandiose soundscapes and sense of purpose.&quot; Pilley said that regardless of the writing credit to Ashcroft, it was evident that the songs were the work of more than just him, saying that if he was to receive praise, it should be for burying the hatchet with McCabe. Pilley commented that the lyrics Ashcroft came with up were confessional in a frequently embarrassing sense, yet were a perfect compliment to the album&#x27;s production.

A few critics and music fans have felt that the album is somewhat overrated. FasterLouder ranked &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; at number 32 in its all-time overrated albums list, where writer Jody Macgregor claimed people bought it on the basis of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; and realised the rest of the material was not as strong as that song. Likewise, Emily Tartanella of &quot;Magnet&quot; wrote that the release was &quot;one of the most bloated, boring and overpraised albums of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
===Album performance===
Fuelled by the success of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; shifted 250,000 copies in its first week of release. It topped the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fifth fastest-selling album in the UK behind &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; (1997) by the Prodigy, &quot;Bad&quot; (1987) by Michael Jackson, and &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (1988) by U2. It remained for 12 weeks at the top, with a total of 162 weeks on the chart. It knocked &quot;Be Here Now&quot; off the top position and was in turn knocked off by &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot; (1997) by Ocean Colour Scene for a single week before returning and staying at number one for five further weeks. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was then knocked off by the to &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997). It ended up as the second best-selling album of the year, being 200,000 copies behind &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) two days after its release. As of 2016, it has been certified 11-times platinum. In 2009, it was the 15th best-selling album in UK chart history, which was moved down to 18th by 2019. In 2013, &quot;Music Week&quot; reported that &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was the only album issued by Virgin Records to have sold at least three million copies in the UK. As of September 2017, it has sold 3,315,950 copies in the UK, and as of September 2019, 10 million copies worldwide.

It initially peaked at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, selling 21,000 copies, giving the band their first commercial success in the country. Figures stood at 470,000 by January 1998; after the Nike advert, the album moved up to number 36, and sales doubled, crossing over one million copies. It ultimately peaked at number 23. Though the Verve did not have as much success in the US compared to British contemporaries the Prodigy and Oasis, it remained within the top 75 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 because of their prior tours in the US. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it platinum in 1998. As of January 2009, sales in the US stood at 1,358,000 million copies.

In other countries, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; achieved similar chart positions: number 1 in Ireland, New Zealand, and Sweden; number 2 in Italy; number 4 in Finland, Norway, and Portugal; number 9 in Australia, Austria, and France; number 11 in the Flanders region of Belgium and Germany; number 12 in Denmark; number 13 in Switzerland; number 15 in Canada; number 16 in the Netherlands; and number 23 in the Wallonia region of Belgium.

The album appeared on various year-end charts for 1997: number 2 in the UK behind &quot;Be Here Now&quot;; number 28 in Sweden; number 31 in New Zealand; number 70 in Australia; number 86 in the Flanders region of Belgium; number 97 in Germany; and number 99 in the Wallonia region of Belgium. The album appeared on various year-end charts for 1998: number 8 in New Zealand; number 31 in Canada; number 32 in Australia; number 36 in France; number 44 in the Flanders region of Belgium; number 48 in the Netherlands; number 49 in Denmark; and number 51 in Germany. In the follow years, the album appeared on the year-end chart only in the UK: number 129 in 1999; number 172 in 2001; number 138 in 2002; and number 186 in 2006. It was ranked number eight on the decade-end chart in the UK for the 1990s.

&quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, held off the top position by &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; (1997) by Puffy Daddy. It won Single of the Year at the NME Awards. The band were reluctant to appear at the ceremony as they thought they were being overexposed through the media. It was first certified platinum by the BPI in 2013 and has been certified quadruple platinum as of 2024; the RIAA certified the track gold in 2005. It also charted at number 6 in Finland, number 10 in Sweden, number 11 in Australia, number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 15 in New Zealand and Switzerland, number 16 in France, number 21 in the Flanders region of Belgium, and number 37 in Germany.

&quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart and was knocked off the position the following week by &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; by Elton John due to the death of Princess Diana. It was certified gold by the BPI in 2013 and platinum in 2016. It also charted at number 9 in Finland, number 10 in New Zealand, number 18 in Sweden, number 22 in Australia, number 52 in the Flanders region of Belgium, number 72 in France, and number 87 in Germany.

&quot;Lucky Man&quot; peaked at number seven in the UK and was certified gold by the BPI in 2016 and platinum in 2019. It also charted at number 16 in Finland, number 38 in New Zealand, number 60 in Australia, number 67 in the Flanders region of Belgium, number 88 in France, and number 89 in Germany.

&quot;Sonnet&quot; peaked at number 74 in the UK and was certified silver by the BPI in 2019, followed by gold in 2024. It also charted at number 38 in New Zealand and number 83 in Australia.

==Accolades and legacy==
&quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was nominated for the 1998 Mercury Prize, ultimately losing to &quot;Bring It On&quot; by Gomez. It did win Best Album at the Rock Bear Awards in Sweden. &quot;Morning Star&quot; ranked it at number six on their list of the year&#x27;s best releases. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; as the number one album of 1997 in its year-end list, and the album ranked at number three on &quot;NME&quot;″s year-end critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Q&quot; also included it in their own list of the best albums of 1997, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked it at number 18 on their year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. At the 1998 Brit Awards, the Verve had nominations for Best Album, Best Producer, Best Single, and Best Video. They won Best Album, beating &quot;OK Computer&quot;, and Best Producer alongside Youth and Potter. &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; lost the Best Rock Song award at the 1999 Grammy Awards to &quot;Uninvited&quot; (1998) by Alanis Morissette. The song&#x27;s video lost Video of the Year to Madonna, Best Group Video to Backstreet Boys, and Best Alternative Video to Green Day at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.

In the years following its release, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; has received much acclaim. In 2000, it was voted number 213 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; included it in their 1999 list of the 90 best albums of the 1990s, while the magazine&#x27;s readers voted it the 18th best album of all time in 1998. It later moved up to 16th place in a similar list compiled in 2006. The Verve were awarded with the first ever &quot;Q&quot; Classic Album award for &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; at the 2007 &quot;Q&quot; Awards, and the following year, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was ranked as the 10th best British album of all time in a poll jointly conducted by &quot;Q&quot; and HMV. It was also nominated for Best British Album of the Last 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards, losing to Oasis&#x27; &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995). Retrospectively, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; included the album at number 39 on their list of the top 50 albums of 1997, while No Ripchord ranked it at 93 on their top 100 albums of the 1990s list. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the album at number eight on their list of the 10 best Britpop albums, followed by &quot;Musikexpress&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, both of whom put it in the top 10 of their best Britpop album lists. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 128 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the 2006 edition of the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Urban Hymns&quot; became the Verve&#x27;s breakthrough album. Journalist Mark Beaumont wrote that as it nearly surpassed Oasis, the album changed culture in a way that acted as a countermeasure to the late-stage moments of Britpop, while in turn influencing minor acts who attempted big-sounding indie ballads, such as Travis. Stephen Hill of Louder said &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, alongside &quot;OK Computer&quot;, as leading to the end of Britpop, explaining that it had &quot;phenomenal dexterity, depth, honesty and complexity that Stella-swigging, bucket hat wearing, chirpy Brit-Pop couldn&#x27;t stand a chance next to it.&quot; Goggins said the profound songs, namely &quot;Space and Time&quot;, &quot;One Day&quot;, and &quot;Velvet Morning&quot;, showcased &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; as an indicator that the Britpop movement was ending. He explained that the Verve combined the anthemic qualities of Oasis and the ambitious musical nature of Blur with a heavy amount of empathy and character. Berman said the album was now seen as &quot;swan song&quot; for the cultural relevance of Britpop, despite it proposing a progression for the genre when it was released. &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was viewed by Leas and David Saavedra of &quot;El País&quot; as Britpop&#x27;s last anthem. Leas grouped &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; alongside &quot;Be Here Now&quot; and &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot; (1998) by Pulp as Britpop&#x27;s &quot;comedown&quot;. Baker said &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; was a cross-generational song, considerably more than &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, that spoke to children, teenagers, people in their 20s, and people who were much older. He went on to say that it became a staple of buskers in the manner that &quot;Wonderwall&quot; did, which was an indicator of any song&#x27;s impact. Egan attributed this to the introspective lyricism and uplifting melody, akin to the pain and darkest aspects found in country music. In 2019, Jagger and Richards relinquished their rights to &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, meaning all subsequent royalties for the track went to Ashcroft.

<doc id="195380" wikidata="Q1179158" url="?curid=195380" title="Moondance">
<text>Moondance is the third studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released on 27 January 1970 by Warner Bros. Records. After the commercial failure of his first Warner Bros. album &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; (1968), Morrison moved to upstate New York with his wife and began writing songs for &quot;Moondance&quot;. There, he met the musicians who would record the album with him at New York City&#x27;s A &amp; R Studios in August and September 1969.

The album found Morrison abandoning the abstract folk jazz compositions of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; in favour of more formally composed songs, which he wrote and produced entirely himself. Its lively rhythm and blues/rock music was the style he would become most known for in his career. The music incorporated soul, jazz, pop, and Irish folk sounds into songs about finding spiritual renewal and redemption in worldly matters such as nature, music, romantic love, and self-affirmation.

&quot;Moondance&quot; was an immediate critical and commercial success. It helped establish Morrison as a major artist in popular music, while several of its songs became staples on FM radio in the early 1970s. Among the most acclaimed records in pop/rock history, &quot;Moondance&quot; frequently ranks in professional listings of the greatest albums. In 2013, the album&#x27;s remastered deluxe edition was released to similar acclaim.

== Background ==

After leaving the rock band Them, Morrison met record producer Bert Berns in New York City and recorded his first solo single, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, in March 1967 for Berns&#x27; Bang Records. When the producer unexpectedly died later that year, Morrison was offered a record deal by Warner Bros. Records executive Joe Smith, who had seen the singer perform at Boston&#x27;s Catacombs nightclub in August 1968. Smith bought out Morrison&#x27;s Bang contract, and he was able to record his first album for Warner Bros., &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, that year. Although it was later acclaimed by critics, its collection of lengthy, acoustic, revelatory folk jazz songs was not well received by consumers at the time and the album proved to be a commercial failure.

After recording &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, Morrison moved with his wife, Janet Planet, to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. According to Planet, he was influenced by Bob Dylan, who had just moved out of town when Morrison arrived. &quot;Van fully intended to become Dylan&#x27;s best friend&quot;, Planet recalled. &quot;Every time we&#x27;d drive past Dylan&#x27;s house ... Van would just stare wistfully out the window at the gravel road leading to Dylan&#x27;s place. He thought Dylan was the only contemporary worthy of his attention.&quot;

Morrison began writing songs for &quot;Moondance&quot; in July 1969. Because of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;″s poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a record that would be more accessible and appealing to listeners. &quot;I make albums primarily to sell them and if I get too far out a lot of people can&#x27;t relate to it&quot;, he later said. &quot;I had to forget about the artistic thing because it didn&#x27;t make sense on a practical level. One has to live.&quot; The musicians who went on to record &quot;Moondance&quot; with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes. The singer left after the Woodstock music festival in August attracted an influx of people to the area.
== Recording and production ==

Morrison began recording sessions for &quot;Moondance&quot; at Century Sound in New York, accompanied by most of the musicians from &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; and its engineer Brooks Arthur. Lewis Merenstein—&quot;Moondance&quot;″s executive producer—had brought in &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first session, but Morrison—according to Platania—&quot;sort of manipulated the situation&quot; and &quot;got rid of them all. For some reason he didn&#x27;t want those musicians.&quot; In place of these jazz-influenced musicians were a horn section and chorus enlisted by Morrison, who Merenstein recalled had grown more confident, outspoken, and independent of the producer. Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. that he would lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison&#x27;s creative vision.

Morrison went on to record &quot;Moondance&quot; at the Studio A penthouse of A &amp; R Studios in New York from August to September 1969. He entered A &amp; R Studios with only the basic song structures written down and the songs&#x27; arrangements in his memory, developing the compositions throughout the album&#x27;s recording. Without any musical charts, he received help with developing the music from Labes, Schroer, and flautist/saxophonist Collin Tilton. &quot;That was the type of band I dig&quot;, the singer recalled. &quot;Two horns and a rhythm section – they&#x27;re the type of bands that I like best.&quot; According to biographer Ritchie Yorke, all of the &quot;tasteful frills&quot; were generated spontaneously and developed at the studio. Most of Morrison&#x27;s vocals were recorded live, and he later said that he would have preferred to record the entire album live. Shelly Yakus—one of the audio engineers who recorded the singer—remembered him being &quot;very quiet and really introverted&quot; in the studio, &quot;yet when he sang it was a &#x27;Holy Shit!&#x27; moment.&quot;

&quot;Moondance&quot; was the first album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said &quot;no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it.&quot; While not an overbearing presence among the record&#x27;s personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: &quot;When I go into the studio, I&#x27;m a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of.&quot;
== Music and lyrics ==
For &quot;Moondance&quot;, Morrison abandoned the abstract folk compositions of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; in favour of rhythm and blues sounds, formally composed songs, and more distinct arrangements that included a horn section and chorus of singers as an accompaniment. The album found Morrison using more traditional melodic figures, which VH1 editor Joe S. Harrington said lent the songs a &quot;rustic and earthy&quot; quality. In Robert Christgau&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Moondance&quot; showed the singer integrating his style of Irish poetry into popular song structure while expanding on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;″ &quot;folk-jazz swing&quot; with lively brass instruments, innovative hooks, and a strong backbeat. The songs were generally arranged around Morrison&#x27;s horn section; music journalist John Milward called it &quot;that rare rock album&quot; on which the solos were performed by the saxophonist rather than the guitarist. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992), Paul Evans observed upbeat soul music, elements of jazz, and ballads on what he considered a &quot;horn-driven, bass-heavy&quot; record. Rob Sheffield said it debuted the musical style Morrison would become known for—a &quot;mellow, piano-based&quot; fusion of jazz, pop, and Irish folk styles.

Morrison&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Moondance&quot; deal with themes of spiritual renewal and redemption. It departed from &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;″ discursive, stream-of-consciousness narratives as the singer balanced his spiritual ideas with more worldly subject matter, which biographer Johnny Rogan felt offered the record a quality of &quot;earthiness&quot;. As a counterpart to &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny believed it &quot;retains the previous album&#x27;s deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity&quot; by rejoicing in &quot;natural wonder&quot;. According to Christgau, the essence of Morrison&#x27;s spirit was, much like the African-American music that inspired him, &quot;mortal and immortal simultaneously: this is a man who gets stoned on a drink of water and urges us to turn up our radios all the way into the mystic.&quot; His &quot;giddy&quot; preoccupation with &quot;natural wonder&quot; on the album was a product of the new approach to composition and the mellow feel of his new band, Harrington said. In his opinion, the record&#x27;s exuberant spirit and theme of self-affirmation were partly inspired by the singer having &quot;settled into a life of domestic bliss&quot;. Musicologist Brian Hinton argued that Morrison was celebrating a &quot;natural alternative&quot; in his music after quitting soft drugs around this time because they had impeded his productivity.

=== Songs ===
The opening song, &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot;, was written about feelings of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he had as a 12-year-old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from an old man who said he had retrieved it from a stream. &quot;We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me&quot;, the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison&#x27;s reference to &quot;&quot; in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic&#x27;s Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track &quot;Moondance&quot; featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song&#x27;s conclusion. &quot;This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing&quot;, Hinton remarked. &quot;Crazy Love&quot; was recorded with Morrison&#x27;s voice so close to the microphone that it captured the click of Morrison&#x27;s tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.
&quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; were cited by Harrington as examples of Morrison&#x27;s interest in &quot;the mystifying powers of the music itself&quot; throughout &quot;Moondance&quot;. The former song thematises music radio and gypsy life—which fascinated the singer—as symbols of harmony. Harrington called it an ode to &quot;the transcendent powers of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and the spontaneous pleasures of listening to a great radio station&quot;, while biographer Erik Hage regarded it as &quot;a joyful celebration of communal spirit, the music of radio, and romantic love&quot;. &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; reconciles &quot;Moondance&quot;″s R&amp;B style with the more orchestrated folk music of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, along with what Evans described as &quot;the complementary sides of Morrison&#x27;s psyche&quot;. Harrington believed it explores &quot;the intricate balance between life&#x27;s natural wonder and the cosmic harmony of the universe&quot;. Hinton said the song evoked a sense of &quot;visionary stillness&quot; shared with &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot; and the gypsy imagery of &quot;Caravan&quot;, while working on several other interpretive levels. Its images of setting sail and water in particular represented &quot;a means of magical transformation&quot; for the writer, comparable to Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poems of leave-taking such as &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot;, which had &quot;the same sense of crossing over, both to another land and into death&quot;. The lyrics also deal with &quot;the mystical union of good sex&quot;, and an act of love Hinton said was intimated by Morrison&#x27;s closing vocal &quot;too late to stop now&quot;—a phrase the singer would use to conclude his concerts in subsequent years.

&quot;Come Running&quot; was described by Morrison as &quot;a very light type of song. It&#x27;s not too heavy; it&#x27;s just a happy-go-lucky song.&quot; By contrast, Hinton found the song&#x27;s sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot;. He argued that &quot;Come Running&quot; juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against &quot;which human life and death play out their little games&quot;, and in which the narrator&#x27;s and his lover&#x27;s dream will not end &quot;while knowing of course it will&quot;. According to the writer, &quot;These Dreams of You&quot; manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and &quot;his angel from above&quot; cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write &quot;Brand New Day&quot; after hearing the Band on the radio playing either &quot;The Weight&quot; or &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;: &quot;I looked up at the sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from &#x27;When all the dark clouds roll away&#x27;.&quot; Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that &quot;Brand New Day&quot; was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.

Along with &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, &quot;Everyone&quot; and &quot;Glad Tidings&quot; form a closing trio of songs permeated by what John Tobler called &quot;a celebratory air, bordering on spiritual joy&quot;. Labes opened &quot;Everyone&quot; by playing a clavinet figure in time. A flute comes in, playing the melody after Morrison has sung four lines, with Schroer playing the harmony underneath on soprano saxophone. Although Morrison says the song is just a song of hope, Hinton says its lyrics suggest a more troubled meaning, as 1969 was the year in which The Troubles broke out in Belfast. The final track, &quot;Glad Tidings&quot;, has a bouncy beat but the lyrics, like &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;, remain largely impenetrable, according to Hinton. In his opinion, &quot;the opening line and closing line, &#x27;and they&#x27;ll lay you down low and easy&#x27;, could be either about murder or an act of love.&quot; In Hage&#x27;s opinion, &quot;&#x27;Glad Tidings&#x27; was a premonition of the future, as for the next four decades, Morrison would continue to use a song here and there to vent about the evils of the music industry and the world of celebrity.&quot;
== Packaging ==
The album&#x27;s cover photo was shot at Morrison&#x27;s home by Elliot Landy, who had previously done the cover for Dylan&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;. Landy captured Morrison&#x27;s face closely and framed the shot to conceal a sizeable pimple the singer had on his forehead the day of the shoot.

Planet wrote the album&#x27;s liner notes, drawing on the style of fairy tales in narrating Morrison&#x27;s story; the notes began, &quot;Once upon a time, there lived a very young man who was, as they say, gifted&quot;. According to Planet, Warner Bros. encouraged her to help promote him, believing &quot;that my image, precisely because it was so enigmatic, was the perfect visual to describe what was going on musically&quot;. In retrospect, she found that &quot;being a muse is a thankless job, and the pay is lousy.&quot;

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Moondance&quot; was released by Warner Bros. on 27 January 1970 in the United Kingdom and on 28 February in the United States, receiving immediate acclaim from critics. Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1970, Robert Christgau gave the album an &quot;A&quot; and claimed that Morrison had finally fulfilled his artistic potential: &quot;Forget &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;—this is a brilliant, catchy, poetic, and completely successful LP.&quot; Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, hailing it as a work of &quot;musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of &#x27;Into the Mystic&#x27; and the fine, epic brilliance of &#x27;Caravan&#x27; will carry it past many good records we&#x27;ll forget in the next few years.&quot; Fellow &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Jon Landau found the singer&#x27;s vocals overwhelming: &quot;Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on &quot;Moondance&quot; he found a home for it.&quot; Ralph J. Gleason from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; also wrote of Morrison&#x27;s singing as a focal point of praise: &quot;He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the old folks in every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines.&quot;

After the commercial failure of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot; was seen by music journalists as a record that redeemed Morrison. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine predicted it would reach rock and folk audiences while rectifying music buyers&#x27; oversight of the singer&#x27;s previous record &quot;with a more commercial entry, still rich with the soul-folk nuances of this sensitive Irish song surrealist&quot;. &quot;Moondance&quot; reached the top 30 of the American albums chart and the top 40 of the British chart in 1970, while establishing Morrison as a young, commercially successful, and artistically independent singer-songwriter with great promise. Its eclectic, lushly arranged style of music proved more accessible to listeners and translatable for live audiences, leading Morrison to form the Caledonia Soul Orchestra, a large ensemble of musicians with whom he would find his greatest concert success. According to Harrington, &quot;Moondance&quot; was very successful with hippie couples who were &quot;settling into complacent domesticity&quot; at the time. In Hage&#x27;s opinion, its success lent Morrison a rising cultural iconicity and presence in the burgeoning singer-songwriter movement of the early 1970s, first indicated by his front cover feature on the July 1970 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

== Legacy and reappraisal ==

In artistic and commercial terms, &quot;Moondance&quot; would &quot;practically define [Morrison] in the public consciousness for decades to follow&quot;, according to Hage. It made the singer a popular radio presence in the 1970s, as several of its songs became FM airplay staples, including &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Come Running&quot;, which was a top 40 hit in the US. Some songs from the album became hits for other recording artists, such as Johnny Rivers&#x27; 1970 cover of &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; and the 1971 &quot;Crazy Love&quot; recording by Helen Reddy. &quot;Moondance&quot; was also a precursor to the decade&#x27;s adult-oriented rock radio format—typified by the music of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, James Taylor, and Paul McCartney—and the first hit album for mixing engineer Elliot Scheiner, who went on to have a prolific career engineering some of the 1970s&#x27; most popular recording artists. In summarising the album&#x27;s legacy, Ryan H. Walsh wrote in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;:

Although the album never topped the record charts, it sold continuously for the next 40 years of its release, particularly after its digitally remastered reissue in 1990. In 1996, &quot;Moondance&quot; was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped three million copies in the US.

In the years following the original release, &quot;Moondance&quot; has been frequently ranked as one of the greatest albums ever. In 1978, it was voted the 22nd best album of all time in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s poll of 50 prominent American and English rock critics. Christgau, one of the critics polled, named it the 7th best album of the 1970s in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; the following year. In a retrospective review, Nick Butler from Sputnikmusic considered &quot;Moondance&quot; to be the peak of Morrison&#x27;s career and &quot;maybe of non-American soul in general&quot;, while &quot;Spin&quot; deemed it &quot;the great white soul album&quot; in an essay accompanying the magazine&#x27;s 1989 list of the all-time 25 greatest albums, on which &quot;Moondance&quot; was ranked 21st. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 2003, it was placed at number 65 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the 2000 edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (where it placed at number 79), the music reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005), and &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 list of the &quot;All-TIME 100 Albums&quot;. The following year, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame named &quot;Moondance&quot; one of their &quot;Definitive 200&quot; albums, ranking it 72nd. In 2009, &quot;Hot Press&quot; polled numerous Irish recording artists and bands, who voted it the 11th best Irish album of all time.

== 2013 reissue ==
A deluxe edition of &quot;Moondance&quot; was released by Warner Bros. on 22 October 2013. It featured a newly remastered version of the original record, three CDs of previously unreleased music from the recording sessions, and a Blu-ray disc with high-resolution audio of the original album. The packaging included a linen-wrapped folio and a booklet with liner notes written by Scheiner and music journalist Alan Light. Select alternate takes from the deluxe edition were later compiled, along with previously unreleased mixes of &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot; and &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, for &quot;The Alternative Moondance&quot;, an album conceived as an alternate version of the original record and released exclusively in vinyl format for Record Store Day in April 2018.

The 2013 deluxe reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim; &quot;Record Collector&quot; called it an aural &quot;marvel&quot;, while &quot;The Independent&quot; said the remastering &quot;strips away centuries of digital compression and makes the music sound as if you&#x27;ve never heard it properly&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Will Hermes felt the numerous outtakes possessed an intimate quality that compensated for lacking the &quot;sublime, brassy&quot; arrangements featured on the final version of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;jazzy-pop masterpiece&quot;. Morrison, however, disowned the release as &quot;unauthorised&quot; and done without his consultation while claiming his management company had given away the rights to the music in the early 1970s.

<doc id="195382" wikidata="Q1777742" url="?curid=195382" title="Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award">
<text>The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award recognizes U.S. organizations in the business, health care, education, and nonprofit sectors for performance excellence. The Baldrige Award is the highest formal recognition of the performance excellence of both public and private U.S. organizations given by the President of the United States. It is administered by the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which is based at and managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program and the associated award were established by the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–107). The program and award were named for Malcolm Baldrige, who served as United States Secretary of Commerce during the Reagan administration, from 1981 until Baldrige&#x27;s 1987 death in a rodeo accident. The first award was given November 13, 1988. By 1991, &quot;The New York Times&quot; opinionated that the criteria should be broader and &quot;tougher to win.&quot; In 2010, the program&#x27;s name was changed to the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program.

The award is not given for specific products or services.

==Baldrige Excellence Framework==

===Overview===
The Baldrige Excellence Framework has three parts: the Criteria for Performance Excellence, core values and concepts, and scoring guidelines. The framework serves two main purposes: (1) to help organizations assess their improvement efforts, diagnose their overall performance management system, and identify their strengths and opportunities for improvement and (2) to identify Baldrige Award recipients that will serve as role models for other organizations. In addition, the framework and its Criteria help strengthen U.S. competitiveness by
• improving organizational performance practices, capabilities, and results
• facilitating communication and sharing of information on best practices among U.S. organizations of all types
• serving as a tool for understanding and managing performance and for guiding planning and opportunities for learning
The framework provide organizations with an integrated approach to performance management that results in
• delivery of ever-improving value to customers and stakeholders, contributing to organizational sustainability
• improved organizational effectiveness and capabilities
• organizational and personal learning

The following three sector-specific versions of the Baldrige framework are revised every two years:
* Baldrige Excellence Framework (Business/Nonprofit)
* Baldrige Excellence Framework (Education)
* Baldrige Excellence Framework (Health Care)

===Framework details===
The framework provides organizations with an integrated approach to performance management that results in delivery of ever-improving value to customers and stakeholders, contributing to organizational sustainability improved organizational effectiveness and capabilities
organizational and personal learning

The criteria for performance excellence are based on a set of core values:
The questions that make up the criteria represent seven aspects of organizational management and performance:
==History of the Baldrige Program==
In the early and mid-1980s, many U.S. industry and government leaders saw that a renewed emphasis on quality was necessary for doing business in an expanding and competitive world market.

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Improvement Act of 1987, signed into law on August 20, 1987, was developed through the actions of the National Productivity Advisory Committee, chaired by Jack Grayson. The nonprofit research organization APQC, founded by Grayson, organized the first White House Conference on Productivity, spearheading the creation of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1987. The Baldrige Award was envisioned as a standard of excellence that would help U.S. organizations achieve competitive quality.

In the late summer and fall of 1987, Dr. Curt Reimann, the first director of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Program, and his staff at the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed an award implementation framework, including an evaluation scheme, and advanced proposals for what is now the Baldrige Award. In its first three years, the Baldrige Award was jointly administered by APQC and the American Society for Quality, which continues to assist in administering the award program under contract to NIST.

Up to 18 awards may be given annually across six eligibility categories—manufacturing, service, small business, education, health care, and nonprofit. As of 2016, 113 awards have been presented to 106 organizations (including seven repeat winners).

==Program impacts==
* The ratio of Baldrige Program benefits for the U.S. economy to program costs has been estimated at 820 to 1
* A New York Times-generated investment portfolio composed of Baldrige awardees &quot;beat the S.&amp; P. by nearly 4 to 1.&quot;
* Median growth in revenue for two-time Baldrige Award winners is 92%. 
* Median job growth for two-time Baldrige Award winners is 63% (compared with 2.5% for a matched set of industries and time periods).
* 2010–2015 Baldrige Award applicants represent 567,434 jobs, over $142 billion in revenue/budgets, and about 449 million customers served.
* The value of services donated in 2015
** by 349 national Baldrige examiners was $5.3 million.
** by state Baldrige-based examiners was $30 million.
* A 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics linked hospitals that adopt and use the Baldrige Criteria to successful operations, management practices, and overall performance.
** According to survey results reported in &quot;Futurescan 2013&quot;, by 2018, 65% of hospitals are likely to &quot;use the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence as a systematic framework for performance improvement or as an internal assessment tool&quot; 
**According to the same survey, 41% of hospitals were then considered likely to submit an application for the Baldrige Award or a state-level Baldrige-based award by 2018.

==Public-private partnership==
The Baldrige Award is supported by a public-private partnership. The following organizations and entities play a key role:
* The Foundation for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award raises funds to permanently endow the award program.
* The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, manages the Baldrige Program.
* The American Society for Quality (ASQ) assists in administering the award program under contract to NIST.
* The Board of Overseers advises the Department of Commerce on the Baldrige Program.
* Members of the Board of Examiners—consisting of leading experts from U.S. businesses and education, health care, and nonprofit organizations—volunteer their time to evaluate award applications and prepare feedback reports for applicant organizations. Board members also share information about the program in their professional, trade, community, and state organizations. The Panel of Judges, part of the Board of Examiners, makes award recommendations to the director of NIST.
* The network of state, regional, and local Baldrige-based award programs known as the Alliance for Performance Excellence provides potential award applicants and examiners, promotes the use of the Criteria, and disseminates information on the award process and concepts.
* The ISSA, the professional association for cybersecurity, is in formal partnership with the Baldrige Alliance for Performance Excellence. The Alliance and the ISSA offer a free Baldrige-based self-assessment of cybersecurity operations. It may be found at ManageHub
* Award recipients share information on their successful performance and quality strategies with other U.S. organizations.

<doc id="195383" wikidata="Q1450796" url="?curid=195383" title="François Victor Alphonse Aulard">
<text>François Victor Alphonse Aulard (19 July 1849 – 23 October 1928) was the first professional French historian of the French Revolution and of Napoleon. His major achievement was to institutionalise and professionalise the practice of history in France.

== Career ==
Aulard was born at Montbron in Charente. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1867 and obtained the degree of doctor of letters in 1877 with a thesis in Latin on Gaius Asinius Pollio and a French one on Giacomo Leopardi (whose works he subsequently translated into French). Moving from literature to history, he made a study of parliamentary oratory during the French Revolution and published two volumes on &quot;Les orateurs de la Constituante&quot; (1882) and on &quot;Les orateurs de la Legislative et de la Convention&quot; (1885). With these works, he established a reputation as a careful scholar well versed in the primary sources of the French Revolution.

Appointed professor of the history of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne in 1885, he formed the minds of students who in their turn did valuable work. Nonetheless his views were seen as controversial and &quot;advanced&quot; in a society still under the long influence of the French Revolution. During his course on the Revolution at the Sorbonne in May 1893 violent fist fights broke out. At the exit rival gangs yelled at each other &quot;Down with Aulard&quot; and, in opposition to a Roman Catholic clergy identified with the Ancien Régime, &quot;Down with the skullcap&quot;.

Peter Kropotkin, the Russian Anarchist, wrote in 1909 that Aulard and the Société de la Revolution française &quot;have shed a flood of light upon the acts of the Revolution, on its political aspects, and on the struggles for supremacy that took place between the various parties. But the study of the economic side of the Revolution is still before us...&quot;

== Work ==
Applying to the study of the French Revolution the rules of historical criticism which had produced such rich results in the study of ancient and medieval history, Aulard devoted himself to profound research in the archives and to the publication of numerous important contributions to the political, administrative and moral history of that period. His masterwork was a &quot;Histoire politique de la Revolution française&quot; (4 vol, 3rd ed. 1901). He championed Georges Danton as opposed to Maximilien Robespierre, seeing in Danton the true spirit of the embattled Revolution and the inspiration of the national defense against foreign enemies.

He was known to have argued:
&quot;From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life. [...] The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.&quot;Aulard divided the French Revolution into &quot;four epochs: 1789- 1792, during which democratic and republican parties were formed under a constitutional monarchy; 1792-1795, during which a democratic republic existed; 1795-1799, the period of the bourgeois republic; and 1799-1804, that of the plebiscitary republic.&quot;

== Editor ==
To him, we owe the &quot;Recueil des actes du Comité de salut public&quot; (27 vols. 1889–1923); &quot;La Société des Jacobins: Recueil de documents sur l&#x27;histoire des club des Jacobins de Paris&quot; (6 vols., 1889–1897); and &quot;Paris pendant la reaction thermidorienne et sous le directoire: Recueil de documents pour l&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;esprit public a Paris&quot; (5 vols., 1898–1902) which was followed by a collection on &quot;Paris sous le consulat&quot; (2 vols., 1903–1904).

For the &quot;Société de l&#x27;Histoire de la Revolution Française&quot; which brought under his editorship the important periodical entitled &quot;La Revolution française&quot;, he produced the &quot;Registre des libérations du consulat provisoire&quot; (1894) and &quot;L&#x27;Etat de la France en l&#x27;an VIII et en l&#x27;an IX&quot;, with the reports of the effects (1897), besides editing various works or memoirs written by men of the Revolution such as Jacques-Charles Bailleul, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette, Claude Fournier (called the American), Hérault de Séchelles and Louvet de Couvrai.

These large collections of documents were a fraction of his output. He wrote a number of articles which were collected in volumes under the title &quot;Etudes et leçons sur la Révolution française&quot; (9 vols., 1893–1924). In a volume entitled &quot;Taine, historien de la Révolution française&quot; (1908), Aulard attacked the method of the eminent philosopher in criticism that was severe, perhaps unjust, but certainly well-informed. This was, as it were, the manifesto of the new school of criticism applied to the political and social history of the Revolution (see &quot;Les Annales révolutionnaires&quot;, June 1908).

== Positivism ==
Aulard&#x27;s historiography was based on positivism. The assumption was that methodology was all-important and the historian&#x27;s duty was to present in chronological order the duly verified facts to analyze relations between facts and provide the most likely interpretation. Full documentation based on research in the primary sources was essential. He took the lead in the publication very important documents and in training advanced students in the proper use and analysis of primary sources. Aulard&#x27;s famous four volume history of the Revolution focused on parliamentary debates, not action in the street; and in institutions, not insurrections. He emphasized public opinion, elections, parties, parliamentary majorities and legislation. He recognized the complications that prevented the Revolution from fulfilling all its ideal promises as when the legislators of 1793 made a suffrage universal for all men, but also established the dictatorship of the Reign of Terror.

== Criticism ==
Aulard remains controversial because of his political positions. His place in historiography remains contested. His history was a series of narrow studies of constitutional, institutional and political developments in stark contrast with the wide-ranging imagination of his leading student Albert Mathiez. Conservatives argue that Aulard&#x27;s anti-clerical and radical-republican position skewed his research findings. On the other hand, his professionalism and fidelity to sources inspired a generation of scholars. He built a neo-Jacobin legacy with attention more to raison d&#x27;état than to party division. He championed international, liberal democracy and human rights.

<text>Neuss is a Kreis (district) in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Nearby are the urban districts Mönchengladbach, Krefeld, Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Cologne, the districts Rhein-Erft-Kreis, Düren, Heinsberg and the district Viersen.

==History==

In 1816 the districts Grevenbroich and Neuss were created when the whole area became part of Prussia. The city of Neuss left the district in 1913 to become an urban district. In 1929 the two districts were merged into the new district Grevenbroich-Neuss, which was renamed to Grevenbroich in 1946. In 1975 the urban district of Neuss lost its independent status and was merged into the Grevenbroich district, which was renamed to &quot;Kreis Neuss&quot; to represent the new administrative seat. On May 26, 2003, it changed its name, and is now officially called &quot;Rhein-Kreis Neuss&quot;.

==Geography==

The main rivers of the district is the Rhine which forms most of the north-eastern border of the district, as well as the Erft. In the southern part of the district are big open pit Lignite (brown coal) mines.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms was continued from the district Grevenbroich. The lion in the right side comes from the city of Jülich. The black cross in the left comes from the Cologne coat of arms. Both the bishops of Cologne as well as the dukes of Jülich owned land of the Neuss district.

<text>Y tu mamá también (Spanish for &quot;And Your Mother Too&quot;) is a 2001 Mexican coming-of-age comedy drama road film directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who co-wrote the script with his brother Carlos. It follows two teenage boys who take a road trip with a woman in her late twenties and stars Diego Luna, Gael García Bernal, and Maribel Verdú, with narration by Daniel Giménez Cacho. It is set in 1999 against the backdrop of Mexico&#x27;s political and economic realities, specifically at the end of the uninterrupted seven decades of presidents from the Institutional Revolutionary Party and the rise of the opposition led by Vicente Fox.

In addition to directing and co-writing the film, Cuarón also produced it with Jorge Vergara and edited it alongside Alex Rodríguez. The film&#x27;s explicit depiction of sex, nudity, and drug use caused complications in its rating. In Mexico, it earned $2.2 million its first weekend, setting a new record for the highest box office opening in Mexican cinema. In 2002, it was released in English-speaking markets under its Spanish title, with a limited release in the United States. It received critical acclaim and was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards and as Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globe Awards.

== Plot ==
The events, set in Mexico in 1999, are punctuated by a voice-over, omniscient narrator who knows the characters&#x27; thoughts, history and future evolution.

Two teenage best friends, working-class Julio and upper-class Tenoch, graduate from high school and see their girlfriends off on a trip to Italy. Despite their vow to remain faithful to the girls, they intend otherwise. Their plans for fun, however, deteriorate and they spend time smoking pot, swimming in a country club and at one point masturbating together on diving boards. 

During the fastuous wedding reception of Tenoch&#x27;s older sister, they meet Luisa, the Spanish wife of Tenoch&#x27;s cousin Jano. Trying to impress her, the boys describe a fictitious secluded beach called &quot;Boca del Cielo&quot; (&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Mouth&quot;), to which they invite her. Days later she visits a doctor for some test results, and receives a drunken call from Jano who tearfully confesses an infidelity. The next day, she takes Tenoch and Julio up on their invitation. 

Even though Julio and Tenoch know it to be an aimless trip, the three set off and drive through rural Mexico. The teenagers talk about their friendship and, when asked by Luisa, boast about their sexual exploits. Luisa speaks of Jano and recalls her first love, who died in a motorcycle accident. During one of their stops, Luisa leaves a message on Jano&#x27;s answering machine explaining that she has left him.

Throughout the trip, Luisa&#x27;s extroverted and upbeat persona is interspersed by bouts of inconsolable crying, some of which are accidentally witnessed by the boys. On one of these occasions, Tenoch enters her motel room in search of shampoo, at which point she daubs her tears and seduces him. Julio witnesses them having sex and, upset, walks away. He later tells Tenoch he had sex with Tenoch&#x27;s girlfriend, in violation of one of the rules governing their friendship. Tenoch spends the night furiously scolding Julio and asking for details.

Noticing tension the next day but still unaware of Julio&#x27;s confession, Luisa has sex with him to &quot;equalize&quot; the boys&#x27; perceived status. A jealous Tenoch then reveals that he, too, has had sex with Julio&#x27;s girlfriend, sparking a quarrel that nearly comes to blows. After being shoved away by Julio while trying to intervene, Luisa angrily berates their immaturity and sexual incompetence, dismisses their rivalry as closeted homosexuality, and walks away. Shocked by her outburst, they beg her to stay, which she does in exchange for her own set of rules to keep them at bay. 

They make camp near the sea and meet a local fishing family who boats them to an isolated beach, coincidentally called &quot;Boca del Cielo&quot;. They relax and enjoy the ocean, but upon their return find their campsite ransacked by a herd of runaway pigs. They spend the night in a nearby village, where Luisa makes another phone call to Jano to bid him an affectionate but final farewell.

Luisa, Julio, and Tenoch get drunk that evening and joke about their sexual histories. Julio and Tenoch reveal that they have frequently had sex with each other&#x27;s girlfriends, not just once as originally confessed. Julio adds that he had sex with Tenoch&#x27;s mother, but it is unclear whether he is serious. The three dance together sensually and then retire to their room. As Luisa kneels and stimulates them both, Julio and Tenoch embrace and kiss each other passionately. 

The next morning, the boys wake up naked together. They bolt from bed and express a sudden eagerness to return home. The narrator explains the subsequent events: the boys&#x27; journey back is quiet and uneventful, Luisa stays behind to explore nearby coves, the boys&#x27; girlfriends break up with them upon returning from Italy, and the erstwhile best friends stop hanging out. 

A year later, after a chance encounter in Mexico City, Julio and Tenoch go for coffee together. They awkwardly catch up on each other&#x27;s lives and news of their mutual friends. Tenoch informs Julio that Luisa died of cancer a month after their trip, and that she had been aware of her prognosis during their entire road trip. Tenoch finds an excuse to leave, and despite the two agreeing to meet up again, the narrator reveals that this is the last they will see of each other.

== Cast ==
* Maribel Verdú as Luisa Cortés
* Gael García Bernal as Julio Zapata
* Diego Luna as Tenoch Iturbide
* Diana Bracho as Silvia Allende de Iturbide
* Andrés Almeida as Diego &quot;Saba&quot; Madero
* Ana López Mercado as Ana Morelos

Cuarón did not want to cast Luna for the role of Tenoch because he was a teen idol and telenovela star in Mexico. García Bernal convinced Cuarón to hire Luna because their friendship would make the performance of their characters&#x27; friendship much easier. Cuarón ultimately hired Luna because he became convinced that their bond would produce a natural and honest performance.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
After working on &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;A Little Princess&quot;, Alfonso Cuarón envisioned a film that was not influenced by production techniques used in Hollywood cinema. Cuarón wanted to reject commercial production techniques he had used in his previous films, like dollies, close-ups, and dissolves. Instead he embraced a documentary-realist style of filmmaking for &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot;. Before making the film, Cuarón had worked for some time in Hollywood, prior to return to his roots in Mexican cinema. In an interview, Cuarón said: &quot;I wanted to make the film I was going to make before I went to film school, ...a film in Spanish, and a road movie involving a journey to the beach.&quot;

Additionally, Cuarón has cited &quot;Adieu Philippine&quot;, a 1962 French New Wave film, as a crucial inspiration for &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot;. Overlaps include a road trip featuring a love triangle, wide shots of a car curving down a road, an omniscient narrator, and a character dancing while staring into the camera.

=== Road movie ===
In &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot;, Alfonso Cuarón reimagined the American road movie genre to depict Mexico&#x27;s geography, politics, people, and culture. Cuarón wanted to use the road-film genre to challenge mid-20th century Latin-American Cinema movements that rejected the pleasure and entertainment typical of Hollywood commercial cinema created by using fictional characters and story. Cuarón aimed to only borrow the pleasure and entertainment of Hollywood cinema to synthesize with political and cultural exploration of Mexico. Using fictional characters and a story within the documentary-realist style, Cuarón was able to explore Mexico&#x27;s geographical, cultural, and political landscapes.

=== Filming and production ===
The director and screenwriter were not afraid of developing &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; during the production process. Cuarón&#x27;s script was minimal and unelaborate so the actors could contribute to its development during the rehearsal process. Throughout the film the actors improvised. Instead of using high-tech equipment, the entire film was shot with a handheld camera to create a documentary-realist look that mimicked candid footage. In an interview, Cuarón said it all went &quot;back to our original idea of 15 years ago, in which we would do a low-budget road movie that would allow us to go with some young actors and semi-improvise scenes and have a bare storyline but not be afraid of adding things as we went.&quot;

=== Locations ===
The beach scenes in the film were shot near the resort Bahías de Huatulco in Oaxaca.

== Home media ==
&quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; was released on DVD in an unrated version in 2002 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 2014, it received a Blu-ray release as part of The Criterion Collection.

== Soundtrack ==
== Distribution and finance ==
&quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; was produced by Anhelo Producciones, a company co-founded by Cuarón and Jorge Vergara, a well-known Mexican businessman and the film&#x27;s producer. The company provided sufficient funding to make the film and launch an impressive marketing campaign. The $5 million film budget was substantial by Mexican film standards. Advertisement and publicity appeared across Mexico. Along with the help of Anhelo Producciones, the ratings board controversy gave the film a lot of free publicity in Mexico. On location production support was provided by Alianza Films International. The film was distributed in Mexico by 20th Century Fox. Shortly after the Mexican release, IFC Films acquired North American distribution rights to the film.

== Reception ==
A box office success both domestically and abroad, &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; grossed $2.2 million in its first week, breaking Mexico&#x27;s box office records for domestic films. It went on to gross a record $12 million in Mexico.

The film became a global success after its distribution by U.S. independent companies Good Machine and IFC Films. The film grossed $13.8 million in the US and Canada, making it the second-highest grossing Spanish language film in the United States at the time, and poised Bernal for crossover success into American markets (Bernal&#x27;s 2004 performance in &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; would go on to break this record). It grossed $33.6 million worldwide.

Critically, &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; received acclaim upon its original release. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 192, and an average rating of 8.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Led by a triumvirate of terrific performances, Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s free-spirited road trip through Mexico is a sexy and wistful hymn to the fleetingness of youth&quot;. On Metacritic, the film received an average score of 89 out of 100 based on 36 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, saying, &quot;Beneath the carefree road movie that the movie is happy to advertise is a more serious level—and below that, a dead serious level.&quot;

&quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; won the Best Screenplay Award at the Venice Film Festival. It was also a runner-up at the National Society of Film Critics Awards for Best Picture and Best Director and earned a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the 2003 Academy Awards. The film made its US premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival.

=== Censorship controversies ===

The film was released without a rating in the US because a market-limiting NC-17 was unavoidable. The MPAA&#x27;s presumed treatment of the film based on the graphic depiction of sex, nudity and drug use in comparison to its much more accepting standards regarding violence, prompted critic Roger Ebert to question why movie industry professionals were not outraged: &quot;Why do serious film people not rise up in rage and tear down the rating system that infantilizes their work?&quot;

In 2001, Alfonso and Carlos Cuarón sued the Mexican Directorate of Radio, Television, and Cinema (RTC) for the film&#x27;s 18+ rating (A grade ‘C’ certificate from the RTC), which they considered illegal political censorship. They took legal action to expose the government-controlled ratings board, prompting its transformation into an autonomous organization free of government involvement and political influence. The 18+ rating was administered for strong sexual content, nudity involving teens, drug use, and explicit language, and prevented audiences under 18 from admittance. They claimed the ratings board was operating illegally by denying parents the right to choose who can watch the film, violating fundamental legal rights in Mexico.

<text>The ORDVAC (&quot;Ordnance Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)&quot;, is an early computer built by the University of Illinois for the Ballistic Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground. It was a successor to the ENIAC (along with EDVAC built earlier). It was based on the IAS architecture developed by John von Neumann, which came to be known as the von Neumann architecture. The ORDVAC was the first computer to have a compiler. ORDVAC passed its acceptance tests on March 6, 1952, at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Its purpose was to perform ballistic trajectory calculations for the US Military. In 1992, the Ballistic Research Laboratory became a part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.

Unlike the other computers of its era, the ORDVAC and ILLIAC I were twins and could exchange programs with each other. The later SILLIAC computer was a copy of the ORDVAC/ILLIAC series. J. P. Nash of the University of Illinois was a developer of both the ORDVAC and of the university&#x27;s own identical copy, the ILLIAC, which was later renamed the ILLIAC I. Abe Taub, Sylvian Ray, and Donald B. Gillies assisted in the checkout of ORDVAC at Aberdeen Proving Ground. After ORDVAC was moved to Aberdeen, it was used remotely by telephone by the University of Illinois for up to eight hours per night. It was one of the first computers to be used remotely and probably the first to routinely be used remotely.

The ORDVAC used 2178 vacuum tubes. Its addition time was 72 microseconds and the multiplication time was 732 microseconds. Its main memory consisted of 1024 words of 40 bits each, stored using Williams tubes. It was a rare asynchronous machine, meaning that there was no central clock regulating the timing of the instructions. One instruction started executing when the previous one finished.

Among the ORDVAC programmers were Martin Davis and Elsie Shutt.

ORDVAC and its successor at Aberdeen Proving Ground, BRLESC, used their own unique notation for hexadecimal numbers. Instead of the sequence A B C D E F universally used today, the digits ten to fifteen were represented by the letters K S N J F L (King Sized Numbers Just For Laughs), corresponding to the teleprinter characters on five-track paper tape. The manual that was used by the military in 1958 used the name sexadecimal for the base 16 number system.

When ORDVAC was completed, it was tested at the University of Illinois and then disassembled and shipped to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Three faculty members including Sylvian Ray and Abe Taub drove to Maryland to help assemble the machine, which was reconstructed and passed its validation tests in just a week. It was expected that assembly and testing would take over a month. When some military officers came to check on the progress of Ordvac assembly, they asked, &quot;Who is in charge here?&quot;, and were told, &quot;It&#x27;s the guy who is holding the broom!&quot;, as Abe Taub—the head of The University of Illinois Digital Computer Laboratory—was sweeping up after having completed all the necessary tasks.

<text>In mathematics, especially the usage of linear algebra in mathematical physics and differential geometry, Einstein notation (also known as the Einstein summation convention or Einstein summation notation) is a notational convention that implies summation over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving brevity. As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of Ricci calculus; however, it is often used in physics applications that do not distinguish between tangent and cotangent spaces. It was introduced to physics by Albert Einstein in 1916.

== Introduction ==

===Statement of convention===

According to this convention, when an index variable appears twice in a single term and is not otherwise defined (see Free and bound variables), it implies summation of that term over all the values of the index. So where the indices can range over the set ,
formula_1
is simplified by the convention to:
formula_2

The upper indices are not exponents but are indices of coordinates, coefficients or basis vectors. That is, in this context should be understood as the second component of rather than the square of (this can occasionally lead to ambiguity). The upper index position in is because, typically, an index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term (see &quot;&quot; below). Typically, would be equivalent to the traditional .

In general relativity, a common convention is that
* the Greek alphabet is used for space and time components, where indices take on values 0, 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are ),
* the Latin alphabet is used for spatial components only, where indices take on values 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are ),

In general, indices can range over any indexing set, including an infinite set. This should not be confused with a typographically similar convention used to distinguish between tensor index notation and the closely related but distinct basis-independent abstract index notation.

An index that is summed over is a &quot;summation index&quot;, in this case &quot;. It is also called a dummy index since any symbol can replace &quot; without changing the meaning of the expression (provided that it does not collide with other index symbols in the same term).

An index that is not summed over is a &quot;free index&quot; and should appear only once per term. If such an index does appear, it usually also appears in every other term in an equation. An example of a free index is the &quot;&quot; in the equation formula_3, which is equivalent to the equation formula_4.

===Application===

Einstein notation can be applied in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention can be applied more generally to any repeated indices within a term. When dealing with covariant and contravariant vectors, where the position of an index indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a contravariant vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, when there is a fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see &quot;&quot; below.

==Vector representations==

=== Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts ===

In terms of covariance and contravariance of vectors,
* upper indices represent components of contravariant vectors (vectors),
* lower indices represent components of covariant vectors (covectors).

They transform contravariantly or covariantly, respectively, with respect to change of basis.

In recognition of this fact, the following notation uses the same symbol both for a vector or covector and its &quot;components&quot;, as in:
formula_5

where formula_6 is the vector and formula_7 are its components (not the formula_8th covector formula_6), formula_10 is the covector and formula_11 are its components. The basis vector elements formula_12 are each column vectors, and the covector basis elements formula_13 are each row covectors. (See also ; duality, below and the examples)

In the presence of a non-degenerate form (an isomorphism , for instance a Riemannian metric or Minkowski metric), one can raise and lower indices.

A basis gives such a form (via the dual basis), hence when working on with a Euclidean metric and a fixed orthonormal basis, one has the option to work with only subscripts.

However, if one changes coordinates, the way that coefficients change depends on the variance of the object, and one cannot ignore the distinction; see Covariance and contravariance of vectors.

===Mnemonics===

In the above example, vectors are represented as matrices (column vectors), while covectors are represented as matrices (row covectors).

When using the column vector convention:

* &quot;Upper indices go up to down; lower indices go left to right.&quot;
* &quot;Covariant tensors are row vectors that have indices that are below (co-row-below).&quot;
* Covectors are row vectors: formula_14 Hence the lower index indicates which &quot;column&quot; you are in.
* Contravariant vectors are column vectors: formula_15 Hence the upper index indicates which &quot;row&quot; you are in.

=== Abstract description ===

The virtue of Einstein notation is that it represents the invariant quantities with a simple notation.

In physics, a scalar is invariant under transformations of basis. In particular, a Lorentz scalar is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. The individual terms in the sum are not. When the basis is changed, the &quot;components&quot; of a vector change by a linear transformation described by a matrix. This led Einstein to propose the convention that repeated indices imply the summation is to be done.

As for covectors, they change by the inverse matrix. This is designed to guarantee that the linear function associated with the covector, the sum above, is the same no matter what the basis is.

The value of the Einstein convention is that it applies to other vector spaces built from using the tensor product and duality. For example, , the tensor product of with itself, has a basis consisting of tensors of the form . Any tensor in can be written as:
formula_16

, the dual of , has a basis , , ..., which obeys the rule
formula_17
where is the Kronecker delta. As
formula_18
the row/column coordinates on a matrix correspond to the upper/lower indices on the tensor product.

== Common operations in this notation ==

In Einstein notation, the usual element reference formula_19 for the formula_20-th row and formula_21-th column of matrix formula_22 becomes formula_23. We can then write the following operations in Einstein notation as follows.

=== Inner product ===

The inner product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding components, with the indices of one vector lowered (see #Raising and lowering indices):
formula_24
In the case of an orthonormal basis, we have formula_25, and the expression simplifies to:
formula_26

=== Vector cross product ===

In three dimensions, the cross product of two vectors with respect to a positively oriented orthonormal basis, meaning that formula_27, can be expressed as:
formula_28

Here, formula_29 is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since the basis is orthonormal, raising the index formula_30 does not alter the value of formula_31, when treated as a tensor.

=== Matrix-vector multiplication ===

The product of a matrix with a column vector is:
formula_32
equivalent to
formula_33

This is a special case of matrix multiplication.

=== Matrix multiplication ===

The matrix product of two matrices and is:
formula_34

equivalent to
formula_35

=== Trace ===

For a square matrix , the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, hence the sum over a common index .

=== Outer product ===

The outer product of the column vector by the row vector yields an matrix :
formula_36

Since and represent two &quot;different&quot; indices, there is no summation and the indices are not eliminated by the multiplication.

=== Raising and lowering indices ===

Given a tensor, one can raise an index or lower an index by contracting the tensor with the metric tensor, . For example, taking the tensor , one can lower an index:
formula_37

Or one can raise an index:
formula_38

==Notes==
#This applies only for numerical indices. The situation is the opposite for abstract indices. Then, vectors themselves carry upper abstract indices and covectors carry lower abstract indices, as per the example in the introduction of this article. Elements of a basis of vectors may carry a lower &quot;numerical&quot; index and an upper &quot;abstract&quot; index.
