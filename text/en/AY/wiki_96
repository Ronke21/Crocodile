<text>Reliant Motor Company was a British car manufacturer based in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England. It was founded in 1935 and ended car production in 2002, the company had been known as &quot;Reliant Motor Company&quot; (or RMC for short) until the 1990s when it became &quot;Reliant Motors&quot; and then finally became &quot;Reliant Cars LTD&quot; after production had ended of the Robin as the company was restructured to be a car import business. It is now a dormant company and the only entity left is a separate parts company created called &quot;Reliant Partsworld&quot; which produces parts for Reliant vehicles.

Reliant was a large manufacturing company that mainly produced vehicles for niche markets, such as small three-wheeled vehicles and sports cars. It was best known for the three-wheeled Reliant Robin, but produced a variety of vehicles over 60 years, including sports cars, convertibles and commercial vehicles. Approximately half a million Reliant vehicles were produced and sold in at least nine countries. For a period from the 1970s until the 1990s, Reliant was the UK&#x27;s second biggest British-owned car manufacturer behind British Leyland.

To make their vehicles light, the company decided to produce car bodies from fibreglass in the mid-1950s. From this, Reliant became a pioneer in fibreglass design, techniques, and developments. Reliant also produced kitchen worktops, train bodies, and personal watercraft shells from fibreglass. In the 1970s, Reliant was the largest producer of fibreglass in Europe.

Reliant became the second-largest British-owned car company in the 1970s after the forming of British Leyland, Reliant had five factories and sold vehicles to seven countries.

==Company history and car production==


=== First vehicles ===
When the Raleigh Bicycle Company decided to discontinue the manufacture of their three-wheeled vehicles in 1934, their works manager, T. L. Williams, and a colleague, E. S. Thompson, felt that the days of lightweight three-wheelers were not over. They decided to build their own vehicle in Williams&#x27;s back garden on Kettlebrook Road in Tamworth. Their home-built design closely resembled the Karryall van previously built by Raleigh, and the prototype was licensed in January 1935. It was a 7 cwt (356 kg) van with a steel chassis, powered by a 600 cc single-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox and chain drive. The body was a hardwood frame with aluminium panels attached to it, like other cars of the time. With the motorcycle front end, mounted in the open, in front of the bulkhead, it was essentially a motorcycle fitted with a box body. The initial prototype had handlebars for steering, but after several trials with small local companies, it was changed to a steering wheel.

The work moved to a disused bus depot on Watling Street in Fazeley. On 3 June 1935, the first Reliant was delivered. Powered by a single-cylinder air-cooled 600 cc J.A.P. engine, the driver sat centrally on the vehicle astride the engine, much like a motorcyclist. The single-cylinder engine left the Reliant under-powered. In March 1936, a two-cylinder, water-cooled J.A.P. engine and an increase to 8 cwt (407 kg) gross vehicle weight was released. The driver no longer sat astride the engine and the vehicle gained more conventional forward-facing seats in the front. The first improved eight cwt twin-cylinder model was delivered on 16 March 1936.

In 1938, the Reliant Motor Company started to use the 10.5 hp, 747 cc four-cylinder Austin side-valve engine as found in the popular Austin Seven. The first four-cylinder Reliant was delivered on 12 March 1938. The Austin Car Company then announced its intention to cease production of the 747 cc Austin Seven engine. As Williams was always enthusiastic about making Reliant as independent as possible, he was keen that the company did not buy parts that it could make &quot;in-house&quot;. Austin sold all the 747 cc engine tooling and manufacturing rights to Reliant, allowing them to commence manufacturing the engine. Although appearing very similar to the Austin engine, the level of commonality between Reliant and Austin remains unclear; the Reliant side-valve engine was a 747 cc four-cylinder unit built using smaller-scale manufacturing techniques than Austin. The Reliant crankcase was sand-cast rather than die-cast.

=== Postwar vehicles and advent of fibreglass ===
During the Second World War, Reliant machined parts for the war effort. In the post-war years, three-wheeler development continued. Reliant introduced a slightly modified van called the Regent. Visually similar to an over-sized motorcycle, the first Regent was completed on 13 March 1946, ten years after the first twin-cylinder van. The Regent grew to a GVW of 10 cwt and was better equipped, with sliding windows in the doors rather than canvas side screens. Two larger models were produced, a 12 cwt Regent and a Prince Regent. In 1953, the Regent continued to be built alongside the Reliant Regal. The Regent was eventually replaced by the Regal Mk II 5 cwt van in 1956.

In 1952, a four-seat car was launched, initially with an aluminium body, but panel by panel, the company substituted it with fibreglass, as their understanding of the material improved and the price of aluminium increased. By 1956, the bodywork of the Mark 3 version of the Reliant Regal had changed completely to fibreglass. The first generation of vehicles were designated Mk1 to Mk6, with each one getting improvements and slightly different styling. The car was originally powered by the 750 cc Austin Seven engine, originally manufactured by Austin Motor Company and later Reliant. Reliant&#x27;s redesign of the engine gave it , which was a big improvement over the 10.5 hp of the 750cc Austin 7 design. Reliant was one of the last companies to produce a side-valve engine design, with the production of the Reliant 750 cc engine ending in 1962.

The 1963 Regal 3/25 had its body completely made of fibreglass. On previous generations of the Regal, the body was fibreglass, but the floor was made of bolted-together hardwood. Its engine was the first mass-produced lightweight overhead valve aluminium-alloy engine in Europe and the UK. Displacement was initially 598 cc on the Regal 3/25, but was later upgraded to 700 cc on the Regal 3/30.

=== Expansion ===
At the same time, Reliant were working for other countries to design vehicles for home-grown production. Vehicles would be sent over in kit form for the countries&#x27; own workforces to assemble. Reliant would first design the vehicle to the country&#x27;s or company&#x27;s requirements. The first was the Anadol in Turkey, which was based on a mix of Ford parts and a custom chassis. The Anadol began as a two-door saloon, then a four-door saloon, followed by commercial pickup and van versions. The pickup was produced until the early 1990s.

A similar vehicle was the Israeli Sabra Sport, also based on a Ford engine and running gear. Reliant was so impressed with the design, they sold it in the UK as the Sabre to help Reliant&#x27;s company image expand beyond a three-wheeled micro-car maker. The car sold poorly against offerings from Triumph and MG, however.

Later, Reliant bought a prototype design for the replacement Daimler Dart, which became the Scimitar coupe and later the best-selling sporting estate—the Scimitar GTE.

To power the Scimitar GT coupe and Sabre, Reliant turned towards Ford of Britain and were supplied with the Zephyr 6 and Consul 4 engines. The coupe GT could be purchased with either the 2.5 litre or the 3.0 litre Essex V6 engine. Later, 3.0 GTEs were fitted with Essex V6 engines and gearboxes. On the 3.0 V6 GTE, the back axle ratio changed depending on the use of either a straight four-speed gearbox or one with an overdrive unit.

Reliant bought out Bond Cars in 1969 after Bond had gone into liquidation. Reliant purchased Bond after wanting to enter Triumph dealerships. Bond&#x27;s Equipe sports car already had this agreement, but Triumph entered British Leyland and the deal ended. It is said that Bond was Reliant&#x27;s main competitor in three-wheeled vehicles, with the Bond Minicar and the Bond 875, but Reliant&#x27;s vehicles outsold Bond&#x27;s in huge numbers, with a much larger production and dealer network. Reliant did use the Bond name for the 1970s Bond Bug, which was a Reliant prototype originally named the Reliant Rogue. The Bug was a sporty three-wheeler designed by Ogle designer Tom Karen. The Bug used a shortened Reliant Regal chassis and other mechanical parts, but many parts, such as the front swingarm, were new designs that would also be used on the 1973 Reliant Robin. The Bond Bug came in 700, 700E and 700ES models until replaced by the 750 model.

Reliant built four-wheeled versions of their three-wheeled stablemates – the first was the Reliant Rebel, which had three-quarters of the rear chassis design of the Regal, but front suspension based on the Triumph Herald with Reliant&#x27;s own steering system. The engines were the same 600 cc and 700 cc units used in the Regal, but with a higher compression ratio and more torque because of the extra weight the Rebel carried over the Regal. The last model came with the 750 cc version when the Mk1 Reliant Robin was introduced. The styling of the Rebel was intended to make the car look unique so it did not seem like a four-wheeled version of the Regal; the Rebel came in saloon, estate and van models.

The Reliant Kitten was the four-wheeled version of the 1970s Reliant Robin, designed to replace the Rebel and featuring the 850 cc version of Reliant&#x27;s own engine, which was introduced in 1975 (with the Reliant Robin gaining the engine shortly afterwards). The design this time featured very heavily on the Reliant Robin with only the nose of the design being different, having square headlights and a black panel around them – this was done mainly for cost-saving reasons so the parts from both vehicles could be shared for production.

After Reliant Kitten production stopped in 1982, the rights were sold to Sipani Automobiles in India who made the vehicle near-exactly the same, but with the name Sipani Dolphin. Later, the vehicle became a 4-door hatchback called the Sipani Montana. The car was built well into the 1990s with exactly the same Kitten mechanical. Reliant exported engines they had built for their own vehicles in the UK.

Between 1983 and 1990, a utility/pickup vehicle called the Reliant Fox was produced in the UK. This was based on an original development by Reliant to design a vehicle for the Greek company MEBEA. It was based on Reliant Kitten mechanical with its own pickup body and canvas top design. It had originally been built in Greece by MEBEA between 1979 and 1983. After production finished in Greece, Reliant decided to build it in the UK, but gave the Fox many design changes, including 12-inch wheels, altered suspension and the high compression 850 cc engine. They designed a rear hardtop to make the vehicle into a van or estate. Tandy Industries used Foxes as a basis for a compact, two-berth camper-van.

Reliant also made a small three-wheeled commercial vehicle called the Reliant TW9, later sold by other companies as the Ant (and, like the Robin, licence-built in Greece by MEBEA), which was a chassis and cab, onto which a custom rear body was fitted: a road sweeper, a flat back, a van, a milk float and hydraulic lifting rear bed version were common fitments. Also, a fifth wheel (actually fourth wheel) articulated tractor unit was created to pull large trailers. It was often used by public utility companies or more commonly sold to councils, where its ability to negotiate narrow alleyways was a big advantage.

Reliant&#x27;s expertise in the area of composite car body production also saw the company produce lightweight bodyshells for Ford RS200 rally cars and a fibreglass-bodied taxi, the MetroCab – the first to have full wheelchair provision (manufactured by a division of Kamkorp after 2001), they also made Ford fibreglass truck cabs and Ford Transit hightops. With Reliant&#x27;s expertise in fibreglass, the company created bodies for trains, kitchen worktops and boat/jet ski hulls.

Reliant&#x27;s main business was selling three-wheeled vehicles. The main market these would sell to would be a motorcyclist who didn&#x27;t wish to pass their full car licence test. It was a sizable niche market due to the large number of motorcyclists present and it lasted until 2001 when the EU eliminated the B1 class from being issued with a full motorcycle licence (the B1 allowing the holder to drive a three or four-wheeled vehicle up to the weight of ). The change capped Reliant&#x27;s market share.

===End of car production===
The Hodge Group bought the majority of Reliant in 1962, selling it 15 years later to the Nash family. During the early 1990s, the owner of Reliant was a major housing developer and when the 1992 recession hit, the company folded and Reliant was sold to Beans Engineering. By 1996, Jonathan Haynes took the lead and his main backer took control – Haynes created a new range of Robin and Rialto specifications to appeal to more customers including more luxury models such as the SLX. Sales doubled as previously most Reliant vehicles were basic with not even the option of metallic paint. 
In 1997, production was relocated to Plant Lane, Burntwood, following a major redesign of the Robin model in 1998. The new model featured all new panels and was essentially a &#x27;heavy facelift&#x27; designed by Andy Plumb. Research continued into four-wheeled Reliant models such as a Kitten for the modern age. Prototypes for this featured in many newspapers and magazines at the time. Production continued of the Robin model until 2001 when shareholders decided to import Ligier microcars and Piaggio Ape three-wheelers instead. Jonathan Haynes sold his shares and left the company before production ended because he wished to create an all-new four-wheeled Reliant model instead.
The last Reliant made was the Robin 65 a Reliant Robin in metallic gold to celebrate 65 years of car production. The vehicles had every optional extra and sold for £10,000 - 65 of these vehicles were built up to Valentine&#x27;s Day 2001.

==Export markets==
Reliant, in the early 1950s, agreed a deal in Israel to produce Regent vans in SKD form. Not long after this, Israel would ask Reliant for a four-wheeled vehicle design which could be built in Israel that was strong for their rough roads and could be used with a choice of van, pick up, and estate body styles. The car used a lot of Reliant&#x27;s existing parts; basically converting a Regent into a four-wheeled vehicle. This vehicle would never be sold in the UK and called the Reliant Regent four 10 cwt van, this would be sold in Israel by Autocars limited but the vehicle renamed Sussita to make it seem a more homegrown car. In 1958 Reliant showed this vehicle extensively in the UK to demonstrate they could design more than just 3 wheeled vehicles but also only showed in LHD form as it was only an overseas model.
Building on this relationship Autocars would then set Reliant the challenge to design a peoples&#x27; car for their country, this car would later be named the Carmel. The Carmel was designed around the same time Reliant were designing its Regal 3/25 and somehow some of its design features rubbed off, the square styling with a reverse slant Ford Anglia rear window for one, the engine was also the 1100cc Ford Anglia unit, apart from the body many of the chassis and running gear was used from the Sussita. Reliant would later design the Sabra Sport using Ashley Laminates existing kit car designs which Reliant would redesign again to sell it in the UK market as the Reliant Sabre.
Reliant would continue designing vehicles for Autocars into the early 1970s when Autocars started to source parts from Standard-Triumph, severing ties with Reliant in the process. Autocars would end in the late 1970s and would plan to start a new company selling Reliant Kittens in Israel but this would not happen.
From this export started another as in 1962 a Turkish delegation visited Autocars in Israel and was impressed with its car production; Turkey would later instruct Reliant to design its own peoples&#x27; car. Through this deal Reliant designed the Anadol, a saloon vehicle using a GRP body, separate chassis and Ford running gear, this deal though would not just be for a vehicle design but to help Turkey create its whole car production from its factory, paint and production. The company would be named Otosan.
The Anadol would be designed into two-door saloon, four-door saloon, van, pick up and estate, several redesigns would keep the Anadol looking modern into the 1970s, later Otosan became more distant from Reliant as local content rose. Reliant offered in the 1980s again to redesign the Anadol even presenting a prototype but by this time Otosan believed it could go it alone and redesigned the vehicle itself, this wouldn&#x27;t end well for Otosan with declining sales and eventually Otosan became a Ford assembly plant for Turkey producing the Ford Escort.

==Revival attempt==
Shortly after Reliant announced that production of the Robin would cease, production rights for the Reliant Robin were sold to a Sudbury-based firm called B&amp;N Plastics, which redesigned major parts of the car. A deal was done where Reliant would supply the mechanical parts of the Reliant Robin to B&amp;N Plastics and then the fibreglass skills of B&amp;N Plastics would be used to build the vehicle and sell it under its own name.
Production of the new Robin would begin in late 2001. The new car would be called the BN-1 Robin with no Reliant branding. The BN-2 model would be made with extras such as electric windows. The cost of the base model, the BN-1 Robin, was £10,000, but had all the features of the Robin 65, such as a leather interior. The BN-2 model had all these extras and more. 
However, after 30 to 40 cars were produced, Reliant could not supply the mechanical parts of the Reliant Robin as they had decided to end production of the Reliant 850 cc engine, which meant that the BN-1 Robin would need a redesign to use a different engine if production continued.

B&amp;N Plastics had already spent £100,000 on approving the Robin design so production could start. The company sought to find more investors to help fund further redesigns to keep the Robin alive but by early 2002, no investors were found and B&amp;N Plastics ended its car production with over 200 orders unfulfilled. B&amp;N Plastics ceased production in late 2002.

In later years, it was revealed that B&amp;N Plastics were planning to fit a Japanese K-car 660 cc three-cylinder engine and five-speed gearbox to make the Reliant Robin more modern.

===Final years===
Reliant produced 50 vehicles a week until 2001, when it finished production of its own models to focus on importing French Ligier microcars and motorcycles as well as the Piaggio Ape range of commercial vehicles. A final version of the Reliant Robin was produced with leather seats, metallic gold paint, alloy wheels, walnut dashboard, and some other luxurious features, which retailed for £10,000. The car was made in the company&#x27;s 65th year of production, and so was named the Reliant Robin 65.
Reliant Cars Ltd. was renamed Reliant Partsworld, and operates from the factory where the Robin was built.
The old site of Reliant Motors, in Tamworth, was turned into a housing estate named Scimitar Park, after the Reliant Scimitar that the company produced. A number of streets in the estate were named after Reliant models as well, such as &#x27;Robin Close&#x27;.

==Other forms of manufacturing==

Since Reliant would be known for building robust fibreglass vehicles, it would diversify into producing fibreglass items other than their own vehicles. It was showcased in the &quot;World of Reliant&quot; documentary, which was written and filmed by Reliant in the early 1980s to show how diverse the company had become from a small car company producing three-wheeled vehicles.

Other fibreglass products produced were items such as GRP sinks and kitchen worktops, GRP replacement car wings for metal vehicles, GRP guttering and tubes, GRP train carriage bodies for British rail, and GRP aircraft bodies.

Reliant also had many contracts with Ford to build fibreglass high roof tops for their Transit model. Vauxhall Motors would also contract Reliant to make their GRP body kits for the Chevette.

==Commemoration plaque==

On 8 July 2017, a blue plaque was unveiled to honour both the founders, T. L. Williams and E. S. Thompson, and marked the birthplace of Reliant. The first Reliant prototype was built by Williams and Thompson in 1934, in the rear garden of Williams&#x27; residence, named Bro-Dawel, on Kettlebrook Road.

==Myths==

The most widespread myth regarding Reliant vehicles is that they cannot go around corners. This was supposedly demonstrated on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, but Jeremy Clarkson admitted in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2016 that the Robin only rolled over frequently because the production team had welded the differential, fitted different sized rear wheels and placed heavy sandbags in the passenger footwell. As a result, the car became much less stable than before.

Another myth is that a Reliant, or any three-wheeled vehicle, is not allowed on British motorways. This is not the case. Any two-, three- or four-wheeled vehicle is allowed on the motorway as long as its engine size is over (with the exception of most agricultural vehicles).
It is a common misconception that the main character Derek &quot;Delboy&quot; Trotter in the British television comedy series &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; owned a Reliant Robin. Many people painted their Reliant Robins and Rialtos yellow with the famous &quot;Trotters’ Independent Trading Co&quot; lettering, but the Trotters&#x27; van was actually a Supervan III.
Many people are under the impression Reliant three-wheeler can be driven on a Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) licence, but they have engines larger than the CBT licence allows. To drive a Reliant, a full motorcycle or car licence is required and the driver must be over 21.
Another widely held myth was that all Reliant three-wheelers have no reverse gear; before 1964, the reverse gear would be disabled, but all Reliant vehicles were equipped with one.

==Licensing==

Originally, to drive a three-wheeled vehicle on a motorcycle licence required passing a full motorcycle test and completing a restriction period. When the licence was issued it included a B1 class. This conferred the right to drive a vehicle with three or four wheels up to 550 kg (10¾ cwt), but the final B1 licences were issued in 2001. In January 2013, the licensing changed again. Drivers with a full A-category motorcycle licence who are over 21 years of age may drive a three-wheeled vehicle of any weight. The age restriction of 21 applies to full car licence holders also in the UK. Driving any Reliant three-wheeled vehicle is not legal on a CBT licence or lower.

<text>Kenneth Alfred Ham (born 20 October 1951) is an Australian Christian fundamentalist, young Earth creationist, apologist and former science teacher, living in the United States. He is the founder, CEO, and former president of Answers in Genesis (AiG), a Christian apologetics organisation that operates the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter.

Ham advocates biblical literalism, claiming that the creation narrative in the Book of Genesis is historical fact and that the universe and the Earth were created together approximately 6,000 years ago, contrary to the scientific consensus that the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old and the universe is about 13.8 billion years old.

==Early life==
Ham was born 20 October 1951 in Cairns, Queensland. His father, Mervyn, was a Christian educator who served as a school principal in several schools throughout Queensland.

Ham earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in applied science (with an emphasis on environmental biology) from the Queensland Institute of Technology and holds a Diploma in Education from the University of Queensland. While at university, he was influenced by John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;. Upon graduation in 1975, Ham began teaching science at Dalby State High School in Dalby, Queensland.

==Career==

In 1977, Ham began teaching at a high school in Brisbane, where he met John Mackay, another teacher who believed in young Earth creationism. According to Susan and William Trollinger, Ham was &quot;appalled by the fact that some of his students assumed their textbooks that taught evolutionary science successfully proved the Bible to be untrue,&quot; and he said the experience &quot;put a &#x27;fire in my bones&#x27; to do something about the influence that evolutionary thinking was having on students and the public as a whole.&quot; In 1979, he resigned his teaching position and, with his wife, founded Creation Science Supplies and Creation Science Educational Media Services, which provided resources for the teaching of creationism in the public schools of Queensland, a practice allowed at the time. In 1980, the Hams and Mackay merged the two organisations with Carl Wieland&#x27;s Creation Science Association to form the Creation Science Foundation (CSF).

As CSF&#x27;s work expanded, Ham moved to the United States in January 1987 to engage in speaking tours with another young Earth creationist organisation, the Institute for Creation Research (ICR). His &quot;Back to Genesis&quot; lecture series focused on three major themes – that evolutionary theory had led to cultural decay, that a literal reading of the first eleven chapters of the Book of Genesis contained the true origin of the universe and a pattern for society, and that Christians should engage in a culture war against atheism and humanism. With his popularity growing in the United States, Ham left ICR in 1994 and, with colleagues Mark Looy and Mike Zovath, founded Creation Science Ministries with the assistance of what is now Creation Ministries International (Australia). In 1997, Ham&#x27;s organisation changed its name to Answers in Genesis.

From the time AiG was founded, Ham planned to open a museum and training centre near its headquarters in Florence, Kentucky, telling an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewer in 2007, &quot;Australia&#x27;s not really the place to build such a facility if you&#x27;re going to reach the world. Really, America is.&quot; In a separate interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;&#x27;s Paul Sheehan, Ham explained, &quot;One of the main reasons [AiG] moved [to Florence] was because we are within one hour&#x27;s flight of 69 percent of America&#x27;s population.&quot; The museum, located in Petersburg, Kentucky, west of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, opened 27 May 2007.

In February 2018, Ham was disinvited from the University of Central Oklahoma, where he was scheduled to speak, after an LGBTQ student group objected. Later that month, UCO reinvited Ham to speak, and Ham spoke on March 5 as planned.

==Disputes with CMI and GHC==
At the end of 2005, the AiG Confederation crumbled due to a disagreement between Ham and Carl Wieland over the &quot;differences in philosophy and operation&quot;. This disagreement led to Ham effectively retaining the leadership of the UK and American branches while Wieland served as managing director of the Australian branch and the smaller offices in Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. This splitting into two groups led to the Australian branch renaming themselves Creation Ministries International (CMI). The AiG stayed with Ham and continued to expand its staff and work closely with the Institute for Creation Research (ICR). Young Earth creationist Kurt Wise was recruited by Ham as a consultant to help with the concluding phases of the museum project.

In May 2007, Creation Ministries International (CMI) filed a lawsuit against Ham and AiG in the Supreme Court of Queensland seeking damages and accusing him of deceptive conduct in his dealings with the Australian organisation. Members of the group expressed &quot;concern over Mr. Ham&#x27;s domination of the groups, the amount of money being spent on his fellow executives and a shift away from delivering the creationist message to raising donations.&quot; Ham was accused of trying to send the Australian ministry into bankruptcy. According to the CMI website, this dispute was amicably settled in April 2009. In 2008, Ham appeared in Bill Maher&#x27;s comedy-documentary &quot;Religulous&quot;. AiG criticised the movie for what it called Maher&#x27;s &quot;dishonesty last year in gaining access to the Creation Museum and AiG President Ken Ham.&quot;

In March 2011, the board of Great Homeschool Conventions, Inc. (GHC) voted to disinvite Ham and AiG from future conventions. Conference organiser Brennan Dean stated Ham had made &quot;unnecessary, ungodly, and mean-spirited statements that are divisive at best and defamatory at worst&quot;. Dean stated further, &quot;We believe Christian scholars should be heard without the fear of ostracism or ad hominem attacks.&quot; The disinvitation occurred after Ham criticised Peter Enns of The BioLogos Foundation, who advocated a symbolic, rather than literal, interpretation of the fall of Adam and Eve. Ham accused Enns of espousing &quot;outright liberal theology that totally undermines the authority of the Word of God&quot;.

==Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate==

In February 2014, Ham debated with American science educator and engineer Bill Nye (popularly known as &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;) on the topic of whether young Earth creationism is a viable model of origins in the contemporary scientific era. Critics expressed concern that the debate lent the appearance of scientific legitimacy to creationism while also stimulating Ham&#x27;s fundraising. Nye said the debate was &quot;an opportunity to expose the well-intending Ken Ham and the support he receives from his followers as being bad for Kentucky, bad for science education, bad for the U.S., and thereby bad for humankind.&quot;

Ham said that publicity generated by the debate helped stimulate construction of the Ark Encounter theme park, which had been stalled for lack of funds. The Ark Encounter opened on 7 July 2016, a date (7/7) chosen to correspond with Genesis 7:7, the Bible verse that describes Noah entering the ark. The following day, Nye visited Ark Encounter, and he and Ham had an informal debate.

==Beliefs==
===Creationism===
According to Ham, he was inspired by his father, also a young Earth creationist, to interpret the Book of Genesis as &quot;literal history&quot; and first rejected what he termed &quot;molecules-to-man evolution&quot; during high school.

As a young Earth creationist and biblical inerrantist, Ham believes that the Book of Genesis is historical fact. Ham believes the age of the Universe to be about 6,000 years, and asserts that Noah&#x27;s flood occurred about 4,400 years ago in approximately 2348 BC. Astrophysical measurements and radiometric dating show that the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years and the age of the Earth is about 4.5 billion years. Arguing that knowledge of evolution and the Big Bang require observation rather than inference, Ham urges asking scientists and science educators, &quot;Were you there?&quot; The Talk.origins archive responds that the evidence for evolution &quot;was there&quot;, and that knowledge serves to determine what occurred in the past and when. &quot;Were you there?&quot; questions also invalidate creationism as science. Creationists argue that if the Bible is truly the word of God, creationism is not invalidated by this question, since God was there.

===Views on sexuality===
Ham claims that abortion, same-sex marriage, homosexuality, and being transgender &quot;are all attacks on the true family God ordained in Scripture&quot;. He believes that Christians should &quot;take back the rainbow&quot;, a popular symbol for the LGBT movement. As a condition for employment at the Ark Encounter, AiG, as directed by Ham, requires workers to sign a statement that they view homosexuality as a sin.

===Other beliefs===
Ham rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.

==Reception==
Chris Mooney, of &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, believes Ham&#x27;s advocacy of young Earth creation will &quot;undermine science education and U.S. science literacy&quot;. But Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; argues that the &quot;liberal intelligentsia&quot; have grossly overstated the influence of Ken Ham and those espousing similar views because, while &quot;religious ecstasy, however nonsensical, is powerful in a way reason and logic are not&quot;, advocates like Ham &quot;represent a marginalised constituency with little power&quot;.

Ham has been awarded honorary degrees by six Christian colleges: Temple Baptist College (1997), Liberty University (2004), Tennessee Temple University (2010), Mid-Continent University (2012), Bryan College (2017), and Mid-America Baptist Theological Seminary (2018).

On February 17, 2020, PBS aired a documentary about the Ark Encounter entitled &quot;We Believe in Dinosaurs&quot;. Filmmakers Monica Long Ross and Clayton Brown followed the story line of a &quot;religious organisation creating their own alternative science in a legitimate looking museum.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ham is married to Mally Ham; the couple have five children.

<doc id="198082" wikidata="Q15889800" url="?curid=198082" title="The Woodcraft Folk">
<text>Woodcraft Folk is a UK-based educational movement for children and young people. Founded in 1925 and grown by volunteers, it has been a registered charity since 1965 and a registered company limited by guarantee since 2012. The constitutional object of this youth organisation is &quot;to educate and empower young people to be able to participate actively in society, improving their lives and others&#x27; through active citizenship.&quot;

Woodcraft Folk was founded by Leslie Paul in 1925. It originated from the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, an organization led by ex-Scout Commissioner John Hargrave, who aimed to move away from the militaristic approach of the Scouts at that time. In its early days, Woodcraft Folk had strong pagan and anti-capitalist emphasis, but it gradually developed its own distinct ethos. The organization was closely tied to the co-operative, labour, pacifist, early feminist, and trade union movements during the 1920s and 1930s.

The Woodcraft Folk&#x27;s philosophy is centered around issues of social justice, pacifism, and the principles of cooperation. Its core values emphasize that all members have an equal say in the decision-making process, regardless of social background, status, age, gender, or sexual orientation. The organization welcomes young people of all religious backgrounds or none and places great importance on international understanding and friendship.

The Creed, or envoy, is a statement that reflects the principles and values of Woodcraft Folk. Members traditionally recite it at the beginning of group nights or formal meetings. The Creed emphasizes peace, kinship with all living things, the rejection of war, sloth, and greed, and the love of fellowship. Members pledge to work towards a new, better world through their actions and beliefs.

==History==
The name &#x27;Woodcraft&#x27; was used by writer and naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton at the start of the 20th century when setting up the American proto-Scouting organisation Woodcraft Indians, and in this context meant the skill of living in the open air, close to nature. Seton later influenced Robert Baden-Powell and became chief scout of the US.

John Hargrave admired Seton&#x27;s work and aimed to revert to it and away from Baden-Powell&#x27;s influence in founding the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. Another pro-Seton breakaway Scout group was the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry, founded slightly earlier in 1916.

Whilst sharing many of the same historical roots as the Scouting movement, Woodcraft Folk&#x27;s direct antecedent was the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, an organisation led by ex-Scout Commissioner for Woodcraft and Camping John Hargrave, who had broken with what he considered to be the Scouts&#x27; militaristic approach in the years immediately after the First World War. Woodcraft Folk was established by Leslie Paul in 1925 after the south London co-operative groups challenged Hargrave&#x27;s authoritarian tendencies over his refusal to recognise a local group called &quot;The Brockley Thing&quot; and broke away from the Kindred.

In its early days it was very similar to the Kibbo Kift, with a strong pagan and anti-capitalist emphasis, but gradually developed its own distinct ethos. In the 1920s and 1930s it had close ties to the Co-operative Societies and to the labour, pacifist, early feminist and trade union movements, which provided a base for recruiting both adults and children and a practical focus which avoided it sharing the fates of the Kibbo Kift and Order of Woodcraft Chivalry, which both became increasingly eccentric and esoteric and were both moribund by the 1950s.

The Woodcraft Folk remained mainly based in working-class districts of industrial towns and cities, notably London, Coventry, and Sheffield, and with strong connections to the Co-operative Societies until the 1960s when it began to acquire a larger middle-class membership. During the 1970s to 1990s there was a large increase in new &#x27;districts&#x27; (local branches) being founded in suburbs and small towns, some of which were short-lived.

Recruitment of new members slowed in the 1990s, apparently due to Scout and Cub groups admitting girls, which removed the Woodcraft Folk&#x27;s former appeal as the only organisation of its kind welcoming children of both sexes.

In the 1990s there was considerable debate within the movement, including over whether to keep or abandon the &#x27;Folk Shirt&#x27; (a green overshirt worn with badges) and over the role of camping and other outdoor activities. The Woodcraft Folk had traditionally attached great importance to outdoor activities and to urban children having access to the natural world, but camping has had a more peripheral role in recent years.

In 2000 Woodcraft Folk developed a birthday logo. There was much argument about which logo should be used on official publications, with the new square logo favoured for a long time by the Head Office. In 2008 Annual Conference Woodcraft Folk voted to stop using the 75th logo and resort only to the round logo on official publications.

The history within the labour movement can be seen in the book produced by Woodcraft Folk called &quot;Fashioning a New World&quot; which it commissioned for its 75th birthday. Other historical references exist, &quot;Cooperative Banners&quot; a book available from the Rochdale Pioneers museum contains banners of Woodcraft Folk. Woodcraft Folk historical records are held at the University College London. Much of these archives can be viewed on-line including resources on how to use them for young peoples groups.

==Philosophy==
The Woodcraft Folk has always been &quot;committed to issues of social justice, pacifism and the principles of cooperation&quot; and described itself in 1930 as a &quot;powerful educational instrument&quot;. A slogan of Woodcraft Folk is &quot;Span the world with friendship&quot;, it also uses &quot;Education for Social Change&quot; in its publicity and also constitutional documents.

Woodcraft Folk is not based upon any particular religious belief or national identity. The core values are that irrespective of social background, status, age, gender, sexual orientation etc. all members have an equal say in the decision making process. The organisation welcomes all young people whether they have a religious background or none and much of its work emphasises the importance of international understanding and friendship. The principles of peace and co-operation are therefore central to everything they do and they endeavour to develop members to have an understanding of some of the issues behind global poverty and conflict in the belief in fashioning a new, better world.

==The Creed==
Woodcraft Folk&#x27;s creed is traditionally said at the beginning of any group night or formal meeting, or sometimes sung. It is also known as the envoi. The tradition is that, when said, each person raises their right hand and says in unison:
&lt;poem&gt;
This shall be for a bond between us,
That we are of one blood you and I;
That we shall cry peace to all,
And claim kinship with every living thing;
That we hate War, Sloth and Greed,
And love fellowship.
And that we shall go singing to the fashioning of a new world.
PEACE&lt;/poem&gt;

There is an alternative to this, usually recited in younger groups such as Elfins (6–9). The words to this are as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;
We will do our best to be healthy and happy,
To care for the world and everything in it.
We will work with our friends in Woodcraft Folk
To build a fair and peaceful world for everyone.
PEACE.&lt;/poem&gt;

The envoi replaced the following Elfin Creed which was used in the 1960s and 70s:

&lt;poem&gt;
I will grow strong and straight – like the pine;
Supple of limb – like the hare;
Keen of eye like the eagle;
I will seek health from the greenwood,
Skill from crafts,
And wisdom from those who will show me wisdom.
I will be a worthy comrade in the Green Company,
And a loyal member of the World Family.

Pioneers:
For these things shall I strive;
A keen eye;
A seeing hand;
A body that fails not;
An arm that is strong and willing to serve;
A mind that yearns to understand;
A spirit that searches for the truth and loves the silent places;
A heart that is courageous and bears goodwill to all men.&lt;/poem&gt;

The last line was later seen by some as sexist and the ending was changed to &quot;and bears goodwill to all&quot;

At the end of camps everyone will link hands and sing the closing song (which is an old Rote Falken song):

&lt;poem&gt;
Link your hands together
A circle we make;
This bond of our friendship
No power can break.
Let&#x27;s all sing together
In one mighty* throng;
Should any be weary
We&#x27;ll help them along;
Should any be weary
We&#x27;ll help them along.

Let us then laugh lightly
If sadness should fall,
May joyous laughter
Spring from us all,
Helping each other
We&#x27;ll lighten the load,
Arms linked with comrades
We travel the road.

Let us march together
With firm step and strong,
As out from the darkness
We all go along,
All sorrow is banished
We march to the light,
Link your hands together,
We&#x27;re strong in our might.
PEACE&lt;/poem&gt;
*Some districts sing as &quot;merry&quot;

Until relatively recently the creed ended with a cry of &#x27;How&#x27; rather than &#x27;Peace&#x27;. This has been changed because the pseudo-Native American origin (with the patronising attitude implicit in its use) of the word &#x27;How&#x27; does not match Woodcraft&#x27;s policy of respect for other cultures.

Another alternative ending to group meetings involved the Folkmarshal and the Herald exchanging the following:

&lt;poem&gt;
Folkmarshal:
Now the time has come when we must part and go our ways to our workshops and our desks.
May we remember the joys of kinship and look forward to our reunion.
Peace and Goodwill to all.
Herald! Proclaim ye the law.

Herald:
List, O Woodcraft Folk, for it is the Law of Fellowship I proclaim.
Learn to grow strong like the pine.
Keep yourself supple and clean,
Read the great book of nature, be hearty, happy and keen.
Work when there is work to be done, be helpful to all those in need,
Be faithful and true to your word, and pure in thought, word and deed.
I have spoken.

Folkmarshal:
Go ye your ways, and may the Spirit of Woodcraft Help you in all your works,
Be ye loyal to our cause and faithful to your fellow citizens.
Be strong! Live Kindly! Love the Sun and Follow The Trail!
I have spoken.&lt;/poem&gt;

This would usually be followed by the campfire carol or other appropriate song.

==Decision making==
Woodcraft Folk is a democratic organisation. Policies are decided at annual conference (Annual Gathering), attended by delegates from groups and local districts. Between Annual Gathering responsibility for running the organisation falls on the members of the General Council. The organisation states that they &quot;are proud of the fact that about half of our current General Council are young people under 25 years of age&quot;.

The District Fellows (DFs) also have an annual decision making meeting, known as &quot;Althing&quot;. This is normally held in October. They have an elected committee where each post is held for two years. Any District Fellow is able to attend and vote on the motions. This is not to say that they are totally independent from the main body of Woodcraft Folk. District Fellows still have representatives at Annual Gathering, and decisions made there still apply.

==Age groups==
Woodcraft Folk groups operate in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. In Wales the organisation is known as &quot;Gwerin y Coed&quot;. Groups generally meet weekly, their activities including co-operative games, drama, camping trips, craftwork, singing and dancing, as well as following an educational programme based on the organisation&#x27;s aims and principles. Group nights last between one and two hours, depending on the age of the children or young people. Groups are divided by age.

===Woodchips===
Under six. The most recently established age group in Woodcraft Folk. Previously, under-sixes were known unofficially by several different names, including Pixies, Wood Pigeons and Mini-Elfins.

===Elfins===
Six to nine years old.

===Pioneers===
Ten to twelve years old.

===Venturers===
Thirteen to fifteen years old.

Venturer events are held nationally every three years as well as regional events happening more often such as midnight ice skating in London or North London Venturer Camp. A National Venturer Camp is held every three years so every Venturer can go once. Each camp has an overarching theme and runs activities for the Venturers to attend. The one held in 2010 at Biblins camp broke the three years regularity. This is because it would otherwise conflict with the coming International Camp in 2011. This enables Venturers who were thirteen during the camp in 2008 to attend Venturer Camp twice – once aged thirteen and once fifteen.

===District Fellows===

Sixteen- to twenty-year-olds are organised in a section called the District Fellows movement.

The District Fellows Movement (DFs) operates both on a local group level and as a semi-autonomous movement within Woodcraft Folk. The age group is largely run by DFs through the DF Committee. This organises three annual events, Winter Wonderland, Spring Awakening and DF Camp together with the AGM – Althing – and three regional, open committee meetings called Things. Other events celebrate music and fancy dress – such as &quot;Span That World With Costume&quot; and &quot;Span That World with Music&quot; – and members meet at regional events including beach bivvying and Valentines hostel weekends.

DFs have their own website, &quot;Span That World&quot;. They also run their own campaigns. The last campaign was on Workers&#x27; Rights and Trade Unions.

==Funding==
Woodcraft Folk is paid for by weekly subscription from children and young people, adult memberships paid yearly and groups pay annual national registration fees. Woodcraft Folk has also from its start received substantial support from the co-operative movement and is part of Cooperatives UK.

Woodcraft Folk used to receive a yearly subsidy from the Department for Education and Skills. In 2005, however, Woodcraft Folk lost this grant. The department said that the organisation&#x27;s claim for a grant lacked detail and that they did not have &quot;sufficiently robust outcome indicators&quot;, meaning that it did not represent a &quot;good value for money&quot;, although some members of Woodcraft Folk have claimed that the real reason the funding was stopped is the group&#x27;s strong stance against the Iraq War. This was the first time in forty years the organisation was denied funding by the department. The grant money provided a fifth of the funds that helped to pay for Woodcraft Folk&#x27;s full-time staff and headquarters.

Woodcraft Folk campaigned to get its funding back and before the May 2005 election was offered a seconded employee from the Department for Education and Skills starting in 2006 for a year and a return to limited funding the year after.

Woodcraft Folk also receives sporadic funding from grant providers for project work it undertakes such as the London Training grant from the City Bridge Trust. Other recent grants include those for Global Village 2006 from the Department for International Development and the Cooperative Group and for the 18-month Climate Challenge project, C-Change, from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

==Affiliations==

===International===
Although a British organisation, it has sister organisations throughout the world, by being a part of the Brussels-based federation of progressive youth organisations, the International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International (IFM-SEI).

The IFM-SEI links together like-minded progressive youth organisations in many parts of the world, though its strongest affiliates are in Western Europe and Latin America. It has a secretariat based in Brussels. Carly Walker-Dawson, a former Woodcraft Folk vice-chair is the (elected) secretary general. Woodcraft Folk&#x27;s former general secretary Andy Piercy sat on the Control Commission of IFM-SEI until 2007.

International camps where similar organisations can meet up and network are held every year in different countries. International camps take place in England every four years or so.

===Voluntary sector===
Woodcraft Folk is affiliated to NCVO, National Council for Voluntary Organisations, and to the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations.

In the development education field, Woodcraft is an affiliate of the Development Education Association.

===Youth service===
The main youth &#x27;quango&#x27; is the NYA, National Youth Agency, to which Woodcraft works closely. Woodcraft Folk plays an active part in the voluntary youth service, mainly through the NCVYS (pronounced &quot;nik-vis&quot;), the National Council for Voluntary Youth Service, which also includes groups such as The Scout Association and Girlguiding UK.

Woodcraft Folk is affiliated to the British Youth Council, an umbrella body for youth councils and youth organisations across the UK.

===Co-operative movement===
Woodcraft Folk has since its founding had close links with the co-operative movement, and currently receives considerable financial support from various co-op bodies.

Co-operatives UK (formerly the Co-operative Union) is the federation of all co-operatives in the UK. Woodcraft Folk are members of Co-operatives UK and work closely with the Co-operative College.

===Peace movement===
Woodcraft Folk are members of the Stop the War Coalition and affiliated to the National Peace Council, the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) and work closely with many local CND branches.

===Outdoor/environmental movements===
Affiliations are held with the Ramblers Association (RA), and Woodcraft Folk have a close relationship with Youth Hostels Association (YHA) attending the AGM and other statutory meetings. Woodcraft Folk is affiliated to the Council for Environmental Education (CEE) and The Central Council of Physical Recreation (UK) (CCPR).

The Forest School Camps (FSC) organisation, which organises democratically run camps for children and young people, has very similar objectives to Woodcraft Folk with shared historical links which continue today.

==General Secretaries and Chairs==
Woodcraft Folk Democratic Years run from June to May and their financial, administrative years run from January to December. The last two General Secretaries have been appointed in January and unless stated the Chairs are all elected after the Annual Gathering some time between July and August.

==Events==
Woodcraft Folk organise both local and regional camps and activities as well as larger national camps such as a camp for Venturers (see above) held every three years and an International Camp, usually held every five to six years.

The second to last event, the Global Village Youth Festival of 2006, was the first in over 60 years to be held as an official IFM-SEI camp. Since then, another international festival has taken place. It was called CoCamp and concentrated on cooperation in the world. CoCamp was an unofficial IFM-SEI camp with groups from all over the world participating in the event.

Regional events are aimed at supporting local communities and traditions and reminding its members of the importance of holding onto ideals of justice, democracy, peace and co-operation. The South West Woodcraft Folk for instance meet annually at Levellers Day and the Tolpuddle Martyrs festival.

==&quot;The Courier&quot;==
&quot;The Courier&quot; was a seasonal members&#x27; magazine bringing news from inside Woodcraft Folk as well as worldwide news on events of interest to members of Woodcraft Folk.

<text>The T-26 tank was a Soviet light tank used during many conflicts of the Interwar period and in World War II. It was a development of the British Vickers 6-Ton tank and was one of the most successful tank designs of the 1930s until its light armour became vulnerable to newer anti-tank guns. It was produced in greater numbers than any other tank of the period, with more than 11,000 units manufactured giving it the title of the most produced tank during the interwar period. During the 1930s, the USSR developed 53 variants of the T-26, including flame-throwing tanks, combat engineer vehicles, remotely controlled tanks, self-propelled guns, artillery tractors, and armoured carriers. Twenty-three of these were series-produced, others were experimental models.

The T-26 and BT were the main tanks of the Red Army&#x27;s armoured forces during the interwar period. The T-26 was the most important tank of the Spanish Civil War and played a significant role during the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, as well as in the Winter War in 1939–40. Though nearly obsolete by the beginning of World War II, the T-26 was the most numerous tank in the Red Army&#x27;s armoured force during the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The T-26 fought the Germans and their allies during the Battle of Moscow in 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus in 1942–1943; some tank units of the Leningrad Front used their T-26s until 1944. Soviet T-26 light tanks last saw use in August 1945, during the defeat of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria.

The T-26 was exported and used extensively by Spain, China and Turkey. Captured T-26s were used by the Finnish, German, Romanian and Hungarian armies. The tank was reliable and simple to maintain, and its design was continually modernised between 1931 and 1941. No new models of the T-26 were developed after 1940.

==British origin==
The T-26 (along with the Polish 7TP) was a Soviet development of the British Vickers 6-Ton (Vickers Mk.E variant) tank, which was designed by the Vickers-Armstrongs company in 1928–29. The simple and easy-to-maintain Vickers 6-Ton was intended for export to less technically advanced countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Thailand, China, and many others. Vickers advertised the tank in military publications, and both the Soviet Union and Poland expressed interest in the Vickers design.

In early 1930, the Soviet buying committee, under the direction of Semyon Ginzburg, arrived in the UK to select tanks, tractors, and cars for use in the Red Army. The Vickers 6-Ton was among four tank models selected by Soviet representatives during their visit to Vickers-Armstrongs. Under the contract signed on 28 May 1930, the company delivered to the USSR 15 twin-turreted Vickers Mk.E (Type A, armed with two .303 in (7.71 mm) water-cooled Vickers machine guns) tanks together with full technical documentation to enable series production of the tank in the USSR. The ability of the two turrets of the Type A to turn independently made it possible to fire to both the left and right at once, which was considered advantageous for breakthroughs of field entrenchments. Several Soviet engineers participated in assembly of the tanks at the Vickers factory in 1930.

The first four Vickers 6-Ton tanks arrived in the USSR at the end of 1930. The last tanks arrived in 1932, when series production of the T-26 was already in progress. The British tanks were sent to Soviet factories for study in preparation for series production and to military educational institutions and training units. Later, some tanks were given to military supply depots and proving grounds. The Vickers-built 6-Ton tanks were called V-26 in the USSR. Three British tanks were tested for cross-country ability at the small proving ground near Moscow on Poklonnaya Hill in January 1931. Kliment Voroshilov ordered the creation of the &quot;Special Commission for the Red Army (RKKA) new tanks&quot; under the direction of S. Ginzburg to define the tank type suitable for the Red Army. The T-19 8-ton light infantry tank, developed by S. Ginzburg under that programme at the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Plant in Leningrad, was a competitor to the British Vickers 6-Ton. The first prototype of the complex and expensive T-19 was finished in August 1931. Because both tanks had advantages and disadvantages, S. Ginzburg suggested developing a more powerful, hybrid tank (the so-called &quot;improved&quot; T-19) with the hull, home-developed engine and armament from the native T-19, and the transmission and chassis from the British Vickers 6-Ton.
On 26 January 1931, I. Khalepsky, Head of the Department of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the RKKA, wrote a letter to S. Ginzburg with information obtained via the intelligence service that the Polish government had decided to purchase Vickers 6-Ton light infantry tanks as well as Christie &quot;M1931&quot; cavalry tanks and to mass-produce them with the assistance of both the British and French. Because Poland was then considered, in Soviet military doctrine, to be the USSR&#x27;s main enemy, the Soviet Revolutionary Military Council decided to pass the foreign tanks into Red Army service, starting their production immediately without waiting for the completion of development works, in order to counter possible aggression. At that time, the RKKA had only several dozen outdated Mark V heavy tanks and Medium Mk.A and Renault FT tanks, captured during the Russian Civil War, together with various armoured cars and obsolescent domestic MS-1 (T-18) light infantry tanks. On 13 February 1931, the Vickers 6-Ton light infantry tank, under the designator T-26, officially entered service in the Red Army as the &quot;main tank for close support of combined arms units and tank units of High Command Reserve&quot;.

One of the Vickers 6-Ton tanks (equipped with Soviet-made turrets for the pilot batch of T-26 tanks) was tested for gunfire resistance in August 1931. The hull was subjected to rifle and Maxim machine gun fire with the use of normal and armour-piercing bullets at a range of . It was found that the armour withstood gunfire with minimal damage (only some rivets were damaged). Chemical analysis showed that the front armour plates were made from high-quality cemented armour (&quot;S.t.a Plat&quot; according to Vickers-Armstrongs classification), whereas the homogenous roof and bottom armour plates were made from mediocre steel. Even so, the British armour was better than armour produced by Izhora Factory for the first T-26s because of a shortage of modern metallurgical equipment in the USSR at that time.

At the same time, the Faculty of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the Military Technical Academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky developed two tank models (TMM-1 and TMM-2) based on the Vickers 6-Ton tank design but with an American Hercules six-cylinder water-cooled engine, improved front armour (to 15–20 mm), and a driver&#x27;s position on the left side. TMM stands for &quot;tank maloy moshchnosti&quot; or &quot;tank of low power&quot;. The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun in front of the hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved gearbox, a clutchless steering device and a 37 mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2&#x27;s maneuverability was found to be even worse).

==Design==
The Soviets did not simply replicate the Vickers 6-Ton. However, like its British counterpart, the T-26 mod. 1931 had a twin-turreted configuration and was designed to carry two machine guns, mounting one in each turret. A major difference was that the Soviet T-26 mod. 1931 had higher turrets (with an observation slit) than the British 6-Ton. Soviet turrets had a round firing port for the Degtyarev light machine gun, as opposed to the rectangular ports used by the original British design for the Vickers machine gun. The front part of the hull was also slightly modified.

Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were assembled using armoured plates riveted to a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced at the end of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank&#x27;s firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).

The hull and turrets of the T-26 mod. 1931 had a maximum armour thickness of 13–15 mm (until 1938, see below), which was sufficient to withstand light machine gun fire. Many twin-turreted tanks of the first series had 10 mm armour plates of low quality, which could be penetrated by 7.62 mm armour-piercing bullets from 

In 1933, the Soviets unveiled the T-26 mod. 1933. This model, which had a new single cylindrical turret carrying one 45-mm cannon L/46 (length in calibers, which meant quite high initial velocity, over 700–800 m/s depending on ammunition) and one 7.62 mm machine gun, became the most common T-26 variant. The 45 mm 20K tank gun was based on the Soviet 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K) and it was one of the most powerful anti-tank guns of its time. The T-26 could carry up to three secondary DT 7.62 mm machine guns in coaxial, rear, and anti-aircraft mounts. This increased firepower was intended to aid crews in defeating dedicated anti-tank teams, as the original machine gun armament had been found insufficient. The turret rear ball mounting for the additional DT tank machine gun was installed on the T-26 tanks from the end of 1935 until 1939.

The T-26 Model 1933 carried 122 rounds of 45 mm ammunition, firing armour-piercing 45 mm rounds with a muzzle velocity of , or lower-velocity high-explosive munitions. Tanks intended for company commanders were equipped with a radio set and a hand-rail radio antenna on the turret (so called &quot;radio tanks&quot;). Later the hand-rail antenna was replaced with a whip antenna, because experience in the Spanish Civil War and Battle of Lake Khasan showed that the hand-rail antenna drew fire onto commander tanks.

The tank was powered by a GAZ T-26 straight 4-cylinder air-cooled petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The engine did not have an over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for and an oil box for were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank — instead of — and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.

The transmission of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch connected to a gearbox, with five gears, in the front part of the vehicle by drive shaft passing through the vehicle. Steering was through steering clutches and band brakes. The gear change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.

Suspension (for each side) consisted of two bogies, four rubber-covered return rollers, a track driving wheel and a track idler. Each bogie consisted of a cast box with four twin rubber-covered road wheels connected by balancing levers and two one-quarter elliptic leaf springs. The cast track driving wheel with removable sprocket ring was located in front, and the track idler with a crank lever tightener was located at the rear of the vehicle. The track was made from chrome-nickel steel wide and consisted of 108–109 links.

The T-26 mod. 1931 did not have a radio set. The tank commander communicated with the driver by speaking tube, which was replaced with a signalling lamp in 1932. The T-26 was equipped with a fire extinguisher, a kit of spare parts tools and accessories (including a tank jack), canvas stowage, and a tow chain fixed on the rear of the hull.

The T-26 could cross -high vertical obstacles and -wide trenches, ford -deep water, cut -thick trees, and climb 40° gradients. Needless to say, it was easy to drive.

Beginning in 1937, there was an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun in the rear of the turret and an anti-aircraft machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was increased from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45 mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander&#x27;s panoramic sight.

In 1938, the T-26 was upgraded to the model 1938 version, which had a new conical turret with better anti-bullet resistance but the same welded hull as the T-26 mod. 1933 produced in 1935–1936. This proved insufficient in the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, so the tank was upgraded once more in February 1939 to have an underturret box with sloped (23°) 20 mm side armoured plates. The turret featured an increase to 20 mm at 18 degrees sloping. This time it was designated T-26-1 (known as the T-26 mod. 1939 in modern sources). There were subsequent attempts to thicken the front plate, but T-26 production soon ended in favour of other designs, such as the T-34.

==Series production==
===The beginning===
In 1931, the only Soviet factory suitable for T-26 production was the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience of manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also planned to use the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But the production of the T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37 mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62 mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.

The series production of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets proved to be more suitable for mass production. The production of the T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10 mm thick instead of the planned 13 mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. The business plan for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established to solve the problem of tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45 mm gun was launched in mid-1933.

Factory No. 174 also manufactured a few T-26s for military educational institutions. These were dissected tanks to demonstrate the relative position and function of tank components during tank crew training.

===Production in Stalingrad===
The Stalingrad Tractor Factory (STZ) was considered as one of the factories for production of the T-26 from 1932, but production in Stalingrad did not start until August 1933. This process went very slowly, with great difficulties because of delays with deliveries of machining equipment and press tools for the newly built factory. In 1936–1939 the Design Office of the STZ developed several experimental tanks (6 TK, 4 TG, STZ-25, STZ-35) based on the T-26 tank and the STZ-5 transport tractor. For instance, the STZ-25 (T-25) had the turret, rear part of the hull, engine and some transmission details from the T-26 mod. 1938, but the STZ-25 wheeled-tracked tank weighed and had 16–24 mm sloped armour. Factory managers tried to promote tanks of their own design rather than producing T-26s. As a result, the STZ failed to organise the series production of the T-26, but this experience helped to bring the T-34 into production in Stalingrad in 1941. The T-26s produced by STZ had no visual differences from other T-26s, but Stalingrad tanks were less reliable and more expensive.
===Modernization and repair===
Some early T-26 tanks were repaired in tank units or factories with the use of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the front wheels) and track idlers with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver&#x27;s hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10 mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the engine, oil tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and in the first half of 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26&#x27;s repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.

===Production in 1941===
Factory No. 174 produced its last T-26 tanks in February 1941. After that, the factory began retooling to produce the new and much more complex T-50 light tank. This work was slowed by delays in the delivery of new equipment and series production of the T-50 did not begin on schedule (planned for 1 June 1941). As a result, factory management decided to resume the production of the T-26, using T-26 hulls, turrets, and other parts already in stock. About 47 T-26 tanks were assembled and 77 were repaired in July–August 1941 before the factory was relocated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk in the end of August 1941, and then to Chkalov in September 1941. Factory No. 174 produced engines and spare parts for the T-26, installed additional armour plates on some T-26s, replaced flame-throwers with 45 mm tank guns in turrets of 130 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks, repaired tanks in army units (846 T-26s since the beginning of 1941) and mounted about 75 turrets from the T-26 and the T-50 as bunkers for the defence of Leningrad.

==Combat history==
The T-26 entered active service for the Red Army (RKKA) in 1932; it was used in many conflicts of the 1930s as well as during World War II. The T-26 together with the BT was the main tank of the RKKA armoured forces during the interwar period.

In the 1930s, T-26 light tanks were delivered to Spain (281 mod. 1933), China (82) and Turkey (60 mod. 1933 and 4 mod. 1931).

The T-26 first saw action in the Spanish Civil War. T-26s were used in almost all Spanish Civil War military operations against the Nationalists from 1936 to 1939 and demonstrated superiority over the German Panzer I light tanks and the Italian CV-33 tankettes, both of which were armed only with machine guns. During the battle of Guadalajara, T-26s outclassed the Italian tankettes, inspiring the design of the first Italian medium tank, the Fiat M13/40. During the war, Nationalist forces would attack the tanks with petrol bombs, the first time such weapons were used in war.

They were used in the Second Sino-Japanese War by the Chinese from 1938 to 1944, especially in the Battle of Kunlun Pass.

The next military operation the T-26 light tank participated in was the Soviet-Japanese border conflict, commencing with the Battle of Lake Khasan, in July 1938. The 2nd Mechanised Brigade together with the 32nd and the 40th Independent Tank Battalions had 257 T-26s, from which 76 tanks were damaged and 9 burnt towards the end of battle action. A small number of T-26 tanks, as well as some flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis, participated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol against Japanese forces in 1939. The T-26 was vulnerable to Japanese tank-killing teams armed with Molotov cocktails; poor quality welds left gaps in the armour plate, and flaming petrol easily seeped into the fighting compartment and engine compartment. The 37 mm gun on the Japanese Type 95 light tank, despite its mediocre performance, was also effective against the T-26. Portions of the armour plating on earlier models of the T-26 used riveted construction and were very vulnerable to both types of attacks. The use of riveted armour on some older T-26 models led to &quot;spalling&quot;, when the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, caused the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.
On the eve of World War II, T-26s served mainly in separate light tank brigades (each brigade had 256–267 T-26s) and in separate tank battalions of the rifle divisions (one company of T-26s consisted of 10–15 tanks). These were the type of tank units that participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 and in the Winter War from December 1939 – March 1940. The Winter War proved that the T-26 was obsolete and its design reserve was totally depleted. Finnish 37 mm antitank guns and even 20 mm antitank rifles easily penetrated the T-26&#x27;s thin anti-bullet armour and tank units equipped with the T-26 suffered significant losses during the breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line, in which the flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis played a significant role.

By mid-1941, most of the Red Army&#x27;s vast numbers of tanks were suffering from serious wear and tear. Poor quality roads, the vulnerabilities of track design in the early 1930s and inadequate maintenance, recovery and repair services all took their toll. In some of the front line armoured units, up to half of the T-26, T-28 and BT tanks had major drive train components (engine, drive train or suspension) that were broken down or worn out and these disabled tanks were parked and cannibalised for spare parts to keep the rest running. Tanks damaged during the 1939 Winter War with Finland were also cannibalised for parts.

On 1 June 1941, the Red Army had 10,268 T-26 light tanks of all models on their inventories, including armoured combat vehicles based on the T-26 chassis. T-26s composed the majority of the fighting vehicles in the Soviet mechanised corps of the border military districts. For instance, the Western Special Military District had 1,136 T-26 tanks on 22 June 1941 (52 percent of all tanks in the district). The T-26 (mod. 1938/39, especially) could withstand most German tanks in 1941 but were inferior to the Panzer III and Panzer IV participating in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and all of the Red Army&#x27;s tank models suffered severe losses due to the air supremacy of the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The majority of the Red Army&#x27;s T-26s were lost in the first months of the German-Soviet War, mainly to enemy artillery and air attacks. Many tanks broke down for technical reasons and lack of spare parts.
As the war progressed and Germany&#x27;s lighter tanks were replaced by the Panzer III, Panzer IV and heavier tanks, such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the vastly superior T-34. The remaining T-26s participated in battles with the Germans and their allies during the Battle of Moscow from 1941 to 1942, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus from 1942 to 1943. Some tank units of the Leningrad Front used their T-26 tanks until 1944.

The defeat of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria in August 1945 was the last military operation in which Soviet T-26s were used.

The Finnish Army used captured T-26s of different models during the Continuation War and some tanks served in Finland for various non-combat purposes until 1961. Captured T-26s were also used by the German, Romanian and Hungarian armies. The Romanian-captured vehicles saw some modifications (see below).
== Variants ==

===Twin-turreted tanks===
* : twin-turreted version armed with two DT tank machine guns. The first series-produced variant of the T-26 that was equipped with turrets differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and turrets, a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.

* T-26 model 1931 with gun plus machine gun armament: twin-turreted version with a 37 mm gun in the right turret (some modern sources mention this tank as T-26 model 1932). There were two models of 37 mm guns in the USSR suitable for mounting in light tanks at that time—the Hotchkiss gun (or its Soviet improved variant PS-1), and the more powerful PS-2 gun developed by P. Syachentov. The latter was superior, but only experimental models existed. Therefore, the first 10 pre-production T-26s, which had a design identical to the Vickers 6-Ton, were equipped with a Hotchkiss gun in the right turret to increase firepower compared to the machine gun armed Vickers tank. The experimental PS-2 gun was mounted on only three T-26 tanks, the right turrets of which were replaced with small gun turrets from the T-35-1 (prototype of the T-35 heavy tank).

As the series production of the PS-2 gun was delayed, the Main Artillery Agency of the RKKA gave preference to a new gun. It was developed by the Artillery Design Office of the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Factory, constructed from parts taken from the previously purchased German 37 mm anti-tank gun developed by Rheinmetall and the PS-2 gun. This system was successfully tested and the Artillery Factory No. 8 named after M. Kalinin started its series production under the designator B-3 (5K). The B-3 gun had less recoil and a smaller breech compared to the PS-2, so it could be easily mounted in the normal machine gun turret of the T-26. The first twin-turreted T-26 was armed with a B-3 gun in the right turret in late 1931. Unfortunately, series production of the B-3 gun proceeded slowly due to poor production standards (none of 225 guns produced in 1931 were accepted by army representatives; it took until 1933 to complete the original order for 300 guns placed in August 1931). Completed B-3 guns were mounted on BT-2 light tanks after mid-1932. This meant that twin-turreted T-26 tanks continued to be equipped with old 37 mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) guns. As production of the PS-1 gun had ended, some guns were taken from military supply depots and scrapped MS-1(T-18) tanks.

The initial plan was to arm every fifth T-26 with the 37 mm gun in the right turret, but the final proportion was somewhat higher. About 450 twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 tanks mounting the 37 mm gun in the right turret were produced in 1931–1933 (including only 20–30 tanks with the B-3 gun). There were 392 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with gun plus machine gun armament in the Red Army on 1 April 1933.

* (BPK stands for &quot;batal&#x27;onnaya pushka Kurchevskogo&quot; or &quot;battalion gun by Kurchevsky&quot;): twin-turreted version with a 76.2 mm recoilless gun (or &quot;dynamic reaction gun&quot;, as it was called at the time) in the right turret. At the end of 1933 M. Tukhachevsky suggested equipping some T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with the 76.2 mm BPK recoilless gun designed by L.V. Kurchevsky in a right turret to increase firepower. One prototype tank was built in 1934. BPK had a muzzle velocity of and a range of . The tank was able to carry 62 4-kg rounds. The test performed on 9 March 1934 demonstrated a significant increase in firepower, but the recoilless gun proved difficult to reload on the move, and the powerful blast projected behind the weapon when fired was dangerous to infantrymen behind the tank. Shortcomings were also observed in the design of the gun itself, and so the planned rearmament of twin-turreted T-26 tanks with recoilless guns did not take place.
* (TU stands for &quot;tank upravleniya&quot; or &quot;command tank&quot;): twin-turreted version with a simplex radio station No. 7N (communication range: 10 km) and a hand-rail frame antenna on the hull. The antenna lead was located in the front part of the underturret box roof between the turrets. The vehicle was intended for platoon (and higher) commanders. Three such tanks were successfully tested in September 1932 and seven more radio stations were delivered to the Factory No. 174, but it is unknown whether they were ever mounted on twin-turreted T-26 tanks. Series production of twin-turreted command radio tanks was scheduled to begin on 1 January 1933, but this did not occur because radio stations No. 7N were in short supply and because of the introduction of single-turreted T-26s with series-produced 71-TK-1 radio stations.

One twin-turreted T-26 was given to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank communication devices. The plan was to equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander&#x27;s tank would be equipped with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.

===Single-turreted tanks===
* : single turret version armed with 45 mm 20K tank gun and DT tank machine gun. This version had a new cylindrical turret with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the turret (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine gun in the turret. In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.
* : new conical turret, small changes in hull parts, increased volume of fuel tanks. Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 telescopic sight (or a TOS telescopic sight on the 1938 model).
* (): underturret box with sloped armoured plates, rear machine gun removed on some tanks, 97 hp engine. Tanks built after 1940 were equipped with an underturret box made from 20 mm homogeneous armour, a unified observation device, and a new turret ring. Some tanks were equipped with armoured screens. About 1,975 T-26 tanks with a conical turret (T-26 mod. 1938, T-26 mod. 1939) were produced.
* : tank with additional armour plating (appliqué armour). Some modern sources mention this tank as T-26E (E stands for &quot;ekranirovanny&quot; or &quot;screened&quot;). The Factory No. 174 developed the design of 30–40 mm appliqué armour for all types of single-turreted T-26s during the Winter War. On 30 December 1939, factory tests proved that the T-26 with appliqué armour successfully resisted fire from a 45 mm anti-tank gun at a range from 400 to 500 m. Side and front armoured plates were mounted with the use of blunt bolts and electric welding. Toward the middle of February 1940, the RKKA received 27 screened T-26 mod. 1939 tanks and 27 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks; an additional 15 T-26 mod. 1939 tanks were armoured by workshops of the 8th Army in Suoyarvi in the beginning of March 1940. All in all, 69 T-26s with appliqué armour were used during the Winter War and 20 more were delivered to tank units after the end of the war. Combat use proved that Finnish light anti-tank guns could not penetrate the armour of these tanks.

The T-26 mod. 1939 with appliqué armour weighed , which caused an overload of the chassis, transmission, and engine of the light tank. Drivers were advised to use low gears only.

During World War II, a mounting of 15–40 mm appliqué armour on about a hundred different T-26s was performed by local factories in Leningrad in 1941–1942, during the Siege of Odessa (1941), the Battle for Moscow and the Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942). A cutting of armoured plates was more rough than developed during the Winter War; the majority of these modified tanks did not have a moving armoured gun mask as seen in Factory No. 174&#x27;s original design, and some tanks had front appliqué armour only.

====Artillery tanks====

* : artillery T-26 or &quot;tank of fire support&quot; with a turret developed by self-taught inventor N. Dyrenkov at the Experimental Design Office of the Department of Mechanization and Motorization of the RKKA (UMM RKKA). Two types of turrets, armed with the 76 mm regimental gun mod. 1927 and DT tank machine gun in a ball mount, were assembled by the Izhora Factory. They were partially pressed and welded. The first variety was installed on the T-26 mod. 1931 in February 1932 and the second type was used in November 1932 (in the last case, the rear armoured plate of underturret box was made sloping).

It was found that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had insufficient observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; and it was hard to rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76 mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900 mm to 500 mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.
* : artillery tank with enlarged turret armed with the 76.2 mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 (some modern sources mention this tank as T-26A, A stands for &quot;artilleriysky&quot; or &quot;artillery&quot;). The turret was developed by the &quot;Bolshevik&quot; Factory (since February 1932—by the Design Office of the established Factory No. 174) in 1931–1932; it was installed on the T-26 mod. 1931 in November 1932. Unlike the A-43 turret, the turret by Factory No. 174 was much more convenient for the crew. The turret of the T-26-4 was quite similar to main turret of the T-28 medium tank.

The T-26-4 with the KT tank gun passed tests successfully and five vehicles were built in 1933–1934 as pilot batch. Initially it was planned to arm three of these T-26-4 with the 76.2 mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 and the other two tanks with the 76.2 mm PS-3 tank gun. The PS-3 tank gun was developed at the Experimental Engineering-Mechanical Department (OKMO) of the Factory No. 174 by engineer P. Syachentov. The PS-3 had better specifications in comparison with the series-produced KT tank gun and also had several technical innovations (foot firing switch, original training gear, travelling position fixing, binocular optical sight). The T-26-4 armed with the PS-3 tank gun was tested in October 1933 but it was found that the PS-3 was too powerful for the T-26 light tank—turret&#x27;s race ring and hull roof were deformed during gun fire, and the suspension springs were damaged. It was decided to arm the T-26-4 with the 76.2 mm KT tank gun only. All five experimental T-26-4 artillery tanks were tested during military exercises near Leningrad in September 1934 before scheduled series production of 50 such vehicles in 1935. But on 19 September 1934 an incident with a T-26-4 took place: a blow-back because of shell case destruction during gun fire. Despite the fact that this defect was unrelated to turret design, the military representatives cancelled the order to produce the T-26-4. Also the work to design turretless AT-1 artillery tanks armed with the powerful 76.2 mm PS-3 tank gun started at that time. The T-26-4&#x27;s turret construction was the design used in the series-produced BT-7A artillery tank.

In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) ordered the development of a new conical turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7&#x27;s turret and to arm it with the 76.2 mm L-10 tank gun. Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it was impossible to implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26&#x27;s chassis.

===Armoured combat vehicles===

A large variety of different armoured combat vehicles were developed on the T-26 chassis in the 1930s. Among them were KhT-26, KhT-130 and KhT-133 flame-throwing (chemical) tanks (552, 401 and 269 vehicles were produced, respectively); T-26T artillery tractors (197 were produced); TT-26 and TU-26 remotely controlled tanks (162 teletanks of all models were produced); ST-26 bridge-laying tanks (71 were produced); SU-5 self-propelled guns (33 were produced); experimental armoured cargo/personnel carriers, reconnaissance vehicles, and many others. The majority of these vehicles were developed at the Leningrad Factory of Experimental Mechanical Engineering (from 1935 known as the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov) by talented Soviet engineers P.N. Syachentov, S.A. Ginzburg, L.S. Troyanov, N.V. Tseits, B.A. Andryhevich, M.P. Zigel and others. Various vehicle-mounted equipment was developed for the T-26, including mine-clearing attachments, inflatable pontoons and a snorkel system for fording water obstacles, devices for overcoming obstacles and many others. T-26 light tanks were also modified into different armoured combat vehicles in the field during wartime.

===Foreign variants===

* Nazi Germany
:* 7.5 cm Pak 97/38(f) auf Pz.740(r): Ten Pak 97/38 anti-tank guns with shields were experimentally mounted on captured Soviet T-26 light tank chassis, resulting in vehicles designated 7.5 cm Pak 97/38(f) auf Pz.740(r). These self-propelled guns served with the 3rd Company of the 563rd Anti-Tank Battalion before being replaced by Marder III on 1 March 1944.
* Finland
:* T-26K &quot;K=Koulutus&quot; (Instruction): Finnish variant used for driver training. Similar to the T-26T artillery tractor, but with more boxy superstructure. 5 built from captured T-26s from 1947 to 1952.
:* T-26V &quot;V=Vetäjä&quot; (Towing): Finnish variant proposed for towing anti-tank guns. Similar to the T-26T artillery tractor. 3 prototypes converted from captured T-26s in 1944.
* Romania
:* T-26/37: Romanian proposal to rearm captured T-26s with 37 mm Škoda guns and 7.92 mm ZB machine guns.
:* Vânătorul de care R35: Romanian tank destroyer based on the Renault R35, using the T-26&#x27;s 45 mm 20-K gun. The first prototype even used the turret of a captured T-26.

== Survivors ==


There are about 45 T-26 tanks of various models preserved in different museums and military schools (mainly Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Finnish). The most notable of them are:
* Twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 in the Central Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Moscow (Russia): this tank from the 115th Rifle Division with shell holes was raised from a river bottom on the site of river crossing at Nevsky Pyatachok in July 1989 by &quot;Katran&quot; diving club. The vehicle was restored at the Pärnu Training Tank Regiment of the Leningrad Military District. It was donated to the museum in February 1998. Only two such vehicles are preserved at the present time.
* Twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 with gun plus machine gun armament and riveted hull in the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow Oblast (Russia). The single surviving twin-turreted T-26 armed with the 37 mm gun.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the Central Armed Forces Museum in Moscow (Russia): this late production variant was transferred from Kubinka Tank Museum in the 1980s.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the museum-diorama &quot;Breaching of the Leningrad Blockade&quot; in Mar&#x27;ino village near Kirovsk, Leningrad Oblast (Russia): this tank was raised from a river bottom at Nevsky Pyatachok in May 2003, without its turret and with a large shell hole on the right side of the hull. It is now displayed with a turret, but the shell hole in the hull is still present.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the Museum of the Northwestern Front in Staraya Russa, Novgorod Oblast (Russia): this tank was raised from the Lovat River in 1981 and became a monument to Soviet tankers in Korovitchino village (Novgorod Oblast). The vehicle was given to the museum in May 2004. The tank has inauthentic tracks.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the El Goloso Barracks Museum in Madrid (Spain): the tank (Spanish tactical number 135) with Nationalist Spanish markings with pressed gun mask is armed with a Hotchkiss machine gun instead of a DT tank machine gun. Produced in 1936. The anti-aircraft machine gun and the hand-rail radio antenna are late dummies.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the Museo Histórico Militar de Cartagena, Spain with Nationalist Spanish markings, in drivable condition.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): Finnish tactical number Ps 163–33, in drivable condition.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): this tank is described in many sources as early version of the T-26 mod. 1933. But in reality this is the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps 163–16) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank (which can be identified by rivets for mounting of a burning mixture tank, rivets for hinges of a filling hatch on the left side and a welded drain port on the right side behind a front track bogie) with a mounted riveted turret with a small rear niche from the early BT-5 light tank.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): the Finnish wartime modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps 163–28) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank with a mounted turret from the BT-7 light tank.
* T-26 mod. 1933 in front of the Istanbul Military Museum (Turkey). One of the 64 T-26 Tanks that were purchased from Russia in 1934. The T-26 remained in service with the Turkish army until 1943.
* T-26 mod. 1939 in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): this tank with pressed turret front armoured plate is in drivable condition (the GAZ-41 engine from the BRDM-2 was installed in 2005). The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded hole on the right side of the turret from a 50 mm shell).
* T-26 mod. 1939 in the Parola Tank Museum, (Finland): the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps 164–7); a hull from a KhT-133 flame-throwing tank with a mounted turret from the T-26 mod. 1938/1939 and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun in a hull front armoured plate.
* KhT-130 flame-throwing tank in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): in reality this is the TU-26 teletank control vehicle with a dummy flame-thrower.
* KhT-130 flame-throwing tank in the Military Unit No. 05776 in Borzya, Chita Oblast (Russia): monument (since 1995) with an incomplete chassis (one track bogie is missing; tracks and driving wheels were taken from the M3 Stuart American light tank). Before 1990 the vehicle stood in the territory of one of military units of the Soviet 39th Army (located in Mongolia) of the Transbaikal Military District. The single preserved KhT-130 at the present time.
* T-26 Model 1933 in the Bovington tank museum, UK. T-26A vehicle. Recovered, converted into a T-26B and used by Finnish forces.

<text>Martina Navratilova (, ; , ; born October18, 1956) is a Czech–American former professional tennis player. One of the most successful tennis players of all time, she was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles for 332 weeks (second-most of all time), including as the year-end No. 1 seven times, and was world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for a record 237 weeks. Navratilova won 167 top-level singles titles and 177 doubles titles (both the Open Era records), including an Open Era record 59 major titles: 18 in singles, a record 31 in women&#x27;s doubles, and 10 in mixed doubles. Her nine Wimbledon singles titles are an all-time record. Alongside Chris Evert, her greatest rival, Navratilova dominated women&#x27;s tennis for much of the 1980s.

Navratilova won a record six consecutive singles majors across 1983 and 1984 while simultaneously winning the Grand Slam in doubles. Navratilova claims the best professional season winning percentage, 98.8% in 1983 (going 86–1 for the season), and the longest all-surface winning streak of 74 straight match wins. She reached the Wimbledon singles final 12 times, including for nine consecutive years from 1982 through 1990. Navratilova is one of the three tennis players, along with Margaret Court and Doris Hart, to have accomplished a career Grand Slam in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, called the career &quot;Boxed Set&quot;. She won her last major title, the mixed doubles crown at the 2006 US Open, shortly before her 50th birthday, and 32 years after her first major title in 1974.

Originally from Czechoslovakia, Navratilova was stripped of her citizenship when, in 1975 at age 18, she asked the United States for political asylum and was granted temporary residence. She became a US citizen in 1981. On January 9, 2008, Navratilova reacquired Czech citizenship, thus becoming a dual citizen. She stated she has not renounced her U.S. citizenship nor does she plan to do so, and that reclaiming Czech nationality was not politically motivated. Navratilova has been openly gay since 1981, and has been an activist on gay rights.

==Early life and background==
Navratilova was born Martina Šubertová in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her parents divorced when she was three, and her mother, an accomplished gymnast, tennis player, and ski instructor, moved the family to Řevnice. In 1962, her mother Jana married Miroslav Navrátil, who became her first tennis coach. Martina then took the name of her stepfather (adding the feminine suffix &quot;-ová&quot;), thus becoming Martina Navrátilová. Her father, Mirek (officially Miroslav Šubert), was a ski instructor.

Navratilova has a younger sister, Jana, and an older paternal half-brother. Her grandmother, Agnes Semanska, was a tennis player for the Czechoslovak Federation before the Second World War and had a ranking as high as No. 2 among Czech women during her amateur career.

When Navratilova was four, she was hitting a tennis ball off a concrete wall and started to play tennis regularly at age seven. In 1972, at the age of 15, she won the Czechoslovakia national tennis championship. In 1973, aged 16, she made her debut on the United States Lawn Tennis Association professional tour but did not turn professional until 1975. Although perhaps most renowned for her mastery of fast low-bouncing grass, her best early showing at majors was on the red clay at the French Open, where she would go on to reach the final six times. In 1973, she made the quarterfinals, where she lost 6–7, 4–6 to Evonne Goolagong. She made the quarterfinals the next year and lost to Helga Masthoff (née Niessen).

==Professional tennis career==
===Early career===

Navratilova won her first professional singles title in Orlando, Florida, in 1974 at the age of 17. Upon arriving in the United States, she lived with former actress Frances Dewey Wormser and her husband Morton Wormser, a tennis enthusiast.

Navratilova was the runner-up at two major singles tournaments in 1975; the Australian Open (won by Goolagong) and the French Open (won by Chris Evert in three sets). After losing to Evert in the semifinals of the US Open in September, the 18-year-old Navratilova went to the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York City and informed them that she wished to defect from communist Czechoslovakia. Within a month, she received a green card and in 1981 became a US citizen. Also, in 1975, Navratilova teamed with world number one Evert to win the French Open women&#x27;s doubles title, Navratilova&#x27;s first major title outside of mixed doubles. They teamed again in 1976 to win the Wimbledon women&#x27;s doubles title over Billie Jean King and Bette Stove.

===1978 Wimbledon singles champion===
Navratilova won her first major singles title at Wimbledon in 1978, where she defeated Evert in three sets in the final and captured the world No. 1 ranking for the first time on the WTA computer, a position she held until Evert took it back in January 1979. She successfully defended her Wimbledon title in 1979, again beating Evert in the final, this time in straight sets, and earned the World No. 1 ranking at the end of the year for the first time. Just before Wimbledon in 1979, Navratilova and Evert played possibly the highest scoring women&#x27;s professional match ever in the Eastbourne final, in which Evert edged Navratilova 7–5, 5–7, 13–11 after facing match points. In 1980, Navratilova defeated previous six-time Wimbledon champion Billie Jean King in a two-day epic in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, with a scoreline of . In April 1981, Evert defeated Navratilova in the finals of the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association championships, held on clay at Amelia Island, 6–0, 6–0. It was Navratilova&#x27;s only professional double bagel loss (one she later avenged with a crushing 6–2, 6–0 defeat of Evert in the finals of the same Amelia Island event in 1984). It was at this point that Navratilova began working with Nancy Lieberman to improve her fitness and toughen her mental approach to better compete with Evert and fulfill her true potential. In 1981, Navratilova won her third major singles title by defeating Evert in the final of the Australian Open. Navratilova also defeated Evert to reach the final of the US Open, where she lost a third set tiebreak to Tracy Austin. Navratilova won both Wimbledon and the French Open in 1982.
===Dominance===
After adopting basketball player Nancy Lieberman&#x27;s exercise plan and using Yonex isometric midsize graphite-fiberglass composite racquets, Navratilova became the most dominant player in women&#x27;s tennis. After losing in the fourth round of the first major event of 1983, the French Open, she captured the year&#x27;s three remaining major titles (the Australian Open was held in December at that time). Navratilova&#x27;s loss at the French Open was her only singles defeat during that year, during which she established an 86–1 record. Her winning percentage was the best ever for a post-1968 professional tennis player. During 1982, 1983, and 1984, Navratilova lost a total of only six singles matches. This included a run of 13 consecutive victories over her closest rival and world-ranked No. 2, Chris Evert. Navratilova&#x27;s reign from 1982 to 1986 is the most dominant unbroken spell in the professional era.

Navratilova won the 1984 French Open, thus holding all four major singles titles simultaneously. Her accomplishment was declared a &quot;Grand Slam&quot; by Philippe Chatrier, president of the International Tennis Federation, although some tennis observers countered that it was not a true slam because the titles had not been won in a single calendar year. Navratilova extended her major singles tournament winning streak to a record-equalling six following wins at Wimbledon and the US Open. Navratilova&#x27;s victory meant she became the first player to win majors on clay, grass and hard court on the same year. She entered the 1984 Australian Open with a chance of winning all four titles in the same year. In the semifinals, Helena Suková ended Navratilova&#x27;s 74-match winning streak (a record for a professional) 1–6, 6–3, 7–5.

A left-hander, Navratilova completed a calendar grand slam in women&#x27;s doubles in 1984, partnering right-handed Pam Shriver. This was part of a record 109-match winning streak that the pair achieved between 1983 and 1985. (Navratilova was ranked the world No. 1 doubles player for a period of over three years in the 1980s.) From 1985 through 1987, Navratilova reached the women&#x27;s singles final at all 11 major tournaments held during those three years, winning six of them. From 1982 through 1990, she reached the Wimbledon final nine consecutive times. She reached the US Open final five consecutive times from 1983 through 1987 and appeared in the French Open final five out of six years from 1982 through 1987.

===Rivalry with Chris Evert===
In 1985, Navratilova played in what many consider to be perhaps the best woman&#x27;s match of all time, the French Open final against Chris Evert. Navratilova battled back from 3–6, 2–4 down to 5–5 all in the third set, before Evert hit a winning backhand passing shot on match point to defeat Navratilova 6–3, 6–7(4–7), 7–5. This was a major turnaround for Evert, who was so outmatched the year earlier in the final that Bud Collins remarked as a TV commentator that the sport needed to create a higher league for Navratilova to compete in. In outdoor matches against Evert, Navratilova led 10–5 on grass and 9–7 on hard courts, while Evert was up 11–3 on clay. On indoor courts, however, Navratilova had a decisive 21–14 lead. At the end of what is widely regarded as the greatest rivalry in women&#x27;s tennis, Navratilova led Evert 43–37 in total matches, 14–8 in Grand Slams, and 10–4 in Grand Slam finals.

===Rivalry with Steffi Graf===
In 1986 at the US Open, in the most anticipated match of the tournament, Navratilova prevailed over 17-year-old German Steffi Graf in the semifinals 6–1, 6–7(7–3), 7–6(10–8), saving three match points in an epic spread over two days. She then handily won the final over Helena Suková 6–3, 6–2. Navratilova, with partner Pam Shriver, also won the women&#x27;s doubles title. Navratilova also defeated Graf in straight sets at the WTA Tour Championship and with an 89–3 record, earned the number-one ranking for the fifth consecutive year.

Graf dominated the first half of the 1987 season including defeating Navratilova in straight sets in the semi-finals of the Miami Open and in the final of the French Open, 6–4, 4–6, 8–6. However, Navratilova defeated Graf in straight sets in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open (and at the US Open became only the third player in the Open Era, joining tennis legends Margaret Court and Billie Jean King, to win the women&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles at the same event—the rare &quot;Triple Crown&quot;). Navratilova reached all four Grand Slam finals in 1987, winning two of them (she lost the Australian Open to Hana Mandlíková). Graf&#x27;s two losses to Navratilova were her only losses of the year and with 11 tournament wins over the year versus 4 for Navratilova she was able to obtain year-end world No. 1 ranking ahead of Navratilova at No. 2. Graf eventually broke Navratilova&#x27;s records of 156 consecutive weeks and 331 total weeks as the world No. 1 singles player but fell 60 short of Navratilova&#x27;s record of 167 singles titles. Including doubles, Navratilova won almost three times as many titles as Graf with a record doubles/mixed/singles combined total of 344 titles to Graf&#x27;s 118.

In 1988, Graf won all four major singles titles, beating the 31-year-old Navratilova 5–7, 6–2, 6–1 in the Wimbledon final, their only match of the year, recovering from a set and a break down. Navratilova did not reach the finals of any of the other Grand Slam events but did win nine tournaments enabling her to claim the No. 2 ranking behind Graf.

In 1989, Graf and Navratilova met in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open, with Graf winning both encounters 6–1 in the third set. Graf also defeated Navratilova in the finals of the WTA Tour Championships their third and final match of the year. Navratilova, who skipped the French Open that year, did win eight titles and was able to capture the No. 2 ranking behind Graf for the third straight year. Despite the 13 year age difference between the two players, and Graf&#x27;s comparative lack of investment in doubles and mixed doubles, Navratilova won 9 of the 18 career singles matches with Graf and 5 of the 9 major singles matches with her. At age 34, Navratilova defeated Graf the last time they played in a major in the semifinals of the 1991 US Open 7–6(7–2), 6–7(6–8), 6–4, to end their Grand Slam rivalry 5–4 up, although it is noteworthy that all 4 of Graf&#x27;s Grand Slam victories over Navratilova came in the finals of a Slam. This is reflected in the Grand Slams Finals chart below.

===Final Grand Slam singles title===
Navratilova&#x27;s final Grand Slam singles triumph was in 1990. In the final at Wimbledon, the 33-year-old Navratilova swept Zina Garrison 6–4, 6–1 to claim an all-time record ninth Wimbledon singles crown. She won four other tournaments that year, although she did not participate in the Australian or French Opens, and finished the year ranked No. 3 in the world, narrowly edged by 16-year-old Monica Seles for the No. 2 spot. 
In September 1992, the 35-year-old Navratilova played 40-year-old Jimmy Connors in the third Battle of the Sexes tennis match at Caesars Palace in Paradise, Nevada. Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7–5, 6–2. She played for the Boston Lobsters in the World TeamTennis pro league through the 2009 season.

Though Wimbledon 1990 was her last major singles title, Navratilova reached two additional major singles finals during the remainder of career: in 1991, she lost in the US Open final to No. 1 Monica Seles; and, in 1994, at age 37, Navratilova reached the Wimbledon final, where she lost in three sets to Conchita Martínez. In November that year, after losing to Gabriela Sabatini in the first round of the WTA Tour Championships, she retired from full-time competition on the singles tour. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000.

===Focus on doubles===
In 2000, Navratilova returned to the tour to mostly play doubles events, while rarely also playing singles. In her first singles performance in eight years, at Eastbourne in 2002, she beat world No. 22, Tatiana Panova, then lost in the next round to Daniela Hantuchová in three sets. In 2003, she won the mixed doubles titles at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, partnering Leander Paes. This made her the oldest ever major champion (aged 46 years, 8 months). The Australian Open victory made her the third player in history to complete a &quot;boxed set&quot; of major titles by winning the singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles at all four majors. The Wimbledon win allowed her to equal Billie Jean King&#x27;s record of 20 Wimbledon titles (in singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles combined) and extended her overall number of major titles to 58 (second only to Margaret Court, who won 64). Navratilova made a return to singles at the 2004 French Open after an absence of 10 years, but she was defeated by Gisela Dulko in the first round. Shortly afterwards, and despite being criticized for receiving a wildcard, Navratilova won a singles match over Catalina Castaño 6–0 6–1 at the first round of Wimbledon in 2004, aged 47 years and eight months, to make her the oldest player to win a professional singles match in the open era. Navratilova then lost her second round match with the same player who had beaten her at the French Open the previous month, Gisela Dulko, in three sets.

On Thursday, July 6, 2006, Navratilova played her last matches at Wimbledon, with partner Liezel Huber losing a quarterfinal match in women&#x27;s doubles to fourth seeds and eventual champions Yan Zi and Zheng Jie, and later in the same day with partner Mark Knowles losing in the third round of mixed doubles to eventual champions Andy Ram and Vera Zvonareva. She had said that her last Wimbledon wasn&#x27;t about breaking her record shared with Billie Jean King of 20 championships. In an interview, Navratilova was quoted as saying, &quot;People keep saying that, but it so wasn&#x27;t. I just wanted to win one more title here, period.&quot;

===Retirement===
Navratilova capped her career by winning the mixed doubles title, her 41st major doubles title (31 in women&#x27;s doubles and 10 in mixed doubles) and 177th overall, at the 2006 US Open with American doubles specialist Bob Bryan. At the time, she was only about a month shy of her 50th birthday and broke her own record as the oldest ever major champion (aged 49 years, 10 months).
Navratilova won 167 top-level singles titles (more than any other player in the open era) and 177 doubles titles. Her last title in women&#x27;s doubles came on August 21, 2006, at the Tier I Rogers Cup in Montreal, Quebec, where she partnered Nadia Petrova. Navratilova won 18 major singles titles: nine at Wimbledon, four at the US Open, three at the Australian Open, and two at the French Open. Her overall record in 67 major singles events was 306–49 (120–14 at Wimbledon, 89–17 at the US Open, 51–11 at the French Open, and 46–7 at the Australian Open). Some observers argue that the very few singles match she played in her forties should be counted separately in her career statistics. She is the only player to have won at least one tour event for 21 consecutive years and won the singles and doubles at the same event a record 84 times. She was ranked in the world&#x27;s top 3 in singles for 15 years between 1977 and 1993. Her career singles match win total of 1,442 is the most during the open era.

==Playing style and coaches==
Navratilova had an attacking serve and volley. Under Renée Richards, she improved her game tactics.

Evert said that &quot;Martina revolutionized the game by her superb athleticism and aggressiveness...She brought athleticism to a whole new level with her training techniques — particularly cross-training, the idea that you could go to the gym or play basketball to get in shape for tennis.&quot;

Throughout her long career, Navratilova had many coaches. They included Miroslav Navrátil, George Parma, Věra Suková, Renée Richards (1981–1983), Mike Estep (1983–1986), and Craig Kardon (1988–1994).

==Coaching career==
In December 2014, it was announced that Navratilova had joined Agnieszka Radwańska&#x27;s coaching staff. However, in April 2015, after Radwańska struggled in the first half of the season, the pair decided to part ways.

==Personal life==
In 1985, Navratilova released an autobiography, co-written with &quot;The New York Times&quot; sports columnist George Vecsey, titled &quot;Martina&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Being Myself&quot; in the rest of the world. She had earlier co-written a tennis instruction book with Mary Carillo in 1982, entitled &quot;Tennis My Way&quot;. She later wrote three mystery novels with Liz Nickles: &quot;The Total Zone&quot; (1994), &quot;Breaking Point&quot; (1996), and &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; (1997). Navratilova&#x27;s most recent literary effort was a health and fitness book entitled &quot;Shape Your Self&quot;, which came out in 2006. An ESPN Documentary was produced about her rivalry with Chris Evert titled, &quot;Unmatched&quot;. Her rivalry and friendship with Evert is also detailed in the book, &quot;The Rivals&quot; by Johnette Howard and the children&#x27;s book, &quot;Martina and Chrissie&quot; by Phil Bildner.

===Sexuality and relationships===
In 1981, shortly after becoming a United States citizen, Navratilova gave an interview to &quot;New York Daily News&quot; sports reporter Steve Goldstein, coming out as bisexual and revealing that she had a sexual relationship with Rita Mae Brown, but asked him not to publish the article until she was ready to come out publicly. However, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; published the article on July 30, 1981. Navratilova and Nancy Lieberman, her friend and roommate at the time, gave an interview to &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; columnist Skip Bayless, where Navratilova reiterated that she was bisexual and Lieberman identified herself as straight. Navratilova since has reidentified herself as homosexual.

From 1984 to 1991, Navratilova had a long-term relationship with Judy Nelson, whom she met at a tournament in Fort Worth in 1982 (at the time Nelson was married with two children). Their split in 1991 resulted in a televised palimony lawsuit, which was settled out of court. On September 6, 2014, Navratilova proposed to her long-time girlfriend Julia Lemigova, a former Miss USSR, at the US Open. They married in New York on December 15, 2014.

===Health problems===
According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; Jane E. Brody, in September 1982, an acute attack of toxoplasmosis &quot;contributed to Martina Navratilova&#x27;s defeat during the US Open tournament&quot;, in which No. 1 seed Navratilova unexpectedly lost to No. 7 seed Pam Shriver in the quarterfinal round. By late October, Navratilova had &quot;apparently recovered&quot;.

Navratilova began to wear glasses in 1985 and recalled that her vision had begun to deteriorate in 1984. She continued to wear glasses for tennis for many years. Few tennis players wear sunglasses regularly for tennis and Navratilova is one of them. Although she achieved so much prior to using glasses, her glasses have become iconic. Some sports writers have said that they made her, as with other top athletes who had imperfect health, seem more vulnerable and human.

On April 7, 2010, Navratilova announced that she was being treated for breast cancer. A routine mammogram in January 2010 revealed that she had a ductal carcinoma in situ in her left breast, which she was informed of on February 24, and in March she had the tumour surgically removed; she received radiation therapy in May.

In December 2010, Navratilova was hospitalized after developing high altitude pulmonary edema while attempting a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

In January 2023, Navratilova was diagnosed with both throat (stage one) and breast cancer. This came after Navratilova discovered a swollen lymph node on her neck, leading her to take medical tests. In March 2023 and after more preventive radiation, she stated that she was cancer-free.

==Activism and opinions==
Navratilova is involved with various charities that benefit animal rights, underprivileged children, and gay rights. Navratilova serves as the Health and Fitness Ambassador for AARP in an alliance created to help AARP&#x27;s millions of members lead active, healthy lives. Navratilova has described herself as a vegetarian. In an April 2006 interview, she said she had begun eating fish again because she found it hard to get enough protein while on the road. Navratilova is a Democrat, and has donated more than $25,000 to Democratic campaigns.

===Gay rights===
Navratilova participated in a lawsuit against Amendment 2, a successful 1992 ballot proposition in Colorado designed to prevent sexual orientation from being a protected class. In 1993, Navratilova spoke before the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. In 2000, she was the recipient of National Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign.

Navratilova is a patron of the Lesbian Project, which describes itself as &quot;an organisation dedicated to representing the rights and interests of lesbians in the UK&quot;. She said &quot;At a time when lesbian rights in many countries are being eroded I am proud to be a patron of The Lesbian Project, an organisation dedicated to the well-being of UK based lesbians – a force for good.&quot;

===Anti-communism===
She is a vocal opponent of communism and was vocal in opposition to the Soviet Bloc power structure that compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union&#x27;s rule in Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian, which she was forced to learn in school.

===Republicans===
Navratilova was a guest on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Connie Chung Tonight&quot; show on July 17, 2002. During the show, Chung quoted a German newspaper which quoted Navratilova as saying:

Navratilova said that the remarks referred to what she perceived as a trend of centralization of government power and a loss of personal freedom. In the discussion that followed, Chung stated:

Navratilova responded,

Navratilova was quoted in 2007 as being ashamed of the U.S. under President George W. Bush because, unlike the communist regime in Czechoslovakia which established its dictatorship as a result of the 1948 coup d&#x27;état, Bush was democratically elected.

===Views on transgender people===
Navratilova is a vocal critic of allowing transgender women to compete in women&#x27;s sports, describing them as &quot;failed male athletes&quot;. She rejects accusations of transphobia, and says she deplores &quot;a growing tendency among transgender activists to denounce anyone who argues against them and to label them all as &#x27;transphobes.&#x27;&quot; Following an article on the subject that Navratilova wrote for &quot;The Times&quot; in February 2019, Athlete Ally, an LGBTQ athlete advocacy group, removed Navratilova from their advisory board, stating her comments &quot;are transphobic [and] based on a false understanding of science and data&quot;.

In March 2019, Navratilova apologized for using the term &quot;cheating&quot; when discussing whether transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in women&#x27;s sport. She also called for &quot;a debate, a conversation that includes everyone and is based, as I have said, not on feeling or emotion but science.&quot;

In an April 2019 article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, she opined that the Equality Act, in its current form, &quot;would make it unlawful to differentiate among girls and women in sports on the basis of sex for any purpose&quot;.

In June 2019, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Trans Women Athlete Dispute with Martina Navratilova&quot;, where she interviewed people including trans women athletes and sports researchers, presenting evidence on both sides of the debate of whether trans women have any advantage in elite sports. Her closing remarks were:

In August 2020, Navratilova along with 300+ women signed a letter to the National Collegiate Athletic Association in support of an Idaho law that bans trans women student athletes from competing in female sports.

In 2021, Navratilova became a leader of the Women&#x27;s Sports Policy Working Group, formed in response to US President Joe Biden&#x27;s Executive Order 13988 mandate that offered blanket inclusion for all trans women athletes. The stated goal of the group is &quot;protecting girls and women in competitive sports categories, while, wherever possible, crafting accommodations for trans athletes into sport.&quot;

In April 2023, Navratilova supported of a boycott of Nike because it had entered into a corporate sponsorship with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender woman, to advertise a sports bra.

In October 2023, Navratilova criticized US Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland&#x27;s interview of environmentalist drag queen Pattie Gonia outside New York&#x27;s Stonewall National Monument, calling the performer a &quot;pathetic parody of women.&quot;

Navratilova has condemned the IOC for allowing women boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, whom she believes to be &quot;biological males&quot;, to compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics, despite there being no evidence that this is the case.

==Career statistics==
===Grand Slam singles finals: 32 (18–14)===
By winning the 1983 US Open title, Navratilova completed the career Grand Slam, becoming only the seventh woman in history to achieve it.

Navratilova is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time and in 2005, &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine selected her as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1965 through 2005, directly over Steffi Graf. Billie Jean King, a former World No. 1 player, said in 2006 that Navratilova is &quot;the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who&#x27;s ever lived.&quot; In 2008, tennis historian and journalist Bud Collins called Navratilova &quot;arguably, the greatest player of all time.&quot;

In 2000, she became a member of the Laureus Sports Foundation&#x27;s Academy.

In 2006, Martina Navratilova was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the LGBT History Month.

==Media==
In 1983, Martina Navratilova and Vijay Amritraj appeared in the &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; episode &quot;Love Game&quot; as themselves, as the guests of honor at a charity tennis event. Her role was the more significant; she partnered with the lead male character Jonathan Hart (Robert Wagner) in a mixed doubles match. Though a homage rather than an appearance, in 1992 Navratilova was mentioned by the titular character in episode 14 of the anime Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon. In 1996, Navratilova was featured with American football player Art Monk in an endorsement for PowerBook in an ad series &quot;What&#x27;s on Your PowerBook?&quot;
In 2000 Martina appeared as herself on Will &amp; Grace &quot;Lows in the Mid-Eighties&quot; as one of Karen Walker&#x27;s (Megan Mullally) paramours in a flashback sequence.

In November 2008, Martina Navratilova appeared on the UK&#x27;s ITV series Series 8 of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;; she finished runner-up to Joe Swash. In February 2012, Navratilova was announced as a cast member on the 14th season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with Tony Dovolani, but they were the first pair eliminated. Navratilova guest-starred as a dissatisfied Yelp reviewer in episode three of the third season of absurdist comedy &quot;Portlandia&quot;. In 2019, Navratilova had a recurring role portraying Brigitte, a horse trainer, in the Netflix series, &quot;The Politician&quot;.

In 2018, it was reported that Glenn Greenwald was developing a feature-length documentary about Navratilova with Reese Witherspoon&#x27;s production company, Hello Sunshine. Greenwald described Navratilova as his childhood hero and as a social justice pioneer. During an interview at the Salesforce World Tour London 2024 event, Navratilova confirmed that a documentary was currently being filmed with her and Chris Evert, and would be released in 2025.

<text>Daventry ( , ) is a market town and civil parish in the West Northamptonshire unitary authority area of Northamptonshire, England, close to the border with Warwickshire. At the 2021 Census, Daventry had a population of 28,123. making it the sixth-largest town in Northamptonshire.

==Geography==
The town is located north-north-west of London via the M1 motorway, west of Northampton, south-west of Rugby and north-north-east of Banbury.

Other nearby places include Southam, Coventry and the villages of Ashby St Ledgers, Badby, Barby, Braunston, Byfield, Charwelton, Dodford, Dunchurch, Everdon, Fawsley, Hellidon, Kilsby, Long Buckby, Newnham, Norton, Staverton, Welton, Weedon and Woodford Halse. The town is twinned with Westerburg, Germany.

The town lies at around above sea level. To the north and west, the land is generally lower than the town. Daventry sits on the watershed of the River Leam which flows to Leamington Spa, Warwick and the west of England and the River Nene which flows east. There is no river in the town; the largest gatherings of water are two reservoirs made to supply the canal that swings from Watford Gap into the West Midlands through the Braunston Tunnel around the north of the town. To the north-west is Drayton Reservoir and to the north-east is the Daventry Reservoir and country park.

Watford Gap is about north-east of the town; through this gap pass the A5 (Watling Street Roman road), the Grand Union Canal, West Coast Main Line, the Northampton Loop Line and most recently the M1 motorway.

Daventry has several housing estates, which include Drayton, Middlemore Farm, Lang Farm, Ashby Fields, Royal Oak, Timken, Stefen Hill, The Grange, The Southbrook, The Headlands and most recently Monksmoor Park.

==Characteristics==
The small historic core of Daventry, centred on High Street, Market Place, New Street, Sheaf Street and their surrounding streets is a conservation area, with most of its buildings dating from the 17th to 19th centuries including many listed buildings. Until the 1950s, Daventry was a small market town with a population of around 4,000. All of the subsequent growth of the town has occurred during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Consequently, the historic core of the town is surrounded by modern roads, housing, and industrial estates.

There are two country parks on the edge of the town; just north-east of the town centre is the Daventry Country Park, based around a canal reservoir, just east of the A425. On the south-eastern edge of the town is the Borough Hill country park.

There are 74 buildings or groups of buildings in the centre of Daventry that are on the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest led by the Church of Holy Cross at grade I. Grade II*buildings include the Saracen&#x27;s Head (now Wetherspoons), the Moot Hall (see below), the Wheatsheaf (now a residential home), 27, 29, 36, 57, 59 High Street and 2, 20, and 22 Sheaf Street. Grade II listed buildings include several in Market Place, Church Walk, New Street, High Street, Sheaf Street and the United Reformed Church, the Burton Memorial (commemorating Edmund Charles Burton, Town Clerk of Daventry; see photo at left), Danetre Hospital Offices (former workhouse) and Middlemore Farmhouse (now a pub), also in Drayton – School Street and Orchard Street.

A street market is held every Tuesday and Friday in High Street, although its original site was on the aptly named Market Square. There is a modern shopping precinct adjacent to the High Street called Bowen Square.

An alternative pronunciation for Daventry used by locals is &#x27;Daintree&#x27;, but this has become less common.

==History==
===Early history and toponymy===
Daventry is overlooked by the Borough Hill on the eastern edge of the town. The hill has been the site of human activity dating back into prehistory: remains have been found of two Bronze Age barrows, two Iron Age hill forts – one of which is the fourth largest found in Britain, and a later Roman villa and farming settlement.

According to local folklore Daventry had Danish (Viking) origins, this was partly due to the old pronunciation of Daventry as &quot;Daintry&quot;, which was interpreted as &quot;Dane Tree&quot;, however in more modern interpretation the town&#x27;s name is thought likelier to be Anglo-Saxon in origin: &quot;Dafa&#x27;s tree&quot; (Dafa being a founding father or paterfamila) and there was very likely a meeting tree, possibly on Borough Hill. Thus the name may have been formed on lines similar to Coventry (&quot;Cofa&#x27;s tree&quot;, i.e. &quot;tree of Cofa&quot;). Another theory which was popular in the 19th century, was that of Thomas Pennant, the Welsh naturalist and antiquarian, who acknowledged the town&#x27;s &#x27;considerable antiquity&#x27; and speculated that the name was Brythonic, &quot;dwy-avon-tre&quot; (town of two rivers), a derivation seemingly supported by the town&#x27;s topography, situated as it is between the sources of the River Leam, which flows west, and the River Nene which flows east. This theory however is now discredited.

===Medieval and Tudor===
Daventry was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Daventrei&quot;. It was recorded as belonging to Countess Judith, niece of William the Conqueror.

In around 1108, Daventry Priory a small Cluniac priory was founded at Daventry, alongside the parish church. The priory was closed in 1526 by Cardinal Wolsey who granted its assets to Christ Church, Oxford.

In 1203 a market was first recorded at Daventry. The market benefited from Daventry&#x27;s location upon the main road (now the A45 road) linking the important city of Coventry with Watling Street (now the A5 road) which was the main route from the Midlands to London, which brought in much passing trade.

In 1576 Daventry grammar school was founded by William Parker, a woollen draper and native of the town. The original schoolhouse on New Street, dating from around 1600 still stands, although it is now a private house. That same year Queen Elizabeth I granted Daventry borough status.

The town was mentioned by William Shakespeare in &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; (Act IV, Sc II), which refers to &quot;the red-nosed innkeeper of Daventry&quot;. Shakespeare would have known Daventry due to its relatively close proximity to Stratford-upon-Avon, and its position on the main route from the Midlands to London.

===English Civil War===
During the English Civil War, the army of King Charles I stayed at Daventry in 1645 after storming the Parliamentary garrison at Leicester and on its way to relieve the siege of Oxford. The King stayed at the Wheatsheaf Inn, whilst his Royalist army camped on Borough Hill.

According to local legend, it was during his stay at the Wheatsheaf Inn in Daventry that Charles was twice visited by the ghost of his former adviser and friend, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who advised him to keep heading north and warned him that he would not win through force of arms.

However, Parliament&#x27;s newly formed New Model Army, led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, was marching north from besieging Oxford after being instructed to engage the king&#x27;s main army. Fairfax&#x27;s leading detachments of horse clashed with Royalist outposts near Daventry on 12 June, alerting the king to the presence of the Parliamentary army. The Royalists made for their reinforcements at Newark-on-Trent but after reaching Market Harborough turned to fight, which resulted in the decisive Battle of Naseby, in which the Royalist army was heavily defeated by the Parliamentarians. The village of Naseby is approximately northeast of Daventry.

===Dissenters===
English Dissenters founded a Dissenting chapel in the town around 1722 in buildings opposite The Wheatsheaf on the southern end of Sheaf Street. Later in 1752 a Dissenting Academy was moved from Northampton to this site. The chemist and theologian Joseph Priestley studied there from 1752 to 1755. In 1789, the Academy moved back to Northampton.

===Coaching town===

Daniel Defoe described Daventry as a &quot;considerable market town which subsists chiefly on the great concourse of travellers on the old Watling Street way.&quot;

During the Georgian era of the 18th and early 19th century, a national system of turnpike roads with improved road surfaces developed, this in turn allowed the development of a national system of mail coaches and long distance passenger stagecoaches. Daventry, being located on the main roads linking London with the West Midlands, Holyhead and Lancashire, flourished as a coaching town. There were many coaching inns in the town including the &quot;Wheatsheaf&quot; the &quot;Saracen&#x27;s Head&quot; the &quot;Plough and Bell&quot; the &quot;Dun Cow&quot; and the &quot;Brown Bear&quot;.

At the zenith of the coaching era in the 1830s, Daventry had become a major hub of the national network, with more than 250 coaches passing through the town every week, including services between London, Warwick, Birmingham, Liverpool and Holyhead, and Birmingham and Cambridge.

Reflecting Daventry&#x27;s prosperity, many of the town&#x27;s finest building were constructed during this period, including, most notably, the Holy Cross Church of 1758.

===Stagnation and decline 1838–1955===

The Industrial Revolution largely passed Daventry by, owing to its failure to become linked to the newer transport networks: The Grand Junction Canal (now Grand Union) had opened in 1796, and passed a few miles north of Daventry. An arm from the canal to Daventry was proposed, and was included in the Act of Parliament authorising it, however this was never built.

The opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 signalled the beginning of the railway age; almost immediately the coaching trade slumped and Daventry entered a long period of stagnation and decline which lasted for over a century: In 1841 Daventry had a population of 4,565, from thereon it went into steady decline until 1911, when it bottomed out at 3,516, and then slowly recovered, reaching 4,077 in 1951, but did not recover to the 1841 level until later in the 1950s.

The London and Birmingham Railway passed a few miles to the east of the town through the Watford Gap. A branch line to Daventry was included in the original Act of Parliament, however, despite several earlier attempts, the line was not built until 1888, when a short branch was built from Weedon to Daventry railway station. In 1895 the line was extended to Leamington Spa. However being only a branch line this did little to revive the town&#x27;s economy. The only significant industry to develop in the town during this time was shoemaking, which at its height in the 1870s employed around 700 workers.

===Broadcasting station===
In 1925, the newly created BBC constructed a radio transmitting station on Borough Hill just outside the town. Daventry was chosen because it was the point of maximum contact with the land mass of England and Wales. From 1932 the BBC Empire Service (now the BBC World Service) was broadcast from there. The radio announcement of &quot;Daventry calling&quot; made Daventry well known across the world. It was the BBC&#x27;s use of the literal pronunciation in this call-sign that resulted in the widespread displacement of the historical pronunciation &quot;Daintree&quot; (). The transmitting station contributed to the town&#x27;s population revival, as a number of BBC staff and their families moved into the area.

At its height by 1990 the station had 43 radio masts, however the station closed in 1992 and all but one of the radio masts was taken down, with most of the land being sold to Daventry District Council who opened it up to the public as a country park. A commercial unit of the BBC remained based locally for a few years after. A busy directional radio beacon (VOR), identifier &quot;DTY&quot;, for aircraft is situated approximately south of the town. The town also gives its name to the busy Daventry air traffic control sector.

====Radar experiment====
On the early morning of Tuesday 26 February 1935 the radio transmitter at Daventry was used for what became known as the &quot;Daventry Experiment&quot; which involved the first-ever practical demonstration of radar, by its inventor Robert Watson-Watt and Arnold Frederic Wilkins. They used a radio receiver installed in a van at Litchborough (just off the A5 about south of Daventry) to receive signals bounced off a metal-clad Handley Page Heyford bomber flying across the radio transmissions. The interference picked up from the aircraft allowed its approximate navigational position to be estimated, and therefore proved that it was possible to detect the position of aircraft using radio waves. The success of the experiment persuaded the British government to fund the development of a network of full scale radar stations on the south coast of England, known as Chain Home, which provided a decisive advantage to the RAF in the Battle of Britain in 1940.

75 years to the day of the original launch, on 26 February 2010, teams from the Coventry Amateur Radio Society &amp; The Northampton Radio Club re-enacted the &#x27;Daventry Experiment&#x27;. Signals from GB75RDF at Borough Hill, reflected from aircraft (all of which were flown by radio hams), were detected in a receiving set housed in a replica Morris van. The receiving station set up in the field that is the home to The Birth of RADAR memorial at Litchborough. The team was led by Brian Leathley, known as Andrew G8GMU.

Borough Hill was also the site of the Gee Eastern chain master transmitter mast: this was part of a radio navigation system used by the Allies during World War II. Borough Hill Roman villa is also located here.

===Daventry since 1955===
The modern growth of Daventry occurred from the mid-1950s onwards. Real growth started in 1955 when the tapered roller bearing manufacturer British Timken opened a large factory in the town (the factory closed in 1993 although the distribution Centre stayed open until 2000).

The town&#x27;s fortunes were also boosted when the first phase of the M1 motorway was opened nearby, giving the town a direct motorway link with London, with the expansion of the motorway network connecting it to the north of England within a decade.

Despite the growth of the town, Daventry railway station was closed to passengers in 1958, with the line closing to freight in 1963.

====Planned expansion====
In 1961, Daventry was designated as an &#x27;overspill&#x27; to house people and industry relocated from Birmingham, as government policy of the time favoured moving population and industry away from Birmingham. Although Daventry was not formally designated as a New Town, its expansion bore many similarities to such developments: A planned expansion of the town was carried out as part of a three-way agreement between Birmingham City Council, Daventry Borough Council, and Northamptonshire County Council: Birmingham&#x27;s role was to buy land, and build houses and industrial estates, Northamptonshire provided roads, schools and libraries, whilst Daventry provided drainage and sewage disposal. 

Work on the official expansion of Daventry began in the second half of the 1960s, when Birmingham City Council purchased nearly of land to be developed for housing and industrial use. The first phase of this expansion was constructed on the south-east slopes of Borough Hill and was named the Southbrook Estate. It was designed and laid out by the architect J A Maudsley for City of Birmingham Architects Department. This began in 1966. and is designed with short terraces of dwellings grouped around a series of cul-de-sacs grouped around a large looped access road around the edge of the hill. There is a central focal point which has schools for children from early years to senior level. There are several service shops and originally there was an estate public house but that was demolished in the mid 1990s. There is also a community centre.

The plan got off to a good start, and by 1972 more than 1,000 new families had moved to Daventry, along with many new industries. However by the mid-1970s growth had slowed sharply, due to a combination of the faltering national economy and public spending cuts. The planning agreement had originally been intended to last for 30 years (until 1991) however Birmingham City Council decided to pull out of it half way through in 1976, due in part to spending cuts, but also as it had become clear that the town&#x27;s plan was falling short of expectations: The target population had been 36,000 by 1981, but actual growth was much slower than this, nevertheless, between 1961 and 1981 the population had nearly tripled from 5,860 to 16,178; Subsequent growth in the following decades has been slower and driven mainly by private developments. The population had reached 22,367 by 2001, and by 2011 it was 25,026.
====Recent history====
Daventry was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. In 1995 RAF Daventry was listed as a USAF communication facility by the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces Nicholas Soames in answer to a question from Max Madden. RAF Daventry is most likely the transmitter base at a former WW1 isolation hospital site on the Staverton to Newnham road which was eventually sold by the Ministry of Defence in 2007.

In 2006, the outdoor pool – which had been built and funded by Daventry residents in the 1950s following the drowning of three children in the local reservoir – was closed due to funding difficulties. In 2007, Daventry began plans to modernise the town with a futuristic personal rapid transit system that would link outer estates to the town centre, and a canal arm with marina next to the former site of the outdoor pool. In May 2018, the District Council dropped the building a canal arm and marina scheme in favour of achievable projects.

In March 2018, the town&#x27;s High Street was used as a filming location for the feature film, &quot;Nativity Rocks!&quot;.

==Politics and government==
Daventry is a civil parish within the unitary authority of West Northamptonshire which was created in 2021. From 1576 until 1974, Daventry had been a borough: The ancient borough of Daventry, created in 1576 was reconstituted as a municipal borough in 1835. In 1974 the municipal borough was abolished and merged into the much larger Daventry District, which also included a large rural area. In 2021 the Daventry District was itself abolished and merged into the even larger unitary authority of West Northamptonshire.

From 1974, the area of the former borough of Daventry became an unparished area with charter trustees until 2003, when Daventry became a civil parish and gained its own Town (parish) Council. Daventry Town Council currently has 16 councillors representing four wards. The Mayor of Daventry is elected annually by the members of the town council. The town council has responsibility for a number of functions such as managing the town&#x27;s market, open spaces, allotments, cemeteries, museum, and CCTV. All other local services are the responsibility of West Northamptonshire Council.

Daventry is represented in Parliament by the Daventry Parliamentary constituency, which is a safe Conservative seat, the MP representing the seat since 2024 has been Stuart Andrew.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
*The Holy Cross Church is the grade I listed parish church of Daventry. Holy Cross is the only 18th-century town church in Northamptonshire. It was built between 1752 and 1758 by David and William Hiorne and is constructed of the local ironstone. It has been the only Church of England church in the town, except when there was a daughter church of St James, a Commissioners&#x27; church built in 1839, by architect Hugh Smith, and stood on the east side of St James Street. It was demolished in 1962.
*The grade II* listed Moot Hall stands on the north side of the Market Square next to the Plume of Feathers inn. It was built in 1769 from ironstone and has had various uses over the years, including town council building, the mayor&#x27;s parlour, town museum and tourist information office, an Indian restaurant and a children&#x27;s nursery. It is of two and a half storeys, and has three bays of windows. The main entrance and its porch is on the western elevation which dates back to 1806. The original staircase from the Moot Hall is now installed at Welton Manor House.
*The Wheatsheaf Hotel is a former coaching inn on Sheaf Street, dating from the early 17th century, but refronted in the early 19th century. King Charles I stayed here before the Battle of Naseby in 1645. It is grade II*listed. It closed as an inn in 1990, and was converted into a nursing home for the elderly known as Wheatsheaf Court.
*The former Daventry Grammar School building on New Street dates from 1600, making it one of the oldest buildings in the town. It was later used as a Roman Catholic Church, and is now in use as offices. It is grade II*listed.
*The Burton Memorial at the junction of High Street and Market Square, is one of the town&#x27;s most noted landmarks. It was built in 1908 in memory of Edmond Charles Burton (1826-1907) who was a prominent figure in local affairs, and served as a clerk to the Borough Council. It is grade II listed.
==Local economy==
Cummins have their largest UK plant at the town where they manufacture some of their largest diesel engines that are suitable for marine, railcar and generator set uses.

The proximity of motorways and mainline railways has led to the development of an increasingly large logistics facility, north of Daventry. This warehousing and distribution centre is known as the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT). It is situated between Rugby and Crick and the A5 and junction 18 of the M1 motorway (its original northern terminus in 1959 until 1964). Stagecoach Midlands provides regular bus services D1 and D2 from Daventry and Rugby. The terminal is served by a direct connection to the Northampton Loop of the West Coast Main Line railway.

Due to the proximity to the M1, Ford opened a large national spare parts distribution warehouse on the Royal Oak Industrial Estate in 1972. The building took Taylor Woodrow a year to build at a cost of £2.25M and was for many years considered the largest building in the United Kingdom.

A new national distribution centre was opened in 2004, run by DHL, for J D Wetherspoon on the Drayton Fields Industrial Estate, north west of the town.

In 2011 a landmark building was opened in Eastern Way – the &quot;iCon&quot;. It provides conferencing and 55 supported units for businesses involved in low carbon construction and environmental technologies. It also includes a café, exhibition space and an auditorium for 300 people. Funding for the project came from the European Regional Development Fund, the East Midlands Development Agency and the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation. Daventry District Council and Northamptonshire County Council have donated the land for the project. It is now operated by the University of Northampton.

==Transport==
===Road===
Daventry is near the M1 motorway with access to two junctions: 18 to the northeast and 16 to the southeast of the town.

The A45 runs around Daventry; eastbound it connects it with the A5 and the M1 at junction 16, and then Northampton. To the north-west it connects to Rugby, Coventry, and Birmingham.

The A425 connects Daventry with Southam, Leamington Spa and Warwick to the west.

The A361 connects Daventry to the A5 at Kilsby to the north, which then gives access to junction 18 of the M1. To the south-west the A361 connects Daventry with junction 11 of the M40 and then Banbury.

These roads all converge on the town&#x27;s outer ringroad.

====Bus====
Local and regional bus services are provided by Stagecoach Midlands from their bases in Northampton, Rugby and until December 2016, Leamington Spa. Stagecoach in Oxfordshire provides an hourly service to Banbury. Villages without a regular connection to Daventry had a bookable County Connect bus service run by Centrebus under a County Council contract until 1 September 2014, when the operator changed to Kier Fleet Passenger Services. All subsidies for bus services in Northamptonshire have been discontinued due to financial mismanagement at Northamptonshire County Council, meaning most of these bus services will end.

===Railways===
The nearest railway station to Daventry today is Long Buckby railway station about northeast, where West Midlands Trains provide services via the Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line, northbound to and stations to Birmingham New Street, and southbound to Northampton and stations to London Euston.

Daventry once had its own railway station on the former London and North Western Railway branch-line from Weedon to Leamington Spa, which opened in 1888 and was closed on 15 September 1958 and is now demolished. Daventry is now one of the largest towns in England without its own railway station.

In addition to this the former Braunston and Willoughby railway station on the Great Central Main Line which ran to the west of Daventry, was originally called &quot;Willoughby for Daventry&quot; when it opened in 1899, despite the station being around five miles north-west of Daventry in neighbouring Warwickshire. It was later renamed &quot;Braunston and Willoughby for Daventry&quot; in 1904, before the reference to Daventry was finally dropped in 1938. The station itself closed in 1957, and the line in 1966.

===Air===
The nearest major international airports are Birmingham Airport and East Midlands Airport.

==Education==
Sixth form provision in the town has been confounded by successive Government policies. From September 1989, the County Council decided to close the newest of the three comprehensive schools (The Grange) and strip the Parker E-ACT Academy and Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village (DSLV) of their sixth forms. The Grange site was converted to become Daventry Tertiary College, providing education and training for 16- to 18-year-olds. When Government moved control of Further Education colleges and their assets in 2001 from county councils to the Learning and Skills Council, the Tertiary College was included. To provide greater financial and professional support, it became part of Northampton College in August 2004. Due to the strong and popular attractions of the sixth forms of nearby Rugby schools, the Daventry Learning Partnership was set up by the two secondary schools and the college (and later included Moulton College) to jointly provide a more competitive offering. After the county councils had failed in efforts to reduce the attraction of the Rugby schools, it was decided in 2010 to reintroduce sixth forms to the two Daventry secondary schools, both of which have now transformed into academies.

Today, Daventry has two secondary schools: The Parker E-ACT Academy to the north of the town and Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village to the east, near the BBC transmitter, both with thriving sixth-forms and the Daventry campus of Northampton College. In September 2013 Daventry University Technical College opened. It was part of the university technical college programme, and offered 14–19-year-old students technical as well as academic courses of education. After failing to attract enough pupils the college closed at the end of the 2016–17 school year, lasting only four years.

Primary education facilities include St James&#x27; Junior School, Falconer&#x27;s Hill Academy, Abbey Church of England Academy, Ashby Fields Primary School – which is a values-based school, The Grange School and the primary part of the Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village. Monksmoor Park CE Primary School opened in September 2018. Many children from Daventry are enrolled with the surrounding village schools, such as Byfield, Badby, Newnham, Woodford Halse, Barby and Welton.

The town&#x27;s Stefen Hill Sports Ground is home to Daventry Amateur Athletic Club and Daventry Rugby Club.

The town has two main public parks, Daventry Country Park, which features a large children&#x27;s play area, fitness equipment, a range of marked walks, nature trail, and cafe, and Daventry reservoir. The smaller Daneholme park is quite close by and is bounded by the old railway cuttings, Daneholme Avenue, Ashby Road and Welton Road.

There is a leisure centre in the town centre which is well attended. It features swimming pool area, gym and a number of multi-sport areas. A children&#x27;s soft play area and cafe provide non-sports-based facilities.

Golfers can enjoy the course at Daventry and District Golf Club, which is effectively on the side of Borough Hill, or head slightly out of town to Staverton Park Golf Club.

2013 saw the opening of a purpose-built skate park on New Street Recreation Ground, this was constructed in consultation with local youth groups and features challenges for boarders of all abilities.

<text>The great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor) is a large and predatory songbird species in the shrike family (Laniidae). It forms a superspecies with its parapatric southern relatives, the Iberian grey shrike (&quot;L. meridionalis&quot;), the Chinese grey shrike (&quot;L. sphenocerus&quot;) and the American loggerhead shrike (&quot;L. ludovicianus&quot;). Males and females are similar in plumage, pearly grey above with a black eye-mask and white underparts.

Breeding takes place generally north of 50° northern latitude in northern Europe and Asia. Most populations migrate south in winter to temperate regions. The great grey shrike is carnivorous, with rodents making up over half its diet.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The species was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name. His description is – &quot;a shrike with a wedge-shaped white-bordered tail, back grey, wings black with white spot&quot;. At that time, none of the other grey shrikes – including the lesser grey shrike (&quot;L. minor&quot;), for which the description of the tail pattern is incorrect and which some authors already recognized as distinct – were considered separate species by Linnaeus, but that was to change soon.

Linnaeus&#x27; binomial name replaced the cumbersome and confusing descriptive names of the earlier naturalist books he gives as his sources: in his own &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot; he named it (&quot;light-blue waxwing, wings and tail blackish&quot;), while it is called &quot;pica cinerea sive lanius major&quot; (&quot;ash-grey magpie or greater shrike&quot;) by Johann Leonhard Frisch, who in his splendid colour plate confused male and female. But most authors cited by Linnaeus – Eleazar Albin, Ulisse Aldrovandi, John Ray and Francis Willughby – called it &quot;lanius cinereus major&quot; or similar, which is a near-literal equivalent of the common name &quot;great grey shrike&quot;. The type locality of Linnaeus is simply given as &quot;Europa&quot; (&quot;Europe&quot;).

The scientific name of the great grey shrike literally means &quot;sentinel butcher&quot;: &quot;Lanius&quot; is the Latin term for a butcher, while &quot;excubitor&quot; is Latin for a watchman or sentinel. This refers to the birds&#x27; two most conspicuous behaviours – storing food animals by impaling them on thorns, and using exposed tree-tops or poles to watch the surrounding area for possible prey. Use of the former by Conrad Gessner established the quasi-scientific term &quot;lanius&quot; for the shrikes. Linnaeus chose his specific name because the species &quot;observes approaching hawks and announces [the presence] of songbirds&quot; as he put it. This habit was also put to use in falconry, as fancifully recorded by William Yarrell later. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call.

===Vernacular names===
Ulisse Aldrovandi, Conrad Gessner, John Ray and Francis Willughby also reported old folk names, mainly from Germanic languages: &quot;Wereangel&quot; or &quot;Wierangel&quot; from the Pennines of England (where the bird was noted as a vagrant) as well as &quot;Warkangel, Werkengel&quot; or &quot;Wurchangel&quot; in various German dialects (e.g. around Frankfurt and Strasbourg) probably mean &quot;choking angel&quot; (cf. Standard German &quot;Würgeengel&quot;). These names are unlikely to significantly pre-date the times of Saint Boniface (c. 700 AD) because of their Christian connotation; the related &quot;Werkenvogel&quot; (&quot;choking bird&quot;) might, however, do so. The English version, having become &quot;wariangle&quot; or &quot;weirangle&quot;, was eventually transferred to the native red-backed shrike (&quot;L. collurio&quot;) and lingered on into modern times in Yorkshire. Along the upper Rhine, between Strasbourg and Heidelberg for example, &quot;Linkenom&quot; is attested; its origin is unclear. Low German &quot;Neghen-doer&quot; and Middle German &quot;Nünmörder&quot; were also used; this has today evolved into &quot;Neuntöter&quot; and specifically means the red-backed shrike, but could in earlier times refer to any native &quot;Lanius&quot;. It literally means &quot;killer of nine [prey animals]&quot; and refers to the food caches.

A falconer&#x27;s name for the great grey shrike was &quot;mattages(s)(e)&quot;, which is related to &quot;mat&#x27;agasse&quot; from the western Alps. These terms may mean &quot;magpie killer&quot;, due to their use for luring carnivorous birds to hunters – but perhaps more likely &quot;killer magpie&quot;, considering that the bird was believed to be a peculiar sort of magpie by Johann Leonhard Frisch and others, and that another vernacular English name was &quot;murdering pie&quot;. &quot;Shrike&quot;, meanwhile, is of Germanic origin also and dates back at least to Middle or Early Modern English . This is related to such words as Norwegian and Swedish (&quot;shriek, skrike&quot;), German (&quot;scream&quot;) or Icelandic (&quot;shrieker&quot;). But it seems to have become the dominant term only in rather recent times, for as late as the 18th century, the species was still widely known as &quot;greater butcher-bird&quot; in English, just like it was known as the (&quot;butcher&quot;) in the French Jura. In Norway a vernacular name for the bird is . A whimsical name – presumably from Scotland or nearby England – was &quot;white wisky John&quot; in reference to its wavy and somewhat unelegant flight, during which its large areas of light plumage are conspicuous.

The &quot;grey shrike&quot; is also sometimes named &quot;gray shrike.&quot;

===Relationships and evolution===
The shrike family (Laniidae) is a member of the Corvoidea, the most ancient of the four large songbird superfamilies. Among its superfamily, the closest relatives of the Laniidae are probably the Corvidae (crows and allies). Little reliable data exists on its evolution; certainly (even though the supposed ancestral shrike &quot;&quot;Lanius&quot; miocaenus&quot; might not belong in the Laniidae, and probably does not belong in the same genus as &quot;L. excubitor&quot;) the genus dates back to Miocene times. A &quot;Lanius&quot; fossil from the Late Miocene Turolian age, c. 6 million years ago, has been found at Polgárdi, Hungary. Its relationship to the modern species is unclear. However, all things considered, the grey shrike lineage probably represents the Holarctic sister to the African radiation of fiscal shrikes. These two seem to have originated in a west- or southwestward expansion from the genus&#x27; origin, which (considering the biogeography of living &quot;Lanius&quot; lineages) was probably somewhere between Asia Minor and central Asia. At the time of the Polgárdi fossil, it is rather likely that the grey shrikes were a distinct lineage already; given that they and the fiscals generally follow Bergmann&#x27;s Rule, the smallish fossil makes an unlikely ancestor to the large grey shrikes even when taking into account the somewhat warmer Miocene climate.

The grey shrike superspecies consists of &quot;L. excubitor&quot; and its parapatric southern relatives. As mentioned above, the other members of this group are the Iberian grey shrike (&quot;L. meridionalis&quot;), the steppe grey shrike (&quot;L. pallidirostris&quot;), the Chinese grey shrike (&quot;L. sphenocerus&quot;) and the loggerhead shrike (&quot;L. ludovicianus&quot;). The centre of this group&#x27;s radiation is probably in the eastern Mediterranean region, and the southern grey shrike represents the basalmost form. The other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions. This must have happened fairly recently, because lineage sorting is not complete in the grey shrikes, and most of the present-day habitat of &quot;L. excubitor&quot; was uninhabitable during much of the Quaternary glaciation. Because of the phylogenetic uncertainties surrounding this close-knit group in the absence of a good fossil record, some refrain from splitting them up into distinct species; most modern authors do so however.

===Subspecies===

There are a number of subspecies:

* &quot;Lanius excubitor excubitor&quot; (including &quot;melanopterus&quot; – which may intergrade with &quot;sibiricus&quot; – and &quot;galliae&quot;) – breeds in temperate to subarctic continental Europe and northwest Siberia
:Medium grey above, pale grey hue below; some white on primaries and sometimes secondaries
* &quot;Lanius excubitor homeyeri&quot; – breeds in southeast Europe and southwest Siberia
:Lighter grey than &quot;excubitor&quot; above, dull white below; more white on primaries and secondaries
* &quot;Lanius excubitor koenigi&quot; – endemic to the Canary Islands
* &quot;Lanius excubitor algeriensis&quot; – coastal northwestern Africa
* &quot;Lanius excubitor elegans&quot; – Eastern Morocco, northeastern Mauritania and northwestern Mali to northeastern Sudan, Egypt and southwestern Israel
* &quot;Lanius excubitor leucopygos&quot; – central and southern Mauritania to southern Chad and central Sudan
* &quot;Lanius excubitor aucheri&quot; – east-central Sudan to northwestern Somalia northwest to Iraq and Iran
* &quot;Lanius excubitor theresae&quot; – southern Lebanon and northern Israel
* &quot;Lanius excubitor buryi&quot; – endemic to Yemen
* &quot;Lanius excubitor uncinatus&quot; – endemic to Socotra
* &quot;Lanius excubitor lahtora&quot; – Pakistan through central India and southern Nepal to western Bangladesh
* &quot;Lanius excubitor pallidirostris&quot; (Steppe grey shrike) – Central Asia and parts of northern China, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan

==Description==
An adult great grey shrike is a medium-sized passerine about as large as a big thrush, measuring from long. It typically weighs around , although some subspecies are noticeably smaller or larger, and even in the nominate subspecies adult weights between are recorded. The wings are around and the tail around long in the nominate subspecies, its bill measures about from tip to skull, and the tarsometatarsus part of its &quot;legs&quot; (actually feet) is around long. Wingspan can range from .
The general colour of the upperparts is pearl grey, tinged brownish towards the east of its Eurasian range. The cheeks and chin as well as a thin and often hard-to-see stripe above the eye are white, and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts; the area immediately above the beak is grey. The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, and pointed at the tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner than the rest of the light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the under mandible (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.

Males and females are about the same size, and do not differ conspicuously in appearance except by direct comparison. In the female the underparts are greyer and are usually visibly barred greyish-brown, and the white wing and tail markings are characteristically less in extent (though this is rarely clearly visible except in flight). Fledged young birds are heavily tinged greyish-brown all over, with barring on the upperside and indistinct buffy-white markings. The tips of the tertiary remiges and the wing coverts are also buffy, with a black band in the latter. In the North American subspecies &quot;borealis&quot;, the fledglings are tinged quite brown indeed on upperside and wings, and have sharp and dark underside bars. In Eurasia, fledglings moult into a female-like plumage with the tertiary bars usually remaining in autumn. Across its range, the young acquire the adult plumage in their first spring.

===Vocalizations===
The male&#x27;s song consists of short pleasant warbling strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles. The individual phrases may go like or ... To announce that it has become aware of someone straying into its territory – be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal – it gives long shrill raspy whistles like or . To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like . These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as , , or . These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship. The song becomes softer and more warbling as the male shows the female around his territory, and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing fluting , trills and calls.

When disturbed, its alarm note is a harsh jay-like , or , often repeated twice. The more excited the birds become, the higher and faster the calls get, via to a rattle or an explosive . A bird of prey alert is given with a whistle . calls are given by adults confronted with a potential threat to their young. To beg for food – young to adults or mates to each other – rows of calls are given. This species sometimes tries to attract small songbirds by mimicking their calls, so it may attempt to catch them for food.

===Similar species===
The Iberian grey shrike (&quot;L. meridionalis&quot;) was formerly included in the great grey shrike as subspecies. It occurs in south western Europe (Iberian Peninsula and France). It prefers different habitat – lightly wooded grassland in the great, more arid shrubland in the southern grey shrike – and where the species&#x27; ranges overlap, they do not hybridize at present (though they may have done so in past millennia).
Elsewhere, the parapatric relatives of the &quot;L. excubitor&quot; are the Chinese grey shrike (&quot;L. sphenocerus&quot;) from East Asia and the northern shrike (&quot;L. borealis&quot;) and loggerhead shrike (&quot;L. ludovicianus&quot;) from North America. The northern grey shrike is sympatric in winter quarters with each of its three close relatives at the north of their range. Their overall colouration is – apparently plesiomorphically – shared in sub-Saharan Africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey-backed fiscal (&quot;L. excubitoroides&quot;) which is found from the Sahel eastwards, and Mackinnon&#x27;s fiscal (&quot;L. mackinnoni&quot;) of the Congo Basin region. The lesser grey shrike (&quot;L. minor&quot;, Balkans to Central Asia) seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike superspecies between Eastern Europe and Central Asia; it may be more closely related to the small brown shrikes and resemble the bold, aggressive and hard-to-catch grey shrikes because of Batesian mimicry.
The Iberian grey shrike is clearer and usually darker grey above, and not tinged grey but often decidedly pinkish on the belly and particular breast; the white &quot;eyebrow&quot; extends to over the beak, which has typically a larger pale base. The barring pattern is less developed at all ages, hardly ever present even in females, and slighter in the otherwise very similar fledglings.

East Asian &quot;L. excubitor&quot; are barely sympatric with the Chinese grey shrike. The latter is larger and generally differs from the northern species as the southern does, and in addition has much larger white areas in wings and tail.

The loggerhead shrike is hard to distinguish, but the proportion of the head to the beak (which seems stubby in &quot;L. ludovicianus&quot; by comparison and is all-dark) is usually reliable. Indeed, the word &quot;loggerhead&quot; refers to the relatively larger head of the southern species.

The lesser grey shrike is a smaller and comparatively short-tailed bird. It can best be recognized by the rather large black area above the bill, almost reaching to the forehead and without a white stripe above it. In flight, the wide instead of pointed black tail end of &quot;L. minor&quot; is characteristic. The African species are completely allopatric with &quot;L. excubitor&quot;; they lack white scapulars (grey-backed fiscal) or wingspots (Mackinnon&#x27;s fiscal) and differ in some other details, particularly the tail pattern.

Generally, its breeding range is found in Eurasia and northern Africa. In the high mountains of the Altai-Tian Shan region, it ranges south perhaps as far as 42° northern latitude. Its northern limit is generally 70° northern latitude. It is only found as a vagrant in Iceland, the British Isles, the Mediterranean region (excluding the Iberian Peninsula and perhaps Romania but including Cyprus), and Korea. There do not appear to be breeding records from the entire Kamchatka Peninsula; in Switzerland, the present day Netherlands and southern Germany small populations were found in the mid-20th century but have declined or even disappeared since then.

Except for the subspecies &quot;bianchii&quot; which is largely all-year resident, and subspecies &quot;excubitor&quot; in the temperate European parts of its range with their mild maritime climate, the species is a short-distance migrant. The migrations are triggered by scarcity of food and therefore, according to prey population levels, the winter range might little extend south beyond the breeding range, or be entirely parapatric to it. The populations of the Central Asian mountains mostly migrate downslope rather than southwards. Females are more prone to migration than males; they do not appear to migrate, on average, longer or shorter distances than males, and consequently are the dominant sex in many parts of the winter range. Birds leave for winter quarters a more or less short time after breeding – July to October, with most birds staying to September – and return to nest mainly in March/April, but some only arrive in May. In recent decades, the number of birds remaining on the breeding grounds all year has been noted to increase e.g. in Fennoscandia, whereas for example &quot;borealis&quot; seems to be as rare a winter visitor in northern Ohio as it was a century ago.

The preferred habitat is generally open grassland, perhaps with shrubs interspersed, and adjacent lookout points. These are normally trees – at forest edges in much of the habitat, but single trees or small stands at the taiga-tundra border. In steppe, it will utilize any isolated perch, be it fence posts, power lines or rocks. In general, some 5–15 perching sites per hectare habitat seem to be required. It avoids low grassland with no lookouts and nesting opportunities (trees or large shrubs), as well as dense forest with no hunting ground. Apart from grassland, the birds will utilize a variety of hunting habitats, including bogs, clearings or non-industrially farmed fields. Breeding birds appear to have different microhabitat desires, but little detail is known yet.

==Behaviour==

This species is territorial, but likes to breed in dispersed groups of a good half-dozen adults. It is not known to what extent the birds in such groups are related. In the temperate parts of its range, groups are perhaps apart, while individual territories within each group may be as small as but more typically are about twice that size. In less hospitable climes, territories may be more than . Throughout the breeding season, in prime habitat, territories are held by mated pairs and single males looking for a partner. In less productive habitat, &quot;floaters&quot; hold territories more ephemerally. This leads to shifts in population density between regions, as &quot;floaters&quot; move between groups of territorial birds in search of a bountiful unclaimed territory to settle down and/or a partner to mate with. On the wintering grounds, pairs separate to account for the lower amount of food available at that time, but if both members migrate they tend to have their wintering grounds not far apart. As it seems, once an individual great grey shrike has found a wintering territory it likes, it will return there subsequently and perhaps even try to defend it against competitors just like a summer territory. Throughout the year, the birds regularly but briefly move through a range up to three times larger than their territory; this is tolerated by territory owners in winter more easily than in summer, and the parts of Europe where all-year residents and winter visitors co-occur typically have population densities around eight birds/km2 (about thirty per square mile) and occasionally more in winter.

Before and after the nesting season, groups of breeding birds will sometimes initiate gatherings; these seem to occur at the boundary of the group&#x27;s combined range or in the unclaimed land separating it from neighbouring groups. The initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory: it spirals tens of meters/yards high into the air, usually briefly does a fluttering hover at the top of the spiral, and then glides down. Group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight, and eventually about half the group&#x27;s members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes – sometimes more than an hour – chattering, calling, duetting, and excitedly moving about the meeting site (which typically is some small tree or shrubbery). In winter, birds will often assemble in small groups and roost together, particularly to keep warm during the night; this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however.

The flight of the great grey shrike is undulating and rather heavy, but its dash is straight and determined. It is, as noted above, also capable of hovering flights, which last briefly but may be repeated time after time because of the birds&#x27; considerable stamina. It will usually stay low above the ground in flight, approaching perches from below and landing in an upward swoop. In social interactions, birds signal an aggressive stance by a bold upright posture, fanning and then flicking the tail and eventually the wings also as the bird gets more excited. It signals its readiness to strike at an intruder by shifting to a horizontal pose and fluffing its feathers, raising them into a small crest along the top of the head. Birds appease conspecifics by head-turns away from them (if close by), or by imitating the crouching fluttering pose and calls given by fledglings begging for food (if sitting father apart). The submission gesture to prevent an imminent attack by a conspecific is pointing the beak straight up.

Fledgelings moult part of their juvenile plumage before their first winter, and the rest in spring. Adults moult on their breeding grounds before going on migration, or before the depth of winter if they are resident. Sometimes adults also seem to moult some feathers before attempting to breed. As moult requires a considerable investment of energy, some significant evolutionary benefits to offset this are likely. Reducing feather wear and parasite load, moulting can make a bird more physically attractive and healthy, and may thus increase its chance of successful reproduction. The phenomenon is not well understood, however.

===Food and feeding===

The great grey shrike eats small vertebrates and large invertebrates. To hunt, this bird perches on the topmost branch of a tree, utility pole or similar elevated spot in a characteristic upright stance some metres/yards (at least one and up to ) above ground. Alternatively, it may scan the grassland below from flight, essentially staying in one place during prolonged bouts of mainly hovering flight that may last up to 20 minutes. It will drop down in a light glide for terrestrial prey or swoop hawk-like on a flying insect. Small birds are sometimes caught in flight too, usually by approaching them from below and behind and seizing their feet with the beak. If no prey ventures out in the open, great grey shrikes will rummage through the undergrowth or sit near hiding places and flash their white wing and tail markings to scare small animals into coming out. As noted above, it will sometimes mimic songbirds to entice them to come within striking distance.
Typically, at least half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and sometimes young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, other passerines, lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, newts and salamanders, and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot;) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles (e.g. ground beetles, dung beetles, rove beetles, and darkling beetles), crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions, crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.

Prey is killed by hitting it with the hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in one or a few chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by carrying it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.

The basic metabolic rate of the great grey shrike is around 800 milliwatts, or somewhat more than 11 milliwatts per gram of body mass. An adult of this species needs about of prey a day, probably somewhat more in winter. Under most circumstances, this would thus translate to one or two rodents, one or two additional vertebrate prey animals (including rodents), and up to a single vertebrate prey item&#x27;s worth of invertebrates. Surplus food may be impaled for storage. These &quot;larders&quot; are typically around above ground and can be found anywhere within the birds&#x27; territory, but tend to be rather in the general vicinity of nest sites than far away from them.

===Breeding and life history===
Great grey shrikes breed during the summer, typically once per year. In exceptionally good conditions, they raise two broods a year, and if the first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one. Their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter; birds often choose a different mate than the year before. To seek out potential mates, males will venture outside their breeding territories. If a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking, she will visit to see whether they get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer. The courtship period is generally longer than in the Iberian grey shrike (&quot;L. meridionalis&quot;), usually starting about March and lasting to April/May. At first, the female rebuffs the male, only allowing him to feed her. Males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and turning away from the female. He also occasionally turns to sit at a right angle to her. Eventually, the female will join in the male&#x27;s displays, and the songs will become duets. To feed females and to show off their hunting prowess, males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time. When presenting nesting sites, males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail.
Copulation is typically initiated by the male bringing an attractive prey item to the female. With both giving begging calls, they approach until they are side by side. The male then raises and swings his body left and right a few times, and passes the prey to the female, followed by the actual copulation. The gatherings of neighbour groups (see above) cease when nesting is underway, and when the eggs are nearly ready to lay, the male guards his partner closely, perching higher than her to watch for threats and frequently feeding her. This apparently ensures her physical well-being rather than preventing extra-pair copulations, as neighbouring males will stray through each other&#x27;s territory to snatch a quick fling with the resident females. In this, they have almost a one-in-three chance of success, and consequently the average grey shrike nest is very likely to contain offspring of more than one male. Females may deposit their eggs in neighbours&#x27; nests, but this seems to occur more rarely; in general, mated females are fairly reclusive after their eggs have started developing. A full clutch of eggs can be produced by a female in about 10–15 days.

Nests are built in April or May more than above ground in trees. This height varies according to habitat, but while nests have been found almost up, most are 2–16 m above ground. Presence of mistletoes or vines like common ivy (&quot;Hedera helix&quot;) on side branches near the trunk (where nests are preferentially built) will make a tree markedly more attractive. Fieldfares (&quot;Turdus pilaris&quot;) nesting in the vicinity will also increase the desirability of nest sites to great grey shrikes, which moreover often refuse to prey upon these thrushes&#x27; nestlings though the opportunity is there. Apparently, the two species are more efficient in spotting potential nest predators – in particular corvids – early on and mobbing them off cooperatively than either is on its own. Otherwise, there is no clear preference for particular taxa of nesting trees, provided they are sufficiently dense. Conifers seem to have become more popular with European &quot;L. excubitor&quot; in recent decades, but a diversity of deciduous trees is used just as well. Far more rarely, large and especially thorny shrubs are used for nesting. The actual nesting site is chosen by the male; the courtship visits of the female are mainly to form and strengthen the pair bond. Also, though the partners build the nest together, the male collects most of the nesting material. The cup nest is quite sizable, measuring in outer diameter. Its body is constructed of coarse vegetable material – mainly large twigs and chunks of moss, though bits of fabric and rubbish may be added. The interior cup is in diameter and deep; it is lined with fine twigs and roots, lichen, hair and feathers. Building a nest from scratch takes a pair one to two weeks, but if nests of the previous year in good locations remain usable, they are repaired rather than discarded.

Laying usually takes place in May. The clutch numbers three to nine eggs, typically around seven, with North American clutches tending to be larger on average than European ones. If a second clutch is produced in one breeding season, it is smaller than the first one. The eggs have a white background colour, usually with a grey hue and sometimes with a blue one; they are patterned with blotches of yellowish- to reddish-brown and purplish-grey, often denser around the blunt end. They measure around in length and in width. Incubation takes around 16 days but may be closer to three weeks for large clutches; it is generally done only by the female. While the male may briefly take over incubating, his task during this time is to provide food. The altricial nestlings hatch naked, blind and pink-skinned, weighing c. ; their skin turns darker after a few days. The inside of their beak is pink and they probably lack spots or other prominent marks; the wattles at the corners of the mouth are yellow as in many passerines. As the nestlings grow, the female broods them, and later on assists in providing food. The young fledge after 2–3 weeks, typically in late June or early July; they become independent of their parents about 3–6 weeks later. Sometimes, a parent will single out particular fledglings (possibly the weakest ones) and focus their care and feeding on these during this time. Other adults have occasionally been recorded assisting in feeding a pair&#x27;s offspring; it is not clear whether these helpers at the nest are offspring of previous years, or unrelated non-breeding &quot;floaters&quot; or breeding neighbours.

Common cuckoos (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;) have been noted as regular brood parasites of &quot;L. e. excubitor&quot; in the past; for reasons unknown this has ceased since the late 1970s or so. It may well be that the cuckoo&#x27;s gens laying eggs similar to those of the great grey shrike has become extinct. Among predators of eggs and nestlings, corvids (Corvidae) – extremely close relatives of the shrikes (Laniidae) as it happens – are most significant.

Usually more than half of all nests manage to hatch at least one young, and around three-quarters of all eggs laid hatch, suggesting that if eggs are lost before hatching, it usually is the entire clutch. Half to three-quarters of the hatched young successfully fledge under most circumstances. They will become sexually mature in their first spring and often attempt to breed right away. On average, great grey shrikes get a chance at four breeding attempts during their life, with most birds in the wild getting eaten by a bird of prey or carnivorous mammal or dying of other causes before the end of their fifth winter. Raptorial birds are the main threat to shrikes after fledging, with regular predators including species as small as little owls (which are close to the same size as the shrike). The maximum documented lifespan, however, is 12 years.

===Conservation status===
As remarked above, the great grey shrike has apparently become extinct as a breeding bird in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Overall, its stocks seem to be declining in the European part of its range since the 1970s. The increase and decline seem to be reactions to changing land use, with an increase as the number of agricultural workers declined after World War II and land fell fallow, declining again when land consolidation (see e.g. &quot;Flurbereinigung&quot;) had seriously depleted the number of hedgerows and similar elevated growth formerly common amidst the agricultural landscape. For such a predatory bird, the indiscriminate use of pesticides (which will accumulate in adult carnivores and inhibit breeding success) around the 1960s probably had a detrimental influence on stocks too.

Altogether, the great grey shrike is common and widespread and not considered a threatened species by the IUCN (though they still include &quot;L. meridionalis&quot; in &quot;L. excubitor&quot;). Wherever it occurs, its numbers are usually many hundreds or even thousands per country. Its stronghold is the region around Sweden, where at least almost 20,000, perhaps as many as 50,000 were believed to live in the late 20th century. However, in some countries it is not robustly established; in Estonia only a few hundred are found, with less than 200 in Belgium and some more or less than 100 in Latvia and Lithuania, respectively. The 10 birds or so in Denmark might disappear because of a few years of adverse circumstances. By contrast, in Luxembourg plentiful high-quality habitat is found; though the number of great grey shrikes in this tiny country is necessarily limited, the average population density there is 25 times as high as in Lithuania.

<text>The Brazilian Intelligence Agency (, ABIN) is the main intelligence agency in Brazil. ABIN&#x27;s mission is to ensure that the Federal Executive has access to knowledge related to the security of the State and society, such as those involving foreign defense, foreign relations, internal security, socioeconomic development and scientific-technological development.

==History==
A successor organization to the Serviço Nacional de Informações (SNI), it formed during the government of Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco in the mid-1960s.

In an attempt to bring military intelligence agencies under the control of the civilian-led government as part of the process of democratization that began in Brazil in 1985, President Fernando Collor de Mello replaced the SNI with the short-lived (1990–1994) Secretaria de Assuntos Estratégicos (SAE) or Strategic Affairs Secretariat. However, despite the dismissal of 144 SNI officers, the agency continued to be dominated by the military and effective oversight and control of the country&#x27;s intelligence activities eluded the civilian government.

In 1995 President Fernando Henrique Cardoso placed a civilian at the head of the SAE and subsequently created ABIN. Like many other Latin American nations, Brazil faces the challenge of having to overcome a long history of involvement by the military and their related intelligence arms in domestic politics. Early on, ABIN was tainted by a wiretapping and influence peddling scandal that led to the agency being placed under the direct control of the President and the Institutional Security Cabinet rather than being responsible to the national Congress. This had once again undermined the attempt to reduce the influence of the military on Brazilian intelligence agencies and their practises.

However, successive governments have taken a number of steps to reduce the influence of the armed forces and related intelligence agencies in domestic politics. The relationships between these groups and government in Brazil, so closely intertwined for decades, is evolving. The focus of intelligence agencies appears to be moving slowly from managing internal dissent to focusing on external threats and support of the nation&#x27;s democracy.

On 1 September 2008, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva suspended the leadership of the organization, including its director Paulo Lacerda, and ordered an investigation into allegations that appeared in &quot;Veja&quot; magazine of phone tapping of senior figures including the heads of both the Senate and the Supreme Court.

In 2024, an investigation was launched after it emerged that the agency had carried out surveillance on prominent critics of former president Jair Bolsonaro when he was still in office, including three justices of the Supreme Federal Court and a speaker of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil). Among those alleged to have been involved were Bolsonaro&#x27;s son Carlos, the then-head of ABIN Alexandre Ramagem, and his deputy Alessandro Moretti, who was dismissed along with four agency department heads by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

==Functions==
ABIN&#x27;s main function is to investigate real and potential threats to the Brazilian society and government and defend the democratic rule of law, the Brazilian sovereignty and the effectiveness of the public power.

==Motto==
The agency&#x27;s motto is &quot;Intelligence for the defense of society, of the democratic rule of Law and of national interests&quot; ().

<text>A ball bearing is a type of rolling-element bearing that uses balls to maintain the separation between the bearing races.

The purpose of a ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. It achieves this by using at least two races to contain the balls and transmit the loads through the balls. In most applications, one race is stationary and the other is attached to the rotating assembly (e.g., a hub or shaft). As one of the bearing races rotates it causes the balls to rotate as well. Because the balls are rolling, they have a much lower coefficient of friction than if two flat surfaces were sliding against each other.

Ball bearings tend to have lower load capacity for their size than other kinds of rolling-element bearings due to the smaller contact area between the balls and races. However, they can tolerate some misalignment of the inner and outer races.

Common ball bearing designs include &quot;angular contact, axial, deep-groove,&quot; and &quot;preloaded pairs.&quot; The balls in ball bearings can also be configured in various ways. Ball bearings are used in a wide range of applications, some of which include skateboards and centrifugal pumps.

==History==
Although bearings had been developed since ancient times, the first modern recorded patent on ball bearings was awarded to Philip Vaughan, a Welsh inventor and ironmaster who created the first design for a ball bearing in Carmarthen in 1794. His was the first modern ball-bearing design, with the ball running along a groove in the axle assembly.

Jules Suriray, a Parisian bicycle mechanic, designed the first radial style ball bearing in 1869, which was then fitted to the winning bicycle ridden by James Moore in the world&#x27;s first bicycle road race, Paris-Rouen, in November 1869.

== Common designs ==

There are several common designs of ball bearing, each offering various performance trade-offs. They can be made from many different materials, including stainless steel, chrome steel, and ceramic (silicon nitride, Si3N4). A hybrid ball bearing is a bearing with ceramic balls and metal races.

; Angular contact: An &quot;angular contact&quot; ball bearing uses axially asymmetric races. An axial load passes in a straight line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that acts to separate the races axially. So, the angle of contact on the inner race is the same as that on the outer race. Angular contact bearings better support combined loads (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high-speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain. Most bicycles use angular-contact bearings in the headsets because the forces on these bearings are in both the radial and axial direction.
; Axial: An &quot;axial&quot; or &quot;thrust&quot; ball bearing uses side-by-side races. An axial load is transmitted directly through the bearing, while a radial load is poorly supported and tends to separate the races, so that a larger radial load is likely to damage the bearing.
; Deep-groove: In a &quot;deep-groove&quot; radial bearing, the race dimensions are close to the dimensions of the balls that run in it. Deep-groove bearings support higher loads than a shallower groove. Like angular contact bearings, deep-groove bearings support both radial and axial loads, but without a choice of contact angle to allow choice of relative proportion of these load capacities.
; Preloaded pairs: The above basic types of bearings are typically applied in a method of &quot;preloaded pairs&quot;, where two individual bearings are rigidly fastened along a rotating shaft to face each other. This improves the axial runout by taking up (&quot;preloading&quot;) the necessary slight clearance between the bearing balls and races. Pairing also provides an advantage of evenly distributing the loads, nearly doubling the total load capacity compared to a single bearing. Angular contact bearings are almost always used in opposing pairs: the asymmetric design of each bearing supports axial loads in only one direction, so an opposed pair is required if the application demands support in both directions. The preloading force must be designed and assembled carefully, because it deducts from the axial force capacity of the bearings and can damage bearings if applied excessively. The pairing mechanism may simply face the bearings together directly, or separate them with a shim, bushing, or shaft feature.

== Construction types ==

; Conrad: The &quot;Conrad&quot;-style ball bearing is named after its inventor, Robert Conrad, who was awarded British patent 12,206 in 1903 and U.S. patent 822,723 in 1906. These bearings are assembled by placing the inner ring into an eccentric position relative to the outer ring, with the two rings in contact at one point, resulting in a large gap opposite the point of contact. The balls are inserted through the gap and then evenly distributed around the bearing assembly, causing the rings to become concentric. Assembly is completed by fitting a cage to the balls to maintain their positions relative to each other. Without the cage, the balls would eventually drift out of position during operation, causing the bearing to fail. The cage carries no load and serves only to maintain ball position. Conrad bearings have the advantage that they are able to withstand both radial and axial loads but have the disadvantage of lower load capacity due to the limited number of balls that can be loaded into the bearing assembly. Probably the most familiar industrial ball bearing is the deep-groove Conrad style. The bearing is used in most of the mechanical industries.
; Slot-fill: In a &quot;slot-fill&quot; radial bearing, the inner and outer races are notched on one face so that when the notches are aligned, balls can be slipped in the resulting slot to assemble the bearing. A slot-fill bearing has the advantage that more balls can be assembled (even allowing a &quot;full complement&quot; design), resulting in a higher radial load capacity than a Conrad bearing of the same dimensions and material type. However, a slot-fill bearing cannot carry a significant axial load, and the slots cause a discontinuity in the races that can have a small but adverse effect on strength. 
; Relieved race: Relieved race ball bearings are &#x27;relieved&#x27; as the name suggests by having either the OD of the inner ring reduced on one side, or the ID of the outer ring increased on one side. This allows a greater number of balls to be assembled into either the inner or outer race, and then press fit over the relief. Sometimes the outer ring will be heated to facilitate assembly. Like the slot-fill construction, relieved race construction allows a greater number of balls than Conrad construction, up to and including full complement, and the extra ball count gives extra load capacity. However, a relieved race bearing can only support significant axial loads in one direction (&#x27;away from&#x27; the relieved race).
; Fractured race: Another way of fitting more balls into a radial ball bearing is by radially &#x27;fracturing&#x27; (slicing) one of the rings all the way through, loading the balls in, re-assembling the fractured portion, and then using a pair of steel bands to hold the fractured ring sections together in alignment. Again, this allows more balls, including full ball complement, however unlike with either slot fill or relieved race constructions, it can support significant axial loading in either direction.
; Rows: There are two &quot;row&quot; designs: &quot;single-row&quot; bearings and &quot;double-row&quot; bearings. Most ball bearings are a single-row design, which means there is one row of bearing balls. This design works with radial and thrust loads. A &quot;double-row&quot; design has two rows of bearing balls. Advantages of double-row bearings as compared to single-row include that they can bear radial and axial loads in both directions. Double-row angular contact ball bearings have a steep mounting, which also can bear tilting effects. Other advantages of double-row bearings are their rigidity and compactness. Their disadvantage is they need better alignment than single-row bearings.
; Flanged: Bearings with a flange on the outer ring simplify axial location. The housing for such bearings can consist of a through-hole of uniform diameter, but the entry face of the housing (which may be either the outer or inner face) must be machined truly normal to the hole axis. However, such flanges are very expensive to manufacture. A more cost-effective arrangement of the bearing outer ring, with similar benefits, is a snap ring groove at either or both ends of the outside diameter. The snap ring assumes the function of a flange.
; Caged: Cages are typically used to secure the balls in a Conrad-style ball bearing. In other construction types they may decrease the number of balls depending on the specific cage shape, and thus reduce the load capacity. Without cages the tangential position is stabilized by sliding of two convex surfaces on each other. With a cage the tangential position is stabilized by a sliding of a convex surface in a matched concave surface, which avoids dents in the balls and has lower friction. Caged roller bearings were invented by John Harrison in the mid-18th century as part of his work on chronographs.
; Hybrid ball bearings using ceramic balls: Ceramic bearing balls can weigh up to 40% less than steel ones, depending on size and material. This reduces centrifugal loading and skidding, so hybrid ceramic bearings can operate 20% to 40% faster than conventional bearings. This means that the outer race groove exerts less force inward against the ball as the bearing spins. This reduction in force reduces the friction and rolling resistance. The lighter balls allow the bearing to spin faster, and uses less power to maintain its speed. The ceramic balls are typically harder than the race. Due to wear, with time they will form a groove in the race. This is preferable to the balls wearing which would leave them with possible flat spots significantly harming performance. While ceramic hybrid bearings use ceramic balls in place of steel ones, they are constructed with steel inner and outer rings; hence the &quot;hybrid&quot; designation. While the ceramic material itself is stronger than steel, it is also stiffer, which results in increased stresses on the rings, and hence decreased load capacity. Ceramic balls are electrically insulating, which can prevent &#x27;arcing&#x27; failures if current should be passed through the bearing. Ceramic balls can also be effective in environments where lubrication may not be available (such as in space applications). In some settings only a thin coating of ceramic is used over a metal ball bearing.
; Fully ceramic bearings: These bearings make use of both ceramic balls and race. These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all. Due to the stiffness and hardness of the balls and race these bearings are noisy at high speeds. The stiffness of the ceramic makes these bearings brittle and liable to crack under load or impact. Because both ball and race are of similar hardness, wear can lead to chipping at high speeds of both the balls and the race, which can cause sparking.
; Self-aligning : Self-aligning ball bearings, such as the Wingqvist bearing shown in the picture, are constructed with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories. One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (its radius is much larger than the ball radius). This led to the invention of the spherical roller bearing, which has a similar design, but uses rollers instead of balls. The spherical roller thrust bearing is another invention derived from the findings by Wingqvist.

==Operating conditions==

===Lifespan===

The calculated life for a bearing is based on the load it carries and its operating speed. The industry standard usable bearing lifespan is inversely proportional to the bearing load cubed. Nominal maximum load of a bearing, is for a lifespan of 1 million rotations, which at 50 Hz (i.e., 3000 RPM) is a lifespan of 5.5 working hours. 90% of bearings of that type have at least that lifespan, and 50% of bearings have a lifespan at least 5 times as long.

The industry standard life calculation is based upon the work of Lundberg and Palmgren performed in 1947. The formula assumes the life to be limited by metal fatigue and that the life distribution can be described by a Weibull distribution. Many variations of the formula exist that include factors for material properties, lubrication, and loading. Factoring for loading may be viewed as a tacit admission that modern materials demonstrate a different relationship between load and life than Lundberg and Palmgren determined .

===Failure modes===
If a bearing is not rotating, maximum load is determined by force that causes plastic deformation of elements or raceways. The indentations caused by the elements can concentrate stresses and generate cracks at the components. Maximum load for not or very slowly rotating bearings is called &quot;static&quot; maximum load.

Also, if a bearing is not rotating, oscillating forces on the bearing can cause impact damage to the bearing race or the rolling elements, known as brinelling. A second lesser form called false brinelling occurs if the bearing only rotates across a short arc and pushes lubricant out away from the rolling elements.

For a rotating bearing, the dynamic load capacity indicates the load to which the bearing endures 1,000,000 cycles.

If a bearing is rotating, but experiences heavy load that lasts shorter than one revolution, static max load must be used in computations, since the bearing does not rotate during the maximum load.

If a sideways torque is applied to a deep groove radial bearing, an uneven force in the shape of an ellipse is applied on the outer ring by the rolling elements, concentrating in two regions on opposite sides of the outer ring. If the outer ring is not strong enough, or if it is not sufficiently braced by the supporting structure, the outer ring will deform into an oval shape from the sideways torque stress, until the gap is large enough for the rolling elements to escape. The inner ring then pops out and the bearing structurally collapses.

A sideways torque on a radial bearing also applies pressure to the cage that holds the rolling elements at equal distances, due to the rolling elements trying to all slide together at the location of highest sideways torque. If the cage collapses or breaks apart, the rolling elements group together, the inner ring loses support, and may pop out of the center.

===Maximum load===
In general, maximum load on a ball bearing is proportional to outer diameter of the bearing times the width of the bearing (where width is measured in direction of axle).

Bearings have static load ratings. These are based on not exceeding a certain amount of plastic deformation in the raceway. These ratings may be exceeded by a large amount for certain applications.

===Lubrication===
For a bearing to operate properly, it needs to be lubricated. In most cases the lubricant is based on elastohydrodynamic effect (by oil or grease) but working at extreme temperatures dry lubricated bearings are also available.

For a bearing to have its nominal lifespan at its nominal maximum load, it must be lubricated with a lubricant (oil or grease) that has at least the minimum dynamic viscosity (usually denoted with the Greek letter formula_1) recommended for that bearing.

The recommended dynamic viscosity is inversely proportional to diameter of bearing.

The recommended dynamic viscosity decreases with rotating frequency. As a rough indication: for less than , recommended viscosity increases with factor 6 for a factor 10 decrease in speed, and for more than , recommended viscosity decreases with factor 3 for a factor 10 increase in speed.

For a bearing where average of outer diameter of bearing and diameter of axle hole is , and that is rotating at , recommended dynamic viscosity is .

Note that dynamic viscosity of oil varies strongly with temperature: a temperature increase of causes the viscosity to decrease by factor 10.

If the viscosity of lubricant is higher than recommended, lifespan of bearing increases, roughly proportional to square root of viscosity. If the viscosity of the lubricant is lower than recommended, the lifespan of the bearing decreases, and by how much depends on which type of oil being used. For oils with EP (&#x27;extreme pressure&#x27;) additives, the lifespan is proportional to the square root of dynamic viscosity, just as it was for too high viscosity, while for ordinary oils lifespan is proportional to the square of the viscosity if a lower-than-recommended viscosity is used.

Lubrication can be done with a grease, which has advantages that grease is normally held within the bearing releasing the lubricant oil as it is compressed by the balls. It provides a protective barrier for the bearing metal from the environment, but has disadvantages that this grease must be replaced periodically, and maximum load of bearing decreases (because if bearing gets too warm, grease melts and runs out of bearing). Time between grease replacements decreases very strongly with diameter of bearing: for a bearing, grease should be replaced every 5000 working hours, while for a bearing it should be replaced every 500 working hours.

Lubrication can also be done with an oil, which has advantage of higher maximum load, but needs some way to keep oil in bearing, as it normally tends to run out of it. For oil lubrication it is recommended that for applications where oil does not become warmer than , oil should be replaced once a year, while for applications where oil does not become warmer than , oil should be replaced 4 times per year. For car engines, oil becomes but the engine has an oil filter to maintain oil quality; therefore, the oil is usually changed less frequently than the oil in bearings.

If the bearing is used under oscillation, oil lubrication should be preferred. If grease lubrication is necessary, the composition should be adapted to the parameters that occur. Greases with a high bleeding rate and low base oil viscosity should be preferred if possible.

===Direction of load===
Most bearings are meant for supporting loads perpendicular to axle (&quot;radial loads&quot;). Whether they can also bear axial loads, and if so, how much, depends on the type of bearing. Thrust bearings (commonly found on lazy susans) are specifically designed for axial loads.

For single-row deep-groove ball bearings, SKF&#x27;s documentation says that maximum axial load is circa 50% of maximum radial load, but it also says that &quot;light&quot; and/or &quot;small&quot; bearings can take axial loads that are 25% of maximum radial load.

For single-row edge-contact ball bearings, axial load can be about 2 times max radial load,
and for cone-bearings maximum axial load is between 1 and 2 times maximum radial load.

Often Conrad-style ball bearings will exhibit contact ellipse truncation under axial load. That means that either the ID of the outer ring is large enough, or the OD of the inner ring is small enough, so as to reduce the area of contact between the balls and raceway. When this is the case, it can significantly increase the stresses in the bearing, often invalidating rules of thumb regarding relationships between radial and axial load capacity. With construction types other than Conrad, one can further decrease the outer ring ID and increase the inner ring OD to guard against this.

If both axial and radial loads are present, they can be added vectorially, to result in the total load on bearing, which in combination with nominal maximum load can be used to predict lifespan. However, in order to correctly predict the rating life of ball bearings the ISO/TS 16281 should be used with the help of a calculation software.

===Avoiding undesirable axial load===
The part of a bearing that rotates (either axle hole or outer circumference) must be fixed, while for a part that does not rotate this is not necessary (so it can be allowed to slide). If a bearing is loaded axially, both sides must be fixed.

If an axle has two bearings, and temperature varies, axle shrinks or expands, therefore it is not admissible for both bearings to be fixed on both their sides, since expansion of axle would exert axial forces that would destroy these bearings. Therefore, at least one of the bearings must be able to slide.

A &#x27;freely sliding fit&#x27; is one where there is at least a 4 μm clearance, presumably because surface-roughness of a surface made on a lathe is normally between 1.6 and 3.2 μm.

===Fit===
Bearings can withstand their maximum load only if the mating parts are properly sized. Bearing manufacturers supply tolerances for the fit of the shaft and the housing so that this can be achieved. The material and hardness may also be specified.

Fittings that are not allowed to slip are made to diameters that prevent slipping and consequently the mating surfaces cannot be brought into position without force. For small bearings this is best done with a press because tapping with a hammer damages both bearing and shaft, while for large bearings the necessary forces are so great that there is no alternative to heating one part before fitting, so that thermal expansion allows a temporary sliding fit.

===Avoiding torsional loads===
If a shaft is supported by two bearings, and the center-lines of rotation of these bearings are not the same, then large forces are exerted on the bearing, which may destroy it. Some very small amount of misalignment is acceptable, and how much depends on type of bearing. For bearings that are specifically made to be &#x27;self-aligning&#x27;, acceptable misalignment is between 1.5 and 3 degrees of arc. Bearings that are not designed to be self-aligning can accept misalignment of only 2–10 minutes of arc (0.033-0.166 degrees) .

==Applications==

In general, ball bearings are used in most applications that involve moving parts. Some of these applications have specific features and requirements:

* Computer fan and spinning device bearings used to be highly spherical and were said to be the best spherical manufactured shapes, but this is no longer true for hard disk drive, and more and more are being replaced with fluid bearings.
* In horology, the Jean Lassale company designed a watch movement that used ball bearings to reduce the thickness of the movement. Using 0.20 mm balls, the Calibre 1200 was only 1.2 mm thick, which still is the thinnest mechanical watch movement.
* Aerospace bearings are used in many applications on commercial, private and military aircraft including pulleys, gearboxes and jet engine shafts. Materials include M50 tool steel (AMS6491), carbon chrome steel (AMS6444), the corrosion resistant AMS5930, 440C stainless steel, silicon nitride (ceramic) and titanium carbide-coated 440C.
* A skateboard wheel contains two bearings, which are subject to both axial and radial time-varying loads. Most commonly bearing 608-2Z is used (a deep groove ball bearing from series 60 with 8 mm bore diameter)
* Many yo-yos, ranging from beginner to professional or competition grade, incorporate ball bearings.
* Many fidget spinner toys use multiple ball bearings to add weight, and to allow the toy to spin.
* In centrifugal pumps.
* Railroad locomotive axle journals. Side rod action of newest high speed steam locomotives before railroads were converted to diesel engines.

==Designation==
The ball size increases as the series increases, for any given inner diameter or outer diameter (not both). The larger the ball the greater the load carrying capacity. Series 200 and 300 are the most common.

<doc id="198107" wikidata="Q131217" url="?curid=198107" title="Gulf of Thailand">
<text>The Gulf of Thailand (), historically known as the Gulf of Siam (), is a shallow inlet in the southwestern South China Sea, bounded between the southwestern shores of the Indochinese Peninsula and the northern half of the Malay Peninsula. It is around in length and up to in width, and has a surface area of . The gulf is surrounded on the north, west and southwest by the coastlines of Thailand (hence the name), on the northeast by Cambodia and the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, and opens to the South China Sea in the southeast.

==Names==
The modern Thai name of the gulf is &quot;Ao Thai&quot; (, , &#x27;Thai Gulf&#x27;) and &quot;Gulf of Thailand&quot; has been adopted as the official name of the body by the International Hydrographic Organization. Its name in Malay is &quot;Gulf of Siam&quot;, &quot;Teluk Siam&quot; or in Jawi script: , and in &quot;, Chhoung Samut Siem&quot;. In Thai, the gulf is historically known as &quot;Ao Sayam&quot; (). In Vietnamese it is known as &quot;Vịnh Thái Lan&quot;.

It is generally identified with the Great Gulf () known to Greek, Roman, Arab, Persian, and Renaissance cartographers before the influx of Portuguese explorers removed the phantom Dragon Tail peninsula from European world maps in the 16th century.

== Etymology ==
The Gulf of Thailand, historically known as the Gulf of Siam, derives its name from the historical kingdom of Siam, the former name of modern-day Thailand. The term &quot;Gulf of Siam&quot; was widely used in Western cartography and geographical references up until the mid-20th century, reflecting the colonial-era practice of naming regions based on the prevalent local political entities at the time.

&quot;Siam&quot; itself is an exonym, believed to have origins in the Sanskrit word &quot;Syama,&quot; which means &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;brown,&quot; referring to the skin tone of the region&#x27;s inhabitants. The term &quot;Siam&quot; was used internationally until 1939, when the country officially changed its name to Thailand. Following this renaming, &quot;Gulf of Thailand&quot; gradually became the more commonly used term, especially in official contexts, although &quot;Gulf of Siam&quot; is still occasionally used.

==Geography==
The Gulf of Thailand is bordered by Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It occupies a seabed area of 304,000 km2 from 6° N to 13°30&#x27; N latitude and 99°E to 104° E longitude. The northern tip of the gulf is the Bay of Bangkok at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River. The southern boundary of the gulf is defined by a line from Cape Bai Bung in southern Vietnam (just south of the mouth of the Mekong River) to the town of Tumpat and Pengkalan Chepa on the Malaysian coast.

The gulf is relatively shallow: its mean depth is and the maximum depth is only . This makes water exchange slow, and the strong water inflow from the rivers reduces the level of salinity in the gulf (3.05–3.25 percent) and enriches the sediments. Only at greater depths does water with a higher salinity (3.4 percent) flow into the gulf from the South China Sea. It fills the central depression below a depth of . The main rivers which empty into the gulf are the Chao Phraya, including its distributary Tha Chin River, the Mae Klong, and Bang Pakong rivers at the Bay of Bangkok, and to a lesser degree the Tapi River flowing into Bandon Bay in the southwest of the gulf.

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as &quot;[a] line running from the Western extreme of Cambodia or Camau Point (8°36&#x27;N) to the Northern extreme of the point on the East side of the estuary of the Kelantan River ()&quot;.

===Seabed morphology===
The seabed morphology in the central depression of the gulf is characterised by the presence of elongated mounds and ridges arranged parallel to the axis of the basin. This morphology, widespread within the gulf in water depths exceeding 50 m, covers an area of tens of thousands of square kilometres.

It reflects an interaction between sediment dewatering and the erosional activity of the present-day bottom currents. The sediment dewatering and fluid seepage result in the formation of numerous small pits and pockmarks. The long-term erosion imposed by currents of stable orientation modifies pockmarks into long runnels and depressions, and ultimately leads to the formation of the large fields of elongated mounds and ridges, as well as the residual outliers of un-eroded mud and clay sheets.

==Environment==
===Coral reefs===
There are 75,590 rai of coral reef in the gulf, of which five percent are considered to be in fertile condition. In 2010 severe coral bleaching occurred at most reef sites in the country. Bleaching of reefs in the Andaman Sea was more severe and extensive than that in the Gulf of Thailand. In 2016, coral bleaching was detected at Ko Thalu and Ko Lueam in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province for the first time. Scientists have determined that bleaching starts when seawater temperature rises beyond 30 °C for more than three weeks. Given the prolonged period of temperatures up to 32 °C at Ko Thalu in Prachuap Khiri Khan, five to ten percent of corals in the area are already bleached.

===Water quality===
Coastal water monitoring results in 2015 from 202 sampling locations, collected twice annually, indicate that no Thai coastal waters were found to be in excellent condition. Sixteen percent of coastal water was of good quality, 72 percent was of fair quality, 9 percent was of poor quality and 3 percent was of very poor quality. The quality of all coastal waters exhibited similar percentages — most were of fair quality — except for the Inner Gulf of Thailand, where the coastal water was poor to very poor. In comparison to coastal water quality as measured in 2014, water quality has deteriorated. Some gulf waters off Chachoengsao Province, Samut Sakhon Province, Samut Prakan Province, Bangkok, Rayong Province, Chonburi Province, Phetchaburi Province, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, and Surat Thani Province were judged to have coastal waters in &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;very poor&quot; condition. Songkhla was the only province on the gulf with coastal water rated &quot;good&quot; quality.

===Fisheries===
Of Thailand&#x27;s total marine catch, 41 percent is caught in the Gulf of Thailand and 19 percent in the Andaman Sea. Forty percent is caught in waters outside Thailand&#x27;s EEZ.

===Coastal erosion===
Thailand has 1,660 kilometres of coastline bordering the gulf. &quot;Severe erosion&quot;, more than five metres of coastline loss per year, afflicts 670 kilometres of that total. At least some of the erosion is attributable to the clearing of mangrove forests to make way for shrimp farms.

===Plastic pollution===
In February 2017, a 10 kilometer-long patch of plastic refuse was found floating off Chumphon Province. Thailand is among the world&#x27;s worst plastic polluters. More than half of &quot;land-based plastic waste leakage&quot; into the sea originates from just five countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The Thai Marine and Coastal Resources Department has noted that at least 300 sea animals on average—60 per cent of which are whales and dolphins—die from eating plastic fishing gear and trash each year. Filter feeding invertebrates tested off the coast of Chonburi Province showed high levels of microplastics, leading the authors to warn that, &quot;Health risks are possible when people consume these contaminated marine organisms, particularly shellfish.&quot;

Thailand&#x27;s Pollution Control Department (PCD) estimates that plastic waste in the country is increasing at an annual rate of 12 percent, or around two million tonnes per year.

===Oil spills===
In 2013, a pipeline leak resulted in an oil slick that went on to coat a beach on the nearby Ka Samet island.

In late January 2022, a leak in the pipeline operated by the Star Petroleum Refining Public Company Ltd caused a spill of 20 to 50 tonnes across 47 km2 of water, with some oil reaching the coast of Rayong province 20 km away.

==Tourism==
The gulf&#x27;s many coral reefs have made it attractive to divers. The tropical warmth of the water attracts many tourists. Some of the most important tourist destinations in the Gulf of Thailand are the islands of Ko Samui and Ko Pha Ngan in Surat Thani Province, Pattaya in Chonburi Province, Cha-am in Phetchaburi Province, Hua Hin in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, and Ko Samet in Rayong Province.

In recent years, the bay has become known for its whale watching activities, targeting the endemic, critically endangered populations of cetaceans (Eden&#x27;s whales, newly described Omura&#x27;s whales, Chinese white dolphins, and Irrawaddy dolphins showing unique feeding behaviors), and dugongs. It was first classified by Müller in 1776 as &quot;Trichechus dugon&quot;. Five species of the sea turtles have been found in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman sea coast, including olive ridley turtles, green turtles, hawksbill turtles, loggerhead turtles, and leatherback turtles.

==Territorial disputes==
The area between Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam is subject to several territorial disputes. Malaysia and Thailand have chosen to jointly develop the disputed areas, which include the islands of Ko Kra and Ko Losin. A long-standing dispute between Cambodia and Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand concerns mainly the island of Phú Quốc or Koh Tral in Khmer, which is off the Cambodian coast. Cambodia also claims of shelf area.

<text>The following is a list of cities and towns (, ) in Finland. The basic administrative unit of Finland is municipality. Since 1977, there is no legal difference between towns and municipalities, and a municipality can independently decide to call itself a city or town if it considers that it meets the requirements of an urban settlement. The following list includes the municipalities that use the word in their official name. For cities and towns founded before the 1960s, the list includes the year it was chartered.

The names used in this encyclopedia are usually the Finnish or Swedish forms, depending on the majority language of the municipality, except when there is a commonly used English name.

<doc id="198115" wikidata="Q199952" url="?curid=198115" title="Taormina">
<text>Taormina ( , , also , ; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Messina, on the east coast of the island of Sicily, Italy. Taormina has been a tourist destination since the 19th century. Its beaches on the Ionian Sea, including that of Isola Bella, are accessible via an aerial tramway built in 1992, and via highways from Messina in the north and Catania in the south. On 26–27 May 2017 Taormina hosted the 43rd G7 summit.

== History ==
The history of Taormina dates back to before Ancient Greece established its first colony on Sicily in 734 BCE in Magna Graecia. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Taormina continued to rank as one of the more important towns of the island. Taormina followed the history of Sicily in being ruled by successive foreign monarchs. After the Italian unification, Taormina began to attract well-off tourists from northern Europe, and it became known as a welcoming haven for gay men and artists.

== Main sights ==

The present town of Taormina occupies the ancient site, on a hill that forms the last projecting point of the mountain ridge that extends along the coast from Cape Pelorus to this point. The site of the old town is about above the sea, while a very steep and almost isolated rock, crowned by a Norman castle, rises about higher. This is the likely site of the ancient &quot;Arx&quot; or citadel, an inaccessible position mentioned by ancient writers. Portions of the ancient walls may be traced at intervals all round the brow of the hill, the whole of the summit of which was occupied by the ancient city. Numerous fragments of ancient buildings are scattered over its whole surface, including extensive reservoirs of water, sepulchres, tessellated pavements, etc., and the remains of a spacious edifice, commonly called a &quot;Naumachia&quot;, but the real purpose of which it is difficult to determine.

Saracen Castle: Built by the Arabs about 400 meters high on the rock of Monte Tauro, the Castello Saraceno allowed to dominate on Taormina and its beautiful bay, and control the valley of the river Alcantara.

Arab Necropolis: The necropolis was probably built between the ninth and eleventh century with symmetrical cells positioned one on the other.
Located outside the city walls that defended the town of Taormina, the necropolis extended toward northeast, between the existing ruins and the Church of St. Pietro.

The ancient theatre of Taormina is built for the most part of brick, and is therefore probably of Roman date, though the plan and arrangement are in accordance with those of Greek, rather than Roman, theatres; whence it is supposed that the present structure was rebuilt upon the foundations of an older theatre of the Greek period. With a diameter of (after an expansion in the 2nd century), this theatre is the second largest of its kind in Sicily (after that of Syracuse); it is frequently used for operatic and theatrical performances and for concerts. The greater part of the original seats have disappeared, but the wall which surrounded the whole cavea is preserved, and the proscenium with the back wall of the scena and its appendages, of which only traces remain in most ancient theatres, are here preserved in an uncommon state of integrity. From the fragments of architectural decorations still extant it has been determined that these were of the Corinthian order, and richly ornamented. Some portions of a temple are also visible, converted into the church of San Pancrazio, but the edifice is of small size.

Other sights include the 12th-14th century &quot;Palazzo Corvaja&quot;, the cathedral (&quot;Duomo di Taormina&quot;) dating from the thirteenth century, a 1635 Baroque fountain, the &quot;Palazzo Duchi di Santo Stefano&quot; in Gothic style of the fourteenth century, the Church of &quot;San Domenico&quot;, the Anglican Church of Saint George, and the municipal gardens (&quot;Giardini della Villa Comunale&quot;).

== Culture and tourism ==
Just south of Taormina is the Isola Bella, a nature reserve; and further south, situated beside a bay, is the popular seaside resort of Giardini Naxos. Tours of the Capo Sant&#x27;Andrea grottos are also available.

The town of Taormina is perched on a cliff overlooking the Ionian Sea. Besides the ancient Greek theatre, it has many old churches, lively bars, fine restaurants and antique shops. The Santuario Madonna della Rocca is one such church. Located on the slope above the town, it commands an impressive view of the coast and Mount Etna to the south, and is accessible on foot via the staired path, Salita Castello. Taormina is approximately a forty-five-minute drive away from Europe&#x27;s largest active volcano, Mount Etna.

== Cultural references ==
Taormina inspired the naming of &#x27;Toormina&#x27;, a suburb of Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.

A part of the film &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988) was set and filmed in Taormina, where the main characters take part in the no limits freediving World Championships.

The second season of the U.S. show &quot;The White Lotus&quot; primarily takes place in Taormina, and was filmed in various locations throughout the city.

== Events ==
Many exhibitions and events are organized during the summer in Taormina. The exceptional stage for pop and classical concerts, opera and important performances often recorded by television (for example, the ceremony of the Silver Ribbon Award, the Festivalbar, the Kore) is the Ancient Theatre. Since 1983, the most important performances are realized by Taormina Arte, the cultural institution which organizes music, theatre and dance festivals.

Within the programme of Taormina Arte there is the Taormina Film Fest, the heir of the Cinema Festival of Messina and Taormina, dating from 1960, which for about twenty years has hosted the David of Donatello Awards. During the Taormina Film Fest the Silver Ribbons are awarded, a prize created by Italian Film Journalists.

Since 2005, in October, Taormina Arte has organized the Giuseppe Sinopoli Festival, a festival dedicated to its late artistic director.

<doc id="198118" wikidata="Q56435730" url="?curid=198118" title="Welsh orthography">
<text>Welsh orthography uses 29 letters (including eight digraphs) of the Latin script to write native Welsh words as well as established loanwords.

Welsh orthography makes use of multiple diacritics, which are primarily used on vowels, namely the acute accent (), the grave accent (), the circumflex (, , or ) and the diaeresis (). They are considered variants of their base letter, i.e. they are not alphabetised separately.

The letter has only recently been accepted into Welsh orthography: for use in words borrowed from English which retain the sound, even when it originally was not represented by in English orthography, as in (&quot;garage&quot;), (“giraffe”), and (&quot;fridge&quot;). Older borrowings of English words containing resulted in the sound being pronounced and spelled in various other ways, resulting in occasional doublets such as and (&quot;Japan&quot;).

The letters are sometimes used in technical terms, like &quot;kilogram&quot;, &quot;volt&quot; and &quot;zero&quot;, but in all cases can be, and often are, nativised: , and .

== History ==

The earliest samples of written Welsh date from the 6th century and are in the Latin alphabet (see Old Welsh). The orthography differs from that of modern Welsh, particularly in the use of to represent the voiced plosives non initially. Similarly, the voiced fricatives were written .

By the Middle Welsh period, this had given way to quite a bit of variability: Although were now used to represent , these sounds were also often written as in Old Welsh, while could be denoted by . In earlier manuscripts, moreover, fricatives were often not distinguished from plosives (e.g. for , now written ). The grapheme was also used, unlike in the modern alphabet, particularly before front vowels. The disuse of this letter is at least partly due to the publication of William Salesbury&#x27;s Welsh New Testament and William Morgan&#x27;s Welsh Bible, whose English printers, with type letter frequencies set for English and Latin, did not have enough letters in their type cases to spell every as , so the order went &quot;C for K, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth&quot;; this was not liked at the time, but has become standard usage.

In this period, (capital ) was also used interchangeably with , such as the passage in the 1567 New Testament: , which contains both and . Elsewhere, the same word is spelt in different ways, e.g. and .

The printer and publisher Lewis Jones, one of the co-founders of , the Welsh-speaking settlement in Patagonia, favoured a limited spelling reform which replaced Welsh and with and , and from &quot;circa&quot; 1866 to 1886 Jones employed this innovation in a number of newspapers and periodicals he published and/or edited in the colony. However, the only real relic of this practice today is the Patagonian placename Trevelin (&quot;mill town&quot;), which in standard Welsh orthography would be .

In 1928, a committee chaired by Sir John Morris-Jones standardised the orthography of modern Welsh.

In 1987, a committee chaired by Professor Stephen J. Williams made further small changes, introducing . Not all modern writers adhere to the conventions established by these committees.

== Letter names and sound values ==
&quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot; indicate variants specific to the northern and southern dialects of Welsh. Throughout Wales an alternative system is also in use in which all consonant letters are named using the corresponding consonant sound plus a schwa (e.g. for ). In this system the vowels are named as below.

== Diacritics ==
Welsh makes use of a number of diacritics.

The circumflex (ˆ) is mostly used to mark long vowels, so &quot;â, ê, î, ô, û, ŵ, ŷ&quot; are always long. However, not all long vowels are marked with a circumflex, so the letters &quot;a, e, i, o, u, w, y&quot; with no circumflex do not necessarily represent short vowels; see .

The grave accent (`) is sometimes used, usually in words borrowed from another language, to mark vowels that are short when a long vowel would normally be expected, e.g. (a cough), (a pass/permit or a lift in a car); (smoke), (a mug).

The acute accent (´) is sometimes used to mark a stressed final syllable in a polysyllabic word. Thus the words (to empty) and (decline) have final stress. However, not all polysyllabic words with final stress are marked with the acute accent ( &quot;Welsh&quot; and &quot;forward/onward&quot;, for example, are written with none). The acute may also be used to indicate that a letter &quot;w&quot; represents a vowel where a glide might otherwise be expected, e.g. (two syllables) &quot;manly&quot;, as opposed to (one syllable) &quot;root&quot;.

Similarly, the diaeresis (¨) is used to indicate that two adjoining vowels are to be pronounced separately (not as a diphthong). However, it is also used to show that the letter &quot;i&quot; is used to represent the cluster which is always followed by another vowel, e.g. (to copy) pronounced , not .

The grave and acute accents in particular are very often omitted in casual writing, and the same is true to a lesser extent of the diaeresis. The circumflex, however, is usually included. Accented vowels are not considered distinct letters for the purpose of collation.

== Predicting vowel length from orthography ==
As mentioned above, vowels marked with the circumflex are always long, and those marked with the grave accent are always short. If a vowel is not marked with a diacritic, its length must be determined by its environment; the rules vary a bit according to dialect.

In all dialects, only stressed vowels may be long; unstressed vowels are always short.

An unmarked (stressed) vowel is long:
* in the last syllable of a word when no consonant follows: (good).
* before voiced stops &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and before all fricatives (except for &quot;ll&quot;) &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;dd&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;ff&quot;, &quot;th&quot;, &quot;s&quot;: (son), (favourite), (thing), (night).

An unmarked vowel is short:
* in an unstressed (proclitic) word: .
* before &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;: (gate), (sheepfold), (ship)
* before most consonant clusters: (saint), (hedge), (April).

The vowel &quot;y&quot;, when it is pronounced , is always short even when it appears in an environment where other vowels would be long: (whole) . When pronounced as a close or near-close vowel ( or in the North, or in the South), &quot;y&quot; follows the same rules as other vowels: (day) (North) ~ (South), (wind) (North) ~ (South).

Before &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;r&quot;, unmarked vowels are long in some words and short in others:

(The last four examples are given in South Welsh pronunciation only since vowels in nonfinal syllables are always short in North Welsh.)

Before &quot;nn&quot; and &quot;rr&quot;, vowels are always short: (ash trees), (to win), (stone).

In Northern dialects, long vowels are stressed and appear in the final syllable of the word. Vowels in non-final syllables are always short. In addition to the rules above, a vowel is long in the North before a consonant cluster beginning with &quot;s&quot;: (witness). Before &quot;ll&quot;, a vowel is short when no consonant follows the &quot;ll&quot;: (better) It is long when another consonant does follow the &quot;ll&quot;: (hair).

In Southern dialects, long vowels may appear in a stressed penultimate syllable as well as in a stressed word-final syllable. Before &quot;ll&quot;, a stressed vowel in the last syllable can be either long (e.g. &quot;better&quot; ) or short (e.g. &quot;hole&quot; ). However, a stressed vowel in the penult before &quot;ll&quot; is always short: (clothes).
Before &quot;s&quot;, a stressed vowel in the last syllable is long, as mentioned above, but a stressed vowel in the penult is short: (measure) . Vowels are always short before consonant clusters: (saint), (hair), (witness).

== Digraphs ==
While the digraphs &quot;ch, dd, ff, ng, ll, ph, rh, th&quot; are each written with two symbols, they are all considered to be single letters. This means, for example that (a town in South Wales) is considered to have only six letters in Welsh, compared to eight letters in English. Consequently, they each take up only a single space in Welsh crosswords. &quot;Ll&quot; itself had actually been written as the ligature in Middle Welsh.

Sorting is done in correspondence with the alphabet. For example, comes before , which comes before , which comes before . Automated sorting may occasionally be complicated by the fact that additional information may be needed to distinguish a genuine digraph from a juxtaposition of letters; for example comes after (in which the stands for ) but before (in which &quot;n&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are pronounced separately as ).

Although the digraphs above are considered to be single letters, only their first component letter is capitalised when a word in lower case requires an initial capital letter. Thus:
: , etc. (place names)
: , etc. (personal names)
: (other sentences starting with a digraph)
The two letters in a digraph are only both capitalised when the whole word is in uppercase:
: (as on a poster or sign)

The status of the digraphs as single letters is reflected in the stylised forms used in the logos of the National Library of Wales (logo) and Cardiff University (logo).

<doc id="198119" wikidata="Q77033" url="?curid=198119" title="Wilhelm von Gloeden">
<text>Wilhelm Iwan Friederich August von Gloeden (September 16, 1856 – February 16, 1931), commonly known as Baron von Gloeden, was a German photographer who worked mainly in Italy. He is mostly known for his pastoral nude studies of Sicilian boys, which usually featured props such as wreaths or amphoras, suggesting a setting in the Greece or Italy of antiquity. His work demonstrates the controlled use of lighting as well utilizing elegant poses of his models. His innovations include the use of photographic filters and special body makeup (a mixture of milk, olive oil, and glycerin) to disguise skin blemishes. His work, both landscapes and nudes, drew wealthy tourists to Sicily, particularly gay men uncomfortable in northern Europe.

==Early life==
Wilhelm von Gloeden was self-invented. He claimed to be the son of an officer and baron from Mecklenburg, and gave a &quot;Schloss Volkshagen near Wismar&quot; as his place of birth. However, there was no such castle. He was indeed born into a Mecklenburg branch of the German noble family von Glöden, but his title was false: the line of Freiherren von Glöden line is well-documented and he was not a member of the baronial line. 

His father was Carl Hermann von Gloeden (1820-1862), who in 1851 was a forest ranger in Volkshagen (today Völkshagen, near Marlow east of Rostock), and in 1856 became a forest inspector in Dargun. His mother, Charlotte, née Maassen, had previously been married to Johann Magnus Wilhelm Raabe. Gloeden was given a Protestant upbringing.

Hermann von Gloeden was an administrator of the hunting estates of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, whose superintendent was an illegitimate son of the Frederick Louis, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and his mistress Luise Charlotte Ahrens, who had legitimized him by giving him the surname taken from an estate given to his son, the castle (actually a mansion) of Plüschow. His son married Charlotte Wilhemine Crull (1831-1891), the daughter of Hermann von Gloeden&#x27;s half-sister, and one of their children was the male photographer Wilhelm von Plüschow.
After the death of his father, his mother married for a third time, to Wilhelm Joachim von Hammerstein in 1864. Hammerstein (1838-1904) had been mentored by Carl Hermann von Gloeden, and his forestry career led to him becoming politician of the German Conservative Party and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot;. Von Gloeden described the relationship with his stepfather as not good. The most important family connection for Wilhelm was his half-sister Sophie Raabe from his mother&#x27;s first marriage, who lived with him in Sicily for years.
After studying art history in Rostock (1876), Gloeden studied painting under at the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School (1876–77) until he was forced by lung disease (apparently tuberculosis) to interrupt his studies for a year, convalescing at a sanatorium in the mountain resort of Görbersdorf, now known as Sokołowsko in Poland. Gloeden wrote: &quot;I studied painting at the Academy of fine arts in Weimar under the master Karl Gehrts, but then I fell ill with tuberculosis and had to leave the studio to move to Görbersdorf, where I spent a year.&quot;

==Taormina==

In a search for health, he travelled to Italy (1877–78), first staying in Naples and visiting Capri before moving on to Taormina in Sicily. He lodged at the Hotel Vittoria before buying a house near San Domenico Convent (). Apart from the period 1915–18, during the First World War, when he was forced to leave Italy to avoid internment as an enemy alien, he remained in Taormina until his death in 1931. Gregory Woods, scholar of LGBT studies, credited von Gloeden with transformative powers: &quot;Largely as a consequence of his photographs&#x27; popularity, the town became a tourist resort with good hotels.&quot; Edward Chaney, an expert on the evolution of the Grand Tour and of Anglo-Italian cultural relations, described the town as attracting &quot;male refugees from more repressive climates&quot;.
The mayor of the town in 1872–1882 was the German landscape painter (1843–1939), who had moved there in 1863. Through him, Gloeden became acquainted with the local inhabitants. He set up his photographic studio at first as a hobby and was exhibiting his work internationally by 1893 (London), including Cairo (1897), Berlin (1898–99, including a solo exhibition), Philadelphia (1902), Budapest &amp; Marseilles (1903), Nice (1903 &amp; 1905), Riga (1905), Dresden (1909) and Rome (World Fair 1911). His well-known study of two young boys clinging to an Ionic column was published in &quot;The Studio&quot; (London) in June 1893 (above a nude study by Baron Corvo of Cecil Castle, cousin of Charles Kains Jackson), which brought his work to the notice of a wider public.
In 1895, when his family&#x27;s fortune was lost through the &quot;Hammerstein affair&quot;, Gloeden received as a gift from his friend and patron the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a large-format plate camera. Soon his work brought him visitors from Europe, including royalty, industrialists, artists, and writers (Oscar Wilde visited in December 1897). In 1930, Gloeden ceased work as a photographer and sold his house on the Piazza San Domenico in return for an annuity and residence rights.
Gloeden scrupulously shared the proceeds of his sales with his models. The names of some of them are known: Pasquale Stracuzzi (known as &quot;Pasqualino&quot;); Vincenzo Lupicino (known as &quot;Virgilio&quot; &amp; seen in the &quot;Boy with Flying Fish&quot; photographs); Peppino Caifasso or Carafasso (who posed as &quot;Ahmed&quot;); Pietro Caspano or Capanu; Nicola Scilio, also spelt Sciglio; Giuseppe De Cristoforo; and Maria Intelisano (niece of the parish priest of nearby Castelmola).
His cousin Guglielmo Plüschow (1852–1930), also a photographer of nudes, helped von Gloeden get more familiar with the technical side of photography (until then von Gloeden had not been a hobby photographer). Other important teachers of von Gloeden were local photographer Giovanni Crupi (1859–1925) in the Via Teatro Greco and the pharmacist/photographer Giuseppe Bruno (1836–1904) in the Corso.

The legends that Gloeden was a pupil of his cousin Plüschow, or of Crupi himself, are groundless, as it was Gloeden himself who wrote to us that he learned the technique of photography (very difficult at the time) from Bruno. This does not mean that Gloeden underwent an intense period of experimentation in close contact with these two photographers, in a sort of teamwork whose results ended up with a certain indifference in the catalog of both associates.

==Works==
 
While today Gloeden is mainly known for his nudes, and is considered &quot;one of the founders of modern homosexual iconography&quot;, in his lifetime he was also famous for his landscape photography that helped popularize tourism to Italy. In addition, he documented damage from the 1908 Messina earthquake, which may explain why the locals mostly approved of his work.
The majority of Gloeden&#x27;s pictures were made before the First World War, in the years from 1890 to 1910. During the war, he had to leave Italy. After returning in 1918, he photographed very little but continued to make new prints from his voluminous archives. In total, he took over 3000 images (and possibly up to 7000), which after his death were left to one of his models, Pancrazio Buciunì (also spelled Bucini; his dates sometimes given as – but probably should be 1879–1963), known as &#x27; (or &#x27;) for his North African looks. &quot;&quot; had been Gloeden&#x27;s lover since the age of 14 when he had first joined his household. In 1933, some 1,000 glass negatives from Gloeden&#x27;s collection (inherited by Buciuni) and 2,000 prints were confiscated by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist police under the allegation that they constituted pornography, and were destroyed; another 1,000 negatives were destroyed in 1936, but Buciuni was tried and cleared at a court in Messina (1939–1941) of disseminating pornographic images. Most of the surviving pictures (negatives and prints) are now in the Fratelli Alinari photographic archive in Florence (which in 1999 bought 878 glass negatives and 956 vintage prints formerly belonging to Buciuni to add to its existing collection of 106 prints) and further prints (which fetch hundreds of pounds at auction) are in private collections or held by public institutions such as the in Milan.
===Attitudes towards his work during his lifetime and later===
Gloeden generally made several different kinds of photographs. The ones that garnered the most widespread attention in Europe and overseas were usually relatively chaste studies of peasants, shepherds, fisherman, etc., featured in clothing like togas or Sicilian traditional costume, and which generally downplayed their homoerotic implications. He also photographed landscapes and some studies were of, or included, women. His models were usually posed either at his house, among the local ancient ruins, or on Monte Ziretto, located two kilometres to the north of Taormina and famous in antiquity for its quarries of red marble. He wrote in 1898: &quot;The Greek forms appealed to me, as did the bronze-hued descendants of the ancient Hellenes, and I attempted to resurrect the old, classic life in pictures...The models usually remained merry and cheerful, lightly clad and at ease in the open air, striding forward to the accompaniment of flutes and animated chatter. More than a few greatly enjoyed the work and anxiously awaited the moment when I would show them the finished picture.&quot;
More explicit photos in which boys aged between about 10 and 20, and occasionally older men, were nude (sometimes with prominent genitalia) and which, because of eye contact or physical contact were more sexually suggestive, were traded &quot;under the counter&quot; and among close friends of the photographer, but &quot;as far as is known, Gloeden&#x27;s archive contained neither pornographic nor erotically lascivious motifs&quot;.
==Other similar photographers at the time==
Gloeden&#x27;s cousin Guglielmo Plüschow also photographed male nudes, working in Rome. Plüschow was already a firmly established photographer when Gloeden started doing photographs of his own in the early 1890s. It is even speculated that Gloeden was taught the (then difficult) art of photography by Plüschow. However, Gloeden soon eclipsed Plüschow, and later works by Plüschow often were erroneously attributed to Gloeden. From an artistic standpoint, Plüschow&#x27;s work is somewhat inferior to Gloeden&#x27;s as his lighting is often too harsh and the poses of his models look quite stilted.
Up until 1907, Plüschow&#x27;s assistant Vincenzo Galdi secretly made work which he tried to pass off as Plüschow&#x27;s own. However, Galdi&#x27;s pictures lack elegance, often feature females, and generally tend to border on the pornographic.

<text>The Punk Rock Movie (also known as The Punk Rock Movie from England) is a British 1978 film that was assembled from Super 8 camera footage shot by Don Letts, the disc jockey at The Roxy club during the early days of the UK punk rock movement, principally during the 100 days in 1977 in which punk acts were featured at The Roxy club in London.

==History==

::The spikiest home movie of the Seventies captured an embryonic rock revolution. ...Verité rock had become verité celluloid almost by accident.

Roxy club disc jockey Don Letts was given a Super 8 camera as a present by fashion editor Caroline Baker. When Letts started to film the acts at The Roxy, it was soon reported that he was making a movie, so Letts determined to film continuously for three months. He needed to sell his possessions in order to continue to purchase film.

A preliminary, 60-minute version of the film was shown in autumn of 1977 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. This resulted in the cover story, &quot;Punk Home Movies&quot; in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine.

The film features live footage of The Clash, Sex Pistols, Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs, Generation X, Slaughter and the Dogs, The Slits, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Eater, Subway Sect, X-Ray Spex, Alternative TV and Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers. Backstage footage of certain bands, such as Generation X, The Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees, is also included.

All live footage was shot at the Roxy, except that of the Sex Pistols, who were filmed at The Screen On The Green cinema in London on 3 April 1977. The performance was Sid Vicious&#x27; first public concert with the band.

The film was subject to limited theatrical release in 1978. It was also subject to limited video release at that time by Sun Video (1978) and Danton Video (1980). It was also released on video in 1992 by Studio K7. Versions of the film were released on DVD between 2006 and 2008, though these releases were subject to criticism for sound reproduction and digital transfers that were considered to be inferior to the original. In addition, concerns were expressed that the soundtrack now included overdubbed material, as opposed to the original live recordings.

<text>Leyte Gulf, also known simply as the Leyte, is a gulf in the Eastern Visayan region in the Philippines. The bay is part of the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean, and is bounded by two islands; Samar in the north and Leyte in the west. On the south of the bay is Mindanao Island, separated from Leyte by the Surigao Strait. Dinagat Island partly encloses the gulf to the southeast, and the small Homonhon Island and Suluan Island, sit astride the eastern entrance to the Gulf. It is approximately north-south, and east-west.

Several municipalities are situated on the coast of the gulf: Balangiga, Giporlos, Guiuan, Lawaan, Mercedes, Quinapondan and Salcedo. There are also eleven marine reserves in the gulf region.

Leyte Gulf was also the scene of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which extends to Surigao Strait during the Battle of Surigao Strait, the largest naval battle of World War II and started the end of Japanese occupation in the Philippines. During World War II the gulf was part of a large US Navy base Leyte-Samar Naval Base.

In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan stirred up a storm surge in Leyte Gulf, resulting in massive loss of lives, agricultural land and property along Leyte&#x27;s shores.

==Fishing==

Leyte Gulf is identified by the Leyte State University as one of the important fishing grounds of Leyte and Samar. Like other rich fishing grounds such as Maqueda Bay and Carigara Bay, the gulf is known for abundant catches of anchovies, herring, shrimp and crabs. It was also once one of the richest sources of mud crabs in 1985. Fish harvest has been in decline in the gulf due to the use of dynamite fishing. Typhoon Haiyan has damaged the hard coral cover within the gulf&#x27;s area, further reducing the fish harvest.

<doc id="198123" wikidata="Q390346" url="?curid=198123" title="CinePaint">
<text>CinePaint is a free and open source computer program for painting and retouching bitmap frames of films. It is a fork of version 1.0.4 of the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It enjoyed some success as one of the earliest open source tools developed for feature motion picture visual effects and animation work. 
The main reason for this adoption over mainline GIMP was its support for high bit depths (greater than 8-bits per channel) which can be required for film work. The mainline GIMP project later added high bit depths in GIMP 2.9.2, released November 2015. It is free software under the GPL-2.0-or-later. In 2018, a post titled &quot;CinePaint 2.0 Making Progress&quot; announced progress, but, , version 2.0 has not been released.

== Main features ==
Features that set CinePaint apart from its photo-editing predecessor include the frame manager, onion skinning, and the ability to work with 16-bit and floating point pixels for high-dynamic-range imaging (HDR). CinePaint supports a 16-bit color managed workflow for photographers and printers, including CIE*Lab and CMYK editing. It supports the Cineon, DPX, and OpenEXR image file formats. HDR creation from bracketed exposures is easy.

CinePaint is a professional open-source raster graphics editor, not a video editor. Per-channel color engine core: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit. The image formats it supports include BMP, CIN, DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, OpenEXR, PNG, TIFF, and XCF.

CinePaint is currently available for UNIX and Unix-like OSes including Mac OS X and IRIX. The program is available on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and NetBSD. Its main competitors are the mainline GIMP and Adobe Photoshop, although the latter is only available for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Glasgow, a completely new code architecture being used for CinePaint, is expected to make a new Windows version possible and is currently under production. The Glasgow effort is FLTK based. This effort appears to have stalled.

CinePaint version 1.4.4 appeared on SourceForge on 2021/5/6, followed by CinePaint 1.4.5 on 30. May 2021.

== Movies ==
Examples of the software&#x27;s application in the movie industry include:
* &quot;Elf&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003)
* &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Duplex&quot; (2003)
* &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Showtime&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Blue Crush&quot; (2002)
* &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003)
* The Harry Potter series
* &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Little Nicky&quot; (2000)
* &quot;The Grinch&quot; (2000)
* &quot;The 6th Day&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002)

Under its former name Film Gimp, CinePaint was used for films such as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002), &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003) and &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999).

<doc id="198126" wikidata="Q781331" url="?curid=198126" title="Australian Antarctic Division">
<text>The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is a division of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. The Division undertakes science programs and research projects to contribute to an understanding of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. It conducts and supports collaborative research programs with other Australian and international organisations, such as the Bureau of Meteorology and Geoscience Australia, as well as administering and maintaining a presence in Australian Antarctic and sub-Antarctic territories.

Their website includes articles on the Antarctic wildlife, threats, guidelines and they have blogs written by Australians at the three Australian bases in Antarctica: Mawson, Davis and Casey.

== Charter ==
Under its charter the Australian Antarctic Division:
* Administers the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands
* Conducts research in high priority areas of Antarctic science
* Coordinates and manages Australia&#x27;s logistic program in Antarctica
* Promotes Antarctic research in universities through grants and the provision of logistic support
* Develops policy proposals and provides advice on Australia&#x27;s Antarctic interests
* Promotes Australia&#x27;s Antarctic interests within the Antarctic Treaty System
* Maintains a continuing presence in the region through permanent stations, the establishment of field bases and the provision of transport, communication and medical services
* Acts as the primary source of Australian Antarctic information

== Australian Antarctic Program ==
The Australian Antarctic Division leads the Australian Antarctic Program (AAP) with four key goals:
* Maintain the Antarctic Treaty System and enhance Australia&#x27;s influence in it
* Protect the Antarctic environment
* Understand the role of Antarctica in the global climate system
* Undertake scientific work of practical, economic and national significance

== Research stations ==

The AAD headquarters is in Kingston, Tasmania, just south of Hobart. The division&#x27;s headquarters houses laboratories for science, electronics and electron microscopy, mechanical and instrument workshops, a krill research aquarium, a herbarium, equipment stores, communications and other operational and support facilities. The Chief Scientist since 2021 has been Professor Nicole Webster.

The AAD maintains three permanently staffed stations on the Antarctic continent, and one on Macquarie Island in the subantarctic.

* Casey Station (including the seasonal camp at Wilkins Runway)
* Davis Station
* Mawson Station
* Macquarie Island Station

Remote field bases operate during the summer research season supporting coastal, inland and traverse operations.

== Transport ==
=== Aviation ===
The AAD uses an air transport system, both for transport to and from Antarctica, and for transport within the continent. Aircraft for this system are provided and operated under contract by private sector operators. Services to and from Antarctica are provided, between November and February each year, by an Airbus A319-115LR operated by Skytraders. This aircraft operates to and from the Wilkins ice runway, situated some from Casey Station. Construction of a paved runway at Davis station was announced in 2018.

Services within Antarctica are provided by a mixture of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Fixed-wing services are provided by Basler BT-67 and DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft operated by Kenn Borek Air. These aircraft operate from Wilkins runway and from smaller snow runways at each of the three permanent stations, as well as any field locations which provide the necessary flat area of snow or ice. 

Helicopter services are provided by up to four BK117 helicopters, operated by Helicopter Resources. In 2016, AAD helicopter pilot David Wood died by falling into a crevasse while unloading sling cargo near Davis Station. Following legal proceedings, the Court of the Australian Capital Territory found the AAD guilty of failing to comply with its duty to ensure the health and safety of workers. 

The Antarctic Flight RAAF operated from 1948 to 1963. Since its withdrawal, aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force operated infrequently in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands in the 1970s and 1980s, Since 2016, RAAF C-17A Globemasters operate as required to carry high priority or oversize cargo that cannot be carried by the A319. Through &quot;Operation Southern Discovery&quot;, elements of the Australian Defence Force are tasked to provide annual support for the Australian Antarctic Division and the Australian Antarctic Program (AAP) in regional scientific, environmental and economic activities.

=== Shipping ===

The AAD uses the icebreaker RSV &quot;Nuyina&quot;, an icebreaking research and supply vessel. Construction commenced in May 2017 at Damen Shipyards in Romania. The vessel was then fitted out at Vlissingen in the Netherlands and handed over on 19 August 2021. &quot;Nuyina&quot; is owned by the Australian Government, and operated by Serco. 

&quot;Nuyina&quot; was built to replace RSV &quot;Aurora Australis&quot;, a multi-purpose marine research and resupply ship chartered from P&amp;O Polar. &quot;Aurora Australis&quot; was launched in 1989 and built by Carrington Slipways in Newcastle, New South Wales, and decommissioned in March 2020.

Due to mechanical problems, &quot;Nuyina&quot; was unable to be used during the 2022-23 Antarctic season and other chartered vessels were used instead, including MPOV &quot;Aiviq&quot; and the ice-strengthened cargo ship MV &quot;Happy Diamond&quot;.

=== Dog sleds ===
Australia was one of the three countries still using sled dogs (husky) in 1992 when the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol) banned the presence of non-native species in Antarctica to avoid the transmission of diseases from non-native species to native species. The younger Australian huskies were relocated using helicopter, ship, aeroplane and truck to Ely, Minnesota, where they could continue to be working dogs. The older dogs were retired to Australia, often living with former Antarctic workers.

== Territorial administration ==
The AAD is responsible, on behalf of the Australian Government, for administering the two Australian federal territories that lie in Antarctic or sub-Antarctic latitudes:

*Australian Antarctic Territory
*Heard Island and McDonald Islands

The AAD maintains a base on Macquarie Island which is part of the Australian state of Tasmania.

<text>SWEB Energy, formerly South Western Electricity Board (SWEB) was a British state-owned regional electricity company operating in South West England which was privatised by the Thatcher government. Although sold many times, the &#x27;SWEB&#x27; brand name survived until 2006.

The distribution network operator for the former SWEB area is now National Grid Electricty Distribution. The incumbent electricity retail company is EDF Energy.

== South Western Electricity Board (SWEB) ==

The board was responsible for the purchase of electricity from the electricity generator (the Central Electricity Generating Board from 1958) and its distribution and sale of electricity to customers. The key people on the board were: Chairman A.N. Irens (1964, 1967), Deputy Chairman S.F.C. Whitmore (1964, 1967), and full-time member C.E. Knight (1964, 1967).

The total number of customers supplied by the board over its operational life was:

==Company timeline==
In 1990, SWEB Energy was formed from the privatisation of the South Western Electricity Board.

In 1995, SWEB Energy was bought by the American utility Southern Company.

In 1999, the company was bought by the PPL Corporation distribution company Western Power Distribution and was split into two. Western Power itself (officially known as WPD South West) dealt with the local distribution, metering and substations, and the &#x27;SWEB&#x27; brand name was continued as a retail energy utility.

In June 1999, SWEB was sold to French-owned EDF Energy. The acquisition was authorised by the European Commission in Jul.1999. EDF discontinued the &#x27;SWEB&#x27; brand name on 5 June 2006.

<text>Sondrio (; ; ; archaic or ; ) is an Italian city, &quot;comune&quot; and administrative centre for the province of Sondrio, located in the heart of the Valtellina. , Sondrio counted approximately 21,876 inhabitants. In 2007, Sondrio was named the Alpine Town of the Year.

== History ==

Formerly an Ancient Roman military camp, today&#x27;s Sondrio was founded by the Lombards: in their language &quot;Sundrium&quot; meant &quot;Exclusive property&quot;, referring to the status of free men (&quot;arimanni&quot;) of the holders of the city and the surrounding land.

After the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in Italy, Sondrio became part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Capitanei of Vizzola, who controlled much of the Valtellina, had it in 1040 from the emperor Henry II. From 1310 to 1335 the city was involved in the war between the Guelph and Ghibelline factions of the nearby Como, and its war against Milan. After having resisted several attacks by the Comaschi, in 1335 Sondrio and Valtellina became part of the Visconti Milanese dominions.

From the second half of the 16th century to the end of the 18th century, Sondrio was governed by the Tre Leghe Grigie (&quot;Three Grey Leagues&quot;) of the Grisons, as the capital city of Valtellina. After the Reformation, Sondrio was the centre of heavy struggles between the Catholic Valtellinesi and the Protestant Grisons. In 1620 the citizens, led by Giacomo Robustelli, killed 180 Protestants and declared the independence of the Valtellina.

After the Napoleonic parenthesis, in which it became part of the Cisalpine Republic (later Kingdom of Italy), Sondrio with the Valtellina was annexed to the Austrian Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, and fought gallantly for its independence.

== Geography ==
The town is located in the middle of the province, and borders with the municipalities of Albosaggia, Caiolo, Castione Andevenno, Faedo Valtellino, Montagna in Valtellina, Spriana and Torre di Santa Maria. Its hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) are Arquino, Colda, Gualtieri, Ligari, Moroni, Mossini, Ponchiera, Sant&#x27;Anna, Sassella, Triangia and Triasso.

==Government==
== Economy ==

The territory of Sondrio has numerous vineyards; wines produced include the Sassella and Grumello. Wine represents one of the main resources of this region, together with tourism, especially in winter.

Another important piece of Sondrio&#x27;s economy is its banking industry, with the Banca Popolare di Sondrio and the Credito Valtellinese both headquartered in Sondrio and listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.

== Main sights ==
The heart of Sondrio is its central Garibaldi Square. Not far from it is the Palazzo Sassi, home of the Art and History Museum of Valtellina. In a dominant position, near the ancient road to the Valmalenco, linking the town to Switzerland, stands the Masegra Castle, housing the Historical Museum of the Grisons Domination.

The church of Santi Gervasio e Protasio rebuilt in Neoclassical-style in 1838, was built in the 12th century as a Romanesque pieve and collegiate church. Other sights include the Torre Ligariana, once the collegiate&#x27;s bell tower, and the Palazzo Pretorio, once the seat of the Grisons government.

Across the railway in direction of Milan there is the ancient Church of Maria della Sassella, which the local tradition dates back to the 10th century. In March 2021 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Como declared the church to be a diocesan Marian sanctuary.

<doc id="198133" wikidata="Q331875" url="?curid=198133" title="Abscam">
<text>Abscam, sometimes written ABSCAM, was a Federal Bureau of Investigation sting operation in the late 1970s and early 1980s that led to the convictions of seven members from both chambers of the United States Congress and others for bribery and corruption. The two-year investigation initially targeted trafficking in stolen property and corruption of prominent business people, but later evolved into a corruption investigation. The FBI was aided by the United States Department of Justice and convict Mel Weinberg in videotaping politicians accepting bribes from a fictitious Arabian company in return for various political favors.

More than 30 political figures were investigated, and six members of the United States House of Representatives and one member of the United States Senate were convicted. One member of the New Jersey State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service were also convicted. The operation was directed from the FBI&#x27;s office in Hauppauge, New York, on Long Island, and was conducted under the supervision of Assistant Director Neil Welch, who headed the bureau&#x27;s New York division, and Thomas P. Puccio, head of the Justice Department&#x27;s United States Organized Crime Strike Force for the Eastern District of New York.

&quot;Abscam&quot; was the FBI codename for the operation, which law enforcement authorities said was a contraction of &quot;Arab scam&quot;. The American-Arab Relations Committee made complaints. Hence, officials revised the source of the contraction to &quot;Abdul scam&quot; after the name of its fictitious company.

== Operation ==
In March 1978, John F. Good of the FBI&#x27;s office in suburban Long Island created and oversaw a sting operation called &quot;Abscam&quot;, which was initially intended to investigate theft, forgery, and stolen art. The FBI employed Melvin Weinberg, a convicted swindler, international con artist and informant, and his girlfriend, Evelyn Knight, to help plan and conduct the operation. At that time they were facing a prison sentence and, in exchange for their help, the FBI agreed to let them out on probation. Weinberg, supervised by the FBI, created a fake company called Abdul Enterprises in which FBI employees posed as fictional Arab sheikhs led by owners Kambir Abdul Rahman and Yassir Habib, who had millions of dollars to invest in the United States. Weinberg instructed the FBI to fund a $1 million account with the Chase Manhattan Bank in the name of Abdul Enterprises, giving the company the credibility it needed to further its operation.

When a forger under investigation suggested to the sheikhs that they invest in casinos in New Jersey and that licensing could be obtained for a price, the Abscam operation was re-targeted toward political corruption. Each member of Congress who was approached would be given a large sum of money in exchange for &quot;private immigration bills&quot; to allow foreigners associated with Abdul Enterprises into the country and for building permits and licenses for casinos in Atlantic City, among other investment arrangements. Among the casino projects involved were the Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City, the Dunes Hotel and Casino (Atlantic City), the Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, and the sheikh&#x27;s fictional casino. The first political figure to participate in the phony investment scheme was Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti. In exchange for monetary kickbacks, Errichetti told the sheikhs&#x27; representatives, &quot;I&#x27;ll give you Atlantic City.&quot; Errichetti helped to recruit several government officials and United States members of Congress who were willing to grant political favors in exchange for monetary bribes (originally $100,000 but then reduced to $50,000).

The FBI recorded each money exchange and, for the first time in American history, surreptitiously videotaped government officials accepting bribes. The meeting places included a house owned by Lee Lescaze in the Foxhall neighborhood of Washington, D.C., a yacht in Florida, and hotel rooms in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Each convicted politician was given a separate trial. During these trials, much controversy arose regarding the ethics of Operation Abscam. Many lawyers defending their clients accused the FBI of entrapment. Though some judges concurred, appeals eventually overruled this claim and each politician was convicted.

== Convictions ==
Of the 31 targeted officials, the following members of Congress were convicted of bribery and conspiracy in 1981:
* US Senator Harrison A. Williams (D-NJ)
* US Representative Frank Thompson (D-NJ)
* US Representative John Jenrette (D-SC)
* US Representative Raymond Lederer (D-PA)
* US Representative Michael Myers (D-PA)
* US Representative John M. Murphy (D-NY)
* US Representative Richard Kelly (R-FL)

Five other government officials were convicted, including
* Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, Angelo Errichetti (D)
* Philadelphia, PA City Council President George X. Schwartz (D)
* Philadelphia, PA City Councilman Harry Jannotti (D)
* Philadelphia, PA City Councilman Louis Johanson (D)
* An inspector for the US Immigration and Naturalization Service

=== Angelo Errichetti ===
Angelo Errichetti, mayor of Camden, New Jersey, was the first government official to be caught in Operation Abscam. Errichetti first accepted the bribe in exchange for obtaining a casino license in Atlantic City for Abdul Enterprises. He then introduced Abdul to Senator Harrison Williams, who also took the bait. Errichetti also introduced Michael Myers and Raymond Lederer to the company and arranged meetings with the undercover agents. He also introduced the &quot;Arab businessmen&quot; to Frank Thompson Jr. By the middle of 1979, Errichetti had arranged meetings with a list of state and federal politicians willing to go in on the operation. The FBI set up video cameras in a hotel suite near New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport to record the transactions between the undercover agents and Errichetti. He was convicted on the federal bribery charges, for which he served about three years in prison.

=== Harrison A. Williams ===

Senator Harrison A. Williams (D-NJ) was indicted on October 30, 1980, and convicted on May 1, 1981, on nine counts of bribery and conspiracy to use his office to aid in business ventures. Williams repeatedly met with the FBI agents and had worked out a deal where he would become involved in a titanium mining operation by way of having 18% of the company&#x27;s shares issued to his lawyer, Alexander Feinberg. Williams then promised to steer government contracts to the venture by using his position in the Senate.

At his trial, lawyers for Williams argued that he had not been bribed because the stock in the titanium mining company was worthless. Other defenses attempting to have the charges dismissed included that he was a victim of selective prosecution by the Justice Department because he had supported the presidential bid of Ted Kennedy over Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primary. These premises were not accepted by the jury, who convicted Williams after 28 hours of deliberation on May 1, 1981. Later appeals made by Williams included arguments that a main prosecution witness had perjured himself and that Williams had been a victim of entrapment. The guilty verdict was upheld, and Williams was sentenced to three years in prison.

Because of the convictions, the Senate Ethics Committee voted to censure Williams and put a motion to the floor to expel him for charges of bringing dishonor upon the Senate and his &quot;ethically repugnant behavior&quot;. Supporters of Williams moved that the censure was enough and that the expulsion was unnecessary. The Senate voted to censure Williams, but before the vote on his expulsion could occur, Williams resigned his seat. In his resignation speech, Williams proclaimed his innocence. He argued that the investigation into his activities was a grievous assault on the rights of the Senate and that other senators should be wary of unchecked investigations into their activities by other branches of the government.

Williams served two years of his three-year sentence at a federal penitentiary in Newark, New Jersey. He served the remainder of his term at the Integrity House halfway house, where he later became a board of directors member until his death by cancer on November 17, 2001. He also attempted to receive a presidential pardon from President Bill Clinton, but his request was denied. Williams was the first Senator to be imprisoned in almost 80 years, and, had the expulsion motion been approved, would have been the first Senator to be expelled from the Senate since the Civil War.

Linguistics expert Roger Shuy is convinced of Williams&#x27; innocence. In a recording of Williams&#x27; encounter with an agent disguised as a sheikh, &quot;At one point, the sheikh put the bribe directly to Williams: &#x27;I would like to give some money for, for permanent residence.&#x27; The first four words of Williams&#x27; reply were &#x27;No, no, no, no. A prosecution memo at the time stated that there was no case against Williams but the judge, who in his ruling decried &quot;the cynicism and hypocrisy of corrupt government officials&quot;, set it aside. After the trial, the lead juror said that had he known all the facts, he would not have found Williams guilty.

=== Frank Thompson ===

Frank Thompson (D-NJ) was a member of the House from Trenton, New Jersey, who was indicted and convicted of accepting a bribe from an FBI agent posing as an Arab sheikh. Thompson was offered money in exchange for helping the Arabs overcome certain immigration laws. Well-liked by his constituents, he was the longest-serving member of Congress convicted in Operation Abscam.

Thompson abstained on the vote to expel Representative Myers, the first Congressman to be indicted. While most of the politicians resigned, Myers was expelled from the House, and Williams did not resign until the vote on his expulsion was almost to take place. Thompson himself was not expelled from the House of Representatives because he lost his re-election campaign in 1980 to Republican Chris Smith, a relatively unknown candidate who in 1978 had run against Thompson as a sacrificial lamb candidate. Smith won the 1980 election by a margin of 20,000 votes. On December 29, 1980, Thompson resigned his seat in the US House of Representatives. Smith has continuously represented Thompson&#x27;s former district through the 119th United States Congress.

On December 2, 1980, Thompson was indicted on bribery charges. Thompson spent $24,000 of campaign funds fighting the charges and appealing his conviction on grounds of entrapment. Thompson was convicted of bribery and conspiracy charges and sentenced to three years in prison, starting in 1983. He served two years before being released and worked as a consultant in Washington until he died in 1989.

=== John M. Murphy ===
Thompson introduced John M. Murphy to the operation. Murphy was from Staten Island, New York. He was chair of the Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He accepted monetary bribes in exchange for his resources. Murphy&#x27;s conviction differed from the other Congressmen. His conviction was considered &quot;receiving an unlawful gratuity&quot; instead of bribery, but he served three years in prison for conspiracy charges only. Murphy was not filmed taking the $50,000 that most other participants took that day, instead arguing on tape with attorney Howard Criden about who would pick up Murphy&#x27;s money for him, which Criden did at a John F. Kennedy airport hotel.

=== Richard Kelly ===
In 1982, the conviction of Richard Kelly was appealed on the grounds of entrapment. Kelly, the sole Republican, said that he was only pretending to be involved with the bribery from Abdul Enterprises. He claimed that he was conducting his own operation dealing with corruption and that the FBI was ruining his own investigation. However, an appeals court upheld the conviction, and Kelly served 13 months in prison.

=== John Jenrette ===
John Jenrette was one of the few who resigned before being expelled from the House. During the operation, Jenrette was asked by an undercover FBI agent if he would take the bribe from the Sheikh. He replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve got larceny in my blood. I&#x27;d take it in a goddamn minute.&quot;

== Also approached by the FBI ==

=== John Murtha ===

John Murtha (D-PA) was one of the Congressmen who refused to take the bribe from the undercover agents. He too was videotaped in his encounter with undercover FBI operatives. Although he was never convicted or prosecuted, he was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the scandal. As such, he testified against Frank Thompson (D-NJ) and John Murphy (D-NY), the two Congressmen mentioned as participants in the deal at the same meeting. A short clip from the videotape shows Murtha stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested, I&#x27;m sorry. At this point...&quot; in direct response to an offer of $50,000 in cash.

In November 1980, the Justice Department announced that Murtha would not face prosecution for his part in the scandal. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office reasoned that Murtha intended to obtain investment in his district. Full-length viewing of the tape shows Murtha citing prospective investment opportunities that could return &quot;500 or 1,000&quot; miners to work. In July 1981, the House Ethics Committee also chose not to file charges against Murtha following a mostly party-line vote. The resignation later that day of attorney E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., the panel&#x27;s special counsel and a Democrat, has been interpreted as an act of protest.

Murtha remained prominent in Congress and was re-elected by his constituency 19 times over 36 years before his death on February 8, 2010.

=== Larry Pressler ===

Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) refused to take the bribe, saying at the time, &quot;Wait a minute, what you are suggesting may be illegal.&quot; He immediately reported the incident to the FBI. When Senator Pressler was told that Walter Cronkite referred to him on the evening news as a &quot;hero&quot;, he stated, &quot;I do not consider myself a hero... what have we come to if turning down a bribe is &#x27;heroic&#x27;?&quot;

=== Bob Guccione ===
Bob Guccione, publisher of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, was also approached with a bribe from the undercover FBI agents. Guccione was in the process of building the Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City and needed financing. He was associated with Abscam&#x27;s interest in Atlantic City, so Weinberg approached him and told him that an Arab sheikh wanted to invest $150 million in the casino project, but only if the casino had obtained a gaming license. Weinberg wanted Guccione to pay a $300,000 bribe to New Jersey gaming officials to get the license. Guccione refused and said, &quot;Are you out of your mind?&quot; After the Abscam scandal came to light, Guccione sued the federal government but lost.

=== Joseph A. Maressa ===
In 1980, New Jersey State Senate member Joseph A. Maressa accepted $10,000 from a group of FBI agents who were part of the Abscam undercover operation. The money was given to Maressa on behalf of a fictional Arab sheikh in exchange for Maressa&#x27;s efforts to get legislative support to obtain a gambling license for a casino in Atlantic City. Maressa justified accepting what he described as legal fees, saying, &quot;I felt like it would be patriotic to take some of this OPEC oil money and get it back to the United States.&quot; Maressa was not prosecuted for his actions.

== Conclusion ==
When the investigation became public in the early 1980s, ethical controversy focused on using the &quot;sting&quot; technique and Weinberg&#x27;s involvement in selecting targets. Although Weinberg was a previously convicted criminal involved in previous scams, he avoided a three-year prison sentence and was paid $150,000 in concurrence with the operation. Ultimately, all of the Abscam convictions were upheld on appeal, although some judges criticized the tactics used by the FBI and lapses in FBI and DOJ supervision.

In the wake of Abscam, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued &quot;The Attorney General Guidelines for FBI Undercover Operations&quot; (&quot;Civiletti Undercover Guidelines&quot;) on January 5, 1981. These were the first Attorney General Guidelines for undercover operations and formalized procedures necessary to conduct undercover operations to avoid future controversy. Following the initial press accounts about the Abscam investigation, Congress held a series of hearings to examine FBI undercover operations and the new Civiletti Undercover Guidelines. The House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights began hearings on FBI undercover operations in March 1980 and concluded with a report in April 1984. Among the concerns expressed during the hearings were the undercover agents&#x27; involvement in illegal activity, the possibility of entrapping individuals, the prospect of damaging the reputations of innocent civilians, and the opportunity to undermine legitimate privacy rights.

In March 1982, after the Senate debated a resolution to expel Senator Williams for his conduct in Abscam, the Senate established the Select Committee to Study Undercover Activities. In December 1982, the Committee issued its final report, which generally supported the undercover technique but observed that its use &quot;creates serious risks to citizens&#x27; property, privacy, and civil liberties, and may compromise law enforcement itself&quot;.

FBI documents later disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, consisting of newspaper clippings and letters written to the FBI, revealed a mixed response from the American public. Some Americans supported the FBI, but others argued that Abscam was an entrapment scenario ordered by a revenge-minded FBI, which earlier had been stung by Congressional inquiries into acts of police brutality and similar widespread abuses. Congressional concern about sting operations persisted, creating numerous additional guidelines in the ensuing years:
* The Civiletti Guidelines – 1980–1981
* The Smith Guidelines – 1983
* The Thornburgh Guidelines – 1989
* The Reno Guidelines – 2001

During Abscam, the FBI handed out more than $400,000 in &quot;bribes&quot; to Congressmen and middlemen.

In his book, &quot;The Dangers of Dissent&quot;, historian Ivan Greenberg suggests that the FBI&#x27;s aggressive investigation of political corruption might have been a response to the years of criticism the agency had received from Congressional investigations: &quot;Was this [ABSCAM] payback for the Church Committee hearings? The FBI wanted to punish the Congress for exposing its past corruption.&quot; Greenberg cites FBI Director William Webster&#x27;s 1980 speech to the Atlanta Bar Association as evidence. Webster stated, &quot;In the FBI we&#x27;ve been under attack for past incidents and circumstances. It&#x27;s quite understandable for those in Congress who love their institution, who are trying to rebuild its reputation and the confidence of the American people, to have an encounter and deal with a situation of this kind, and emotions run high. It&#x27;s my sense that the good sense of the Congress, similar to the emotions in the Bureau when they had their times, that now people are saying, well, let&#x27;s wait and see what the facts are...&quot; However, Greenberg does not provide evidence beyond this public comparison for his allegation.

== In popular culture ==

=== Movies ===
* French director Louis Malle adapted the Abscam story into a film script titled &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot;, with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi set to star, with Belushi playing a fictionalized version of Weinberg. Belushi&#x27;s death in March 1982 scuttled plans for the film. The script was co-written with John Guare, who also co-wrote &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, also by Malle, who would turn the unproduced screenplay into a play of the same name.
* The 1989 miniseries &quot;Family of Spies&quot;, which starred Powers Boothe as Soviet spy John Walker made an indirect reference to Abscam. When Walker&#x27;s compatriot Jerry Whitworth has second thoughts due to potential FBI involvement, Walker confidently remarks &quot;The FBI is too busy dressing up like Arabs to entrap Congressmen&quot; to focus on espionage.
* In the 1997 film &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, and 2003 film, &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;, Abscam is mentioned.
* The Abscam operation is dramatized in the 2013 feature film &quot;American Hustle&quot;, directed by David O. Russell, which received ten Academy Award nominations. The film is described as a &quot;fictionalization&quot; rather than a straight adaptation. The opening screen states, &quot;Some of this actually happened.&quot;

=== Television ===
* &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parodied the scandal in a skit titled &quot;The Bel-Airabs&quot; (a spoof of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;), February 9, 1980.
* &quot;Fridays&quot; parodied the scandal in a skit titled &quot;Abscam Camera&quot; (a spoof of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;).
* The incident was referenced in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Sniffing Accountant&quot;.
* Abscam was also mentioned as an insult to an FBI agent on an episode of &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;.
* In &quot;Dallas&quot; episode &quot;The Fall of the House of Ewing&quot;, an FBI agent attempts to get J. R. Ewing to offer a bribe to a government official. However, J.R. notices the hidden camera and denies wanting to offer a bribe. The undercover FBI agent is upset and says, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand how this happened; I even nailed a couple of those ABSCAM guys&quot;.
* It was referenced in an episode of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; titled &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; when Louise asks a fellow inmate if she was in jail for prostitution, and she replies, &quot;No, we&#x27;re three of the Abscam senators.&quot;

=== Music ===
* Prince refers to the Abscam story in the track &quot;Annie Christian&quot; from his 1981 album &quot;Controversy&quot;.
* In 1980, folk singer Tom Paxton wrote and recorded the song &quot;I Thought You Were an Arab&quot; (pronounced Ay&#x27;-rab) on his album &quot;The Paxton Report.&quot;
* In 2019, indie rock artist David Berman sang the lyric &quot;Got a comb over cut circa Abscam sting&quot; on the song &quot;Storyline Fever&quot;.

=== Print media ===
* A 1981 &quot;Bloom County&quot; comic strip in which Milo Bloom envisions himself as a senator on trial has him accused of (among many things) &quot;taking money from FBI agents posing as Arab camel scalpers&quot;. A later strip showed Milo attempting the same thing when working as a reporter for the local paper, the &quot;Beacon&quot;, only for Senator Bedfellow to state he knows he is Milo. Milo claims he is an Arab and will show ID, asking Bedfellow to hold the bribe money while he retrieves the ID, only for the picture to be snapped and a misleading headline of &quot;Caught!&quot; published.
* The &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comics also parody the investigation; they show congressmen claiming that &quot;they&quot; were doing the sting operation to bust FBI agents who were bribing elected officials and working for foreign organizations hostile to the United States.

=== Video games ===
* In 1982, a modified version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was unofficially created to satirize the investigation. In the game, the player takes control of a congressman (Pac-Man) who runs around Washington, DC, collecting dollar bills while avoiding FBI vans (the ghosts). By grabbing a large dollar sign (energizer), the player can &#x27;influence&#x27; the FBI vans into retreating.

<doc id="198134" wikidata="Q25557" url="?curid=198134" title="Gruiformes">
<text>The Gruiformes ( ) are an order containing a considerable number of living and extinct bird families, with a widespread geographical diversity. Gruiform means &quot;crane-like&quot;.

Traditionally, a number of wading and terrestrial bird families that did not seem to belong to any other order were classified together as Gruiformes. These include 15 species of large cranes, about 145 species of smaller crakes and rails, as well as a variety of families comprising one to three species, such as the Heliornithidae, the limpkin, or the Psophiidae.
Other birds have been placed in this order more out of necessity to place them &quot;somewhere&quot;; this has caused the expanded Gruiformes to lack distinctive apomorphies. Recent studies indicate that these &quot;odd Gruiformes&quot; are if at all only loosely related to the cranes, rails, and relatives (&quot;core Gruiformes&quot;).
==Systematics==
There are only two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds traditionally classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed &quot;core-Gruiformes&quot;. These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, to name just a few (see below). Though some of these are superficially &#x27;crane-like&#x27; and the possibility exists that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.

The traditional order Gruiformes was established by the influential German avian comparative anatomist Max Fürbringer (1888). Over the decades, many ornithologists suggested that members of the order were in fact more closely related to other groups (reviewed by Olson 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). For example, it was thought that sunbittern might be related to herons and that seriemas might be related to cuckoos. Olson and Steadman (1981) were first to correctly disband any of the traditional Gruiformes. They recognized that the Australian plains-wanderer (family Pedionomidae) was actually a member of the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) based on skeletal characters. This was confirmed by Sibley and Ahlquist (1990) based on DNA–DNA hybridization and subsequently by Paton et al. (2003), Paton and Baker (2006) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006). Sibley and Ahlquist furthermore removed button-quails (Turnicidae) from the Gruiformes based on large DNA–DNA hybridization distances to other supposed Gruiformes. However, it was not until the work of Paton et al. (2004) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006) that the correct placement of buttonquails within the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) was documented on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of multiple genetic loci. Using 12S ribosomal DNA sequences, Houde et al. (1997) were the first to present molecular genetic evidence of gruiform polyphyly, although apparently they were not convinced by it. However, on the basis of numerous additional sequence data, it has been shown decisively that the traditionally recognized Gruiformes consist of five to seven unrelated clades (Fain and Houde 2004, Ericson et al. 2006, Hackett et al. 2008).

Fain and Houde (2004) proposed that Neoaves are divisible into two clades, Metaves and Coronaves, although it has been suggested from the start that Metaves may be paraphyletic (Fain and Houde 2004, Ericson &quot;et al.&quot; 2006, Hackett &quot;et al.&quot; 2008). Sunbittern, kagu, and mesites all group within Metaves but all the other lineages of &quot;Gruiformes&quot; group either with a collection of waterbirds or landbirds within Coronaves. This division has been upheld by the combined analysis of as many as 30 independent loci (Ericson &quot;et al.&quot; 2006, Hackett &quot;et al.&quot; 2008), but is dependent on the inclusion of one or two specific loci in the analyses. One locus, i.e., mitochondrial DNA, contradicts the strict monophyly of Coronaves (Morgan-Richards &quot;et al.&quot; 2008), but phylogeny reconstruction based on mitochondrial DNA is complicated by the fact that few families have been studied, the sequences are heavily saturated (with back mutations) at deep levels of divergence, and they are plagued by strong base composition bias.

The kagu and sunbittern are one another&#x27;s closest relatives. It had been proposed (Cracraft 2001) that they and the recently extinct adzebills (family Aptornithidae) from New Zealand constitute a distinct Gondwanan lineage. However, sunbittern and kagu are believed to have diverged from one another long after the break-up of Gondwanaland and the adzebills are in fact members of the Grues (Houde &quot;et al.&quot; 1997, Houde 2009). The seriemas and bustards represent distinct lineages within neoavian waterbirds.

When considered to be monophyletic, it was assumed that Gruiformes was among the more ancient of avian lineages. The divergence of &quot;gruiforms&quot; among &quot;Metaves&quot; and &quot;Coronaves&quot; is proposed to be the first divergence among Neoaves, far predating the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event c. 66 mya (Houde 2009). No unequivocal basal gruiforms are known from the fossil record. However, there are several genera that are not unequivocally assignable to the known families and that may occupy a more basal position:
* &quot;Propelargus&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene of Quercy, France) – cariamid or idornithid
* &quot;Rupelrallus&quot; (Early Oligocene of Germany) – rallid? parvigruid?
* &quot;Badistornis&quot; (Brule Middle Oligocene of Shannon County, Missouri) – aramid?
* &quot;Probalearica&quot; (Late Oligocene? – Middle Pliocene of Florida, France?, Moldavia and Mongolia) – gruid? A &quot;nomen dubium&quot;?
* &quot;Gruiformes&quot; gen. et sp. indet. MNZ S42623 (Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand) – Aptornithidae?
* &quot;Aramornis&quot; (Sheep Creek Middle Miocene of Snake Creek Quarries, U.S.) – gruid? aramid?
* &quot;Euryonotus&quot; (Pleistocene of Argentina) – rallid?

Other even more enigmatic fossil birds and five living families are occasionally suggested to belong into this order, such as the proposed Late Cretaceous family Laornithidae and the following taxa:
* Family †Gastornithidae (diatrymas) (fossil)
* Family †Messelornithidae (Messel-birds)
* Family †Salmilidae (fossil) – distinct order (Cariamiformes)
* Family †Geranoididae (fossil) – distinct order (Cariamiformes); however, Mayr (2016) argued they might be members of Gruiformes, specifically stem group representatives of the Gruoidea.
* Family †Bathornithidae (fossil) – distinct order (Cariamiformes)
* Family †Idiornithidae (fossil) – distinct order (Cariamiformes)
* Family †Phorusrhacidae (terror birds) (fossil) – distinct order (Cariamiformes)
* Family Cariamidae (seriemas) – Neoavian landbirds – distinct order (Cariamiformes)
* Family Otididae (bustards) – Neoavian waterbirds – distinct order
* Family Eurypygidae (sunbittern) – prospective &quot;Metaves&quot; – new order Eurypygiformes together with kagu
* Family Rhynochetidae (kagu) – prospective &quot;Metaves&quot; – new order Eurypygiformes together with sunbittern
* Family Mesitornithidae (mesites, roatelos, monias) prospective &quot;Metaves&quot; – distinct order
*Family Turnicidae (buttonquails) moved to already existing order Charadriiformes together with plains wanderer
*Family Pedionomidae (plains wanderer) moved to already existing order Charadriiformes together with buttonquails
* &quot;Horezmavis&quot; (Bissekty Late Cretaceous of Kyzyl Kum, Uzbekistan)
* &quot;Telmatornis&quot; (Navesink Late Cretaceous?)
* &quot;Amitabha&quot; (Bridger middle Eocene of Forbidden City, Wyoming) – rallid?
* &quot;Eobalearica&quot; (Ferghana Late? Eocene of Ferghana, Uzbekistan) – gruid?
* &quot;&quot;Phasianus&quot; alfhildae&quot; (Washakie B Late Eocene of Haystack Butte, U.S.)
* &quot;Talantatos&quot; (Late Eocene of Paris Bain, France)
* &quot;Telecrex&quot; (Irdin Manha Late Eocene of Chimney Butte, China) – rallid?
* Neornithes incerta sedis (Late Paleocene/Early Eocene of Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco)
* &quot;Aminornis&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene of Rio Deseado, Argentina) – aramid?
* &quot;Loncornis&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene of Rio Deseado, Argentina) – aramid?
* &quot;Riacama&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene of Argentina)
* &quot;Smiliornis&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene of Argentina)
* &quot;Pseudolarus&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene – Miocene of Argentina) – gruiform?
* &quot;Gnotornis&quot; (Brule Late Oligocene of Shannon County, Missouri) – aramid?
* &quot;Anisolornis&quot; (Santa Cruz Middle Miocene of Karaihen, Argentina) – aramid?
* &quot;Occitaniavis&quot; – cariamid or idiornithid, includes &quot;Geranopsis elatus&quot;

<text>Casey Station, commonly called Casey, is one of three permanent stations and research outposts in Antarctica managed by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). Casey lies on the northern side of the Bailey Peninsula overlooking Vincennes Bay on the Budd Coast of Wilkes Land in the Australian Antarctic Territory, a territory claimed by Australia. Casey is due south of Perth, Western Australia.

Casey was named in honour of Richard, Baron Casey.

== History ==
Casey is close to the now-abandoned Wilkes Station, established by the United States of America to support science and exploration of Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957–1958.

Australia took Wilkes over after the IGY, but the American buildings were already unusable due to the build-up of ice around them. Australia built the first Casey Base, originally as &quot;Repstat&quot;, referring to &quot;replacement station&quot;, on the opposite south side of the Newcomb Bay in 1964, with works completed in February 1969. This set of buildings was a unique attempt to prevent the problem of ice build-up by elevating the buildings on stilts, to encourage the wind to blow beneath as well as above, and connecting the entire line of buildings with a corrugated iron tunnel. This would, it was hoped, clear the buildup of snow each year, while allowing personnel to move between buildings without having to brave the elements. It worked for some time until corrosion occurred.

The current Casey Station headquarters (the &quot;Red Shed&quot;) was built in the late 1980s as part of the Australian Government&#x27;s Antarctic Re-building Program. It was prefabricated in Hobart, Tasmania, by Hobart construction firm Contas Pty Ltd; trial-erected on the wharf at Hobart; then dismantled, packaged and shipped to Antarctica. Erected at Casey by tradespeople employed as workers on the normal summer expedition crews, it incorporates innovative design features to prevent the transfer of heat through the structure. The &quot;Shed&quot; is conspicuously located near the top of the hill on which the old radio masts stood. It is probably the largest single structure on Antarctica and was first occupied in 1988. The station has two other sheds, the green shed for storing food and the yellow shed for brewing. Homebrew beer is served at the station&#x27;s bar, &quot;Splinters&quot;. While the old transmitter hut of the original Wilkes Station, nicknamed the &quot;Wilkes Hilton&quot;, is now used as temporary accommodation for Casey personnel.

==Current research==
Since 2008, scientists based at Casey have contributed to research into study of the Law Dome, the bedrock geology and structure of the East Antarctic ice sheet and its glaciological processes. In more recent years, Casey has served as a base for marine biologists to examine changes to polar seafloor communities exposed to different carbon dioxide concentrations. Adélie penguin research is conducted at Casey. Scientists are also studying the influence of climate change and human impact on extensive and well developed moss beds that grow at and near Casey.

==Infrastructure==
Casey is from Hobart, the AAD&#x27;s main supply hub for Antarctic operations, and from Fremantle.

===Access methods===
Access to Casey is possible via a four-hour flight from Hobart, followed by a four-hour ride in an over-snow bus.

===Road===
The old and new stations are connected by a road. The road is excavated by a bulldozer/excavator set at the end of every winter, providing a means to get supplies from the wharf to the new station, leaving ice walls tall in places.

===Earth stations===

Casey has a dome-covered satellite tracking antenna. The antenna was upgraded in March 2016 to communicate with a Himawari-8 satellite, allowing the station to monitor and track weather related information. There is also an ANARESAT satellite for communication.

===Airstrips===
Casey is significant as a transport hub for the Australian Antarctic program, with the introduction of intercontinental jet flights for scientists and operational staff from Hobart to the Wilkins ice runway, inland from Casey station. The inaugural landing of the AAD&#x27;s Airbus A319 aircraft was on the evening of 9 December 2007.

The smaller Casey Station Skiway () is located east of the station, and opened on 30 December 2004.

In March 2009, the Australian ABC &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; international affairs television program featured air operations at Casey Station as part of a report titled &quot;Antarctica - What Lies Beneath&quot;.

<text>The Bethlehem Steel Corporation was an American steelmaking company headquartered in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Until its closure in 2003, it was one of the world&#x27;s largest steel-producing and shipbuilding companies. At the height of its success and productivity, the company was a symbol of American manufacturing leadership in the world, and its decline and ultimate liquidation in the late 20th century is similarly cited as an example of America&#x27;s diminished manufacturing leadership. From its founding in 1857 through its 2003 dissolution, Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s headquarters were based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. Its primary steel mill manufacturing facilities were located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and were later expanded to include a major research laboratory in Bethlehem, and various additional manufacturing plants in Sparrows Point, Maryland; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Lackawanna, New York; and Burns Harbor, Indiana.

The company&#x27;s steel was used in the construction of many of the nation&#x27;s largest and most famed structures. Among major buildings, Bethlehem produced steel for 28 Liberty Street, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Rockefeller Center, and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City and Merchandise Mart in Chicago. Among major bridges, Bethlehem&#x27;s steel was used in constructing the George Washington Bridge and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and the Peace Bridge between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario.

Bethlehem Steel played an instrumental role in manufacturing the U.S. warships and other military weapons used in World War I and later by Allied forces in ultimately winning World War II. Over 1,100 Bethlehem Steel-manufactured warships were built for use in defeating Nazi Germany and the Axis powers in World War II. Historians cite Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s ability to quickly manufacture warships and other military equipment as decisive factors in American victories in both world wars.

Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s roots trace to an iron-making company organized in 1857 in Bethlehem, later named the Bethlehem Iron Company. In 1899, the owners of the iron company founded Bethlehem Steel Company and, five years later, Bethlehem Steel Corporation was created to be the steelmaking company&#x27;s corporate parent.

Bethlehem Steel survived the earliest declines in the American steel industry beginning in the 1970s. In 1982, however, the company suspended most of its steelmaking operations after posting a loss of $1.5 billion, attributable to increased foreign competition, rising labor and pensions costs, and other factors. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2001, and was dissolved in 2003 after its remaining assets were sold to International Steel Group.

==History==
===19th century===

In 1857, what ultimately became Bethlehem Steel was launched as the Saucona Iron Company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, by Augustus Wolle. That same year, the Panic of 1857, a national financial crisis, halted the company&#x27;s further organization. But the organization subsequently restarted, its site was moved elsewhere to South Bethlehem, and the company&#x27;s name was changed to the Bethlehem Rolling Mill and Iron Company. On June 14, 1860, the board of directors of the fledgling company elected Alfred Hunt president.

On May 1, 1861, the company&#x27;s name was changed to the Bethlehem Iron Company. Construction of the first blast furnace began on July 1, 1861, and was operationalized on January 4, 1863. The first rolling mill was built between the spring of 1861 and the summer of 1863 with the first railroad rails being rolled on September 26, 1863. A machine shop, in 1865, and another blast furnace, in 1867, were completed. During its early years, the company produced rails for the rapidly expanding railroads and armor plating used by the U.S. Navy.

The company continued to prosper during the early 1880s, but its share of the rail market began to decline in the face of competition from growing Pittsburgh and Scranton-based firms, such as the Carnegie Steel Company and Lackawanna Steel. The nation&#x27;s decision to rebuild the Navy with steam-driven, steel-hulled warships reshaped Bethlehem Iron Company&#x27;s destiny.

Following the American Civil War, the U.S. Navy quickly downsized after the end of hostilities, and national focus was redirected toward settling the West and rebuilding the war-ravaged South. Almost no new ordnance was produced, and new technology was neglected. By 1881, international incidents highlighted the poor condition of the U.S. fleet and the need to rebuild it to protect U.S. military capabilities, trade, and prestige.

In 1883, then U.S. Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler and U.S. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln appointed Lt. William Jaques to the Gun Foundry Board, and Jaques was sent on several fact-finding tours of European armament makers. On one of these trips, he formed business ties with the firm of Joseph Whitworth in Manchester, England. He returned to the U.S. as Whitworth&#x27;s agent and, in 1885, was granted an extended furlough to pursue this personal interest.

Jaques was aware that the U.S. Navy would soon solicit bids for the production of heavy guns and other products such as armor that would be needed to further expand the fleet, and he contacted the Bethlehem Iron Company with a proposal to serve as an intermediary between it and the Whitworth Company, so Bethlehem Iron could erect a heavy forging plant to produce ordnance.

In 1885, John F. Fritz, sometimes referred to as the father of the U.S. steel industry, accompanied Bethlehem Iron directors Robert H. Sayre, Elisha Packer Wilbur, president of Lehigh Valley Railroad, William Thurston, and Joseph Wharton, founder of the Wharton School, to meet with Jaques in Philadelphia. In early 1886, Bethlehem Iron and the Whitworth Company executed a contract.

In the spring 1886, Congress passed a naval appropriations bill that authorized the construction of two armored second-class battleships, one protected cruiser, one first-class torpedo boat, and the complete rebuilding and modernization of two Civil War-era monitors. The two second-class battleships, the and the , both had large-caliber guns with 12-inch and 10-inch, respectively, and heavy armor plating. Bethlehem secured both the forging and armor contracts on June 28, 1887.

Between 1888 and 1892, the Bethlehem Iron Company completed the first U.S. heavy-forging plant, which was designed by John Fritz with assistance from Russell Davenport, who joined Bethlehem Iron in 1888. By fall 1890, Bethlehem Iron was delivering gun forging to the U.S. Navy and was completing facilities to provide armor plating.

During the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, Bethlehem Steel provided the iron used in the creation of a 45.5-foot steel axle to support the world&#x27;s first Ferris wheel, a structure. The iron was manufactured in Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s blast furnaces and represented the largest single steel forging ever constructed at the time.

In 1898, Frederick Winslow Taylor joined Bethlehem Steel as a management consultant charged with solving the company&#x27;s expensive machine shop capacity challenge. Taylor and Maunsel White and a team of assistants applied a series of management principles established by Taylor, later known as scientific management, which were used in increasing mass production.

The Bethlehem Iron Company was very successful and profitable, and the company&#x27;s corporate management believed that it could be even more profitable. To accomplish this, the corporate ownership of the Bethlehem Iron Company switched to steel production, and the company&#x27;s name was formally changed to Bethlehem Steel Company.

====Bethlehem Steel Company====
In 1899, Bethlehem Steel Company was established. Bethlehem Steel Company, also then known as Bethlehem Steel Works, was incorporated to take over all liabilities of the Bethlehem Iron Company. Bethlehem Iron Company and the Bethlehem Steel Company operated as separate companies under the same ownership. Bethlehem Steel Company leased the properties, which were owned by the Bethlehem Iron Company.

===20th century===



In 1901, Charles M. Schwab (no relation to the stockbroker Charles R. Schwab), purchased Bethlehem Steel Company, and named Samuel Broadbent as its vice president. During this time, the company&#x27;s lease with the Bethlehem Iron Company came to an end as the Bethlehem Steel Company gained control of all properties from the Bethlehem Iron Company and Bethlehem Iron Company ceased operations.

Schwab transferred his ownership of Bethlehem Steel Company to U.S. Steel Corporation, the company where he previously served as president. Schwab then repurchased Bethlehem Steel Company, and sold it to United States Shipbuilding Company, which owned Bethlehem Steel Company only briefly. The United States Shipbuilding Company was in turmoil; its subsidiaries, including Bethlehem Steel Company, contributed to United States Shipbuilding Company&#x27;s problems. Schwab again became involved with Bethlehem Steel Company through the parent company, United States Shipbuilding Company.

In 1903, United States Shipbuilding Company planned to reorganize as Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company, which was the second company to use the name Bethlehem Steel. However, United States Shipbuilding Company was not reorganized as Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company; instead, a plan was drawn up for a new company to be formed to replace United States Shipbuilding Company. The new company was initially to be named Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company. In 1904, it instead assumed the name Bethlehem Steel Corporation. From 1906 until it was delisted in 2002, Bethlehem Steel was traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BS.

Bethlehem Steel Corporation was formed by Schwab, who had recently resigned from U.S. Steel, and by Joseph Wharton, who founded Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Schwab became the company&#x27;s first president and first chairman of its board of directors.

After its formation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation purchased Bethlehem Steel Company and its remaining subsidiaries from United States Shipbuilding Company. Bethlehem Steel Company became a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, though the Bethlehem Steel Company also had subsidiaries of its own. Bethlehem Steel Corporation became the second-largest steel provider in the nation. Both Bethlehem Steel Company and Bethlehem Steel Corporation existed simultaneously after 1904 until the 1960s, when the two companies merged into Bethlehem Steel Corporation.

Bethlehem Steel Corporation installed the Gray rolling mill and produced the nation&#x27;s first wide-flange structural shapes, which proved partly responsible for ushering in the age of the skyscraper and establishing Bethlehem Steel as the leading supplier of steel to the construction industry.

In the early 1900s, Samuel Broadbent led an initiative to diversify the company. The corporation diversified beyond steel, managing iron mines in Cuba and shipyards around the U.S. In 1913, under Broadbent, Bethlehem Steel acquired Fort River Shipyard}Fort River Shipbuilding Company, a Quincy, Massachusetts-based company, and became one of the world&#x27;s major shipbuilders. In 1917, it incorporated its shipbuilding division as Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation Ltd. In 1922, Bethlehem Steel purchased the Lackawanna Steel Company, which included Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and extensive coal holdings.

During World War I and World War II, Bethlehem Steel was a major supplier of armor plate and ordinance to the U.S. armed forces, including armor plate and large-caliber guns used by the U.S. Navy, which proved influential to U.S. victories in both wars. Bethlehem Steel &quot;was the most important to America&#x27;s national defense of any company in the past century. We wouldn&#x27;t have won World War I and World War II without it&quot;, historian Lance Metz told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2003.

In the 1930s, the company manufactured the steel sections and the parts of the Golden Gate Bridge and built for Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, a new oil refinery in La Plata, Argentina, which was the tenth-largest in the world. During World War II, as much as 70 percent of airplane cylinder forgings, a quarter of the armor plate for warships, and a third of the big cannon forgings for the U.S armed forces were manufactured by Bethlehem Steel.

Steel is an alloy made up of iron and carbon, and additional minerals are sometimes added to it depending on its intended use. In the 20th century, however, sourcing necessary minerals in the U.S. began proving significantly more expensive than obtaining from other nations. Bethlehem Steel is one of several U.S. companies that chose to source iron from Latin America. The company established a presence in Latin America for roughly a century from the 1880s to 1980s. The company profited greatly from U.S. economic control over the region. &quot;In a single year, 1960, U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel realized a greater than 30 percent profit on their Venezuelan iron investment, and this profit equaled all the taxes paid to the Venezuelan state in the decade since 1950&quot;

Bethlehem Steel also relied on Latin American mines for manganese, an additive for tensile strength. During President Eurico Dutra&#x27;s presidency in Brazil from 1946 to 1951, Bethlehem Steel received 40 million ton of manganese “for 4 percent of the income of exporting it.” 

====World War II====

Bethlehem Steel ranked seventh among all U.S. corporations in the value of its wartime production contracts during World War II. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s 15 shipyards produced a total of 1,121 ships, more than any other builder during World War II, and nearly one-fifth of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s two-ocean fleet. Its shipbuilding operations employed as many as 180,000 persons, representing the lion&#x27;s share of the company&#x27;s total employment of 300,000 at the time.

From 1916 to 1945, Eugene Grace served as president of Bethlehem Steel, and chairman of the board from 1945 until his retirement in 1957. Grace orchestrated Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s World War II wartime efforts. In 1943, Grace promised U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt that Bethlehem Steel would manufacture one ship per day, and he ultimately exceeded that commitment by 15 ships.

World War II, however, drained Bethlehem Steel of much of its male workforce. With many of its male employees deployed to the war front, the company hired female employees to guard and work on the company&#x27;s factory floor and in its company offices. After World War II, female workers were promptly fired in favor of male counterparts.

On Liberty Fleet Day, September 27, 1941, then U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was present at the launching of the first Liberty ship SS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; at Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard in Baltimore. Also launched the same day were the Liberty SS &quot;James McKay&quot; at Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard in Sparrows Point, Maryland, and the emergency vessel SS &quot;Sinclair Superflame&quot; at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts.

In 1946, Bethlehem Steel signed a contract with mining company LKAB, committing the company to contribute to the recovery of the post-World War II recovery of the iron ore industry in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden.

Following the end of World War II, Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s plant continued to supply a wide variety of structural shapes for construction trades. Galvanized sheet steel under the name BETHCON was widely produced for use as duct work or spiral conduit.

The company also produced forged products for defense, power generation, and steel-producing companies.

From 1949 to 1952, Bethlehem Steel had a contract with the U.S. federal government to roll uranium fuel rods for nuclear reactors in Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s Lackawanna, New York plant. Workers were not aware of the dangers of the hazardous substance and were not given protective equipment. Some workers later sought compensation under a radiation exposure law, which was enacted in 2000 and required the U.S. Labor Department to compensate workers up to $150,000 if they developed cancer later in life, provided their work history involved enough radiation exposure to significantly increase their cancer risk. Bethlehem Steel workers, however, have not been awarded this compensation because radiation doses involved in processing fresh uranium fuel is low and produces a small risk relative to baseline risks. The larger danger in processing uranium is chemical poisoning from the heavy metal, which does not produce cancer.

The steel industry in the U.S. prospered during and after World War II, while the steel industries in Germany and Japan were in ruins, devastated by allied bombardments. Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s success reached its peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The company began manufacturing 23 million tons of steel annually. In 1958, the company&#x27;s president, Arthur B. Homer, was the nation&#x27;s highest-paid business executive, and the firm built the first phase of what became its largest plant, Burns Harbor, between 1962 and 1964 in Burns Harbor, Indiana. 

In 1967, the company lost its bid to provide steel for the original World Trade Center. The contracts, a single one of which was for 50,000 tons of steel, went to competitors in Seattle, St. Louis, New York, and Illinois.

U.S. global leadership in steel manufacturing lasted about two decades, during which U.S. steel industry operated with little foreign competition. Eventually, however, foreign firms were rebuilt with modern techniques, including continuous casting, while profitable U.S. companies resisted modernization. Bethlehem Steel experimented with continuous casting but never fully adopted the practice.

Meanwhile, as the age of Bethlehem Steel workers was increasing, the ratio of retirees to workers was rising, meaning that the value created by each worker had to cover a greater portion of pension costs than before. Former top manager Eugene Grace failed to adequately invest in the company&#x27;s pension plans during the 1950s. At its peak, the company&#x27;s pension contributions that should have been made were not. As a result, the company encountered difficulty when it faced rising pension costs associated with its retiring workers, which were amplified by the company&#x27;s diminishing profits and increased global competition.

By the 1970s, imported foreign steel was proving cheaper than domestically produced steel, and Bethlehem Steel faced growing competition from mini-mills and smaller-scale operations that could sell steel at lower prices.

In 1982, Bethlehem Steel reported an unexpected loss of US$1.5 billion, and responded by promptly shutting down much of its operations. The company returned to profitability briefly six years later, in 1988, but restructuring and shutdowns continued through the 1990s. In the mid-1980s, demand for the plant&#x27;s structural products began diminishing, and new competition entered the marketplace. Lighter construction styles, featuring lower-height construction styles, such as low-rise buildings, did not require the heavy structural grades of steel that were being produced at the Bethlehem plant.

In 1991, Bethlehem Steel Corporation discontinued coal mining, which the company had been conducting under the name BethEnergy. In 1992, the Johnstown plants of the Bethlehem Steel, which were founded in 1852 by The Cambria Iron Company of Johnstown and were purchased by Bethlehem Steel in 1923, were forced into closure. In 1993, the company also exited the railroad car business. 

By the end of 1995, Bethlehem Steel ceased manufacturing steel at its main Bethlehem plant, bringing an end to 140 years of such production in Bethlehem, and the company ceased operations in Bethlehem. Two years later, in 1997, Bethlehem Steel Corporation ceased shipbuilding activities in an attempt to preserve its steel manufacturing operations. 

In 1998, after denying pension benefits, a lawsuit was filed in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The case, Lawrence Hollyfield, Fiduciary to the Estate of Collins Hollyfield v. Pension Plan of Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Subsidiary Companies, was settled in favor of Hollyfield three years later, in 2001. The settlement led to a class action lawsuit filed by Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s workers union, which led to PBGC assuming all Bethlehem Steel pension obligations, representing the largest pension such liability assumption in U.S. history.

===21st century===
In 2001, Bethlehem Steel filed for bankruptcy. Two years later, in 2003, the company was dissolved.

===21st century===
In 2001, Bethlehem Steel filed for bankruptcy, becoming the 25th American steelmaking company in the span of four years between 1998 and 2001 to file for bankruptcy protection. In 2003, the company was dissolved with its remaining assets, including six plants, acquired by the International Steel Group. International Steel Group, in turn, was acquired by Mittal Steel in 2005, which then merged with Arcelor to become ArcelorMittal in 2006.

Despite closing its local operations, Bethlehem Steel tried to reduce the significant economic and social impact on Bethlehem and the Lehigh Valley area, announcing plans to revitalize the south side of Bethlehem where its headquarters and primary plant had existed since the mid-19th century. The company hired consultants to develop conceptual plans on the reuse of the massive property, and a consensus emerged to rename the site Bethlehem Works and to use the land for cultural, recreational, educational, entertainment, and retail development. The National Museum of Industrial History, in association with the Smithsonian Institution and the Bethlehem Commerce Center, consisting of of prime industrial property in Bethlehem would be erected on the site along with a casino and a large retail and entertainment complex.

In 2007, the Bethlehem Steel property was sold to Sands BethWorks, which planned to build a casino where the plant once stood. Construction began in fall 2007, and the casino was completed in 2009. Due to a global steel shortage at the time, the casino had difficulty finding the 16,000 tons of structural steel needed for construction of the $600 million casino complex.

The site of the company&#x27;s original plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania is home to SteelStacks, an arts and entertainment district. The plant&#x27;s rusted five blast furnaces were left standing and serve as a backdrop for the new campus. SteelStacks currently features the ArtsQuest Center, a contemporary performing arts center, the Wind Creek Bethlehem casino resort, formerly Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, a gambling emporium, and new studios for WLVT-TV, the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s PBS affiliate. The area includes three outdoor music venues: Levitt Pavilion is a free music venue featuring lawn seating for up to 2,500 people, Air Products Town Square at Steelstacks, and PNC Plaza, which hosts outdoor concerts. Levitt Pavilion and the casino resort are connected via the Hoover-Mason Trestle linear park.

On November 9, 2016, a warehouse being used as a recycling facility that was part of the Bethlehem Steel complex in Lackawanna, New York caught fire and burned down.

On May 19, 2019, Martin Tower, Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s former corporate headquarters building in West Bethlehem, was demolished.

Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s corporate records are housed at the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware, and at the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem.

== Shipyards ==

Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation was created in 1905, when Bethlehem Steel acquired the San Francisco-based shipyard Union Iron Works. In 1917, it was incorporated as &#x27;Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Limited.

==Electric multiple units==
In 1931 and 1932, Bethlehem Steel manufactured 38 electric multiple unit carriages for the Philadelphia-based Reading Company, then one of the nation&#x27;s largest and most profitable commercial railroads.

==Freight cars==
From 1923 to 1991, Bethlehem Steel was one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of railroad freight cars following their purchase of Midvale Steel, whose railcar division was located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Bethlehem Steel Freight Car Division pioneered the use of aluminum in freight car construction. The Johnstown plant was purchased from Bethlehem Steel through a management buyout in 1991, creating Johnstown America Industries.

<text>Davis Station, commonly called Davis, is one of three permanent bases and research outposts in Antarctica managed by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). Davis is situated on the coast of Cooperation Sea in Princess Elizabeth Land, Ingrid Christensen Coast in the Australian Antarctic Territory, a territory claimed by Australia. Davis lies in an Antarctic oasis, a mostly ice-free area known as the Vestfold Hills.

Davis was named in honour of Captain John King Davis.

Davis was listed on the Register of the National Estate on 26 October 1999 and has been included on the Commonwealth Heritage List as an indicative place, due to the condition of buildings and structures that varies from no longer exists/demolished due to poor condition, through to very good condition.

==Purpose==
Davis is a base for scientific research programs including the study of viruses and bacteria using molecular genetic techniques in glacial lakes, the impact of environmental change and pollution on Antarctic marine ecosystems, atmospheric research, measuring algae growth as an important food source for tiny marine herbivores such as zooplankton, the impact of climate change, including the increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on marine microbes and, together with researchers at Casey, the study of the Law Dome, the bedrock geology and structure of the East Antarctic ice sheet.

==History==
The first recorded sighting of the coastline now occupied by Davis Station was on 9 February 1931, during the second British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) voyage aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;. Sir Douglas Mawson and Flight Lieutenant Stuart Campbell sighted the Antarctic continent from a seaplane and named the high land to the southeast Princess Elizabeth Land.

The first recorded landing in the region was made in 1935 by the Norwegian whaler Captain Klarius Mikkelsen in the vessel &quot;Thorshavn&quot;. Mikkelsen named the hills after the Vestfold province of Norway, on the western side of Oslo Fjord, which he considered it resembled, and where the Christensen company&#x27;s headquarters was located, at the town of Sandefjord.

On 20 February 1935, together with his wife and seven crew members (including the ship&#x27;s dentist, Lief Sørsdal), Mikkelsen landed in a small bay on an unnamed island at the northern end of the Vestfold Hills. Mrs Caroline Mikkelsen was the first woman to set foot on the Antarctic continent and the party raised the Norwegian flag on an improvised flagpole and built a rock cairn to mark the site. This cairn was found by members of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) in 1960 but was lost for many years until its rediscovery in 1995. (As an interesting aside, Caroline Mikkelsen was still living and received word of the rediscovery of the original flagpole.) Captain Mikkelsen named the area &quot;Ingrid Christensen Land&quot; after the wife of the ship&#x27;s owner, Lars Christensen. Mrs Christensen was later to land in Antarctica herself - on 30 January 1937, at Scullin Monolith (which the Norwegians called Klarius Mikkelsen Mountain).

The &quot;Thorshavn&quot; and Klarius Mikkelsen, along with Lars Christensen, were back in the Vestfold Hills area in the 1936–37 summer. An area to the immediate north of the Vestfold Hills was used as a take-off and landing area for a seaplane, from which oblique aerial photos were taken for mapping purposes. The first map of the Vestfold Hills, derived from this imagery, was published after World War II.

The next recorded visitors to the area were the American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth and his Australian aircraft pilot and observer Sir Hubert Wilkins, in Ellsworth&#x27;s ship &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. Despite Wilkins&#x27; protestations that Mawson had already claimed the area for Australia, Ellsworth planned to lodge a counter claim for America. In response to this, Wilkins took pre-emptive action and made two landings. The first was on one of the Rauer Islands, at 68° 46&#x27; South, 77° 50&#x27; East on 8 January 1939, and the second on a rocky outcrop at 68° 22&#x27; South 70° 33&#x27; East on 11 January 1939. At both of these locations he deposited decrees recognising Australia&#x27;s right to &quot;. . . administrate . . . those parts of His Majesty&#x27;s dominions in the Antarctic Seas&quot;. Along with the decree he left a copy of the famous Australian geographical magazine &quot;&#x27;Walkabout&quot;&quot;. Of three such sites, only the northern cairn has been located and hence the name &quot;Walkabout Rocks&quot;.

During the U.S. Antarctic explorations that formed a part of &quot;Operation Highjump&quot; in 1947, USS &quot;Currituck&quot; visited the area, but no landing took place. As part of Operation Highjump, the Vestfolds and surrounding area were extensively photographed from the air.

The first ANARE landing in the Vestfold Hills was made on 3 March 1954 by Phillip Law, Peter Shaw, John Hansen, Arthur Gwynn and R. Thompson. They raised the Australian flag at Law Cairn, to the north of Davis Station, but had to return to their ship soon after due to deteriorating weather.

On 12 January 1956, members of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition landed on the Ingrid Christensen Coast, in preparation for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). The Soviets did not stay for long but even today the Russian presence is betrayed by some distinctively Russian names on the map (Lakes Lebed, Zvezda and Druzhby among them) They later established their base at Mirny Station, some to the east of Davis.

As Phillip Law recalled during a short visit to Davis on 11 January 1998, it was felt that if Australia did not establish a base in the Vestfold Hills the Russians would, and so in 1955 the Australian Government announced that a new station would be established in the Vestfold Hills.

A further exploratory visit was made by ANARE in January 1955 that involved two teams traversing much of the Vestfold Hills. During January 1957, an ANARE party led by Dr Phillip Law sailing on the &quot;Kista Dan&quot; attempted to locate a suitable site for the station. This proved difficult due to a lack of good ship anchorages and a scarcity of fresh water sources. On 12 January, after two days of attempting to find a suitable site, a last-minute decision was made to locate the station on a small rocky plateau located above a black sandy beach. Unloading began immediately and, on 13 January 1957, a small ceremony was held to officially open the new station. It was named Davis &quot;to honour Captain John King Davis, a famous Antarctic navigator and captain . . . at present . . . living in Melbourne, a member of the ANARE Planning Committee&quot;. (Law&#x27;s address on the day). After the ceremony, unloading recommenced and continued until 20 January when &quot;Kista Dan&quot; sailed. &quot;Kista Dan&quot; made a return visit to Davis later dropping off dogs and one more expeditioner.

Bob Dingle, Alan Hawker, Nils Lied, Bill Lucas and Bruce Stinear made up the first party to winter in the Vestfold Hills. The party was not completely isolated however as Auster aircraft flew between Mawson Station and Davis several times that year exchanging personnel and supplies.

Davis was temporarily closed on 25 January 1965 to make resources available for the rebuilding of Casey Station. It was reopened on 15 February 1969 and has been continuously occupied since that time. The original small huts (&quot;dongas&quot;) fell into disuse and disrepair from the late 1970s / early 1980s, with a major rebuilding program.

Davis has become the busiest of Australia&#x27;s Antarctic stations supporting a wide variety of scientific research in both the local and surrounding areas during the summertime. During the wintertime, the principal research activity is Upper Atmospheric Physics.

==Logistics==
Davis is from Hobart, the AAD&#x27;s main supply hub for Antarctic operations, and from Fremantle.

===Air transport===
In early summer when sea ice conditions are most favourable, a ski landing area (SLA) is constructed adjacent to Davis. As sea ice conditions progressively worsen over summer, operations are moved first to the Plough Island SLA, 6 km north of Davis, and in late summer to Whoop Whoop, a field camp 40 km east of Davis on the inland ice plateau, called the Davis Plateau ice SLA. The SLA requires frequent maintenance by snow grooming, and as it is not accessible by ground vehicles, passengers and cargo are transported on to Davis by helicopter.

==Earth station==
Davis is the first Antarctic Earth stations in Australia, with the first satellite tracking antenna ANARESAT for communications installed in March 1987. There is also a Bureau of Meteorology satellite tracking station for a weather satellite, Himawari-8 located there.

After numerous upgrades since installation, the ANARESAT facility is able to provide the station with a 9 Mbps link back to the mainland. This allows for the real time transfer of scientific data as well as support for telemedicine and video calls for expeditioners.

==Climate==
Davis Station experiences an tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;); the temperature is moderated by its proximity to the Southern Ocean.

<doc id="198139" wikidata="Q1434388" url="?curid=198139" title="Mawson Station">
<text>Mawson Station, commonly called Mawson, is one of three permanent bases and research outposts in Antarctica managed by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). Mawson lies in Holme Bay in Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica in the Australian Antarctic Territory, a territory claimed by Australia. Established in 1954, Mawson is Australia&#x27;s oldest Antarctic station and the oldest continuously inhabited Antarctic station south of the Antarctic Circle. It houses approximately 20 personnel over winter and up to 53 in summer. 

Mawson was named in honour of the Australian Antarctic explorer Sir Douglas Mawson.

Mawson was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 2001 and listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004, reflecting the post-World War Two revival of Australia&#x27;s scientific research and territorial interests in Antarctica.

==Purpose==
Mawson Station is an active base for scientific research programs including an underground cosmic ray detector, various long-term meteorological aeronomy and geomagnetic studies, as well as ongoing conservation biology studies, in particular of nearby Auster rookery, a breeding ground for emperor penguins and Adélie penguins.

==History==
In 1946, the Minister for External Affairs, H.V. Evatt indicated his support for a proposal by Douglas Mawson for the establishment of a permanent Australian base in Antarctica. It was another seven years before a suitable ship, the &quot;Kista Dan&quot; could be chartered to set up facilities on the southern continent.

The station site was chosen in 1953 by Phillip Law, the first director of the AAD, who drew aerial photographs taken during the U.S. Operation Highjump (OpHjp) of 1946-1947 to select the site for its large natural harbour (Horseshoe Harbour) and permanently exposed rock for building. The station was built during 1954. Some of the small pre-fabricated huts used in the first years remain on the station, but these are overshadowed by large steel-framed modular buildings dating from a major rebuilding program that started in the late 1970s.

By 1959, the facilities at Mawson Station had expanded significantly. Personnel at that time included 6 scientists, 4 technicians, 2 pilots, 2 weather observers, and 10 others. Scientific disciplines represented included cartography, geology and geomagnetism, glaciology, seismology, ionospheric and auroral physics, meteorology, and physiology. Vehicles included 2 de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver aircraft, 3 Caterpillar D4 tractors, 1 TEA-20 Ferguson, and 1 Sno-Cat.

==Geography==
Mawson Station is located at Holme Bay in Mac Robertson Land, East Antarctica, named in January 1930 by Sir Douglas Mawson during the first British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) voyage, aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;. It is in a region which Mawson proclaimed as British territory on several occasions in 1930 and 1931 (including at Proclamation Island, Scullin Monolith and Cape Bruce), and later became Australian Antarctic Territory.

Some notable geographic features in the region include the Framnes Mountains, which form the dramatic backdrop to Mawson Station. The Framnes Mountains were named in the 1930s by Norwegian explorers financed by the shipowner and whaling magnate Lars Christensen.

==Climate==
Mawson Station experiences a Polar climate:
==Research==
During March and April 1960, an ANARE survey party from Mawson Station carried out a barometric mapping control traverse along the route of a dog sledge journey from Cape Batterbee through the Napier Mountains to Martin Island in Edward VIII Bay. The members of this survey party — led by Syd Kirkby — were the first people to set foot in the Napier Mountains. The highest peak of this small range — Mount Elkins — was identified and named at this time for Terence James Elkins. Many other terrain features were mapped, visited or named as a result of this expedition, including Armstrong Peak, Bird Ridge, Mount Griffiths, Newman Nunataks, Wilkinson Peaks, and the Young Nunataks. 

In 2018, astronaut and academic Jay C. Buckey conducted research using virtual reality, at the Australian Antarctic Division’s Mawson Station, wherein the expeditioners used VR headsets to view Australian beach scenes, European nature scenes, and North American nature scenes of forests and urban environments, which were different from the isolation of the whiteness and silence of Antarctica. The research will inform psychological techniques to support long-duration spaceflight such as for astronauts going to Mars.

==Logistics==
Mawson is from Hobart, the AAD&#x27;s main supply hub for Antarctic operations, and from Fremantle.

===Communications===
Mawson&#x27;s infrastructure includes an ANARESAT satellite antenna Earth station for communication.

In early summer when sea ice conditions are most favourable, a ski landing area (SLA) is constructed adjacent to Mawson. As sea ice conditions progressively worsen over summer, operations are moved to Rumdoodle SLA, a field camp on the inland ice plateau 10 km from Mawson. 

Rumdoodle SLA has been in use since the 1950s, and the glacier surface requires annual inspection and preparation prior to use. It is accessible from Mawson by Hägglunds ground vehicles.

===Sea transport===
Mawson Station is accessible by sea for only a short period each austral summer, between February and March.
It has a deep, sheltered natural harbour and is ice-free in February. A direct voyage from Hobart to Mawson takes about 10—12 days, due to variable weather and sea-ice conditions. The approach to Horseshoe Harbour is through the Mawson Corridor and the Entrance Shoal.

Between 1953 and 1987, Mawson was supplied by the ice-strengthened polar research vessels, including &quot;Kista Dan&quot;, &quot;Magga Dan&quot;, &quot;Thala Dan&quot;, and &quot;Nella Dan&quot;. This period came to an end when &quot;Nella Dan&quot; ran aground and sank at Macquarie Island on 3 December 1987.

===Wind power===
Mawson is the only Antarctic station to use wind generators designed to take advantage of the fierce katabatic winds. Two 300 kW wind turbines were installed in 2003, but one failed in 2017.

<text>Saint David&#x27;s Day ( or ), or the Feast of Saint David, is the feast day of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales, and falls on 1 March, the date of Saint David&#x27;s death in 589 AD.

Traditional festivities include wearing daffodils and leeks, recognised symbols of Wales and Saint David, respectively, eating traditional Welsh food including cawl, and women wearing traditional Welsh dress. An increasing number of cities and towns across Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, and Aberystwyth also put on parades throughout the day. 

The day is not a public holiday in Wales, which has prompted calls for a St David&#x27;s Day to be a bank holiday in Wales and some organisations designating unofficial celebrations. 

The feast has been regularly celebrated since the canonisation of David in the 12th century by Pope Callixtus II.

==History==

Saint David () was born in Caerfai, southwest Wales into an aristocratic family. He was reportedly a scion of the royal house of Ceredigion, and founded a Celtic monastic community at Glyn Rhosyn (The Vale of Roses) on the western headland of Pembrokeshire () at the spot where St Davids Cathedral stands today.

David&#x27;s fame as a teacher and his asceticism spread among Celtic Christians, and he helped found about 1200 monasteries. His foundation at Glyn Rhosyn became an important Christian shrine, and the most important centre in Wales. The date of Saint David&#x27;s death is believed to be 1 March 589. His final words to the community of monks were: &quot;Brothers be ye constant. The yoke which with single mind ye have taken, bear ye to the end; and whatsoever ye have seen with me and heard, keep and fulfil.&quot;

For centuries, 1 March has been a national festival. Saint David was recognised as a national patron saint in the 12th century at the peak of Welsh resistance to the Normans. He was canonised by Pope Callixtus II in 1120. The 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys noted how Welsh celebrations in London for Saint David&#x27;s Day would spark wider counter-celebrations amongst their English neighbours: life-sized effigies of Welshmen were symbolically lynched, and by the 18th century the custom had arisen of confectioners producing &quot;taffies&quot;—gingerbread figures baked in the shape of a Welshman riding a goat—on Saint David&#x27;s Day.

In the poem &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; (&quot;The Prophesy of Britain&quot;), composed in the early to mid-10th century, the anonymous author prophesies that the Cymry (the Welsh people) will unite and join an alliance of fellow-Celts to repel the Anglo-Saxons, under the banner of Saint David: &quot;A lluman glân Dewi a ddyrchafant&quot; (&quot;And they will raise the pure banner of Dewi&quot;). Although there were occasional Welsh uprisings in the Middle Ages, the country was briefly united by various Welsh princes before its conquest at different times, and it arguably had a very short period of independence during the rising of Owain Glyndŵr, but Wales as a whole was never an independent kingdom for long. Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond, who was born in Pembroke Castle as a patrilineal descendant of the Tudor Dynasty of North Wales, became King Henry VII of England after his victory over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, to end the Wars of the Roses. Henry&#x27;s green and white banner with a red dragon became a rallying point for Welsh patriotism with the memory of Saint David on his Feast Day. Henry was the first monarch of the House of Tudor, and during the reign of that dynasty, the royal coat of arms included the Welsh Dragon, a reference to the monarch&#x27;s origin. The banner from Henry&#x27;s victory was not adopted as the official Flag of Wales until 1959. The flag of Saint David, however, a golden cross on a black background, was not part of the symbolism of House of Tudor.

==Celebration and traditions==
Children in Wales participate in school concerts or eisteddfodau, with recitation and singing as the main activities. Formerly, schoolchildren were given a half-day holiday. Officially this custom does not continue, although the practice can vary between schools. The younger girls sometimes wear traditional Welsh costumes to school. This costume includes a long woollen skirt, apron, white blouse, woollen shawl, and a Welsh hat.

Also, various Welsh Regiments of the British Army use aspects of Saint David&#x27;s cross, Saint David himself, or songs of Saint David in their formalities during the celebrations. Many Welsh people wear one or both of the National symbols of Wales to celebrate St. David: the daffodil (a generic Welsh symbol) or the leek (Saint David&#x27;s personal symbol) on this day. The leek arises when a troop of Welsh could distinguish each other from a troop of English enemy (some historical accounts indicate Saxon invading forces), dressed similarly, by wearing leeks.

The flag of Saint David often plays a central role in the celebrations and can be seen flying throughout Wales. Popular dishes traditionally eaten on Saint David&#x27;s Day include cawl (soup), bara brith tea loaf, Welsh Cakes, Welsh lamb and Welsh rarebit.
===Wales===

Around Wales each year, Saint David is commemorated in parades, the largest of which is in Cardiff. The parade is a non-military celebration of Welsh heritage and culture. To mark Saint David&#x27;s Day and their return from a six-month tour of Afghanistan, soldiers from the Royal Welsh Regiment provided the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Cardiff Castle&#x27;s south gate on 27 and 28 February 2010.

On 1 March 2010, the seventh National Saint David&#x27;s Day Parade occurred in Cardiff city centre. Celebrations included concerts, a parade, and a food festival. The food festival ran from 26 February with the third annual Really Welsh Food Festival in Queen Street, featuring all-Welsh produce. Following the parade, several Welsh entertainers performed and in the evening Cardiff Central Library provided free entertainment and food.

Many towns now hold an annual parade through the town centre. Concerts are held in pubs, clubs, and other venues. In the town of Colwyn Bay in north Wales, an annual parade through the town centre is now held with several hundred citizens and schoolchildren participating. Other events are centred on the parade.

Swansea inaugurated a &quot;St David&#x27;s Week&quot; festival in 2009 with a range of musical, sporting, and cultural events held throughout the city to mark the national day. For 2018, the city followed St David&#x27;s Day celebrations with a two-day food festival.

===Celebrations elsewhere===
Disneyland Paris also organises yearly events to celebrate Saint David&#x27;s Day, which includes a Welsh-themed week, fireworks, parades, and Disney characters dressed in traditional Welsh attire.

Washington, DC holds a St. David&#x27;s Day congressional reception at the United States Capitol in honour of the First Minister of Wales&#x27; biannual visits.

The Los Angeles St. David&#x27;s Day Festival – National Day of Wales is the largest annual event of its kind in the United States, encompassing an eisteddfod, Celtic marketplace, classes, and a concert.

== Proposals for a public holiday ==

Unlike Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in Ireland, Saint David&#x27;s Day is not a national holiday, though there is strong support for it becoming a bank holiday in Wales. In the past, schools have taken a half-day holiday, which continues in some parts of Wales. Saint David&#x27;s Day is also celebrated in expatriate Welsh communities outside the UK. Cross-party support resulted in the National Assembly for Wales voting unanimously to make Saint David&#x27;s Day a public holiday in 2000. A poll conducted for Saint David&#x27;s Day in 2006 found that 87% of people in Wales wanted it to be a bank holiday, with 65% prepared to sacrifice a different bank holiday to achieve this. A petition in 2007 to make Saint David&#x27;s Day a bank holiday was rejected by the office of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair. In 2022 Gwynedd County Council voted to make the day a paid public holiday for their staff.

<text>Macquarie Island is a subantarctic island in the south-western Pacific Ocean, about halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica. It has been governed as a part of Tasmania, Australia, since 1880. It became a Tasmanian State Reserve in 1978 and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

Macquarie Island is an exposed portion of the Macquarie Ridge and is located where the Australian Plate meets the Pacific Plate. 

The island is home to the entire royal penguin population during their annual nesting season. Ecologically, the island is part of the Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion.

==History==
===19th century===
Frederick Hasselborough, an Australian, discovered the uninhabited island on 11 July 1810, while looking for new sealing grounds. He claimed Macquarie Island for Britain and annexed it to the colony of New South Wales in 1810. The island was named for Colonel Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821. Hasselborough reported a wreck &quot;of ancient design&quot;, which has given rise to speculation that the island may have been visited before by Polynesians or others. In the same year, Captain Smith described in more detail what is presumably the same wreck and incorrectly speculated that it belonged to French explorer Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse: &quot;several pieces of wreck of a large vessel on this Island, apparently very old and high up in the grass, probably the remains of the ship of the unfortunate De la Perouse&quot;.

Between 1810 and 1919, seals and then penguins were hunted for their oil almost to the point of extinction. Sealers&#x27; relics include iron try pots, casks, hut ruins, graves and inscriptions. During that time, 144 vessel visits are recorded, 12 of which ended in shipwreck. The conditions on the island and the surrounding seas were considered so harsh that a plan to use it as a penal settlement was rejected.

Richard Siddins and his crew were shipwrecked in Hasselborough Bay on 11 June 1812. Joseph Underwood sent the ship &quot;Elizabeth and Mary&quot; to the island to rescue the remaining crew. The Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen explored the area for Alexander I of Russia in 1820, and produced the first map of Macquarie Island. Bellingshausen landed on the island on 28 November 1820, defined its geographical position and traded his rum and food for the island&#x27;s fauna with the sealers.

In 1877, the crew of the schooner &quot;Bencleugh&quot; was shipwrecked on the island for four months; folklore says they came to believe there was hidden treasure on the island. The ship&#x27;s owner, John Sen Inches Thomson, wrote a book on his sea travels, including his time on the island. The book, written in 1912, was entitled &quot;Voyages and Wanderings In Far-off Seas and Lands&quot;.

====Tasmania–New Zealand seal skin dispute====
Macquarie Island was made a constituent part of Tasmania on 17 June 1880 through Letters Patent for the Governor of Tasmania. 

In 1890, the Colony of New Zealand wrote to Lord Onslow (the Governor of New Zealand), Philip Fysh (the Premier of Tasmania), and the Lord Knutsford (the Secretary of State for the Colonies) regarding the island, initially requesting permission to annex the island, then requesting its transfer from the Colony of Tasmania, as this would close a loophole in New Zealand&#x27;s closed sealing season when vessels were poaching on sub-Antarctic islands under the Colony&#x27;s jurisdiction but claiming they got the seal skins from Macquarie Island. On the recommendation of Fysh, the Tasmanian Legislative Council passed a motion on 24 July 1890 requesting the &quot;necessary steps be taken&quot; for Macquarie Island to be transferred to New Zealand. Fysh was in no hurry to complete this process, and the request was only officially transmitted to the Tasmanian Legislative Assembly on 28 August 1890. 

When the Legislative Assembly considered the matter on 2 September 1890, the virtue of transferring a dependent island was questioned, and (after several points of order and jokes from members) the assembly deferred consideration until the following day (effectively denying the transfer). By October 1890, it was certain that Tasmania would not condone the transfer of the island to New Zealand. Sir Harry Atkinson (Premier of New Zealand) expressed his regrets that Tasmania had decided against the transfer, with Fysh noting that all of New Zealand&#x27;s stated objectives could be achieved under existing Tasmanian legislation and through inter-colonial agreements. In mid October 1890, &quot;The Southland Times&quot; was reporting that an explanation was forthcoming from Wellington. On 23 October 1890, Fysh formally advised New Zealand of the colonial legislature&#x27;s refusal to transfer the island, and on 20 November 1890 Knutsford formally advised Onslow that the British government had not consented to any transfer.

On 20 April 1891, regulations issued by the Tasmanian Commissioner of Fisheries for the protection of seals on Macquarie Island came into effect. This was possible under existing Tasmanian legislation, namely the Fisheries Act 1889. By 26 October 1891, these regulations were amended to expire on 20 July 1894, and to no longer include the forfeiture of a vessel as penalty for the offence.

===20th century===
Between 1902 and 1920, the Tasmanian Government leased the island to Joseph Hatch (1837–1928) for his oil industry based on harvesting penguins.

Between 1911 and 1914, the island became a base for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition under Sir Douglas Mawson. George Ainsworth operated a meteorological station between 1911 and 1913, followed by Harold Power from 1913 to 1914, and by Arthur Tulloch from 1914 until the station was shut down in 1915.

In 1933, the authorities declared the island a wildlife sanctuary under the Tasmanian &quot;Animals and Birds Protection Act 1928&quot; and, in 1972, it was made a State Reserve under the Tasmanian &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970&quot;. On 25 May 1948, the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) established its expedition headquarters on Macquarie Island. In March 1949, they were visited by the Fifth French Antarctic Expedition on their return trip from Adélie Land where any landing was made impossible due to extensive pack ice that year. 

The island had status as a biosphere reserve under the Man and the Biosphere Programme from 1977 until its withdrawal from the program in 2011. On 5 December 1997, Macquarie Island was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as a site of major geoconservation significance, being the only mid-ocean ridge on Earth where rocks from the Earth&#x27;s mantle are being actively exposed above sea-level.

===21st century===
On 23 December 2004, an earthquake measuring 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale rocked the island but caused no significant damage. Geoscience Australia issued a Tsunami Inundation Advice for Macquarie Island Station. The paper indicated that a tsunami caused by a local earthquake could occur with no warning, and could inundate the isthmus and its existing station. Such a tsunami would likely affect other parts of the coastline and field huts located close to the shore. According to several papers, an earthquake capable of causing a tsunami of that significance is a high risk.

==Geography==
Macquarie Island is about long and wide, with an area of . The island consists of plateaus at north and south ends, each of elevation, joined by a low, narrow isthmus. The high points include Mount Elder on the northeast coastal ridge at , and Mounts Hamilton and Fletcher in the south at . The island is almost equidistant between the island of Tasmania and the Antarctic continent&#x27;s Anderson Peninsula, about from either point. In addition, Macquarie Island is about southwest of Auckland Island, and north of the Balleny Islands.

Near Macquarie Island are two small groups of minor islands: the Judge and Clerk Islets (), to the north, in area, and the Bishop and Clerk Islets (), to the south, in area. Like Macquarie Island, both groups are part of the state of Tasmania. The Bishop and Clerk Islets mark the southernmost point of Australia (excluding the Australian Antarctic Territory).

In the 19th century a phantom island named &quot;Emerald Island&quot; was believed to lie south of Macquarie Island.

==Geology==
The island is located on the tectonic plate boundary between the Australian plate to the northwest and the Pacific plate to the southeast. It is part of the Macquarie Ridge, a long fault zone in the oceanic crust, running southwestwards from New Zealand along the plate boundary. The Macquarie Ridge has formed along the plate boundary by movement of the two plates towards each other, leading to uplift along the boundary. However, in earlier geologic time the two plates had been moving apart, allowing lava from the earth&#x27;s mantle to rise to the seafloor, forming basalt. The subsequent reversal of the movement of the plates has uplifted the basaltic material from the seafloor along the line of the Macquarie Ridge.

The Macquarie ridge lies entirely on the seafloor except for where it rises above sea level at Macquarie Island. The island emerged above sea level in recent geologic time - the highest points on the island may have emerged above the sea as recently as 300,000 years ago or less. The estimates vary based on the assumed rate of uplift and the changes in sea level over time. The unique exposures include excellent examples of pillow basalts without any hint of continental crust contamination. The island is an example of an ophiolite - a section of Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed. The process has been described as &quot;the island itself seems to have been simply squeezed toward the surface like toothpaste from a tube&quot;.The unique exposures include excellent examples of pillow basalts without any hint of continental crust contamination and other extrusive rocks. It also is the only oceanic environment with an exposed ophiolite sequence. The geology of the island has been described as revealing &quot;the best exposed and most isolated pieces of the ocean floor in the world&quot;.The unique geological exposures were one of the two criteria cited when the island was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

The island lies close to the edge of the submerged continent of Zealandia, but is not regarded as a part of it, because the Macquarie Ridge is oceanic crust rather than continental crust.

==Climate==
Macquarie Island&#x27;s climate is moderated by the sea, and all months have an average temperature above freezing; although snow is common between June and October, and may even occur in summer. Due to its cold summers, the island has a tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. 

Average daily maximum temperatures range from in July to in January. Precipitation occurs fairly evenly throughout the year and averages annually. Macquarie Island is one of the cloudiest places on Earth with an annual average of only 862 hours of sunshine (similar to Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands). Annually, there are an average of 289.4 cloudy days and just 3.5 clear days. 

There are 316.7 precipitation days annually, including 55.7 snowy days (being equal to Charlotte Pass on this metric). This is a considerably lower figure than at Heard Island due to its longitude, which receives 96.8 snowy days at only 53 degrees south.

==Flora and fauna==
The flora has taxonomic affinities with other subantarctic islands, especially those south of New Zealand. Plants rarely grow over in height, though the tussock-forming grass &quot;Poa foliosa&quot; can grow up to tall in sheltered areas. There are over 45 vascular plant species and more than 90 moss species, as well as many liverworts and lichens. Woody plants are absent.

The island has five principal vegetation formations: grassland, herbfield, fen, bog and feldmark. Bog communities include &#x27;featherbed&#x27;, a deep and spongy peat bog vegetated by grasses and low herbs, with patches of free water. Endemic flora include the cushion plant &quot;Azorella macquariensis&quot;, the grass &quot;Puccinellia macquariensis&quot;, and two orchids – &quot;Nematoceras dienemum&quot; and &quot;Nematoceras sulcatum&quot;.

Mammals found on the island include subantarctic fur seals, Antarctic fur seals, New Zealand fur seals and southern elephant seals – over 80,000 individuals of this species. Diversities and distributions of cetaceans are less known; southern right whales and orcas are more common followed by other migratory baleen and toothed whales, especially sperm and beaked whales, which prefer deep waters. So-called &quot;upland seals&quot; once found on Antipodes Islands and Macquarie Island have been claimed by some researchers as a distinct subspecies of fur seals with thicker furs, although it is unclear whether these seals were genetically distinct.

Royal penguins and Macquarie shags are endemic breeders, while king penguins, southern rockhopper penguins and gentoo penguins also breed here in large numbers. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports about 3.5 million breeding seabirds of 13 species.

=== Protected area ===
The Tasmanian Government declared Macquarie Island as a wildlife sanctuary in 1933. The status was changed to a conservation area in 1971, and then in 1972 it was re-designated as a state reserve known as the Macquarie Island Wildlife Reserve. In 1977 the island was declared a Biosphere Reserve under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme, and it was also listed on the Australia Register of the National Estate. In 1978, the area of the state reserve was extended to the mean low-water mark including the offshore islets, and it was formally named as the Macquarie Island Nature Reserve. Access to the reserve was restricted from 1979 onwards, requiring a permit for all those seeking access to the reserve.

In December 1997, Macquarie Island was listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site, including the reserve and the surrounding waters out to 12 nautical miles. The Macquarie Island Marine Park was established in 1999, and in 2000, the Macquarie Island Nature Reserve was extended in 2000 to include the area out to 3 nautical miles from the island and outlying islets.
===Impact of introduced animals===
The island ecology was affected by the onset of European visits in 1810. The island&#x27;s fur seals, elephant seals and penguins were killed for fur and blubber. Rats and mice that were inadvertently introduced from the ships prospered due to lack of predators. Cats were subsequently introduced deliberately to keep them from eating human food stores. In about 1870, rabbits and a species of New Zealand rail (wekas) were left on the island by sealers to breed for food. This caused huge damage to the local wildlife, including the extinction of the Macquarie Island rail (&quot;Gallirallus macquariensis&quot;), the Macquarie parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus erythrotis&quot;), and an as-yet-undescribed species of teal. By the 1970s, 130,000 rabbits were causing tremendous damage to vegetation.

==== Feral cats ====
The feral cats introduced to the island had a devastating effect on the native seabird population, with an estimated annual loss of 60,000 seabirds. From 1985, efforts were undertaken to remove the cats. In June 2000, the last of the nearly 2,500 cats were culled in an effort to save the seabirds. Seabird populations responded rapidly, but rats and rabbits population increased after the cats were culled, and continued to cause widespread environmental damage.

==== Rabbits ====
The rabbits rapidly multiplied before numbers were reduced to about 10,000 in the early 1980s when myxomatosis was introduced. Rabbit numbers then grew again to over 100,000 by 2006. Rats and mice feeding on young chicks, and rabbits nibbling on the grass layer, has led to soil erosion and cliff collapses, destroying seabird nests. Large portions of the Macquarie Island bluffs are eroding as a result. In September 2006 a large landslip at Lusitania Bay, on the eastern side of the island, partially destroyed an important penguin breeding colony. Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service attributed the landslip to a combination of heavy spring rains and severe erosion caused by rabbits. 

Research by Australian Antarctic Division scientists, published in the 13 January 2009 issue of the British Ecological Society&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Applied Ecology&quot;, suggested that the success of the feral cat eradication program has allowed the rabbit population to increase, damaging the Macquarie Island ecosystem by altering significant areas of island vegetation. However, in a comment published in the same journal other scientists argued that a number of factors (primarily a reduction in the use of the Myxoma virus) were almost certainly involved and the absence of cats may have been relatively minor among them. The original authors examined the issue in a later reply and concluded that the effect of the Myxoma virus use was small and reaffirmed their original position. The original authors did not, however, explain how rabbit numbers were greater in previous periods such as the 1970s before the myxoma virus was introduced and when cats were not being controlled, nor how rabbits had built up to such high numbers when cats were present for some 60 years prior to the introduction of rabbits; suggesting that cats were not controlling rabbit populations before the introduction of the myxoma virus.

==== Eradication of rabbits, rats and mice ====
On 4 June 2007, a media release by Malcolm Turnbull, Federal Minister for Australia&#x27;s Environment and Water Resources Board, announced that the Australian and Tasmanian Governments had reached an agreement to jointly fund the eradication of rodent pests, including rabbits, to protect Macquarie Island&#x27;s World Heritage values. The plan, estimated to cost $24 million Australian dollars, was based on mass baiting the island similar to an eradication program on Campbell Island, New Zealand, to be followed with teams of dogs trained by Steve Austin over a maximum seven-year period. The baiting was expected to inadvertently affect kelp gulls, but greater-than-expected bird deaths caused the program to be suspended. Other species killed by the baits include giant petrels, black ducks and skuas.

In February 2012, &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper reported that rabbits, rats and mice had been nearly eradicated from the island. In April 2012 the hunting teams reported the extermination of 13 rabbits that had survived the 2011 baiting; the last five were found in November 2011, including a lactating doe and four kittens. No fresh rabbit signs were found up to July 2013. 

On 8 April 2014, Macquarie Island was officially declared pest-free, after seven years of conservation efforts. This achievement was the largest successful island pest-eradication program attempted to that date. In May 2024, it was reported that the island had remained free of pests for 10 years, with vegetation flourishing. 

Populations of multiple bird species have begun to recover. The white-headed petrel (&quot;Pterodroma lessonii&quot;) that was close to extinction by 2001 has shown a large increase in breeding success, and the population is now slowly increasing. Two other species of petrel, the grey petrel (&quot;Procellaria cinerea&quot;) and blue petrel (&quot;Halobaena caerulea&quot;) that were extinct on the main island from the 1900s, have now returned. Their populations are increasing at around 10% per annum. However, ongoing monitoring, along with measures such as the use of biosecurity dogs to check cargo with the island as its destination are necessary, as there are new threats such as climate change and avian influenza. Ongoing monitoring programs are funded by the federal government.

===Introduced birds===
Despite being declared pest-free, Macquarie Island is still inhabited by several invasive bird species, such as the domestic mallard and European starling. The self-introduction of domestic mallards from New Zealand has become a threat to the Pacific black duck population on Macquarie Island through introgressive hybridisation.

== Governance and administration ==
Macquarie Island has been a part of Tasmania, Australia since 1880. It was a part of Esperance Municipality until 1993, when the municipality was merged with other municipalities to form Huon Valley Council.

Since 1948, the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) has maintained a permanent base, the Macquarie Island Station, on the isthmus at the northern end of the island at the foot of Wireless Hill. The population of the base, constituting the island&#x27;s only human inhabitants, usually varies from 20 to 40 people over the year. A heliport is located nearby. 

In September 2016, the Australian Antarctic Division said it would close its research station on the island in 2017. However, shortly afterwards, the Australian government responded to widespread backlash by announcing funding to upgrade ageing infrastructure and continue existing operations.

In 2018, the Australian Antarctic Division published a map showing the island&#x27;s buildings with confirmed or suspected asbestos contamination, which included at least half the structures there.

In April 2024, Permanent Daylight-Saving Time on Macquarie Island was abolished by the Huon Valley Council and was changed to Summer DST. Previously, Macquarie Island was the only place on earth to observe permanent Daylight-Saving Time. Permanent Daylight-Saving on Macquarie Island was intended for stationed personnel on Macquarie Island Station, until a permanent human population was granted.

Through &quot;Operation Southern Discovery&quot;, elements of the Australian Defence Force also provide annual support for the Australian Antarctic Division and the Australian Antarctic Program (AAP) in regional scientific, environmental and economic activities. As part of &quot;Operation Resolute&quot;, the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Border Force are tasked with deploying or patrol boats to carry out civil maritime security operations in the region as may be required. In part to carry out this mission, as of 2023, the Navy&#x27;s &quot;Armidale&quot;-class boats are in the process of being replaced by larger s.

<text>Hans Lipperhey ( – buried 29 September 1619), also known as Johann Lippershey or simply Lippershey, was a German-Dutch spectacle-maker. He is commonly associated with the invention of the telescope, because he was the first one who tried to obtain a patent for it. It is, however, unclear if he was the first one to build a telescope.

==Biography==
Lipperhey was born in Wesel, now in western Germany, around 1570. He settled in Middelburg, the capital of the province of Zeeland, now in the Netherlands, in 1594, married the same year and became a citizen of Zeeland in 1602. During that time he became a master lens grinder and spectacle maker and established a shop. He remained in Middelburg until his death, in September 1619.

===Invention of the telescope===

Hans Lipperhey is known for the earliest written record of a refracting telescope, a patent he filed in 1608. His work with optical devices grew out of his work as a spectacle maker, an industry that had started in Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century, and later expanded to the Netherlands and Germany.

Lipperhey applied to the States General of the Netherlands on 2 October 1608 for a patent for his instrument &quot;for seeing things far away as if they were nearby&quot;, a few weeks before another Dutch instrument-maker&#x27;s patent, that of Jacob Metius. Lipperhey failed to receive a patent since the same claim for invention had also been made by other spectacle-makers but he was handsomely rewarded by the Dutch government for copies of his design.

Lipperhey&#x27;s application for a patent was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on an embassy to Holland from the Kingdom of Siam sent by the Siamese king Ekathotsarot: &quot;Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoyé à l&#x27;Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrivé à La Haye le 10 Septemb. 1608&quot; (&quot;Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellency Prince Maurice, arrived at The Hague on 10 September 1608&quot;). This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian Paolo Sarpi, who received the report in November, the Englishman Thomas Harriot, who was using a six-powered telescope by the summer of 1609, and Galileo Galilei, who improved the device.

There are many stories as to how Lipperhey came by his invention. One version has Lipperhey observing two children playing with lenses in his shop and commenting how they could make a far away weather-vane seem closer when looking at it through two lenses. Other stories have Lipperhey&#x27;s apprentice coming up with the idea or have Lipperhey copying someone else&#x27;s discovery. Lipperhey&#x27;s original instrument consisted of either two convex lenses with an inverted image or a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens so it would have an upright image. This &quot;Dutch perspective glass&quot; (the name &quot;telescope&quot; would not be coined until three years later by Giovanni Demisiani) had a three-times (or 3X) magnification.
The lunar crater Lippershey, the minor planet 31338 Lipperhey, and the exoplanet Lipperhey (55 Cancri d) are named after him.

<text>Cribbage, or crib, is a card game, traditionally for two players, that involves playing and grouping cards in combinations which gain points. It can be adapted for three or four players.

Cribbage has several distinctive features: the cribbage board used for score-keeping; the &quot;crib&quot;, &quot;box&quot;, or &quot;kitty&quot; (in parts of Canada and New England); two distinct scoring stages; and a unique scoring system, including points for groups of cards that total 15. It has been characterized as &quot;Britain&#x27;s national card game&quot; and the only one legally playable in licensed pubs and clubs without requiring local authority permission.

The game has relatively few rules yet many subtleties, which accounts for its ongoing appeal and popularity. Tactical play varies, depending on which cards one&#x27;s opponent has played, how many cards in the remaining pack will help the hand one holds, and what one&#x27;s position on the board is. A game may be decided by a single point, and the edge often goes to an experienced player who utilizes strategy, including calculating odds and making decisions based on the relative positions of players on the board.

Both cribbage and its close relative costly colours are descended from the old English card game of noddy. Cribbage added the distinctive feature of a crib and changed the scoring system for &quot;points&quot;, whereas costly colours added more combinations but retained the original noddy scoring scheme.

==History==

According to John Aubrey, cribbage was created by the English poet Sir John Suckling in the early 17th century, as a derivation of the game &quot;noddy&quot;. While noddy has become a historical, rarely-played game, cribbage has continued as a popular game in the English-speaking world. The objective of the game is to be the first player to score a target number of points, typically 61 or 121. Points are scored for showing certain jacks, playing the last card, for card combinations adding up to 15 or 31, and for pairs, triples, quadruples (cards of the same rank), runs (sequences of consecutive numbers irrespective of suit) and flushes (sets of cards of the same suit).

The earliest rules were published in England and appear in Cotgrave (1662) and are soon followed by Willughby (1672) and Cotton (1674).

The continuing popularity of cribbage is due in some part to the influence of the Victorian novelist Charles Dickens, who depicted the game in his novel &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;.

Cribbage was popular among prospectors in the American West, and the small mining town of Nelson, Montana, to this day has a sign proclaiming it the &quot;Cribbage Capital of the World&quot;.

Cribbage is played by American submariners, serving as a common pastime. The wardroom of the oldest active submarine in the United States Pacific Fleet carries on board the personal cribbage board of World War II submarine commander and Medal of Honor recipient Rear Admiral Dick O&#x27;Kane, and upon the boat&#x27;s decommissioning, the board is transferred to the next oldest boat.

==Rules==

Play proceeds through a succession of &quot;hands&quot;, each hand consisting of a &quot;deal&quot;, &quot;the play&quot; and &quot;the show&quot;. At any time during any of these stages, if a player reaches the target score (usually 121), play ends immediately with that player being the winner of the game. This can even happen during the deal, since the dealer scores if a jack is cut as the starter.

===Deal===
The players cut for first deal, and the person who cuts the lowest card deals. The dealer shuffles and deals five or six cards to each player, depending on the number of players. For two players, each is dealt six cards; for three or four players, each is dealt five cards. In the case of three players, a single card is dealt face down in the centre of the table to start the crib. Once the cards have been dealt, each player chooses four cards to retain, then discards the other one or two face-down to form the &quot;crib&quot; (also called the box), which will be used later by the dealer.

At this point, each player&#x27;s hand and the crib will contain exactly four cards. The player on the dealer&#x27;s left or, in a two-player game, the pone, cuts the remaining pack. The dealer reveals the top card of the lower half, called the &quot;starter card&quot; or &quot;cut&quot;, and places it face up on top of the reunited pack. If this card is a jack, the dealer scores two points for &quot;his heels&quot; or &quot;his nibs&quot;.

===Play===

Starting with the player on the dealer&#x27;s left, the players each, in turn, lay one card face up on the table in front of them, stating the count—that is, the cumulative value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says &quot;five&quot;, the next lays a six and says &quot;eleven&quot;, and so on)—without the count going above 31. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) count as 10. The cards are not laid in the centre of the table as, at the end of the &quot;play&quot;, each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.

Players score points during the play as follows:
*15 – For causing the count to reach exactly 15 a player scores two points, then play continues.
*Pair – Completing a pair (two of a kind) scores two points. 
**Three of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points.
**Four of a kind is 6 different pairs, or 12 points. 
*A run of three or more cards (consecutively played, but not necessarily in order) scores the number of cards in the run.

If a player cannot play without causing the count to exceed 31, they call &quot;Go&quot;. Continuing with the player on their left, the other players continue the play until no one can play without the count exceeding 31. A player is obliged to play a card unless there is no card in their hand that can be played without the count exceeding 31 (one cannot voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to play, the player who played the last card scores one point if the count is still under 31 and two if it is exactly 31. The count is then reset to zero and those players with cards remaining in their hands repeat the process starting with the player to the left of the player who played the last card. When all players have played all of their cards the game proceeds to the &quot;show&quot;.

Players choose the order in which to lay their cards in order to maximize their scores; experienced players refer to this as either good or poor &quot;pegging&quot; or &quot;pegsmanship&quot;. If one player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins. When the scores are level during a game, the players&#x27; pegs will be side by side, and it is thought that this gave rise to the phrase &quot;level pegging&quot;.

===Show===
Once the play is complete, each player in turn, starting with the player on the left of the dealer, displays their own hand on the table and scores points based on its content &quot;in conjunction with the starter card&quot;. Points are scored for:
*Combinations of any number of cards totalling fifteen (2 points each)
*Runs (1 point for each card)
*Pairs (2 points each. Multiple pairs are scored pair by pair but may be referred to as three or four of a kind.)
*Four-card flush (All four cards in the hand of the same suit score 4 points.)
*Five-card flush (All four cards in the hand of the same suit as the starter card score 5 points. A flush in the crib must be a five-card flush according to the official rules of the ACC.)
*Having a jack of the same suit as the starter card (1 point; referred to as &quot;one for his nob [or &quot;nobs&quot; or &quot;nibs&quot;]&quot; or sometimes the &quot;right&quot; jack)

The dealer scores their hand last and then turns the cards in the crib face up. These cards are then scored by the dealer as an additional hand, also in conjunction with the starter card. Unlike the dealer&#x27;s own hand, the crib cannot score a four-card flush, but it can score a five-card flush with the starter.

All scores from 0 to 29 are possible, with the exception of 19, 25, 26 and 27. Players may refer colloquially to a hand scoring zero points as a “nineteen hand”.

===Muggins===
Muggins is a commonly used but optional rule, which must be announced before game play begins and exact rules worked out. If a player fails to claim their full score on any turn, the opponent may call out &quot;Muggins&quot; and peg any points overlooked by the player.

===Match===
A match (much like tennis) consists of more than one game, often an odd number. The match points are scored on the cribbage board using the holes reserved for match points. On a spiral board, these are often at the bottom of the board in a line with 5 or 7 holes. On a conventional board, they are often in the middle of the board or at the top or bottom.

In a two-player game of cribbage, a player scores one match point for winning a game. Their opponent will start as dealer in the next game. If a player lurches (British) or skunks (US) their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent scores 91 points), that player wins two match points for that game. If a player double skunks their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent reaches 61), they score three or four match points for the game, depending on local convention. If a player triple skunks their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent reaches 31 points), they automatically win the match. Double and triple skunks are not included in the official rules of cribbage play and are optional. There are several different formats for scoring match points.

==Cribbage board==
Visually, cribbage is known for its scoring board—a series of holes (&quot;streets&quot;) on which the score is tallied with pegs (also known as &quot;spilikins&quot;). Scores can be kept on a piece of paper, but a cribbage board is almost always used, since scoring occurs throughout the game, not just at the conclusion of hands as in most other card games.

Points are registered as having been scored by &quot;pegging&quot; along the crib board. Two pegs are used in a leapfrog fashion, so that if a player loses track during the count one peg still marks the previous score. Some boards have a &quot;game counter&quot; with many additional holes for use with a third peg to count the games won by each side.

There are several designs of crib board:
*The classic design is a flat wooden board approximately 250–300 mm (10–12 in) by 70–80 mm (3–4 in) and 10–20 mm (0.4–0.8 in) deep. There are two sets of 60 holes (30 &#x27;out&#x27; and 30 &#x27;back&#x27;) divided into 5 point sections. A &quot;pegging-out&quot; hole in the middle at each end allows the board to be used in either direction. One player or team scores on one set of 60 holes and the other player or team scores on the second set. Different arrangements are made for three player games.
*A relatively old design is that of an equilateral triangle with two rows of forty holes on each side. These boards did not generally include extra &quot;pegging-out&quot; holes or holes to count games.
*A newer design has three or four rows of 120 holes in a &quot;paperclip&quot; shape (with a &quot;pegging-out&quot; hole at the end) and is often brightly coloured. It is best suited to games played to 121, though it can also be used for 61-point games.
*Another common variation is based on features of the highest-scoring cribbage hand. The board takes the form of the number 29 (the highest possible score), with the pegging rows following the contour of the numbers &quot;2&quot; and &quot;9&quot;. The design can sometimes include a background image of three fives and a jack, with the fourth five offset—the &quot;perfect hand&quot; giving that score. The count being 8 combinations of 15 for 16 points, 6 pairs of 2 for 12 points and a matching &quot;nobs&quot; jack (matching the cut card) for 1 totalling 29.

Each of the four 30-point divisions of the cribbage board (1–30, 31–60, 61–90, and 91–120) is colloquially called a &quot;street&quot;. Being at 15 points would be on first street, being at 59 points would be on second street, etc.

== Noddy and costly colours ==
The ancestor of cribbage is noddy, a game for two or four players, each receiving just three cards and playing and scoring in a similar manner to modern cribbage. However, instead of scoring 2 points for reaching 15 or 31 (called &quot;hitter&quot;), players scored the number of constituent cards making up the &quot;point&quot;. In addition, there was originally a third &quot;point&quot; at 25. Players also scored for pairs, prials, runs and flushes as in cribbage. There was no crib and game was 31.

Costly colours may have developed separately from noddy, as it retains several original features that are no longer part of cribbage. Again, only three cards are dealt, there is no crib and it uses the same scoring scheme for &quot;points&quot; at 15, 25 and 31 or &quot;hitter&quot;. What is new is that deuces play a similar role to jacks and that players may score for &quot;colours&quot;—i.e., having three or four cards of the same suit or colour. Four cards of the same suit are &quot;costly colours&quot;, hence the name.

<text>Turkmenistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north, east and northeast, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest and the Caspian Sea to the west. Ashgabat is the capital and largest city. It is one of the six independent Turkic states. With a population over 7 million, Turkmenistan is the 35th most-populous country in Asia and has the lowest population of the Central Asian republics while being one of the most sparsely populated nations on the Asian continent.

Turkmenistan has long served as a thoroughfare for several empires and cultures. Merv is one of the oldest oasis-cities in Central Asia, and was once among the biggest cities in the world. It was also one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by the Russian Empire in 1881, Turkmenistan figured prominently in the anti-Bolshevik movement in Central Asia. In 1925, Turkmenistan became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR); it became independent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The country is widely criticized for its poor human rights, including for its treatment of minorities, and its lack of press and religious freedoms. Since the independence declared from the Soviet Union in 1991, Turkmenistan has been ruled by repressive totalitarian regimes: that of President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov (also known as &quot;Türkmenbaşy&quot; or &quot;Head of the Turkmens&quot;) until his death in 2006; Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who became president in 2007 after winning a non-democratic election (he had been vice-president and then acting president previously); and his son Serdar, who won a subsequent 2022 presidential election described by international observers as neither free nor fair, and now shares power with his father.

Turkmenistan possesses the world&#x27;s fifth largest reserves of natural gas. Most of the country is covered by the Karakum Desert. From 1993 to 2019, citizens received government-provided electricity, water and natural gas free of charge. Turkmenistan is an observer state in the Organisation of Turkic States, the Türksoy community and a member of the United Nations.
== Etymology ==
The name of Turkmenistan () can be divided into two components: the ethnonym Türkmen and the Persian suffix -stan meaning &quot;place of&quot; or &quot;country&quot;. The name &quot;Turkmen&quot; comes from Turk, plus the Sogdian suffix -men, meaning &quot;almost Turk&quot;, in reference to their status outside the Turkic dynastic mythological system.

Muslim chroniclers like Ibn Kathir suggested that the etymology of Turkmenistan came from the words Türk and iman (); this is in reference to a massive conversion to Islam of two hundred thousand households in the year 971.

Turkmenistan declared its independence from the Soviet Union after the independence referendum in 1991. As a result, the constitutional law was adopted on 27 October of that year and Article 1 established the new name of the state: Turkmenistan (&quot;Türkmenistan&quot; / Түркменистан).

A common name for the Turkmen SSR was Turkmenia (, romanization: Turkmeniya), used in some reports of the country&#x27;s independence.

== History ==

Historically inhabited by Indo-Iranians, Turkmenistan&#x27;s written history begins with its annexation by the Achaemenid Empire of Ancient Iran. After centuries of turmoil, over a thousand years later, in the 8th century AD, Turkic-speaking Oghuz tribes moved from Mongolia into present-day Central Asia. Part of a powerful confederation of tribes, these Oghuz formed the ethnic basis of the modern Turkmen population. In the 10th century, the name &quot;Turkmen&quot; was first applied to Oghuz groups that accepted Islam and began to occupy present-day Turkmenistan. There they were under the dominion of the Seljuk Empire, which was composed of Oghuz groups living in present-day Iran and Turkmenistan. Oghuz groups in the service of the empire played an important role in the spreading of Turkic culture when they migrated westward into present-day Azerbaijan and eastern Turkey.

In the 12th century, Turkmen and other tribes overthrew the Seljuk Empire. In the next century, the Mongols took over the more northern lands where the Turkmens had settled, scattering the Turkmens southward and contributing to the formation of new tribal groups. The sixteenth and eighteenth centuries saw a series of splits and confederations among the nomadic Turkmen tribes, who remained staunchly independent and inspired fear in their neighbors. By the 16th century, most of those tribes were under the nominal control of two sedentary Uzbek khanates, Khiva and Bukhoro. Turkmen soldiers were an important element of the Uzbek militaries of this period. In the 19th century, raids and rebellions by the Yomud Turkmen group resulted in that group&#x27;s dispersal by the Uzbek rulers. In 1855 the Turkmen tribe of Teke led by Gowshut-Khan defeated the invading army of the Khan of Khiva Muhammad Amin Khan and in 1861 the invading Persian army of Nasreddin-Shah.

In the second half of the 19th century, northern Turkmens were the main military and political power in the Khanate of Khiva. According to Paul R. Spickard, &quot;Prior to the Russian conquest, the Turkmen were known and feared for their involvement in the Central Asian slave trade.&quot;

Russian forces began occupying Turkmen territory late in the 19th century. From their Caspian Sea base at Krasnovodsk (now Türkmenbaşy), the Russians eventually overcame the Uzbek khanates. In 1879, the Russian forces were defeated by the Teke Turkmens during the first attempt to conquer the Ahal area of Turkmenistan. However, in 1881, the last significant resistance in Turkmen territory was crushed at the Battle of Geok Tepe, and shortly thereafter Turkmenistan was annexed, together with adjoining Uzbek territory, into the Russian Empire. In 1916, the Russian Empire&#x27;s participation in World War I resonated in Turkmenistan, as an anticonscription revolt swept most of Russian Central Asia. Although the Russian Revolution of 1917 had little direct impact, in the 1920s Turkmen forces joined Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Uzbeks in the so-called Basmachi rebellion against the rule of the newly formed Soviet Union. In 1921 the tsarist province of Transcaspia (, &#x27;Transcaspian Oblast&#x27;) was renamed Turkmen Oblast (), and in 1924, the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic was formed from it. By the late 1930s, Soviet reorganization of agriculture had destroyed what remained of the nomadic lifestyle in Turkmenistan, and Moscow controlled political life. The Ashgabat earthquake of 1948 killed over 110,000 people, amounting to two-thirds of the city&#x27;s population.

During the next half-century, Turkmenistan played its designated economic role within the Soviet Union and remained outside the course of major world events. Even the major liberalization movement that shook Russia in the late 1980s had little impact. However, in 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan declared sovereignty as a nationalist response to perceived exploitation by Moscow. Although Turkmenistan was ill-prepared for independence and then-communist leader Saparmurat Niyazov preferred to preserve the Soviet Union, in October 1991, the fragmentation of that entity forced him to call a national referendum that approved independence. On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Niyazov continued as Turkmenistan&#x27;s chief of state, replacing communism with a unique brand of independent nationalism reinforced by a pervasive cult of personality. A 1994 referendum and legislation in 1999 abolished further requirements for the president to stand for re-election (although in 1992 he completely dominated the only presidential election in which he ran, as he was the only candidate and no one else was allowed to run for the office), making him effectively president for life. During his tenure, Niyazov conducted frequent purges of public officials and abolished organizations deemed threatening. Throughout the post-Soviet era, Turkmenistan has taken a neutral position on almost all international issues. Niyazov eschewed membership in regional organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and in the late 1990s he maintained relations with the Taliban and its chief opponent in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance. He offered limited support to the military campaign against the Taliban following the 11 September 2001 attacks. In 2002 an alleged assassination attempt against Niyazov led to a new wave of security restrictions, dismissals of government officials, and restrictions placed on the media. Niyazov accused exiled former foreign minister Boris Shikhmuradov of having planned the attack.

Between 2002 and 2004, serious tension arose between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan because of bilateral disputes and Niyazov&#x27;s implication that Uzbekistan had a role in the 2002 assassination attempt. In 2004, a series of bilateral treaties restored friendly relations. In the parliamentary elections of December 2004 and January 2005, only Niyazov&#x27;s party was represented, and no international monitors participated. In 2005, Niyazov exercised his dictatorial power by closing all hospitals outside Ashgabat and all rural libraries. The year 2006 saw intensification of the trends of arbitrary policy changes, shuffling of top officials, diminishing economic output outside the oil and gas sector, and isolation from regional and world organizations. China was among a very few nations to whom Turkmenistan made significant overtures. The sudden death of Niyazov at the end of 2006 left a complete vacuum of power, as his cult of personality, comparable to the one of eternal president Kim Il Sung of North Korea, had precluded the naming of a successor. Deputy Prime Minister Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who was named interim head of government, won a non-democratic special presidential election held in early February 2007. His appointment as interim president and subsequent run for president violated the constitution. Berdimuhamedow won two additional non-democratic elections, with approximately 97% of the vote in both 2012 and 2017. His son Serdar Berdimuhamedow won a non-democratic snap presidential election in 2022, establishing a political dynasty in Turkmenistan. On 19 March 2022, Serdar Berdimuhamedov was sworn in as Turkmenistan&#x27;s new president to succeed his father.

== Government and politics ==

After over a century of being a part of the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union (including 67 years as a union republic), Turkmenistan declared its independence on 27 October 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Saparmurat Niyazov, a former official of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, ruled Turkmenistan from 1985, when he became head of the Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR, until his death in 2006. He retained absolute control over the country as President after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On 28 December 1999, Niyazov was declared President for Life of Turkmenistan by the Mejlis (parliament), which itself had taken office a week earlier in elections that included only candidates hand-picked by President Niyazov. No opposition candidates were allowed.

The former Communist Party, now known as the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan, is the dominant party. The second party, the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, was established in August 2012, and an agrarian party appeared two years later. Political gatherings are illegal unless government sanctioned. In 2013, the first multi-party parliamentary elections were held in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan was a one-party state from 1991 to 2012; however, the 2013 elections were widely seen as rigged. In practice, all parties in parliament operate jointly under the direction of the DPT. There are no true opposition parties in the Turkmen parliament.
Since the December 2006 death of Niyazov, Turkmenistan&#x27;s leadership has made tentative moves to open up the country. His successor, President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, repealed some of Niyazov&#x27;s most idiosyncratic policies, including banning operas and circuses for being &quot;insufficiently Turkmen&quot;, though other such rules were later put into place such as the banning of non-white cars. In education, Berdimuhamedow&#x27;s government increased basic education to ten years from nine years, and higher education was extended from four years to five. Berdimuhamedow was succeeded by his son Serdar in 2022.

The politics of Turkmenistan take place in the framework of a presidential republic, with the President both head of state and head of government. Under Niyazov, Turkmenistan had a one-party system; however, in September 2008, the People&#x27;s Council unanimously passed a resolution adopting a new Constitution. The latter resulted in the abolition of the council and a significant increase in the size of Parliament in December 2008 and also permits the formation of multiple political parties.

===Legislature===

The Assembly () is since January 2023 the unicameral legislature of Turkmenistan. Between March 2021 and 21 January 2023 it was the lower house of the now defunct bicameral National Council of Turkmenistan (). It has 125 members, elected for five-year terms in single-seat constituencies.

The People&#x27;s Council of Turkmenistan (, ; &quot;People&#x27;s Council&quot;) is Turkmenistan&#x27;s independent &quot;representative body&quot; exerting supreme constitutional authority. It includes in its membership, but is not considered part of, the legislature. &quot;Inter alia&quot; it is empowered to amend the constitution. Its chairperson is appointed by the president and is designated the &quot;National Leader&quot;. State media referred to the People&#x27;s Council as the &quot;supreme organ of government authority&quot;. From 2018 to 2023 it was the upper chamber of the National Council of Turkmenistan.

Outside observers consider the Turkmen legislature to be a rubber stamp parliament. The 2018 OSCE election observer mission noted,The 25 March elections lacked important prerequisites of a genuinely democratic electoral process. The political environment is only nominally pluralist and does not offer voters political alternatives. Exercise of fundamental freedoms is severely curtailed, inhibiting free expression of the voters&#x27; will. Despite measures to demonstrate transparency, the integrity of elections was not ensured, leaving veracity of results in doubt

===Judiciary===

The judiciary in Turkmenistan is not independent. Under Articles 71 and 100 of the constitution of Turkmenistan, the president appoints all judges, including the chairperson (chief justice) of the Supreme Court, and may dismiss them with the consent of the Parliament. Outside observers consider the Turkmen legislature to be a rubber stamp parliament, and thus despite constitutional guarantees of judicial independence under Articles 98 and 99, the judiciary is &quot;de facto&quot; firmly under presidential control. The chief justice is considered a member of the executive authority of the government and sits on the State Security Council. The U.S. Department of State stated in its 2020-human rights report on Turkmenistan,Although the law provides for an independent judiciary, the executive controls it, and it is subordinate to the executive. There was no legislative review of the president&#x27;s judicial appointments and dismissals. The president had sole authority to dismiss any judge. The judiciary was widely reputed to be corrupt and inefficient.

Many national laws of Turkmenistan have been published online on the Ministry of Justice website.

=== Foreign relations ===
Turkmenistan&#x27;s declaration of &quot;permanent neutrality&quot; was formally recognized by the United Nations in 1995. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov stated that the neutrality would prevent Turkmenistan from participating in multi-national defense organizations, but allows military assistance. Its neutral foreign policy has an important place in the country&#x27;s constitution. Turkmenistan has diplomatic relations with 139 countries, some of the most important partners being Afghanistan, Armenia, Iran, Pakistan and Russia. Turkmenistan is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Economic Cooperation Organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Islamic Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization, International Organization of Turkic Culture and observer member of Organisation of Turkic States.

Turkmenistan is the 83rd most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.

===Military===
The Armed Forces of Turkmenistan (), known informally as the Turkmen National Army () is the national military of Turkmenistan. It consists of the Ground Forces, the Air Force and Air Defense Forces, Navy, and other independent formations (etc. Border Troops, Internal Troops and National Guard).

===Law enforcement===

The national police force in Turkmenistan is mostly governed by the Interior Ministry. The Ministry of National Security (KNB) is the intelligence-gathering asset. The Interior Ministry commands the 25,000 personnel of the national police force directly, while the KNB deals with intelligence and counterintelligence work.

=== Human rights ===

Turkmenistan has been widely criticised for human rights abuses and has imposed severe restrictions on foreign travel for its citizens. Discrimination against the country&#x27;s ethnic minorities remains in practice. Universities have been encouraged to reject applicants with non-Turkmen surnames, especially ethnic Russians. It is forbidden to teach the customs and language of the Baloch, an ethnic minority. The same happens to Uzbeks, though the Uzbek language was formerly taught in some national schools.

According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;Turkmenistan remains one of the world&#x27;s most repressive countries. The country is virtually closed to independent scrutiny, media and religious freedoms are subject to draconian restrictions, and human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisal.&quot;

According to Reporters Without Borders&#x27;s 2014 World Press Freedom Index, Turkmenistan had the 3rd worst press freedom conditions in the world (178/180 countries), just before North Korea and Eritrea. It is considered to be one of the &quot;10 Most Censored Countries&quot;. Each broadcast under Niyazov began with a pledge that the broadcaster&#x27;s tongue will shrivel if he slanders the country, flag, or president.

Religious minorities are discriminated against for conscientious objection and practising their religion by imprisonment, preventing foreign travel, confiscating copies of Christian literature or defamation. Many detainees who have been arrested for exercising their freedom of religion or belief were tortured and subsequently sentenced to imprisonment, many of them without a court decision. Homosexual acts are illegal in Turkmenistan.

The use of the death penalty in the country was suspended in 1999, before being formally abolished in 2008.

=== Restrictions on free and open communication ===

Despite the launch of Turkmenistan&#x27;s first communication satellite, the TurkmenSat 1, in April 2015, the Turkmen government banned all satellite dishes in Turkmenistan the same month. The statement issued by the government indicated that all existing satellite dishes would have to be removed or destroyed—despite the communications receiving antennas having been legally installed since 1995—in an effort by the government to fully block access of the population to many &quot;hundreds of independent international media outlets&quot; which are currently accessible in the country only through satellite dishes, including all leading international news channels in different languages. The main target of this campaign is Radio Azatlyk, the Turkmen-language service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

Internet access is filtered and websites to which the government objects are blocked. Blocked websites include opposition news media, YouTube, many social media sites (including Facebook), and encrypted communications applications. Use of virtual private networks to circumvent censorship is prohibited.

=== Corruption ===
Transparency International&#x27;s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index placed Turkmenistan in a tie with Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo for 169th place globally, between Chad and Equatorial Guinea, with a score of 19 out of 100.

Opposition media and foreign human rights organizations describe Turkmenistan as suffering from rampant corruption. A non-governmental organization, Crude Accountability, has openly called the economy of Turkmenistan a kleptocracy. Opposition and domestic state-controlled media have described widespread bribery in education and law enforcement. In 2019, the national chief of police, Minister of Internal Affairs Isgender Mulikov, was convicted and imprisoned for corruption. In 2020, the deputy prime minister for education and science, Pürli Agamyradow, was dismissed for failure to control bribery in education.

The illegal adoption of abandoned babies in Turkmenistan is blamed on rampant corruption in the agencies involved in the legal adoption process which pushes some parents to a &quot;cheaper and faster&quot; option. One married couple in the eastern Farap district said that they had to provide documents and letters from 40 different agencies to support their adoption application, yet three years later there was still no decision on their bid. Meanwhile, wealthier applicants in Farap received a child for legal adoption within four months after applying because they paid up to 50,000 manats (about $14,300) in bribes.

== Geography ==

At , Turkmenistan is the world&#x27;s 52nd-largest country. It is slightly smaller than Spain and larger than Cameroon. It lies between latitudes 35° and 43° N, and longitudes 52° and 67° E.
Over 80% of the country is covered by the Karakum Desert. The center of the country is dominated by the Turan Depression and the Karakum Desert. Topographically, Turkmenistan is bounded by the Ustyurt Plateau to the north, the Kopet Dag Range to the south, the Paropamyz Plateau, the Koytendag Range to the east, the Amu Darya Valley, and the Caspian Sea to the west. Turkmenistan includes three tectonic regions, the Epigersin platform region, the Alpine shrinkage region, and the Epiplatform orogenesis region. The Alpine tectonic region is the epicenter of earthquakes in Turkmenistan. Strong earthquakes occurred in the Kopet Dag Range in 1869, 1893, 1895, 1929, 1948, and 1994. The city of Ashgabat and surrounding villages were largely destroyed by the 1948 earthquake.

The Kopet Dag Range, along the southwestern border, reaches at Kuh-e Rizeh (Mount Rizeh).

The Great Balkhan Range in the west of the country (Balkan Province) and the Köýtendag Range on the southeastern border with Uzbekistan (Lebap Province) are the only other significant elevations. The Great Balkhan Range rises to at Mount Arlan and the highest summit in Turkmenistan is Ayrybaba in the Kugitangtau Range – . The Kopet Dag mountain range forms most of the border between Turkmenistan and Iran.

Major rivers include the Amu Darya, the Murghab River, the Tejen River, and the Atrek (Etrek) River. Tributaries of the Atrek include the Sumbar River and Chandyr River.

The Turkmen shore along the Caspian Sea is long. The Caspian Sea is entirely landlocked, with no natural access to the ocean, although the Volga–Don Canal allows shipping access to and from the Black Sea.

Major cities include Aşgabat, Türkmenbaşy (formerly Krasnovodsk), Balkanabat, Daşoguz, Türkmenabat, and Mary.

=== Climate, biodiversity and environment ===

Turkmenistan is in a temperate desert zone with a dry continental climate. Remote from the open sea, with mountain ranges to the south and southeast, Turkmenistan&#x27;s climate is characterized by low precipitation, low cloudiness, and high evaporation. Absence of mountains to the north allows cold Arctic air to penetrate southward to the southerly mountain ranges, which in turn block warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean. Limited winter and spring rains are attributable to moist air from the west, originating in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Winters are mild and dry, with most precipitation falling between January and May. The Kopet Dag Range receives the highest level of precipitation.

The Karakum Desert is one of the driest deserts in the world; some places have an average annual precipitation of only . The highest temperature recorded in Ashgabat is and Kerki, an extreme inland city located on the banks of the Amu Darya river, recorded in July 1983, although this value is unofficial. is the highest temperature recorded at Repetek Reserve, recognized as the highest temperature ever recorded in the whole former Soviet Union. Turkmenistan enjoys 235–240 sunny days per year. The average number of degree days ranges from 4500 to 5000 Celsius, sufficient for production of extra long staple cotton.

Turkmenistan contains seven terrestrial ecoregions: Alai-Western Tian Shan steppe, Kopet Dag woodlands and forest steppe, Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert, Caspian lowland desert, Central Asian riparian woodlands, Central Asian southern desert, and Kopet Dag semi-desert.

Turkmenistan&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions per person (17.5 tCO2e) are considerably higher than the OECD average: due mainly to natural gas seepage from oil and gas exploration.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Turkmenistan is divided into five provinces or &quot;welayatlar&quot; (singular &quot;welayat&quot;) and one capital city district. The provinces are subdivided into districts (&quot;etraplar&quot;, sing. &quot;etrap&quot;), which may be either counties or cities. According to the Constitution of Turkmenistan (Article 16 in the 2008 Constitution, Article 47 in the 1992 Constitution), some cities may have the status of &quot;welaýat&quot; (province) or &quot;etrap&quot; (district).

== Economy ==

The country possesses the world&#x27;s fourth largest reserves of natural gas and substantial oil resources.

Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its economy. In 2019, the unemployment rate was estimated to be 4.27%.

Between 1998 and 2002, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt. At the same time, however, the value of total exports rose sharply due to increases in international oil and gas prices. The subsequent collapse of both hydrocarbon and cotton prices in 2014 cut revenues from export sales severely, causing Turkmenistan to run trade deficits from 2015 through 2017. Economic prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty and the burden of foreign debt, coupled with continued low hydrocarbon prices and reduced Chinese purchases of natural gas. One reflection of economic stress is the black-market exchange rate for the Turkmen manat, which though officially set at 3.5 manats to the US dollar, reportedly was trading in November 2022 at 18.5 manats to the dollar.

President Niyazov spent much of the country&#x27;s revenue on extensively renovating cities, Ashgabat in particular. Corruption watchdogs voiced particular concern over the management of Turkmenistan&#x27;s currency reserves, most of which are held in off-budget funds such as the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund in the Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, according to a report released in April 2006 by London-based non-governmental organization Global Witness.

According to a decree of the Peoples&#x27; Council of 14 August 2003, electricity, natural gas, water and salt were to have been subsidized for citizens until 2030. Under implementing regulations, every citizen was entitled to 35 kilowatt hours of electricity and 50 cubic meters of natural gas each month. The state also provided 250 liters (66 gallons) of water per day. As of 1 January 2019, however, all such subsidies were abolished, and payment for utilities was implemented.

=== Natural gas and export routes ===

, the Galkynysh Gas Field was estimated to possess the second-largest volume of gas in the world, after the South Pars field in the Persian Gulf. Reserves at the Galkynysh Gas Field are estimated at 21.2 trillion cubic metres. The Turkmenistan Natural Gas Company (Türkmengaz) controls gas extraction in the country. Gas production is the most dynamic and promising sector of the national economy. In 2009 the government of Turkmenistan began a policy of diversifying export routes for its raw materials.

Prior to 1958, gas production was limited to associated gas from oil wells in western Turkmenistan. In 1958, the first gas wells were drilled at Serhetabat (then Kushky) and at Derweze. Oil and gas fields were discovered in the Central Karakum Desert between 1959 and 1965. In addition to Derweze, these include Takyr, Shyh, Chaljulba, Topjulba, Chemmerli, Atabay, Sakarchage, Atasary, Mydar, Goyun, and Zakli. These fields are located in Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments. The Turkmen gas industry got underway with the opening of the Ojak gas field in 1966. To put this in perspective, associated gas production in Turkmenistan was only 1.157 billion cubic meters in 1965, but by 1970 natural gas production reached 13 billion cubic meters, and by 1989, 90 billion cubic meters. The USSR exported much of this gas to western Europe. Following independence, natural gas extraction fell as Turkmenistan sought export markets but was limited to existing delivery infrastructure under Russian control: Turkmenistan-Russia in two lines (3087 km, originating at Ojak, and another of 2259 km, also originating at Ojak); the Gumdag line (2530 km); and the Shatlyk line (2644 km) to Russia, Ukraine, and the Caucasus. On 1 January 2016, Russia halted natural gas purchases from Turkmenistan after reducing them step by step for the previous years. Russia&#x27;s Gazprom announced resumption of purchases in April 2019, but reported volumes remained low compared to previous delivery levels.

In 1997, the Korpeje-Gurtguy natural gas pipeline was built to Iran. It is 140 kilometers in length and was the first gas pipeline to a foreign customer constructed after independence. Turkmenistan&#x27;s exports of natural gas to Iran, estimated at 12 bcma, ended on 1 January 2017, when Turkmengaz unilaterally cut off deliveries, citing payment arrears.

In December 2009, the first line, Line A, of the Trans-Asia pipeline to China opened, creating a second major market for Turkmen natural gas. By 2015 Turkmenistan was delivering up to 35 billion cubic meters per annum (bcma) to China.

China is the largest buyer of gas from Turkmenistan, via three pipelines linking the two countries through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In 2019, China bought over 30bcm of gas from Turkmenistan, making China Turkmenistan&#x27;s main external source of revenue. In 2023, the Turkmenistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Turkmenistan&#x27;s quota on this pipeline system was 40 bcma.

The East–West pipeline was completed in December 2015, with the intent of delivering up to 30 bcm of natural gas to the Caspian shore for eventual export through a yet-to-be-built Trans-Caspian natural gas pipeline connecting the Belek-1 compressor station in Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan.

The Turkmenistan government continues to pursue construction of the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline, or TAPI. The anticipated cost of the TAPI pipeline is currently estimated at $25 billion. Turkmenistan&#x27;s section of the pipeline was started in 2015 and was completed in 2019, though the Afghanistan and Pakistan sections remain under construction.

6 billion dollars worth of methane, a greenhouse gas which causes climate change, was estimated to leak in 2019/20.

=== Oil ===

Oil was known to exist in western Turkmenistan as early as the 18th century. General Aleksey Kuropatkin reported in 1879 that the Cheleken Peninsula had as many as three thousand oil sources. Turkmen settlers in the 19th century extracted oil near the surface and shipped it to Astrakhan by ship and to Iran by camel caravan. Commercial oil drilling began in the 1890s. The oil extraction industry grew with the exploitation of the fields in Cheleken in 1909 (by Branobel) and in Balkanabat in the 1930s. Production leaped ahead with the discovery of the Gumdag field in 1948 and the Goturdepe field in 1959. By 1940 production had reached two million tons per year, by 1960 over four million tons, and by 1970 over 14 million tons. Oil production in 2019 was 9.8 million tons.

Oil wells are mainly found in the western lowlands. This area also produces associated natural gas. The main oil fields are Cheleken, Gonurdepe, Nebitdag, Gumdag, Barsagelmez, Guyujyk, Gyzylgum, Ordekli, Gogerendag, Gamyshlyja, Ekerem, Chekishler, Keymir, Ekizek, and Bugdayly. Oil is also produced from offshore wells in the Caspian Sea. Most oil is extracted by the Turkmenistan State Company (Concern) Türkmennebit from fields at Goturdepe, Balkanabat, and on the Cheleken Peninsula near the Caspian Sea, which have a combined estimated reserve of 700 million tons. Much of the oil produced in Turkmenistan is refined in the Türkmenbaşy and Seydi refineries. Some oil is exported by tanker vessel across the Caspian Sea en route to Europe via Baku and Makhachkala. Foreign firms involved in offshore oil extraction include Eni S.p.A. of Italy, Dragon Oil of the United Arab Emirates, and Petronas of Malaysia.

On 21 January 2021, the governments of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop an oil field in the Caspian Sea that straddles the nations&#x27; border. Known previously as Kyapaz in Azeri and Serdar in Turkmen, the oil field, now called Dostluk (&quot;friendship&quot; in both languages), potentially has reserves of up to 60 million tons of oil as well as associated natural gas.

=== Energy ===
Turkmenistan&#x27;s first electrical power plant was built in 1909 and went into full operation in 1913. As of 2019 it was still in operation. The original triple-turbine Hindukush hydroelectric plant, built by the Austro-Hungarian company Ganz Works on the Murghab River, was designed to produce 1.2 megawatts at 16.5 kilovolts. Until 1957, however, most electrical power in Turkmenistan was produced locally by small diesel generators and diesel-electric locomotives.

In 1957, Soviet authorities created a republic-level directorate for power generation, and in 1966 Turkmenistan entered the first phase of connecting its remote regions to the regional Central Asian electrical grid. By 1979 all rural areas of Turkmenistan were brought on line. Construction of the Mary thermal power plant began in 1969, and by 1987 the eighth and final generator block was completed, bringing the plant to its design capacity of 1.686 gigawatts. In 1998 Turkmenenergo commissioned its first gas-turbine power plant, using GE turbines.

As of 2010, Turkmenistan featured eight major power plants operating on natural gas, in Mary, Ashgabat, Balkanabat, Buzmeyin (suburb of Ashgabat), Dashoguz, Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenabat, and Seydi. As of 2013, Turkmenistan had 10 electrical power plants equipped with 32 turbines, including 14 steam-driven, 15 gas powered, and 3 hydroelectric. Power output in 2011 was 18.27 billion kWh, of which 2.5 billion kWh was exported. Major power generating installations include the Hindukush Hydroelectric Station, which has a rated capacity of 350 megawatts, and the Mary Thermoelectric Power Station, which has a rated capacity of 1,370 megawatts. In 2018, electrical power production totaled more than 21 billion kilowatt-hours.

Since 2013, additional power plants have been constructed in Mary and Ahal province, and Çärjew District of Lebap province. The Mary-3 combined cycle power plant, built by Çalık Holding with GE turbines, commissioned in 2018, produces 1.574 gigawatts of electrical power and is specifically intended to support expanded exports of electricity to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Zerger power plant built by Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Rönesans Holding in Çärjew District has a design capacity of 432 megawatts from three 144-megawatt gas turbines and was commissioned in September 2021. It is also primarily intended for export of electricity. The Ahal power plant, with capacity of 650 megawatts, was constructed to power the city of Ashgabat and in particular the Olympic Village.

Turkmenistan is a net exporter of electrical power to Central Asian republics and southern neighbors. In 2019, total electrical energy generation in Turkmenistan reportedly totaled 22,521.6 million kilowatt-hours (22.52 terawatt-hours).

=== Agriculture ===

Following independence in 1991, Soviet-era collective- and state farms were converted to &quot;farmers associations&quot; (). Virtually all field crops are irrigated due to the aridity of the climate. The top crop in terms of area planted is wheat (761 thousand hectares in 2019), followed by cotton (551 thousand hectares in 2019).

Turkmenistan is the world&#x27;s tenth-largest cotton producer. Turkmenistan started producing cotton in the Murghab Valley following conquest of Merv by the Russian Empire in 1884. According to human rights organizations, public sector workers, such as teachers and doctors, are required by the government to pick cotton under the threat of losing their jobs if they refuse.

During the 2020 season, Turkmenistan reportedly produced roughly 1.5 million tons of raw cotton. In 2012, around 7,000 tractors, 5,000 cotton cultivators, 2,200 sewing machines and other machinery, mainly procured from Belarus and the United States, were used. Prior to imposition of a ban on export of raw cotton in October 2018, Turkmenistan exported raw cotton to Russia, Iran, South Korea, United Kingdom, China, Indonesia, Turkey, Ukraine, Singapore and the Baltic states. Beginning in 2019, the Turkmenistan government shifted focus to export of cotton yarn and finished textiles and garments.

=== Tourism ===

Turkmenistan reported arrival of 14,438 foreign tourists in 2019. Turkmenistan&#x27;s international tourism has not grown significantly despite creation of the Awaza tourist zone on the Caspian Sea. Every traveler must obtain a visa before entering Turkmenistan (see Visa policy of Turkmenistan). To obtain a tourist visa, citizens of most countries need visa support from a local travel agency. For tourists visiting Turkmenistan, organized tours exist providing visits to historical sites in and near Daşoguz, Konye-Urgench, Nisa, Ancient Merv, and Mary, as well as beach tours to Avaza and medical tours and holidays in the sanatoria in Mollagara, Bayramaly, Ýylysuw and Archman.

In January 2022 President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow ordered that the fire at the Darvaza gas crater, known informally as the country&#x27;s &quot;Gateway to Hell&quot;, and one of Turkmenistan&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, should be extinguished for environmental and health reasons, as well as part of efforts to increase gas exports. A possible explanation for the fire is that a Soviet drilling operation in 1971 caused it; however, in 2013 Canadian explorer George Kourounis examined the crater and believed that no one actually knew how it started.

== Transportation ==
=== Automobile transport ===
Prior to the 1917 Russian Revolution, only three automobiles existed in Turkmenistan, all of them foreign models in Ashgabat. No automobile roads existed between settlements. After the revolution, Soviet authorities graded dirt roads to connect Mary and Kushky (Serhetabat), Tejen and Sarahs, Kyzyl-Arvat (Serdar) with Garrygala (Magtymguly) and Chekishler, i.e., with important border crossings. In 1887–1888 the Gaudan Highway () was built between Ashgabat and the Persian border at Gaudan Pass, and Persian authorities extended it to Mashhad, allowing for easier commercial relations. Municipal bus service began in Ashgabat in 1925 with five routes, and taxicab service began in 1938 with five vehicles. The road network was extended in the 1970s with construction of republic-level highways connecting Ashgabat and Kazanjyk (Bereket), Ashgabat and Bayramaly, Nebit Dag (Balkanabat) and Krasnovodsk (Türkmenbaşy), Çärjew (Turkmenabat) and Kerki, and Mary and Kushka (Serhetabat).

The primary west–east motor route is the M37 highway linking the Turkmenbashy International Seaport to the Farap border crossing via Ashgabat, Mary, and Turkmenabat. The primary north–south route is the Ashgabat-Dashoguz Automobile Road (), built in the 2000s. Major international routes include European route E003, European route E60, European route E121, and Asian Highway (AH) routes AH5, AH70, AH75, AH77, and AH78.

A new toll motorway is under construction between Ashgabat and Turkmenabat by the Turkmen Awtoban company, which will construct the 600-km highway in three phases: Ashgabat-Tejen by December 2020, Tejen-Mary by December 2022 and Mary-Turkmenabat by December 2023. A sister project to link Türkmenbaşy and Ashgabat was suspended when the Turkish contractor Polimeks walked away from the project, reportedly because of non-payment.

As of 29 January 2019, the Turkmen Automobile Roads state concern () was subordinated by presidential decree to the Ministry of Construction and Architecture, and responsibility for road construction and maintenance was shifted to provincial and municipal governments. Operation of motor coaches (buses) and taxicabs is the responsibility of the Automobile Services Agency () of the Ministry of Industry and Communication.

=== Air transport ===
Air service began in 1927 with a route between Çärjew (Turkmenabat) and Tashauz (Dashoguz), flying German Junkers 13 and Soviet K-4 aircraft, each capable of carrying four passengers. In 1932 an aerodrome was built in Ashgabat on the site of the current Howdan neighborhoods, for both passenger and freight service, the latter mainly to deliver supplies to sulfur mines near Derweze in the Karakum Desert.

Airports serving the major cities of Ashgabat, Dashoguz, Mary, Turkmenabat, and Türkmenbaşy, which are operated by Turkmenistan&#x27;s civil aviation authority&#x27;s airline, Türkmenhowaýollary, feature scheduled domestic commercial air service. Under normal circumstances international scheduled commercial air service is limited to Ashgabat. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, international flights take off from and land at Turkmenabat, where quarantine facilities have been established.

State-owned Turkmenistan Airlines is the only Turkmen air carrier. Turkmenistan Airlines&#x27; passenger fleet is composed of Boeing and Bombardier Aerospace aircraft. Air transport carries more than two thousand passengers daily in the country. Under normal conditions, international flights annually transport over half a million people into and out of Turkmenistan, and Turkmenistan Air operates regular flights to Moscow, London, Frankfurt, Birmingham, Bangkok, Delhi, Abu Dhabi, Amritsar, Kyiv, Lviv, Beijing, Istanbul, Minsk, Almaty, Tashkent, and St. Petersburg.

Small airfields serve industrial sites near other cities, but do not feature scheduled commercial passenger service. Airfields slated for modernization and expansion include those serving Garabogaz, Jebel, and Galaýmor. The new Turkmenabat International Airport was commissioned in February 2018. In June 2021, an international airport was opened in Kerki.

=== Maritime transport ===

Since 1962, the Turkmenbashy International Seaport has operated a passenger ferry to the port of Baku, Azerbaijan as well as rail ferries to other ports on the Caspian Sea (Baku, Aktau). In recent years tanker transport of oil to the ports of Baku and Makhachkala has increased.

In May 2018, construction was completed of a major expansion of the Turkmenbashy seaport. Cost of the project was $1.5 billion. The general contractor for the project was Gap Inşaat, a subsidiary of Çalık Holding of Turkey. The expansion added 17 million tons of annual capacity, making total throughput including previously existing facilities of over 25 million tons per year. The international ferry and passenger terminals will be able to serve 300,000 passengers and 75,000 vehicles per year, and the container terminal is designed to handle 400,000 TEU (20-foot container equivalent) per year.

=== Railway transport ===

The first rail line in Turkmenistan was built in 1880, from the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea to Mollagara. By October 1881 the line was extended to Kyzyl-Arvat, by 1886 had reached Çärjew. In 1887 a wooden rail bridge was built over the Amu Darya, and the line was continued to Samarkand (1888) and Tashkent (1898). Rail service in Turkmenistan began as part of Imperial Russia&#x27;s Trans-Caspian Railway, then of the Central Asian Railway. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the railway network in Turkmenistan was transferred to and operated by the state-owned Türkmendemirýollary. The rail gauge is the same as the Russian (and former Soviet) one-1520 millimeters.

The total length of railways is 3181 km. Only domestic passenger service is available, except for special trains operated by tour operators. The railway carries approximately 5.5 million passengers and moves nearly 24 million tons of freight per year.

Turkmen Railways is currently constructing a rail line in Afghanistan to connect Serhetabat to Herat. Upon completion, it may connect to the proposed rail line to connect Herat to Khaf, Iran.

== Demographics ==
The last census to be published in full was held in 1995. Detailed results of every census since then have been kept secret, although a total figure for the 2022 census was released. Available figures indicate that most of Turkmenistan&#x27;s citizens are ethnic Turkmens with sizeable minorities of Uzbeks and Russians. Smaller minorities include Kazakhs, Tatars, Ukrainians, Kurds (native to the Kopet Dagh mountains), Armenians, Azeris, Balochs and Pashtuns. The percentage of ethnic Russians in Turkmenistan dropped from 18.6% in 1939 to 9.5% in 1989. The &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot; estimated the ethnic composition of Turkmenistan in 2003 as 85% Turkmen, 5% Uzbek, 4% Russian and 6% other. According to official data announced in Ashgabat , 91% of the population were Turkmen, 3% were Uzbeks and 2% were Russians. Between 1989 and 2001 the number of Turkmen in Turkmenistan doubled (from 2.5 to 4.9 million), while the number of Russians dropped by two-thirds (from 334,000 to slightly over 100,000). As of 2021, the number of Russians in Turkmenistan was estimated at 100,000.
Opposition media reported that some results of the 2012 census had been surreptitiously released, including a total population number of 4,751,120. According to this source, as of 2012 85.6% of the population was ethnically Turkmen, followed by 5.8% ethnic Uzbek and 5.1% ethnic Russian. In contrast, an official Turkmen delegation reported to the UN in January 2015 some different figures on national minorities, including slightly under 9% ethnic Uzbek, 2.2% ethnic Russian, and 0.4% ethnic Kazakh. The 2012 census reportedly counted 58 different nationalities.

Official population estimates are likely too high, given known emigration trends. Population growth has been offset by emigration in search of permanent employment. In July 2021 opposition media reported, based on three independent anonymous sources, that the population of Turkmenistan was between 2.7 and 2.8 million.

A once-in-a-decade national census was conducted 17–27 December 2022. Opposition media reported that many people claimed not to have been interviewed by census workers, or that census workers merely telephoned respondents, and did not visit them to count residents. According to the official results of the 2022 census published in July 2023, the population of Turkmenistan was 7,057,841. However, offshore media disputed that figure, with one source claiming it came out of &quot;thin air&quot;.

===Migration===

Based on data from receiving countries, MeteoZhurnal estimated that at least 102,346 Turkmenistani citizens emigrated abroad in 2019, 78% of them to Turkey, and 24,206 apparently returned home, for net migration of 77,014. According to leaked results of a 2018 survey, between 2008 and 2018 1,879,413 Turkmenistani citizens emigrated permanently out of an estimated base population of 5.4 million. Deputy Foreign Minister Vepa Hajiyev stated publicly in August 2023 that in 2022 267,330 Turkmenistan citizens had traveled abroad, but without indicating either how many of these had emigrated or how many had returned.

===Turkmen tribes===

The tribal nature of Turkmen society is well documented. The major modern Turkmen tribes are Teke, Yomut, Ersari, Chowdur, Gokleng and Saryk. The most numerous are the Teke.

=== Languages ===
Turkmen is the official language of Turkmenistan (per the 1992 Constitution), a language that shares to some degree mutual intelligibility with Azerbaijani and Turkish. Since the late 20th century, the government of Turkmenistan has taken steps to distance itself from the Russian language (which has been seen as a soft power tool for Russian interests). The first step in this campaign was the shift to the Latin alphabet in 1993, and Russian lost its status as the &quot;language of inter-ethnic communication&quot; in 1996. As of 1999, Turkmen was spoken by 72% of the population, Russian by 12% (349,000), Uzbek by 9% (317,000), and other languages by 7% (Kazakh (88,000), Tatar (40,400), Ukrainian (37,118), Azerbaijani (33,000), Armenian (32,000), Northern Kurdish (20,000), Lezgian (10,400), Persian (8,000), Belarusian (5,290), Erzya (3,490), Korean (3,490), Bashkir (2,610), Karakalpak (2,540), Ossetic (1,890), Dargwa (1,600), Lak (1,590), Tajik (1,280), Georgian (1,050), Lithuanian (224), Tabasaran (180), and Dungan).

=== Religion ===

According to The World Factbook, Muslims constitute 93% of the population while 6% of the population are followers of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the remaining 1% religion is reported as &quot;non-religious.&quot; According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 93.1% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s population is Muslim.

The first migrants were sent as missionaries and often were adopted as patriarchs of particular clans or tribal groups, thereby becoming their &quot;founders.&quot; Reformulation of communal identity around such figures accounts for one of the highly localized developments of Islamic practice in Turkmenistan.

In the Soviet era, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and &quot;vestiges of the past.&quot; Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. However, since 1990, efforts have been made to regain some of the cultural heritage lost under Soviet rule.

Former president Saparmurat Niyazov ordered that basic Islamic principles be taught in public schools. More religious institutions, including religious schools and mosques, have appeared, many with the support of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Turkey. Under Niyazov, religious classes were held in both schools and mosques, with instruction in Arabic language, the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith, and history of Islam. At present, the only educational institution teaching religion is the theological faculty of Turkmen State University.

President Niyazov wrote his own religious text, published in separate volumes in 2001 and 2004, entitled the &quot;Ruhnama&quot; (&quot;Book of the Soul&quot;). The Turkmenbashy regime required that the book, which formed the basis of the educational system in Turkmenistan, be given equal status with the Quran (mosques were required to display the two books side by side). The book was heavily promoted as part of the former president&#x27;s personality cult, and knowledge of the &quot;Ruhnama&quot; was required even for obtaining a driver&#x27;s license. Quotations from the &quot;Ruhnama&quot; are inscribed on the walls of the Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque, which many Muslims consider sacrilegious.

Most Christians in Turkmenistan belong to Eastern Orthodoxy (about 5% of the population). There are 12 Russian Orthodox churches in Turkmenistan, four of which are in Ashgabat. An archpriest resident in Ashgabat leads the Orthodox Church within the country. Until 2007 Turkmenistan fell under the religious jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox archbishop in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but since then has been subordinate to the Archbishop of Pyatigorsk and Cherkessia. There are no Russian Orthodox seminaries in Turkmenistan.

There are also small communities of the following denominations: the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Pentecostal Christians, the Protestant Word of Life Church, the Greater Grace World Outreach Church, the New Apostolic Church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Jews, and several unaffiliated, nondenominational evangelical Christian groups. In addition, there are small communities of Baháʼís, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and Hare Krishnas.

The history of Baháʼí Faith in Turkmenistan is as old as the religion itself, and Baháʼí communities still exist today. The first Baháʼí House of Worship was built in Ashgabat at the beginning of the twentieth century. It was seized by the Soviets in the 1920s and converted to an art gallery. It was heavily damaged in the earthquake of 1948 and later demolished. The site was converted to a public park.

The Russian Academy of Sciences has identified many instances of syncretic influence of pre-Islamic Turkic belief systems on practice of Islam among Turkmen.

== Culture ==
The Turkmen people have traditionally been nomads and equestrians; even today after the fall of the USSR, attempts to urbanize the Turkmens have not been very successful. They never really formed a coherent nation or ethnic group until they were forged into one by Joseph Stalin in the 1930s. Turkmen are divided into clans, and each clan has its own dialect and style of dress. Turkmens are famous for making &quot;knotted Turkmen carpets&quot;, often mistakenly called &quot;Bukhara rugs&quot; in the West. These are elaborate and colorful hand-knotted carpets, which help indicate the distinctions among the various Turkmen clans. Ethnic groups throughout the region build yurts, circular houses with dome roofs, made of a wooden frame covered in felt from the hides of sheep or other livestock. Horses play a vital role in various recreational pursuits across the region, from the horse racing to horseback fighting, where skilled riders attempt to unseat their opponents.

Turkmen men wear traditional &quot;telpek&quot; or &quot;mekan telpek&quot; hats, which are large black or white sheepskin hats. Traditional dress for men consists of these high, shaggy sheepskin hats and red robes over white shirts. Women wear long sack-dresses over narrow trousers (the pants are trimmed with a band of embroidery at the ankle). Female headdresses usually consist of silver jewelry. Bracelets and brooches are set with semi-precious stones.

=== Mass media ===
Newspapers and monthly magazines are published by state-controlled media outlets, primarily in Turkmen. The daily official newspaper is published in both Turkmen (&quot;Türkmenistan&quot;) and Russian (&quot;Нейтральный Туркменистан&quot;). Two online news portals repeat official content, Turkmenportal and Parahat.info, in addition to the official &quot;Golden Age&quot; (, ) news website, which is available in Turkmen, Russian, and English. Two Ashgabat-based private news organizations, Infoabad and Arzuw, offer online content.

Articles published by the state-controlled newspapers are heavily censored and written to glorify the state and its leader. Uncensored press coverage specific to Turkmenistan is provided only by news organizations located outside Turkmenistan: Azatlyk Radiosy, the Turkmen service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty based in Prague; Chronicles of Turkmenistan, the Vienna-based outlet of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights; Turkmen.news, previously known as Alternative News of Turkmenistan, based in the Netherlands; and Gündogar. In addition, Mediazona Central Asia, Eurasianet and Central Asia News provide some reporting on events in Turkmenistan.

Turkmenistan currently broadcasts eight national TV channels via satellite. They are Altyn Asyr, Ýaşlyk, Miras, Turkmenistan (in seven languages), Türkmen Owazy (music), Aşgabat, Turkmenistan Sport and Arkadag. There are no commercial or private TV stations. The nightly official news broadcast, &quot;Watan&quot; (Homeland), is available on YouTube.
Although officially banned, widespread use of satellite dish receivers allows access to foreign programming, particularly outside Ashgabat. Due to the high mutual intelligibility of the Turkmen and Turkish languages, Turkish-language programs have grown in popularity despite official efforts to discourage viewership.

Internet services are the least developed in Central Asia. Access to Internet services is provided by the government&#x27;s ISP company, Turkmentelekom. As of 27 January 2021, Turkmenistan reported an estimated 1,265,794 internet users, or roughly 21% of the total population.

=== Holidays ===

Holidays in Turkmenistan are laid out in the Constitution of Turkmenistan. Holidays in Turkmenistan practiced internationally include New Year&#x27;s Day, Nowruz, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. Turkmenistan exclusive holidays include Melon Day, Turkmen Woman&#x27;s Day, and the Day of Remembrance for Saparmurat Niyazov.

=== Education ===
Education is universal and mandatory through the secondary level. Under former President Niyazov, the total duration of primary and secondary education was reduced from 10 to 9 years. President Berdimuhamedov restored 10-year education as of the 2007–2008 school year. Effective 2013, general education in Turkmenistan was expanded to three-stages lasting 12 years: elementary school (grades 1–3), high school – the first cycle of secondary education with duration of 5 years (grades 4–8), and secondary school (grades 9–12).

At the end of the 2019–20 academic year, nearly 80,000 Turkmen pupils graduated from high school. As of the 2019–20 academic year, 12,242 of these students were admitted to institutions of higher education in Turkmenistan. An additional 9,063 were admitted to the country&#x27;s 42 vocational colleges. An estimated 95,000 Turkmen students were enrolled in institutions of higher education abroad as of Autumn 2019.

=== Architecture ===

The tasks for modern Turkmen architecture are diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect&#x27;s own artistic style, and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Most major new buildings, especially those in Ashgabat, are faced with white marble. Major projects such as Turkmenistan Tower, Bagt köşgi, Alem Cultural and Entertainment Center, Ashgabat Flagpole have transformed the country&#x27;s skyline and promote its identity as a modern, contemporary city.

=== Sports ===

The most popular sport in Turkmenistan is football. The national team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. However, the team has appeared twice at the AFC Asian Cup, in 2004 and 2019; they failed to advance past the group stage in both editions. Another popular sport is archery; Turkmenistan holds league and local competitions for archery. International sports events hosted in Turkmenistan include; the 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games and the 2018 World Weightlifting Championships.

<text>Master-checker or master/checker is a hardware-supported fault tolerance architecture for multiprocessor systems, in which two processors, referred to as the &quot;master&quot; and &quot;checker&quot;, calculate the same functions in parallel in order to increase the probability that the result is exact. The checker CPU is synchronised at clock level with the master CPU and processes the same programs as the master. Whenever the master CPU generates an output, the checker CPU compares this output to its own calculation and in the event of a difference raises a warning.

The master-checker system generally gives more accurate answers by ensuring that the answer is correct before passing it on to the application requesting the algorithm being completed. It also allows for error handling if the results are inconsistent. A recurrence of discrepancies between the two processors could indicate a flaw in the software, hardware problems, or timing issues between the clock, CPUs, and/or system memory. However, such redundant processing wastes time and energy. If the master-CPU is correct 95% or more of the time, the power and time used by the checker-CPU to verify answers is wasted. Depending on the merit of a correct answer, a checker-CPU may or may not be warranted. In order to alleviate some of the cost in these situations, the checker-CPU may be used to calculate something else in the same algorithm, increasing the speed and processing output of the CPU system.

<doc id="198152" wikidata="Q2858593" url="?curid=198152" title="Appalachian Mountain Club">
<text>Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) is the oldest outdoor group in the United States. Created in 1876 to explore and preserve the White Mountains in New Hampshire, it has expanded throughout the northeastern U.S., with 12 chapters stretching from Maine to Washington, D.C. The AMC&#x27;s 90,000 members, its advocates, and supporters () mix outdoor recreation, particularly hiking and backpacking, with environmental activism. Additional activities include cross-country skiing, whitewater and flatwater canoeing and kayaking, sea kayaking, sailing, rock climbing and bicycle riding. The Club has about 2,700 volunteers, who lead roughly 7,000 trips and activities per year. The organization publishes a number of books, guides, and trail maps.

==History==
Appalachian Mountain Club was organized in 1876, incorporated in 1878, and authorized by legislative act of 1894 to hold mountain and forest lands as historic sites. The club was formed by the efforts of Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Edward Charles Pickering and Samuel Hubbard Scudder, who invited fellow Boston academics and vacationers to form a group interested in mountain exploration. The club aims to preserve the beauty of mountain forests, waters, historic sites and resorts; to render them attractive to visitors and excursionists; to publish accurate maps thereof; and to collect scientific data concerning the mountains. The group helped map the White Mountains and in 1888 built the first of eight High Huts in the range, modeled on Alpine shelters.

Though it&#x27;s the oldest mountain club in America, the AMC was preceded by the Rocky Mountain Club (1875), White Mountain Club (1873), the Alpine Club of Williamstown (1863), and The Exploring Circle (1850). Each of these were short-lived organizations.

In 2003, Appalachian Mountain Club purchased of land east of Moosehead Lake and southwest of Baxter State Park, along the 100-Mile Wilderness portion of the Appalachian Trail, as part of their Maine Woods Initiative. It has converted the Katahdin Iron Works portion of the purchase to a nature preserve, logged a portion, and runs a sporting camp called Little Lyford Pond camps about two miles (3 km) off the trail. The Club purchased an adjacent , including Baker Mountain, in 2015, and is considering purchasing more sporting camps in the vicinity.

In 2011, the Appalachian Mountain Club opened the newly built Gorman Chairback Lodge.

In September 2016, the Appalachian Mountain Club sold their Joy Street headquarters to a group of real estate investors for $15 million, who planned to turn the 22,000 square feet of office space on Beacon Hill into residential units. In December 2016, The Appalachian Mountain Club purchased Roughan Hall in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, and moved their headquarters there in September 2017.

In 2022, the AMC purchased another adjacent to their previous holdings near the 100 Mile Wilderness, bringing the total to over of contiguous land.

== Organization ==
Appalachian Mountain Club&#x27;s headquarters is located in Roughan Hall at 10 City Square in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, with an adjunct facility at 6 Spice St.

Appalachian Mountain Club employed 755 individuals in 2022. AMC estimated that 5,000 individuals volunteered for the organization in 2022.

In 2022, the Appalachian Mountain Club earned over $14.7 million from its outdoor program centers, educational activities, membership dues, trail activities, and advertising. Sale of products netted over $1.2 million, rental income netted a loss of $0.6 million, investment income was over $2.2 million, and charitable contributions and grants received were almost $30.3 million.

Appalachian Mountain Club has twelve chapters located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington, D.C. The largest chapter is the Boston chapter, with over 20,000 members, followed by the New Hampshire chapter with over 12,000 members, and the New York-North Jersey chapter with over 10,000 members.

== Activities ==

=== The High Huts ===

Appalachian Mountain Club owns and maintains a series of eight mountain huts in the White Mountains. Modeled after similar shelters in the Alps, the various huts hold between 36 and 90 people. Hikers may reserve bunks; at most huts dinner and breakfast are included.

The huts&#x27; 30-year special use permits were renewed by the U.S. Forest Service in 1999 following a four-year process that included an environmental impact statement.

=== Campsites and shelters ===
The Appalachian Mountain Club also operates many campsites and shelters in the White Mountains, the Mahoosucs, and other New England locations. These campsites are often run by caretakers who manage waste, fees, and nearby trails. Nine of the highest use campsites have a $15 per person fee: Kinsman Pond, Liberty Spring, Garfield Ridge, 13 Falls, Guyot, Ethan Pond, Nauman, Imp, and Speck Pond.

=== Activities ===
The majority of the AMC&#x27;s activities are conducted by its members who volunteer to lead trips throughout the northeast, from Maine to DC. Activities include hiking, backpacking, paddling, biking, rock climbing, camping, skiing, and snowshoeing, ranging in duration from a day to a week. Additional long-duration domestic and international trips are conducted through the AMC&#x27;s Adventure Travel program.

=== Trails ===
The club also operates several trails operations. The Volunteer for Trails program brings teens and adults on day to week long programs teaching trail building and maintenance techniques based out of Camp Dodge in Pinkham Notch. The Roving Conservation Crew is a small crew which works on both backcountry and frontcountry projects around New England. The White Mountain Professional Trail Crew focuses on trail projects within the White Mountains, and the Maine Woods Professional Crew focuses on projects in Maine.

=== The Four Thousand Footer Club ===
A committee of Appalachian Mountain Club administers the Four Thousand Footer Club. Anyone who has climbed to and from each of the 48 New Hampshire Four-thousand footers is eligible to apply for membership to the club. Members are given a patch and new inductees are invited to attend a yearly celebration dinner. The Four Thousand Footer Club also recognizes individuals who complete the New England Four Thousand Footers (of which there are 67) and the New England Hundred Highest.

=== Publications ===
&quot;Appalachia&quot;, the club journal, has been published since 1876. Books relating to subjects such as mountaineering and touring trips are published under the auspices of the society.

==National Register of Historic Places==
The Club&#x27;s Ponkapoag Camp is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="198153" wikidata="Q843389" url="?curid=198153" title="Canning">
<text>Canning is a method of food preservation in which food is processed and sealed in an airtight container (jars like Mason jars, and steel and tin cans). Canning provides a shelf life that typically ranges from one to five years, although under specific circumstances, it can be much longer. A freeze-dried canned product, such as canned dried lentils, could last as long as 30 years in an edible state.

In 1974, samples of canned food from the wreck of the &quot;Bertrand&quot;, a steamboat that sank in the Missouri River in 1865, were tested by the National Food Processors Association. Although appearance, smell, and vitamin content had deteriorated, there was no trace of microbial growth and the 109-year-old food was determined to be still safe to eat.

==History and development==

===French origins===
Shortly before the Napoleonic Wars, the French government offered a hefty cash award of 12,000 francs to any inventor who could devise a cheap and effective method of preserving large amounts of food to create well-preserved military rations for the Grande Armée. The larger armies of the period required increased and regular supplies of quality food. Limited food availability was among the factors limiting military campaigns to the summer and autumn months. In 1809, Nicolas Appert, a French confectioner and brewer, observed that food cooked inside a jar did not spoil unless the seals leaked, and developed a method of sealing food in glass jars. Appert was awarded the prize in 1810 by Count Montelivert, a French minister of the interior. The reason for lack of spoilage was unknown at the time, since it would be another 50 years before Louis Pasteur demonstrated the role of microbes in food spoilage and developed pasteurization.

The Grande Armée began experimenting with issuing canned foods to its soldiers, but the slow process of canning and the even slower development and transport stages prevented the army from shipping large amounts across the French Empire, and the wars ended before the process was perfected.

Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the canning process was gradually employed in other European countries and the United States.

===In the United Kingdom===
Based on Appert&#x27;s methods of food preservation, the tin can process was allegedly developed by Frenchman Philippe de Girard, who came to London and used British merchant Peter Durand as an agent to patent his own idea in 1810. Durand did not pursue food canning himself, selling his patent in 1811 to Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who were in business as Donkin Hall and Gamble, of Bermondsey. Bryan Donkin developed the process of packaging food in sealed airtight cans, made of tinned wrought iron. Initially, the canning process was slow and labour-intensive, as each large can had to be hand-made, and took up to six hours to cook, making canned food too expensive for ordinary people.

The main market for the food at this stage was the British Army and Royal Navy. By 1817, Donkin recorded that he had sold £3000 (equal to £ today) worth of canned meat in six months. In 1824, Sir William Edward Parry took canned beef and pea soup with him on his voyage to the Arctic in HMS &quot;Fury&quot;, during his search for a northwestern passage to India. In 1829, Admiral Sir James Ross also took canned food to the Arctic, as did Sir John Franklin in 1845. Some of his stores were found by the search expedition led by Captain (later Admiral Sir) Leopold McClintock in 1857. One of these cans was opened in 1939 and was edible and nutritious, though it was not analysed for contamination by the lead solder used in its manufacture.

===In Europe===

During the mid-19th century, canned food became a status symbol among middle-class households in Europe, being something of a frivolous novelty. Early methods of manufacture employed poisonous lead solder for sealing the cans. Studies in the 1980s attributed the lead from the cans as a factor in the disastrous outcome of the 1845 Franklin expedition to chart and navigate the Northwest Passage. However, studies in 2013 and 2016 suggested that lead poisoning was likely not a factor, and that the crew&#x27;s ill health may, in fact, have been due to malnutrition—specifically zinc deficiency—possibly due to a lack of meat in their diet.

Increasing mechanization of the canning process, coupled with a huge increase in urban populations across Europe, resulted in a rising demand for canned food. A number of inventions and improvements followed, and by the 1860s smaller machine-made steel cans were possible, and the time to cook food in sealed cans had been reduced from around six hours to thirty minutes.

===In the United States===

Canned food also began to spread beyond Europe—Robert Ayars established the first American canning factory in New York City in 1812, using improved tin-plated wrought-iron cans for preserving oysters, meats, fruits, and vegetables. Demand for canned food greatly increased during wars. Large-scale wars in the nineteenth century, such as the Crimean War, American Civil War, and Franco-Prussian War, introduced increasing numbers of working-class men to canned food, and allowed canning companies to expand their businesses to meet military demands for non-perishable food, enabling companies to manufacture in bulk and sell to wider civilian markets after wars ended. Urban populations in Victorian Britain demanded ever-increasing quantities of cheap, varied, quality food that they could keep at home without having to go shopping daily. In response, companies such as Underwood, Nestlé, Heinz, and others provided quality canned food for sale to working class city-dwellers. The late 19th century saw the range of canned food available to urban populations greatly increase, as canners competed with each other using novel foodstuffs, highly decorated printed labels, and lower prices.

===World War I===
Demand for canned food skyrocketed during World War I, as military commanders sought vast quantities of cheap, high-calorie food to feed their millions of soldiers, which could be transported safely, survive trench conditions, and not spoil in transport. Throughout the war, British soldiers generally subsisted on low-quality canned food, such as the British bully beef, pork and beans, canned sausages, and Maconochie&#x27;s stew, but by 1916, widespread dissatisfaction and increasing complaints about the poor quality canned food among soldiers resulted in militaries seeking better-quality food to improve morale, and complete meals-in-a-can began to appear. In 1917, the French Army began issuing canned French cuisine such as coq au vin, beef bourguignon, french onion soup, and Vichyssoise, while the Italian Army experimented with canned ravioli, spaghetti bolognese, minestrone, and pasta e fagioli. After the war, companies that had supplied military canned food began to improve the quality of their goods for civilian sale.

==Methods==
The original fragile and heavy glass containers presented challenges for transportation, and glass jars were largely replaced in commercial canneries with cylindrical tin can or wrought-iron canisters (later shortened to &quot;cans&quot;) following the work of Peter Durand (1810). Cans are cheaper and quicker to make, and much less fragile than glass jars.

Can openers were not invented for another thirty years. At first, soldiers would cut the cans open with bayonets or smash them open with rocks. Today, tin-coated steel is the material most commonly used. Aseptically processed retort pouches are also used for canning.

Glass jars have remained popular for some high-value products and in home canning.

=== Microbial control ===
To prevent the food from being spoiled before and during containment, a number of methods are used: pasteurisation, boiling (and other applications of high temperature over a period of time), refrigeration, freezing, drying, vacuum treatment, antimicrobial agents that are natural to the recipe of the foods being preserved, a sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, submersion in a strong saline solution, acid, base, osmotically extreme (for example very sugary) or other microbially-challenging environments.

Other than sterilization, no method is perfectly dependable as a preservative. Sterilization is done after the can is sealed, so that both the container and the food are secured.

The spores of the microorganism &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; (which causes botulism) can be eliminated only at temperatures above the boiling point of water. As a result, from a public safety point of view, foods with low acidity (a pH more than 4.6) need sterilization under high temperature (116–130 °C). To achieve temperatures above the boiling point requires the use of a pressure canner. Foods that must be pressure canned include most vegetables, meat, seafood, poultry, and dairy products. The only foods that may be safely canned in an ordinary boiling water bath are highly acidic ones with a pH below 4.6, such as fruits, pickled vegetables, or other foods to which acidic additives have been added. Although an ordinary boiling temperature does not kill botulism spores, the acidity is enough to stop them from growing.

===Sealing: double seams===

Invented in 1888 by Max Ams, modern double seams provide an airtight seal to a can. This airtight nature is crucial to keeping micro-organisms out of the can and keeping the can&#x27;s contents sealed inside. Thus, double seamed cans are also known as Sanitary Cans. Developed in 1900 in Europe, this sort of can was made of the traditional cylindrical body made with tin plate. The two ends (lids) were attached using what is now called a double seam. A can thus sealed is impervious to contamination by creating two tight continuous folds between the can&#x27;s cylindrical body and the lids. This eliminated the need for solder and allowed improvements in manufacturing speed, reducing cost.

Double seaming uses rollers to shape the can, lid and the final double seam. To make a sanitary can and lid suitable for double seaming, manufacture begins with a sheet of coated tin plate. To create the can body, rectangles are cut and curled around a die, and welded together creating a cylinder with a side seam.

Rollers are then used to flare out one or both ends of the cylinder to create a quarter circle flange around the circumference. Precision is required to ensure that the welded sides are perfectly aligned, as any misalignment will cause inconsistent flange shape, compromising its integrity.

A circle is then cut from the sheet using a die cutter. The circle is shaped in a stamping press to create a downward countersink to fit snugly into the can body. The result can be compared to an upside down and very flat top hat. The outer edge is then curled down and around about 140 degrees using rollers to create the end curl.

The result is a steel tube with a flanged edge, and a countersunk steel disc with a curled edge. A rubber compound is put inside the curl.

====Seaming====

The body and end are brought together in a seamer and held in place by the base plate and chuck, respectively. The base plate provides a sure footing for the can body during the seaming operation and the chuck fits snugly into the end (lid). The result is the countersink of the end sits inside the top of the can body just below the flange. The end curl protrudes slightly beyond the flange.

====First operation====
Once brought together in the seamer, the seaming head presses a first operation roller against the end curl. The end curl is pressed against the flange curling it in toward the body and under the flange. The flange is also bent downward, and the end and body are now loosely joined. The first operation roller is then retracted. At this point five thicknesses of steel exist in the seam. From the outside in they are:
* End
* Body hook
* Cover hook
* Body
* Countersink

====Second operation====
The seaming head then engages the second operation roller against the partly formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly to form the final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.

Probably the most important innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.

====Seamer setup and quality assurance====
Many different parts during the seaming process are critical in ensuring that a can is airtight and vacuum sealed. The dangers of a can that is not hermetically sealed are contamination by foreign objects (bacteria or fungicide sprays), or that the can could leak or spoil.

One important part is the seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. among the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a clearance gauge). The lifter pressure and position, roll and chuck designs, tooling wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good double seam.

Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, due to the springback effect, a seam can appear loose, when in reality it was closed too tight and has opened up like a spring. For this reason, experienced operators and good seamer setup are critical to ensure that double seams are properly closed.

Quality control usually involves taking full cans from the line – one per seamer head, at least once or twice per shift, and performing a teardown operation (wrinkle/), mechanical tests (external thickness, seamer length/height and countersink) as well as cutting the seam open with a twin blade saw and measuring with a double seam inspection system. The combination of these measurements will determine the seam&#x27;s quality.

Use of a statistical process control (SPC) software in conjunction with a manual double-seam monitor, computerized double seam scanner, or even a fully automatic double seam inspection system makes the laborious process of double seam inspection faster and much more accurate. Statistically tracking the performance of each head or seaming station of the can seamer allows for better prediction of can seamer issues, and may be used to plan maintenance when convenient, rather than to simply react after bad or unsafe cans have been produced.

==Nutritional value==

Canning is a way of processing food to extend its shelf life. The idea is to make food available and edible long after the processing time. A 1997 study found that canned fruits and vegetables are as rich with dietary fiber and vitamins as the same corresponding fresh or frozen foods, and in some cases the canned products are richer than their fresh or frozen counterparts. The heating process during canning appears to make dietary fiber more soluble, and therefore more readily fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active byproducts. Canned tomatoes have a higher available lycopene content. Consequently, canned meat and vegetables are often among the list of food items that are stocked during emergencies.

==Potential hazards==

In the beginning of the 19th century the process of canning foods was mainly done by small canneries. These canneries were full of overlooked sanitation problems, such as poor hygiene and unsanitary work environments. Since the refrigerator did not exist and industrial canning standards were not set in place it was very common for contaminated cans to slip onto the grocery store shelves.

According to &quot;The Fruits of Empire: Art, Food and the Politics of Race in the Age of American Expansion&quot; by Shana Klein, &quot;Workers also suffered injuries, specifically bruised knuckles and open sores, from trimming and packaging pineapples. Gloves were one preventative measure to protect a canner&#x27;s hands from the acidity of the pineapple, but gloves did not always help.&quot;

===Migration of can components===
In canning toxicology, &quot;migration&quot; is the movement of substances from the can itself into the contents. Potential toxic substances that can migrate are lead, causing lead poisoning, or bisphenol A (BPA), a potential endocrine disruptor that is an ingredient in the epoxy commonly used to coat the inner surface of cans. Some cans are manufactured with a BPA-free enamel lining produced from plant oils and resins. In February 2018, the Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade association in the United States, surveyed the industry and reported that at least 90% of food cans no longer contained BPA.

===Salt content===
Salt (sodium chloride), dissolved in water, is used in the canning process, which helps prevent spoilage and can improve sensory characteristics. As a result, canned food can be a major source of dietary salt. Too much salt increases the risk of health problems, including high blood pressure. Therefore, health authorities have recommended limitations of dietary sodium. Many canned products are available in low-salt and no-salt alternatives.

Rinsing thoroughly after opening may reduce the amount of salt in canned vegetables, since much of the salt content is thought to be in the liquid, rather than the food itself.

===Botulism===

Foodborne botulism results from contaminated foodstuffs in which &quot;C. botulinum&quot; spores have been allowed to germinate and produce botulism toxin, and this typically occurs in canned non-acidic food substances that have not received a strong enough thermal heat treatment. &quot;C. botulinum&quot; prefers low oxygen environments and is a poor competitor to other bacteria, but its spores are resistant to thermal treatments. When a canned food is sterilized insufficiently, most other bacteria besides the &quot;C. botulinum&quot; spores are killed, and the spores can germinate and produce botulism toxin. Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness, leading to paralysis that typically starts with the muscles of the face and then spreads towards the limbs. The botulinum toxin is extremely dangerous because it cannot be detected by sight or smell, and ingestion of even a small amount of the toxin can be deadly. In severe forms, it leads to paralysis of the breathing muscles and causes respiratory failure. In view of this life-threatening complication, all suspected cases of botulism are treated as medical emergencies, and public health officials are usually involved to prevent further cases from the same source.

==Canning and economic recession==
Canned goods and canning supplies sell particularly well in times of recession due to the tendency of financially stressed individuals to engage in cocooning, a term used by retail analysts to describe the phenomenon in which people choose to stay at home instead of adding expenditures to their budget by dining out and socializing outside the home.. Also, some people may become preppers and proceed to stockpile canned food. A doomer would also be interested in stockpiling canned food upon learning about a recession.

In February 2009 during a recession, the United States saw an 11.5% rise in sales of canning-related items.

Some communities in the US have county canning centers which are available for teaching canning, or shared community kitchens which can be rented for canning one&#x27;s own foods.

<text>The beak, bill, or [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] is an external anatomical structure found mostly in birds, but also in turtles, non-avian dinosaurs and a few mammals. A beak is used for pecking, , and holding (in for food, eating, manipulating and carrying objects, killing prey, or fighting), preening, courtship, and feeding young. The terms &quot;beak&quot; and &quot;rostrum&quot; are also used to refer to a similar mouth part in some ornithischians, pterosaurs, cetaceans, dicynodonts, rhynchosaurs, anuran tadpoles, monotremes (i.e. echidnas and platypuses, which have a bill-like structure), sirens, pufferfish, billfishes, and cephalopods.

Although beaks vary significantly in size, shape, color and texture, they share a similar underlying structure. Two bony projections–the upper and lower mandibles–are covered with a thin keratinized layer of epidermis known as the rhamphotheca. In most species, two holes called &quot;nares&quot; lead to the respiratory system.

==Etymology==
Although the word &quot;beak&quot; was, in the past, generally restricted to the sharpened bills of birds of prey, in modern ornithology, the terms beak and bill are generally considered to be synonymous. The word, which dates from the 13th century, comes from the Middle English &quot;bec&quot; (via Anglo French), which itself comes from the Latin &quot;beccus&quot;.

==Anatomy==

Although beaks vary significantly in size and shape from species to species, their underlying structures have a similar pattern. All beaks are composed of two jaws, generally known as the maxilla (upper) and mandible (lower). The upper, and in some cases the lower, mandibles are strengthened internally by a complex three-dimensional network of bony spicules (or trabeculae) seated in soft connective tissue and surrounded by the hard outer layers of the beak. The avian jaw apparatus is made up of two units: one four-bar linkage mechanism and one five-bar linkage mechanism.

===Mandibles===

The upper mandible is supported by a three-pronged bone called the intermaxillary. The upper prong of this bone is embedded into the forehead, while the two lower prongs attach to the sides of the skull. At the base of the upper mandible a thin sheet of nasal bones is attached to the skull at the nasofrontal hinge, which gives mobility to the upper mandible, allowing it to move upward and downward.

The base of the upper mandible, or the roof when seen from the mouth, is the palate; the palate&#x27;s structure differs greatly in the ratites. Here, the vomer is large and connects with premaxillae and maxillopalatine bones in a condition termed as a &quot;paleognathous palate&quot;. All other extant birds have a narrow forked vomer that does not connect with other bones and is then termed as neognathous. The shape of these bones varies across the bird families.

The lower mandible is supported by a bone known as the inferior maxillary bone—a compound bone composed of two distinct ossified pieces. These ossified plates (or rami), which can be U-shaped or V-shaped, join distally (the exact location of the joint depends on the species) but are separated proximally, attaching on either side of the head to the quadrate bone. The jaw muscles, which allow the bird to close its beak, attach to the proximal end of the lower mandible and to the bird&#x27;s skull. The muscles that depress the lower mandible are usually weak, except in a few birds such as the starlings and the extinct huia, which have well-developed digastric muscles that aid in foraging by prying or gaping actions. In most birds, these muscles are relatively small as compared to the jaw muscles of similarly sized mammals.

===Rhamphotheca===
The outer surface of the beak consists of a thin sheath of keratin called the rhamphotheca, which can be subdivided into the rhinotheca of the upper mandible and the gnathotheca of the lower mandible. The covering arises from the Malpighian layer of the bird&#x27;s epidermis,
growing from plates at the base of each mandible. There is a vascular layer between the rhamphotheca and the deeper layers of the dermis, which is attached directly to the periosteum of the bones of the beak. The rhamphotheca grows continuously in most birds, and in some species, the color varies seasonally.
In some alcids, such as the puffins, parts of the rhamphotheca are shed each year after the breeding season, while some pelicans shed a part of the bill called a &quot;bill horn&quot; that develops in the breeding season.

While most birds have a single seamless rhamphotheca, species in a few families, including the albatrosses and the emu, have compound rhamphothecae that consist of several pieces separated and defined by softer keratinous grooves.
Studies have shown that this was the primitive ancestral state of the rhamphotheca, and that the modern simple rhamphotheca resulted from the gradual loss of the defining grooves through evolution.

===Tomia===

The tomia (singular &quot;tomium&quot;) are the cutting edges of the two mandibles. In most birds, they range from being rounded to slightly sharp, but some species have evolved structural modifications that allow them to handle their typical food sources better.
Granivorous (seed-eating) birds, for example, have ridges in their tomia, which help the bird to slice through a seed&#x27;s outer hull.
Most falcons have a sharp projection along the upper mandible, with a corresponding notch on the lower mandible. They use this &quot;tooth&quot; to sever their prey&#x27;s vertebrae fatally or to rip insects apart. Some kites, principally those that prey on insects or lizards, also have one or more of these sharp projections,
as do the shrikes.
The tomial teeth of falcons are underlain by bone, while the shrike tomial teeth are entirely keratinous. Some fish-eating species, e.g., the mergansers, have sawtooth serrations along their tomia, which help them to keep hold of their slippery, wriggling prey.

Birds in roughly 30 families have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most of these species are either insectivores (preferring hard-shelled prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the coefficient of friction between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird&#x27;s ability to hold hard prey items.
Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter-billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy flower corollas.
In some cases, the color of a bird&#x27;s tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The snow goose, for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar Ross&#x27;s goose is pinkish-red, without darker tomia.

===Culmen===

The culmen is the dorsal ridge of the upper mandible. Likened by ornithologist E. Coues to the ridge line of a roof, it is the &quot;highest middle lengthwise line of the bill&quot; and runs from the point where the upper mandible emerges from the forehead&#x27;s feathers to its tip. The bill&#x27;s length along the culmen is one of the regular measurements made during bird banding (ringing)
and is particularly useful in feeding studies. There are several standard measurements which can be made—from the beak&#x27;s tip to the point where feathering starts on the forehead, from the tip to the anterior edge of the nostrils, from the tip to the base of the skull, or from the tip to the cere (for raptors and owls)—and scientists from various parts of the world generally favor one method over another. In all cases, these are chord measurements (measured in a straight line from point to point, ignoring any curve in the culmen) taken with calipers.

The shape or color of the culmen can also help with the identification of birds in the field. For example, the culmen of the parrot crossbill is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar red crossbill is more moderately curved.
The culmen of a juvenile common loon is all dark, while that of the very similarly plumaged juvenile yellow-billed loon is pale towards the tip.

===Gonys===
The gonys is the ventral ridge of the lower mandible, created by the junction of the bone&#x27;s two rami, or lateral plates. The proximal end of that junction—where the two plates separate—is known as the gonydeal angle or gonydeal expansion. In some gull species, the plates expand slightly at that point, creating a noticeable bulge; the size and shape of the gonydeal angle can be useful in identifying between otherwise similar species. Adults of many species of large gulls have a reddish or orangish gonydeal spot near the gonydeal expansion. This spot triggers begging behavior in gull chicks. The chick pecks at the spot on its parent&#x27;s bill, which in turn stimulates the parent to regurgitate food.

===Commissure===
Depending on its use, &quot;commissure&quot; may refer to the junction of the upper and lower mandibles, or alternately, to the full-length apposition of the closed mandibles, from the corners of the mouth to the tip of the beak.

===Gape===
In bird anatomy, the gape is the interior of the open mouth of a bird, and the gape flange is the region where the two mandibles join together at the base of the beak.
The width of the gape can be a factor in the choice of food.

Gapes of juvenile altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, and these are believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on that, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the nest.
Some species, especially in the families Viduidae and Estrildidae, have bright spots on the gape known as gape tubercles or gape papillae. These nodular spots are conspicuous even in low light.
A study examining the nestling gapes of eight passerine species found that the gapes were conspicuous in the ultraviolet spectrum (visible to birds but not to humans).
Parents may, however, not rely solely on the gape coloration, and other factors influencing their decision remain unknown.

Red gape color has been shown in several experiments to induce feeding. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system with barn swallow nestlings showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell–mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.
Conversely, the red gape of the common cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;) did not induce extra feeding in host parents.
Some brood parasites, such as the Hodgson&#x27;s hawk-cuckoo (&quot;C. fugax&quot;), have colored patches on the wing that mimic the gape color of the parasitized species.

When born, the chick&#x27;s gape flanges are fleshy. As it grows into a fledgling, the gape flanges remain somewhat swollen and can thus be used to recognize that a particular bird is young.
By the time it reaches adulthood, the gape flanges will no longer be visible.

===Nares===

Most species of birds have external nares (nostrils) located somewhere on their beak. The nares are two holes—circular, oval or slit-like in shape—which lead to the nasal cavities within the bird&#x27;s skull, and thus to the rest of the respiratory system. In most bird species, the nares are located in the basal third of the upper mandible. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their bills. A handful of species have no external nares. Cormorants and darters have primitive external nares as nestlings, but these close soon after the birds fledge; adults of these species (and gannets and boobies of all ages, which also lack external nostrils) breathe through their mouths. There is typically a septum made of bone or cartilage that separates the two nares, but in some families (including gulls, cranes, and New World vultures), the septum is missing. While the nares are uncovered in most species, they are covered with feathers in a few groups of birds, including grouse and ptarmigans, crows, and some woodpeckers. The feathers over a ptarmigan&#x27;s nostrils help to warm the air it inhales,
while those over a woodpecker&#x27;s nares help to keep wood particles from clogging its nasal passages.

Species in the bird order Procellariformes have nostrils enclosed in double tubes which sit atop or along the sides of the upper mandible. These species, which include the albatrosses, petrels, diving petrels, storm petrels, fulmars and shearwaters, are widely known as &quot;tubenoses&quot;.
A number of species, including the falcons, have a small bony tubercule which projects from their nares. The function of the tubercule is unknown. Some scientists suggest it acts as a baffle, slowing down or diffusing airflow into the nares (thus allowing the bird to continue breathing without damaging its respiratory system) during high-speed dives, but this theory has not been proved experimentally. Not all species which fly at high speeds have these tubercules, while some species which fly at low speeds have them.

===Operculum===

The nares of some birds are covered by an operculum (plural &quot;opercula&quot;), a membraneous, horny or cartilaginous flap.
In diving birds, the operculum keeps water out of the nasal cavity; when the birds dive, the impact force of the water closes the operculum.
Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to help to keep pollen from clogging their nasal passages, while the opercula of the two species of &quot;Attagis&quot; seedsnipe help to keep dust out.
The nares of nestling tawny frogmouths are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselves—both critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. The opercula shrink as the birds age, disappearing completely by the time they reach adulthood.
In pigeons, the operculum has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits at the base of the bill, above the nares; though it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;cere&quot;, this is a different structure. Tapaculos are the only birds known to have the ability to move their opercula.

===Rosette===

Some species like the puffin, have a fleshy rosette, sometimes called a &quot;gape rosette&quot;
at the corners of the beak. In the puffin, it is grown as part of its display plumage.

===Cere===

Birds from a handful of families—including raptors, owls, skuas, parrots, pigeons, turkeys and curassows—have a waxy structure called a cere (from the Latin &quot;cera&quot;, which means &quot;wax&quot;) or ceroma
which covers the base of their bill. This structure typically contains the nares, except in the owls, where the nares are distal to the cere. Although it is sometimes feathered in parrots,
the cere is typically bare and often brightly colored. In raptors, the cere is a sexual signal which indicates the &quot;quality&quot; of a bird; the orangeness of a Montagu&#x27;s harrier&#x27;s cere, for example, correlates to its body mass and physical condition.
The cere color of young Eurasian scops-owls has an ultraviolet (UV) component, with a UV peak that correlates to the bird&#x27;s mass. A chick with a lower body mass has a UV peak at a higher wavelength than a chick with a higher body mass does. Studies have shown that parent owls preferentially feed chicks with ceres that show higher wavelength UV peaks, that is, lighter-weight chicks.

The color or appearance of the cere can be used to distinguish between males and females in some species. For example, the male great curassow has a yellow cere, which the female (and young males) lack.
The male budgerigar&#x27;s cere is royal blue, while the female&#x27;s is a very pale blue, white, or brown.

===Nail===

All birds of the family Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans) have a nail, a plate of hard horny tissue at the tip of the beak. The shield-shaped structure, which sometimes spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook.
It serves different purposes depending on the bird&#x27;s primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation,
while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks.
There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp objects. Species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails.
Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration, or touch, are located under the nail.

The shape or color of the nail can sometimes be used to help distinguish between similar-looking species or between various ages of waterfowl. For example, the greater scaup has a wider black nail than does the very similar lesser scaup.
Juvenile &quot;grey geese&quot; have dark nails, while most adults have pale nails.
The nail gave the wildfowl family one of its former names: &quot;Unguirostres&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;ungus&quot;, meaning &quot;nail&quot; and &quot;rostrum&quot;, meaning &quot;beak&quot;.

===Rictal bristles===
Rictal bristles are stiff hair-like feathers that arise around the base of the beak.
They are common among insectivorous birds, but are also found in some non-insectivorous species.
Their function is uncertain, although several possibilities have been proposed. They may function as a &quot;net&quot;, helping in the capture of flying prey, although to date, there has been no empirical evidence to support this idea.
There is some experimental evidence to suggest that they may prevent particles from striking the eyes if, for example, a prey item is missed or broken apart on contact. They may also help to protect the eyes from particles encountered in flight, or from casual contact from vegetation. There is also evidence that the rictal bristles of some species may function tactilely, in a manner similar to that of mammalian whiskers (vibrissae). Studies have shown that Herbst corpuscles, mechanoreceptors sensitive to pressure and vibration, are found in association with rictal bristles. They may help with prey detection, with navigation in darkened nest cavities, with the gathering of information during flight or with prey handling.

==Egg tooth==
Full-term chicks of most bird species have a small sharp, calcified projection on their beak, which they use to chip their way out of their egg.
Commonly known as an egg tooth, this white spike is generally near the tip of the upper mandible, though some species have one near the tip of their lower mandible instead, and a few species have one on each mandible.
Despite its name, the projection is not an actual tooth, as the similarly-named projections of some reptiles are; instead, it is part of the integumentary system, as are claws and scales.
The hatching chick first uses its egg tooth to break the membrane around an air chamber at the wide end of the egg. Then it pecks at the eggshell while turning slowly within the egg, eventually (over a period of hours or days) creating a series of small circular fractures in the shell.
Once it has breached the egg&#x27;s surface, the chick continues to chip at it until it has made a large hole. The weakened egg eventually shatters under the pressure of the bird&#x27;s movements.

The egg tooth is so critical to a successful escape from the egg that chicks of most species will perish unhatched if they fail to develop one. However, there are a few species which do not have egg teeth. Megapode chicks have an egg tooth while still in the egg but lose it before hatching, while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way out.
Most chicks lose their egg teeth within a few days of hatching, although petrels keep theirs for nearly three weeks and marbled murrelets have theirs for up to a month.
Generally, the egg tooth drops off, though in songbirds it is resorbed.

==Color==
The color of a bird&#x27;s beak results from concentrations of pigments—primarily melanins and carotenoids—in the epidermal layers, including the rhamphotheca.
Eumelanin, which is found in the bare parts of many bird species, is responsible for all shades of gray and black; the denser the deposits of pigment found in the epidermis, the darker the resulting color. Phaeomelanin produces &quot;earth tones&quot; ranging from gold and rufous to various shades of brown. Although it is thought to occur in combination with eumelanin in beaks which are buff, tan, or horn-colored, researchers have yet to isolate phaeomelanin from any beak structure. More than a dozen types of carotenoids are responsible for the coloration of most red, orange, and yellow beaks.

The hue of the color is determined by the precise mix of red and yellow pigments, while the saturation is determined by the density of the deposited pigments. For example, bright red is created by dense deposits of mostly red pigments, while dull yellow is created by diffuse deposits of mostly yellow pigments. Bright orange is created by dense deposits of both red and yellow pigments, in roughly equal concentrations. Beak coloration helps to make displays using those beaks more obvious. In general, beak color depends on a combination of the bird&#x27;s hormonal state and diet. Colors are typically brightest as the breeding season approaches, and palest after breeding.

Birds are capable of seeing colors in the ultraviolet range, and some species are known to have ultraviolet peaks of reflectance (indicating the presence of ultraviolet color) on their beaks. The presence and intensity of these peaks may indicate a bird&#x27;s fitness, sexual maturity or pair bond status.
King and emperor penguins, for example, show spots of ultraviolet reflectance only as adults. These spots are brighter on paired birds than on courting birds. The position of such spots on the beak may be important in allowing birds to identify conspecifics. For instance, the very similarly-plumaged king and emperor penguins have UV-reflective spots in different positions on their beaks.

==Dimorphism==

The size and shape of the beak can vary across species as well as between them; in some species, the size and proportions of the beak vary between males and females. That allows the sexes to utilize different ecological niches, thereby reducing intraspecific competition.
For example, females of nearly all shorebirds have longer bills than males of the same species,
and female American avocets have beaks which are slightly more upturned than those of males.
Males of the larger gull species have bigger, stouter beaks than those of females of the same species, and immatures can have smaller, more slender beaks than those of adults.
Many hornbills show sexual dimorphism in the size and shape of both beaks and casques, and the female huia&#x27;s slim, decurved bill was nearly twice as long as the male&#x27;s straight, thicker one.

Color can also differ between sexes or ages within a species. Typically, such a color difference is due to the presence of androgens. For example, in house sparrows, melanins are produced only in the presence of testosterone; castrated male house sparrows—like female house sparrows—have brown beaks. Castration also prevents the normal seasonal color change in the beaks of male black-headed gulls and indigo buntings.

== Development ==
The beak of modern birds has a fused premaxillary bone, which is modulated by the expression of &quot;Fgf8&quot; gene in the frontonasal ectodermal zone during embryonic development.

The shape of the beak is determined by two modules: the prenasal cartilage during early embryonic stage and the premaxillary bone during later stages. Development of the prenasal cartilage is regulated by genes &quot;Bmp4&quot; and &quot;CaM&quot;, while that of the premaxillary bone is controlled by &quot;TGFβllr&quot;, &quot;β-catenin&quot;, and &quot;Dickkopf-3.&quot; &quot;TGFβllr&quot; codes for a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates gene transcription upon ligand binding; previous work has highlighted its role in mammalian craniofacial skeletal development. &quot;β-catenin&quot; is involved in the differentiation of terminal bone cells. &quot;Dickkopf-3&quot; codes for a secreted protein also known to be expressed in mammalian craniofacial development. The combination of these signals determines beak growth along the length, depth, and width axes. Reduced expression of &quot;TGFβllr&quot; significantly decreased the depth and length of chicken embryonic beak due to the underdevelopment of the premaxillary bone. Contrarily, an increase in &quot;Bmp4&quot; signaling would result in a reduced premaxillary bone due to the overdevelopment of the prenasal cartilage, which takes up more mesenchymal cells for cartilage, instead of bone, formation.

==Functions==

===Eating===
Different species&#x27; beaks have evolved according to their diet; for example, raptors have sharp-pointed beaks that facilitate dissection and biting off of prey animals&#x27; tissue, whereas passerine birds that specialize in eating seeds with especially tough shells (such as grosbeaks and cardinals) have large, stout beaks with high compressive power (on the same principle as a human-devised nutcracker). Birds which fish for a living have beaks adapted for that pursuit; for example, pelicans&#x27; beaks are well adapted for scooping up and swallowing fish whole. Woodpeckers have beaks well adapted for pecking apart wood while hunting for their meals of arthropods.

===Self-defensive pecking===
Birds may bite or stab with their beaks to defend themselves.

===Displays (for courtship, territoriality, or deterrence)===
Some species use their beaks in displays of various sorts. As part of his courtship, for example, the male garganey touches his beak to the blue speculum feathers on his wings in a fake preening display, and the male mandarin duck does the same with his orange sail feathers. A number of species use a gaping, open beak in their fear and/or threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beak. Red-bellied woodpeckers at bird feeders often wave their formidable beaks at competing birds who get too close, clearly signaling &quot;this seed&#x27;s mine, you can&#x27;t have it.&quot;

===Sensory detection===
The platypus uses its bill to navigate underwater, detect food, and dig. The bill contains electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, causing muscular contractions to help detect prey. It is one of the few species of mammals to use electroreception. 
The beaks of Kiwis, Ibises, and sandpipers have sensory pits in their beaks that allow them to sense vibrations. 

The beaks of aquatic birds contain Grandry corpuscles, which assist in velocity detection while filter feeding.

=== Preening ===

The beak of birds plays a role in removing skin parasites (ectoparasites) such as lice. It is mainly the tip of the beak that does this. Studies have shown that inserting a bit to stop birds from using the tip results in increased parasite loads in pigeons.
Birds that have naturally deformed beaks have also been noted to have higher levels of parasites.
It is thought that the overhang at the end of the top portion of the beak (that is the portion that begins to curve downwards) slides against the lower beak to crush parasites.

This overhang of the beak is thought to be under stabilising natural selection. Very long beaks are thought to be selected against because they are prone to a higher number of breaks, as has been demonstrated in rock pigeons. Beaks with no overhang would be unable to effectively remove and kill ectoparasites as mentioned above. Studies have supported there is a selection pressure for an intermediate amount of overhang. Western scrub jays who had more symmetrical bills (i.e. those with less of an overhang), were found to have higher amounts of lice when tested. The same pattern has been found in surveys of Peruvian birds.

Additionally because of the role beaks play in preening, this is evidence for coevolution of the beak overhang morphology and body morphology of parasites. Artificially removing the ability to preen in birds, followed by readdition of preening ability was shown to result in changes in body size in lice. Once the ability of the birds to preen was reintroduced, the lice were found to show declines in body size suggesting they may evolve in response to preening pressures from birds who could respond in turn with changes in beak morphology.

===Communicative percussion===
A number of species, including storks, some owls, frogmouths and the noisy miner, use bill clapping as a form of communication. Some woodpecker species are known to use percussion as a courtship activity, whereas males get the (aural) attention of females from a distance and then impress them with the sound volume and pattern. This explains why humans are sometimes inconvenienced by pecking that clearly has no feeding purpose (such as when the bird pecks on sheet metal repeatedly).

===Heat exchange===
Studies have shown that some birds use their beaks to rid themselves of excess heat. The toco toucan, which has the largest beak relative to the size of its body of any bird species, is capable of modifying the blood flow to its beak. This process allows the beak to work as a &quot;transient thermal radiator&quot;, reportedly rivaling an elephant&#x27;s ears in its ability to radiate body heat.

Measurements of the bill sizes of several species of American sparrows found in salt marshes along the North American coastlines show a strong correlation with summer temperatures recorded in the locations where the sparrows breed; latitude alone showed a much weaker correlation. By dumping excess heat through their bills, the sparrows are able to avoid the water loss which would be required by evaporative cooling—an important benefit in a windy habitat where freshwater is scarce.
Several ratites, including the common ostrich, the emu and the southern cassowary, use various bare parts of their bodies (including their beaks) to dissipate as much as 40% of their metabolic heat production.
Alternately, studies have shown that birds from colder climates (higher altitudes or latitudes and lower environmental temperatures) have smaller beaks, lessening heat loss from that structure.

== Billing ==

During courtship, mated pairs of many bird species touch or clasp each other&#x27;s bills. Termed billing (also nebbing in British English),
this behavior appears to strengthen pair bonding. The amount of contact involved varies among species. Some gently touch only a part of their partner&#x27;s beak while others clash their beaks vigorously together.

Gannets raise their bills high and repeatedly clatter them, the male puffin nibbles at the female&#x27;s beak, the male waxwing puts his bill in the female&#x27;s mouth and ravens hold each other&#x27;s beaks in a prolonged &quot;kiss&quot;.
Billing can also be used as a gesture of appeasement or subordination. Subordinate Canada jay routinely bill more dominant birds, lowering their body and quivering their wings in the manner of a young bird food begging as they do so.
A number of parasites, including rhinonyssids and &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; are known to be transferred between birds during episodes of billing.

Use of the term extends beyond avian behavior; &quot;billing and cooing&quot; in reference to human courtship (particularly kissing) has been in use since Shakespeare&#x27;s time, and derives from the courtship of doves.

==Beak trimming==

Because the beak is a sensitive organ with many sensory receptors, beak trimming (sometimes referred to as &#x27;debeaking&#x27;) is &quot;acutely painful&quot; to the birds it is performed on. It is nonetheless routinely done to intensively farmed poultry flocks, particularly laying and broiler breeder flocks, because it helps reduce the damage the flocks inflict on themselves due to a number of stress-induced behaviors, including cannibalism, vent pecking and feather pecking. A cauterizing blade or infrared beam is used to cut off about half of the upper beak and about a third of the lower beak. Pain and sensitivity can persist for weeks or months after the procedure, and neuromas can form along the cut edges. Food intake typically decreases for some period after the beak is trimmed. However, studies show that trimmed poultry&#x27;s adrenal glands weigh less, and their plasma corticosterone levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed overall.

A similar but separate practice, usually performed by an avian veterinarian or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes–in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening activities.

Among raptor keepers, the practice is commonly known as &quot;coping&quot;.

==Bill tip organ==

The bill tip organ is a region found near the tip of the bill in several types of birds that forage particularly by probing. The region has a high density of nerve endings known as the corpuscles of Herbst. This consists of pits in the bill surface which in the living bird is occupied by cells that sense pressure changes. The assumption is that this allows the bird to perform &#x27;remote touch&#x27;, which means that it can detect movements of animals which the bird does not directly touch. Bird species known to have a &#x27;bill-tip organ&#x27; include ibises, shorebirds of the family Scolopacidae, and kiwis.

There is a suggestion that across these species, the bill tip organ is better-developed among species foraging in wet habitats (water column, or soft mud) than in species using a more terrestrial foraging. However, it has been described in terrestrial birds too, including parrots, who are known for their dextrous extractive foraging techniques. Unlike probing foragers, the tactile pits in parrots are embedded in the hard keratin (or rhamphotheca) of the bill, rather than the bone, and along the inner edges of the curved bill, rather than being on the outside of the bill.
