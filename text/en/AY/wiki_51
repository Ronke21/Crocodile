<text>Friedrich Gustav Emil Martin Niemöller (; 14 January 1892 – 6 March 1984) was a German theologian and Lutheran pastor. He is best known for his opposition to the Nazi regime during the late 1930s and for his 1946 quote &quot;First they came ...&quot;. Niemöller was sent to a concentration camp for his affiliation with the Confessing Church and his opposition to state involvement in Church. After the war, he went on tour around the world to condemn the Nazi cause and educate people about why it is important to protect human rights.

Niemöller was a national conservative and initially a supporter of Adolf Hitler and a self-identified antisemite. He became one of the founders of the Confessing Church, which opposed the Nazification of German Protestant churches. He opposed the Nazis&#x27; Aryan Paragraph. For his opposition to the Nazis&#x27; state control of the churches, Niemöller was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps from 1938 to 1945. He narrowly escaped execution. After his imprisonment, he expressed his deep regret about not having done enough to help victims of the Nazis. He turned away from his earlier nationalistic beliefs and was one of the initiators of the Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt. From the 1950s on, he was a vocal pacifist and anti-war activist, and vice-chair of War Resisters&#x27; International from 1966 to 1972. He met with Ho Chi Minh during the Vietnam War and was a committed campaigner for nuclear disarmament.

== Youth and World War I participation ==
Niemöller was born in Lippstadt, the Prussian Province of Westphalia (now in North Rhine-Westphalia), on 14 January 1892 to the Lutheran pastor Heinrich Niemöller and his wife Pauline (née Müller), and grew up in a very conservative home. In 1900, the family moved to Elberfeld where he finished school, taking his &quot;Abitur&quot; exam in 1908.

He began a career as an officer of the Imperial Navy of the German Empire, and his first assigment was as cadet on the cruiser SMS Hertha after which he served on the battleship . In 1915, was assigned to the U-boat branch. In October of that year, he joined the submarine mother ship , followed by training on the submarine . In February 1916, he became second officer on , which was assigned to the Mediterranean in April 1916. There the submarine fought on the Saloniki front, patrolled in the Strait of Otranto and from December 1916 onward, planted many mines in front of Port Said and was involved in commerce raiding. Flying a French flag as a ruse of war, the SM &quot;U-73&quot; sailed past British warships and torpedoed two Allied troopships and a British man-of-war.

In January 1917, Niemöller was navigator of . Later he returned to Kiel, and in August 1917, he became first officer on , which attacked numerous ships at Gibraltar, in the Bay of Biscay, and other places. During this time, the SM &quot;U-151&quot; crew set a record by sinking 55,000 tons of Allied ships in 115 days at sea. In June 1918, he became commander of the . Under his command, &quot;UC-67&quot; achieved a temporary closing of the French port of Marseille by sinking ships in the area, by torpedoes, and by the laying of mines.

For his achievements, Niemöller was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. When the war drew to a close, he decided to become a preacher, a story he later recounted in his book &quot;Vom U-Boot zur Kanzel&quot; (&quot;From U-boat to Pulpit&quot;). At war&#x27;s end, Niemöller resigned his commission, as he rejected the new democratic government of the German Empire that formed after the abdication of the German Emperor Wilhelm II.

== Weimar Republic and education as pastor ==
In 1919, he married Else Bremer (20 July 1890 – 7 August 1961). That same year, he began working at a farm in Wersen near Osnabrück but gave up becoming a farmer as he could not afford to buy his own farm. He subsequently pursued his earlier idea of becoming a Lutheran pastor and studied Protestant theology at the Westphalian Wilhelm University in Münster from 1919 to 1923. His motivation was his ambition to give a disordered society meaning and order through the Gospel and church bodies.

During the Ruhr Uprising in 1920, he was battalion commander of the &quot;III. Bataillon der Akademischen Wehr Münster&quot; belonging to the paramilitary Freikorps.

Niemöller was ordained on 29 June 1924. Subsequently, the united Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union appointed him curate of Münster&#x27;s Church of the Redeemer. After serving as the superintendent of the Inner Mission in the old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of Westphalia, Niemöller in 1931 became pastor of the Jesus Christus Kirche (comprising a congregation together with St. Anne&#x27;s Church) in Dahlem, an affluent suburb of Berlin.

== Role in Nazi Germany ==
Like most Protestant pastors, Niemöller was a national conservative, and openly supported the conservative opponents of the Weimar Republic. He voted for Nazis in 1924, 1928, and 1933. He thus welcomed Hitler&#x27;s accession to power in 1933, believing that it would bring a national revival. In his autobiography, &quot;From U-Boat to Pulpit&quot; published in the spring of 1933, he called the time of &quot;the System&quot; (a pejorative name for the Weimar Republic) the &quot;years of darkness&quot; and hailed Adolf Hitler for beginning a &quot;national revival&quot;. Niemöller&#x27;s autobiography received positive reviews in Nazi newspapers and was a bestseller. However, he decidedly opposed the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Aryan Paragraph&quot; to Jewish converts to Lutheranism.

The Nazi regime reacted with mass arrests and charges against almost 800 pastors and ecclesiastical lawyers. In 1933, Niemöller founded the &quot;Pfarrernotbund&quot;, an organization of pastors to &quot;combat rising discrimination against Christians of Jewish background&quot;. By the autumn of 1934, Niemöller joined other Lutheran and Protestant churchmen such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in founding the Confessional Church, a Protestant group that opposed the Nazification of the German Protestant churches. Author and Nobel Prize laureate Thomas Mann published Niemöller&#x27;s sermons in the United States and praised his bravery.

However, Niemöller only gradually abandoned his national conservative views. Even as he opposed the Nazis, he made pejorative remarks about Jews of faith while protecting – in his own church – baptised Christians of Jewish descent whom the Nazis persecuted. In one sermon in 1935, he remarked: &quot;What is the reason for [their] obvious punishment, which has lasted for thousands of years? Dear brethren, the reason is easily given: the Jews brought the Christ of God to the cross!&quot;

This has led to controversy about his attitude toward Jews and to accusations of anti-Judaism. The Holocaust historian Robert Michael argues that Niemöller&#x27;s statements were a result of traditional anti-Semitism, and that Niemöller agreed with the Nazis&#x27; position on the &quot;Jewish question&quot; at that time. American sociologist Werner Cohn lived as a Jew in Nazi Germany, and he also reports on antisemitic statements by Niemöller. Niemöller said, &quot;The crucial issue was not whether the USA or the USSR would win the next war. The big question rather was whether there would still be a white race in thirty or forty years.&quot; In her book &quot;Twisted Cross&quot;, Doris L. Bergen says, &quot;Martin Niemöller explained how he, a self-professed antisemite, had come to oppose plans to exclude non-Aryans from the clergy. Even his personal antipathy toward Jews, Niemöller indicated, had not blinded him to the realization that acceptance of an Aryan clause in the church would effectively negate the teaching of baptism.&quot;

In 1936, he signed the petition of a group of Protestant churchmen which sharply criticized Nazi policies and declared the Aryan Paragraph incompatible with the Christian virtue of charity. 

==Imprisonment and liberation==
Niemöller was arrested on 1 July 1937. On 2 March 1938, he was tried by a &quot;Special Court&quot; for activities against the state. He was given Sonder- und Ehrenhaft status (&#x27;special or honourable detention&#x27;). He received a 2,000 Reichsmark fine and seven months&#x27; imprisonment. But as he had been detained pre-trial for longer than the seven-month jail term, he was released by the court after sentencing. However, he was immediately rearrested by Himmler&#x27;s Gestapo – presumably because Rudolf Hess found the sentence too lenient and decided to take &quot;merciless action&quot; against him. He was interned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps for &quot;protective custody&quot; from 1938 to 1945.

While in the concentration camp, he &quot;wrote to a military commander whom he had known in World War I asking to be released from Sachsenhausen so he could serve in the German Wehrmacht.&quot; He volunteered in September 1939 to become a U-boat commander; his offer was rejected.

His former cellmate, Leo Stein, was released from Sachsenhausen to go to America, and he wrote an article about Niemöller for &quot;The National Jewish Monthly&quot; in 1941. Stein reports having asked Niemöller why he ever supported the Nazi Party, to which Niemöller replied:

In late April 1945, Niemöller – together with about 140 high-ranking prisoners – was transported to the Alpenfestung. The group possibly were to be used as hostages in surrender negotiations. The transport&#x27;s SS guards had orders to kill everyone if liberation by the advancing Western Allies became imminent. However, in the south Tyrol region, regular German troops took the inmates into protective custody. The entire group was eventually liberated by advanced units of the U.S. Seventh Army.

== First they came ==
&quot;First They Came&quot; ( , or &quot;Habe ich geschwiegen&quot; ), is the poetic form of a 1946 post-war confessional prose by Niemöller . The quote exists in many versions; the one featured on the United States Holocaust Memorial reads: &quot;First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out – because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me – and there was no one left to speak for me.&quot;

==Later life and death==
In 1947, Niemöller was denied Nazi victim status. Niemöller himself acknowledged his guilt. In 1959, he was asked about his former attitude toward Jews by Alfred Wiener, a Jewish researcher into racism and war crimes committed by the Nazi regime. In a letter to Wiener, Niemöller stated that his eight-year imprisonment by the Nazis became the turning point in his life, after which he viewed things differently. He went on tour around the world to condemn the Nazi cause and educate people about why it&#x27;s important to protect human rights. 

Niemöller was president of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau from 1947 to 1961. He was one of the initiators of the Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt, signed by leading figures in the German Protestant churches. The document acknowledged that the churches had not done enough to resist the Nazis.

Under the impact of a meeting with Otto Hahn (referred to as the &quot;father of nuclear chemistry&quot;) in July 1954, Niemöller became an ardent pacifist and campaigner for nuclear disarmament. He was soon a leading figure in the post-war German peace movement and was even brought to court in 1959 because he had spoken about the military in a very unflattering way. His visit to North Vietnam&#x27;s communist ruler Ho Chi Minh at the height of the Vietnam War caused an uproar. Niemöller also took active part in protests against the Vietnam War and the NATO Double-Track Decision.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

In 1961, he became president of the World Council of Churches. He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in December 1966.

He gave a sermon at the 30 April 1967 dedication of a Protestant &quot;Church of Atonement&quot; in the former Dachau concentration camp, which in 1965 had been partially restored as a memorial site.

Niemöller died at Wiesbaden, West Germany, on 6 March 1984, at the age of 92.

<text>A pharmacist, also known as a chemist in Commonwealth English, is a healthcare professional who is knowledgeable about preparation, mechanism of action, clinical usage and legislation of medications in order to dispense them safely to the public and to provide consultancy services. A pharmacist also often serves as a primary care provider in the community and offers services, such as health screenings and immunizations.

Pharmacists undergo university or graduate-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Among other licensing requirements, different countries require pharmacists to hold either a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Master of Pharmacy, or a Doctor of Pharmacy degree.

The most common pharmacist positions are that of a &quot;community pharmacist&quot; (also referred to as a &quot;retail pharmacist&quot;, &quot;first-line pharmacist&quot; or &quot;dispensing chemist&quot;), or a &quot;hospital pharmacist&quot;, where they instruct and counsel on the proper use and adverse effects of medically prescribed drugs and medicines. In most countries, the profession is subject to professional regulation. Depending on the legal scope of practice, pharmacists may contribute to prescribing (also referred to as &quot;pharmacist prescribers&quot;) and administering certain medications (e.g., immunizations) in some jurisdictions. Pharmacists may also practice in a variety of other settings, including industry, wholesaling, research, academia, formulary management, military, and government.

==Nature of work==

Historically, the fundamental role of pharmacists as a healthcare practitioner was to check and distribute drugs to doctors for medication that had been prescribed to patients. In more modern times, pharmacists advise patients and health care providers on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications, and act as a learned intermediary between a prescriber and a patient. Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists may practice compounding; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists have prescriptive authority to either independently prescribe under their own authority or in collaboration with a primary care physician through an agreed upon protocol called a collaborative practice agreement.

Increased numbers of drug therapies, aging but more knowledgeable and demanding populations, and deficiencies in other areas of the health care system seem to be driving increased demand for the clinical counseling skills of the pharmacist. One of the most important roles that pharmacists are currently taking on is one of pharmaceutical care. Pharmaceutical care involves taking direct responsibility for patients and their disease states, medications, and management of each to improve outcomes. Pharmaceutical care has many benefits that may include but are not limited to: decreased medication errors; increased patient compliance in medication regimen; better chronic disease state management, including hypertension and other cardiovascular disease risk factors; strong pharmacist–patient relationship; and decreased long-term costs of medical care.

Pharmacists are often the first point-of-contact for patients with health inquiries. Thus pharmacists have a significant role in assessing medication management in patients, and in referring patients to physicians. These roles may include, but are not limited to:
*clinical medication management, including reviewing and monitoring of medication regimens
*assessment of patients with undiagnosed or diagnosed conditions, and ascertaining clinical medication management needs
*specialized monitoring of disease states, such as dosing drugs in kidney and liver failure
*compounding medicines
*providing pharmaceutical information
*providing patients with health monitoring and advice, including advice and treatment of common ailments and disease states
*supervising pharmacy technicians and other staff
*oversight of dispensing medicines on prescription
*provision of and counseling about non-prescription or over-the-counter drugs
*education and counseling for patients and other health care providers on optimal use of medicines (e.g., proper use, avoidance of overmedication)
*referrals to other health professionals if necessary
*pharmacokinetic evaluation
*promoting public health by administering immunizations
*constructing drug formularies 
*designing clinical trials for drug development
*working with federal, state, or local regulatory agencies to develop safe drug policies
*ensuring correctness of all medication labels including auxiliary labels
*member of inter-professional care team for critical care patients
*symptom assessment leading to medication provision and lifestyle advice for community-based health concerns (e.g. head colds, or smoking cessation)
*staged dosing supply (e.g. opioid substitution therapy)

==Education and credentialing==

The role of pharmacy education, pharmacist licensing, and continuing education vary from country to country and between regions/localities within countries. In most countries, pharmacists must obtain a university degree at a pharmacy school or related institution, and/or satisfy other national/local credentialing requirements. In many contexts, students must first complete pre-professional (undergraduate) coursework, followed by about four years of professional academic studies to obtain a degree in pharmacy (such as Doctorate of Pharmacy). In the European Union, pharmacists are required to hold a Masters of Pharmacy, which allows them to practice in any other E.U. country, pending professional examinations and language tests in the country in which they want to practice. Pharmacists are educated in pharmacology, pharmacognosy, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, microbiology, pharmacy practice (including drug interactions, medicine monitoring, medication management), pharmaceutics, pharmacy law, pathophysiology, physiology, anatomy, drug delivery, pharmaceutical care, nephrology, hepatology, and compounding of medications. Additional curriculum may cover diagnosis with emphasis on laboratory tests, disease state management, therapeutics and prescribing (selecting the most appropriate medication for a given patient).

Upon graduation, pharmacists are licensed, either nationally or regionally, to dispense medication of various types in the areas they have trained for.

Some may undergo further specialized training, such as in cardiology or oncology or long-term care. Specialties include:

*Academic pharmacist
*Clinical pharmacy specialist
*Community pharmacist
*Compounding pharmacist
*Consultant pharmacist
*Long-term care pharmacist
*Drug information pharmacist
*Home health pharmacist
*Hospital pharmacist
*Industrial pharmacist
*Informatics pharmacist
*Managed care pharmacist
*Military pharmacist
*Nuclear pharmacist
*Oncology pharmacist
*Regulatory-affairs pharmacist
*Veterinary pharmacist
*Pharmacist clinical pathologist
*Pharmacist clinical toxicologist
==Training and practice by country==

=== Armenia ===
The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health oversee pharmacy school accreditation in Armenia. Pharmacists are expected to have competency in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML), the use of Standard Treatment Guidelines, drug information, clinical pharmacy, and medicine supply management. There are currently no laws requiring pharmacists to be registered, but all pharmacies must have a license to conduct business. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from 2010, there are 0.53 licensed pharmacists and 7.82 licensed pharmacies per 10,000 people in Armenia. Pharmacists are able to substitute for generic equivalents at point of dispensing.

===Australia===

The Australian Pharmacy Council is the independent accreditation agency for Australian pharmacists. The accreditation standards for Australian pharmacy degrees include compulsory clinical placements. with an emphasis on encouraging rural experiences to develop a rural workforce. It conducts a written examination on behalf of the Pharmacy Board of Australia towards eligibility for registration. The Pharmacy Board of Australia conducts an oral examination at the end of the intern year as the last hurdle prior to registration. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia provides continuing education programs for pharmacists. The number of full-time equivalent pharmacists working in Australia over the past decade has remained stable. Pharmacy practice is described by the practice standards and guidelines including those from the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia.

The Australian Pharmacy Council is developing accreditation standards for pharmacists to prescribe and for pharmacists to work in aged care. The aged care accreditation standards are being developed in preparation for pharmacists working in residential aged care settings to ensure that they are adequately prepared.

There is a shortage of pharmacists at present leaving many jobs unfilled. Despite many pharmacists leaving the profession, pharmacists remain optimistic about their profession. Contract and casual work is becoming more common. A contract pharmacist is self-employed and often called a locum; these pharmacists may be hired for one shift or for a longer period of time. The number of pharmacists has stayed stable over a number of years.

=== Canada ===
The Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA) is the national professional organization for pharmacists in Canada. Specific requirements for practice vary across provinces, but generally include a bachelor&#x27;s (BSc Pharm) or Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree from one of 10 Canadian universities offering a pharmacy program, successful completion of a national board examination through the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC) (Quebec being the exception), practical experience through an apprenticeship/internship program, and fluency in French or English. International pharmacy graduates can begin their journey of becoming licensed to practice in Canada by enrolling with the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) Pharmacists&#x27; Gateway Canada. The vast majority (~70%) of Canada&#x27;s licensed pharmacists work in community pharmacies, another 15% work in hospital, and the remainder work in other settings such as industry, government, or universities. Pharmacists&#x27; scope of practice varies widely among the 13 provinces and territories and continues to evolve with time. As a result of pharmacists&#x27; expanding scope and knowledge application, there has been a purposeful effort to transition the professional programs in Canadian pharmacy schools to offer doctors of pharmacy over baccalaureate curriculums to ensure graduates have the most up to date level of training to match the increasing practice requirements.

===European Union===
The pharmacist qualification in the European Union is regulated by the Directive 2005/36/EC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Directive 2005/36/EC&quot;&gt;Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, Official Journal of the European Union, 30.9.2005&lt;/ref&gt; where Section 7 Article 44(2) mandates at least five years of training including &quot;four years of full-time theoretical and practical training&quot; and &quot;six-month traineeship in a pharmacy which is open to the public or in a hospital, under the supervision of that hospital&#x27;s pharmaceutical department&quot;. The training of pharmacist must include at least: &quot;Plant and animal biology, Physics, General and inorganic chemistry, Organic chemistry, Analytical chemistry, Pharmaceutical chemistry, including analysis of medicinal products, General and applied biochemistry (medical), Anatomy and physiology; medical terminology, Microbiology, Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy, Pharmaceutical technology, Toxicology, Pharmacognosy, Legislation and, where appropriate, professional ethics&quot;, which can be adapted to &quot;scientific and technical progress&quot; according to procedure in Directive 2005/36/EC.

====Germany====
In Germany, the education and training is divided into three sections, each ending with a state examination:
* University: Basic studies (at least four semesters)
* University: Main studies (at least four semesters)
* Community Pharmacy / Hospital Pharmacy / Industry: Practical training (12 months; 6 months in a Community Pharmacy).
After the third state examination a person must become licensed as an RPh (&quot;registered pharmacist&quot;) for a licence to practice pharmacy. 
Today, many pharmacists work as employees in public pharmacies. They will be paid according to the labour agreement of Adexa and employer associations.

==== Poland ====
Polish pharmacists have to complete a -year Master of Pharmacy Programme at medical university and obtain the right to practice as a pharmacist in Poland from District Pharmaceutical Council. The Programme includes 6 months of pharmacy training. The Polish name for the Master of Pharmacy Degree (M.Pharm.) is &quot;magister farmacji&quot; (mgr farm). Not only pharmacists, but also pharmaceutical technicians are allowed to dispense prescription medicines, except for narcotics, psychotropics and very potent medicines. Pharmacists approve prescriptions fulfilled by pharmaceutical technicians subsequently. Pharmaceutical technicians have to complete 2 years of post-secondary occupational school and 2 years of pharmacy training afterwards. Pharmacists are eligible to prescribe medicines in exceptional circumstances. All Polish pharmacies are obliged to produce compound medicines. Most pharmacists in Poland are pharmacy managers and are responsible for pharmacy marketing in addition to traditional activities. To become a pharmacy manager in Poland, a pharmacist is expected to have at least 5 years of professional experience. All pharmacists in Poland have to maintain an adequate knowledge level by participating in various university- and industry-based courses and arrangements or by undergoing postgraduate specialization.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the national board of health and welfare regulates the practice of all legislated health care professionals, and is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. The education to become a licensed pharmacist is regulated by the European Union, and states that minimum educational requirements are five years of university studies in a pharmacy program, of which six months must be a pharmacy internship. To be admitted to pharmacy studies, students must complete a minimum of three years of gymnasium, similar to high school (school for about 15–20-year-old students) program in natural science after elementary school (6–16-year-olds). Only three universities in the whole of Sweden offer a pharmacy education, Uppsala University, where the Faculty of Pharmacy is located, the University of Gothenburg, and Umeå University. In Sweden, pharmacists are called &quot;Apotekare&quot;. At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called &quot;Receptarier&quot;, in English so-called &quot;prescriptionists&quot;, who have completed studies equal to a Bachelor of Science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are &quot;Apotekstekniker&quot; or &quot;pharmacy technicians&quot; with a three -semester education at a vocational college. Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.

===Japan===

====History====
In ancient Japan, the men who fulfilled roles similar to pharmacists were respected. The place of pharmacists in society was settled in the Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists — and even pharmacist assistants — were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.

====Contemporary====
As of 1997, 46 universities of pharmacy in Japan graduated about 8000 students annually. Contemporary practice of clinical pharmacists in Japan (as evaluated in September 2000) focuses on dispensing of drugs, consultation with patients, supplying drug information, advising on prescription changes and amending prescriptions. These practices have been linked to decreases in the average number of drugs in prescriptions, drug costs and incidence of adverse drug events.

===Nigeria===
Training to become a registered pharmacist in Nigeria involves a five-year course after six years of secondary/high school or four years after eight years of secondary/high school (i.e. after 2 years of Advanced-level studies in accredited Universities). The degree awarded by most pharmacy schools is a Bachelor of Pharmacy Degree (B.Pharm.) However, in the near future, all schools will offer a 6-year first Degree course leading to the award of a Pharm.D (Doctor of Pharmacy Degree). The University of Benin has started the Pharm.D programme with other pharmacy schools planning to start soon. The Pharmacy Degree in Nigeria is unclassified i.e. awarded without first class, second class upper, etc., however graduates could be awarded Pass with Distinctions in specific fields such as Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, medicinal chemistry etc. Pharmacy Graduates are required to undergo 1 year of Tutelage under the supervision of an already Registered Pharmacist(a preceptor) in a recognized and designated Institution before they can become Registered Pharmacists. The Profession is Regulated by a Government Statutory body called the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria. The West African Post Graduate College of Pharmacy runs post-registration courses on advanced-level practice in various fields of pharmacy. It is a college jointly funded by a number of Countries in the West Africa sub-region. There are thousands of Nigerian-trained pharmacists registered and practicing in countries such as the US, the UK, Canada etc., due to the relatively poor public sector salaries in Nigeria.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) degree is a graduate-level professional doctorate degree. Twenty-one universities are registered with the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan for imparting Pharmacy courses. In 2004 the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan and the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan revised the syllabus and changed the 4-year B.Pharmacy (Bachelor of Pharmacy) Program to a 5-year Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) program. All 21 universities have started the 5-year Pharm.D Program. In 2011 the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan approved the awarding of a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, a five-year programme at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Peshawar.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice. Four Swiss universities offer a major in pharmaceutical studies, the University of Basel, the University of Geneva, the University of Lausanne and the ETH Zurich. To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside &quot;pharma assistants&quot;, an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialize in various fields; this is organized by PharmaSuisse, the pharmacists&#x27; association of Switzerland.

===Tanzania===
In Tanzania, pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007–2009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The Ministry of Health salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
In Trinidad and Tobago, pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands. The University of the West Indies in St. Augustine offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy as the sole practicing degree of pharmacy. Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional. After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist. After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist. Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.

===United Kingdom===

In British English (and to some extent Australian English), the professional title known as &quot;pharmacist&quot; is also known as &quot;dispensing chemist&quot; or, more commonly, &quot;chemist&quot;. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist&#x27;s shop, and is allowed to fulfil medical prescriptions and sell over-the-counter drugs and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.

====Practices====
In the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the National Health Service practice in hospital pharmacy or community pharmacy. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time. They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.

The new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the &quot;Pharmacist Independent Prescriber&quot;. Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction (cocaine, diamorphine and dipipanone).

====Education and registration====
Pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy premises in the United Kingdom are regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) for England, Scotland and Wales and by the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland for Northern Ireland. The role of regulatory and professional body on the mainland was previously carried out by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, which remained as a professional body after handing over the regulatory role to the GPhC in 2010.

The following criteria must be met for qualification as a pharmacist in the United Kingdom (the Northern Irish body and the GPhC operate separately but have broadly similar registration requirements):
*Successful completion of a 4-year Master of Pharmacy degree at a GPhC accredited university. Pharmacists holding degrees in pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year postgraduate diploma. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.
*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.
*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the British National Formulary and the GPhC&#x27;s &quot;Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance&quot; document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment. Instead, relevant extracts of the British National Formulary will be provided within the assessment paper. 
*Satisfactorily meeting the GPhC&#x27;s Fitness to Practice Standards.

===United States===
In 2014 the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that there were 297,100 American pharmacist jobs. By 2024 that number is projected to grow by 3%. The majority (65%) of those pharmacists work in retail settings, mostly as salaried employees but some as self-employed owners. About 22% work in hospitals, and the rest mainly in mail-order or Internet pharmacies, pharmaceutical wholesalers, practices of physicians, and the Federal Government.

All graduating pharmacists must now obtain the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree before they are eligible to sit for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) to enter into pharmacy practice. In addition, pharmacists are subject to state-level jurisprudence exams in order to practice from state to state.

====Pharmacy School Accreditation====
The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) has operated since 1932 as the accrediting body for schools of pharmacy in the United States. The mission of ACPE is &quot;To assure and advance excellence in education for the profession of pharmacy&quot;. ACPE is recognized for the accreditation of professional degree programs by the United States Department of Education (USDE) and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Since 1975, ACPE has also been the accrediting body for continuing pharmacy education. The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.

A Pharmacy school pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status. These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.

The customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.

====Education====

Acceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor&#x27;s degree. Pharmacy school is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy (PharmD) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test PCAT and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the PharmD program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree before entry to pharmacy school.

Possible prerequisites:

*Anatomy
*Physiology
*Biochemistry
*Biology
*Immunology
*Chemical engineering
*Economics
*Pathophysiology
*Physics
*Humanities
*Microbiology
*Molecular biology
*Organic chemistry
*Physical chemistry
*Statistics
*Calculus
Besides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.

Estimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1–2 years residency + 1–3 years fellowship = 8–13 years

A doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy NABP to be eligible to &quot;sit&quot; for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated PharmD programs.

The current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited PharmD program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the NAPLEX, and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam MPJE. Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE; in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.

Residency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1–2 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a PharmD program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research.

The passage of Assembly Bill 1535 (2014) authorizes pharmacists in California to furnish naloxone without a physician&#x27;s prescription.

With the passage of Senate Bill 159 in 2019, pharmacists in California are authorized to furnish pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to patients without a physician&#x27;s prescription. In order to be eligible to dispense, a pharmacists must first &quot;complete a training program approved by the&quot; California State Board of Pharmacy.

California pharmacists can apply for Advanced Practice Pharmacist (APh) licenses from the California State Board of Pharmacy.

An APh can:
* Perform patient assessments
* Refer patients to other healthcare providers
* Participate in the evaluation and management of diseases and health conditions in collaboration with other health care providers
* Initiate, adjust, or discontinue therapy pursuant to the regulations outlined in the bill
To qualify for an advanced practice pharmacist license in California, the applicant must be in good standing with the State Board of pharmacy, have an active pharmacist license, and fulfill two of three requirements, including certification in their area clinical practice. The license must be renewed every 2 years, and the APh applying for renewal must complete 10 hours of continuing education in at least one area relevant to their clinical practice.

====Earnings and wages====

*Directors of Pharmacy $125,200
*Retail Staff Pharmacists $113,600
*Hospital Staff Pharmacists $111,700

===Vietnam===
School students must take a national exam to enter a university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. About 5–7% of students can pass the exam. There are 3 aspects to the exam. These are on math, chemistry, and physics or biology. After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. This exam is easier than the national one. Passing the exam they continue studying to gain 3-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees or 4-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees. This degree is considered equivalent to a 5-year bachelor&#x27;s degree.

<text>Walter Crawford Kelly Jr. (August 25, 1913 – October 18, 1973) was an American animator and cartoonist, best known for the comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot;. He began his animation career in 1936 at Walt Disney Studios, contributing to &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, and &quot;Dumbo&quot;. In 1941, at the age of 28, Kelly transferred to work at Dell Comics, where he created &quot;Pogo&quot;, which eventually became his platform for political and philosophical commentary.

==Early life and career==
Kelly was born of Irish-American heritage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Walter Crawford Kelly Sr. and Genevieve Kelly (née MacAnnula). When he was two years old, the family moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut. After graduating from Warren Harding High School in 1930, Kelly worked at odd jobs until he was hired as a crime reporter on the &quot;Bridgeport Post&quot;. He also took up cartooning and illustrated a biography of another well-known figure from Bridgeport, P. T. Barnum. Kelly was extremely proud of his journalism pedigree and considered himself a newspaper man as well as a cartoonist.

Kelly became close friends with fellow cartoonists Milton Caniff and Al Capp, and the three occasionally referred to each other in their strips.

==Personal life==
In 1930, Kelly graduated from high school and met Helen DeLacy at choir practice. DeLacy was a few years older than Kelly. DeLacy left her southern California position as a Girl Scout executive in 1935, hoping to leave Kelly behind. Kelly gave up his job at Bridgeport General Electric and followed DeLacy to Los Angeles, where he took a job at Walt Disney. Kelly and DeLacy then married in September 1937. In 1951, Kelly divorced DeLacy and married Stephanie Waggony; the two remained married until Waggony died of cancer in 1970. Kelly met Selby Daley in the late 1960s while working on &quot;The Pogo Special Birthday Special&quot;, a television special based on the &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strip. Kelly and Daley continued to collaborate professionally, and got married in late 1972.

Kelly and DeLacy had three children: Kathleen, Carolyn, and Peter. He and Waggony had three children who survived infancy: Stephen, Andrew, and John. A fourth child, Kathryn Barbara, died before her first birthday, an event he commemorated in the &quot;Pogo&quot; strip for several years thereafter with a bug character attempting to deliver a cake with one candle.

==Disney Studios==

After relocating to Southern California, Kelly found a job at Walt Disney Productions as a storyboard artist and gag man on Donald Duck cartoons and other shorts. In 1939, he requested a transfer to the animation department. Kelly became an assistant to noted Walt Disney animator Fred Moore and became close friends with Moore and Ward Kimball, one of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men. Kelly and Kimball were so close that Kimball named his daughter Kelly Kimball in tribute.

Kelly worked for Disney from January 6, 1936, to September 12, 1941, contributing to &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Kelly once stated that his salary at Disney averaged about $100 a week. During 1935 and 1936, his work also appeared in early comic books for what later became DC Comics.

Kelly&#x27;s animation can be seen in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; when Mastro Geppetto is first seen inside Monstro the whale, fishing; in &quot;Fantasia&quot; when Bacchus is seen drunkenly riding a donkey during the Beethoven/&quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; sequence; and in &quot;Dumbo&quot; of the ringmaster and during bits of the crows&#x27; sequence. His drawings are especially recognizable in &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; of the little boy, and in the Mickey Mouse short &quot;The Little Whirlwind&quot;, when Mickey is running from the larger tornado (the tornado even blows a copy of the &quot;Bridgeport Post&quot; into Mickey&#x27;s face).

During the 1941 animators&#x27; strike Kelly did not picket the studio, as has often been reported, but took a leave of absence, pleading &quot;family illness&quot;, to avoid choosing sides. Surviving correspondence between Kelly and his close friend and fellow animator Ward Kimball chronicles his ambivalence towards the highly charged dispute. Kimball stated in an interview years later that Kelly felt creatively constricted in animation, a collective art form, and possibly over-challenged by the technical demands of the form, and had been looking for a way out when the strike occurred.

Kelly never returned to the studio as an animator, but jobs adapting the studio&#x27;s films &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; for Dell Comics, apparently the result of a recommendation from Walt Disney himself, led to a new and ultimately transitional career.

On May 25, 1960, Kelly wrote a letter to Walt Disney regarding his time at the studio:

==Dell Comics==
Kelly began a series of comic books based on fairy tales and nursery rhymes along with annuals celebrating Christmas and Easter for Dell Comics. Kelly seems to have written or co-written much of the material he drew for the comics; his unique touches are easily discernible. He also produced a series of stories based on the &quot;Our Gang&quot; film series, provided covers for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, illustrated the aforementioned adaptations of two Disney animated features, drew stories featuring Raggedy Ann and Andy and Uncle Wiggily, wrote and drew a lengthy series of comic books promoting a bread company and featuring a character called &quot;Peter Wheat&quot;, and did a series of pantomime (without dialogue) two-page stories featuring Roald Dahl&#x27;s Gremlins for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #34–41. Kelly also then wrote, drew, and performed on children&#x27;s records, children&#x27;s books, and cereal boxes.

So highly regarded was his work that the introduction, likely written by Dell editor Oskar Lebeck, to &quot;Fairy Tale Parade&quot; #1 spoke of him as &quot;the artist who drew all the wonderful pictures in this book.&quot;

Although his health would not allow him to serve in the military, during World War II, Kelly also worked in the Army&#x27;s Foreign Language Unit illustrating manuals, including several on languages, one of his favorite topics. One manual depicted his friend Ward Kimball as a caveman.

This period saw the creation of Kelly&#x27;s most famous character, Pogo, who first saw print in 1943 in Dell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Comics&quot;. Pogo was almost unrecognizable in his initial appearance, resembling a real possum more closely than in his classic form.

Kelly&#x27;s work with Dell continued well into the successful run of the newspaper strip in the early 1950s, ending after 16 issues of &quot;Pogo Possum&quot; (each with all-new material) in a dispute over the republication of Kelly&#x27;s early Pogo and Albert stories in a comic book titled &quot;The Pogo Parade&quot;.

==&quot;New York Star&quot;==
He returned to journalism as a political cartoonist after the war. In 1948, while serving as art director of the short-lived &quot;New York Star&quot; (successor to the afternoon liberal tabloid &quot;PM)&quot;, Kelly began to produce a pen-and-ink daily comic strip featuring anthropomorphic animal characters that inhabited the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia. The first &quot;Pogo&quot; strip appeared on October 4, 1948. After the &quot;New York Star&quot; folded on January 28, 1949, Kelly arranged for syndication through the Hall Syndicate, which relaunched the strip in May 1949. Kelly eventually arranged to acquire the copyright and ownership of the strip, which was then uncommon.

==&quot;Pogo&quot;==

The &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strip was syndicated to newspapers for 26 years. The individual strips were collected into at least 20 books edited by Kelly. He received the Reuben Award for the series in 1951.

The principal characters were Pogo the Possum, Albert the Alligator, Churchy LaFemme (a turtle; cf. Cherchez la femme), Howland Owl, Beauregard Bugleboy (a hound dog), Porkypine, and Miss Mam&#x27;selle Hepzibah (or &quot;Miz Mamzelle Hepzibah&quot;, a French skunk). Kelly used the strip in part as a vehicle for his liberal and humanistic political and social views, and satirized, among other things, Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Communist demagogy (in the form of a shotgun-wielding bobcat named &quot;Simple J. Malarkey&quot;) and the sectarian and dogmatic behavior of communists (in the form of two comically doctrinaire cowbirds).

The setting for Pogo and his friends was the Okefenokee Swamp. The Okefenokee Swamp Park near Waycross, Georgia, now has a building housing Kelly&#x27;s relocated studio and various Pogo memorabilia.

Additionally, Kelly illustrated &quot;The Glob&quot;, a children&#x27;s book about the evolution of man written by John O&#x27;Reilly and published in 1952.

==Death==
Kelly died on October 18, 1973, in Woodland Hills, California, from diabetes complications, following a long and debilitating illness that had cost him a leg. During his final illness, work on the strip had fallen to various assistants and occasionally reprints, and Kelly characteristically joked about returning to work as soon as he regrew the leg. He is sometimes listed as having been interred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York, but there is no actual grave for him there. He is believed to have been cremated.

==Influences==

His influences included cartoonists George Kerr, Frederick Opper, E. W. Kemble, A. B. Frost, John Tenniel, George Herriman, and, especially, T. S. Sullivant. Kelly, a great admirer of Lewis Carroll, was also a prolific poet, especially in the &quot;Anguish Languish&quot; form (of which &quot;Deck Us All with Boston Charlie&quot; is considered one of the prime examples). Kelly&#x27;s singing voice, a boozy Irish baritone, can be heard on the &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot; album, for which he also supplied the lyrics.

==Legacy==
&quot;Pogo&quot; was continued by Kelly&#x27;s widow, Selby, and various assistants until the summer of 1975. Reprint books continued in a steady stream, including a series reprinting several original books under a single cover according to various themes—romance, elections—that ran into the 1980s. In 1977, Gregg Press reprinted the first ten &quot;Pogo&quot; books in hardcover editions with dust jackets. In 1995 Jonas/Winter issued another ten &quot;Pogo&quot; titles in navy blue cloth editions.

In 1988 Steve Thompson issued &quot;The Walt Kelly Collector&#x27;s Guide&quot; (Spring Hollow Books), an invaluable and comprehensive resource of &quot;Pogo&quot; and other Walt Kelly-related memorabilia.

In 1989 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; attempted to revive the strip with other artists, including Kelly&#x27;s two children, Carolyn and Peter, under the title &quot;Walt Kelly&#x27;s Pogo&quot;. The new strip ran through the early 1990s. Also in 1989, Eclipse Books began publication of a hardcover series called &quot;Walt Kelly&#x27;s Pogo and Albert&quot; collecting the early Dell &quot;Pogo&quot; comic book stories in color, starting with the characters&#x27; first appearance in 1943. The series reached four numbered volumes, with volumes two, three, and four subtitled &quot;At the Mercy of Elephants&quot;, &quot;Diggin&#x27; fo&#x27; Square Roots&quot; and &quot;Dreamin&#x27; of a Wide Catfish&quot;, respectively.

In 2003 Reaction Records reissued Kelly&#x27;s 1956 album &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot; on compact disc. The album features Kelly singing his own comic lyrics and nonsense verse to melodies written mostly by Norman Monath. Kelly wrote music to seven of the 30 songs, according to the printed song book. The disc also features the content of Kelly&#x27;s later recordings, &quot;No! with Pogo&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t! with Pogo&quot;, which were issued as children&#x27;s 45 rpm record sets in 1969, with booklets written and illustrated by Kelly to accompany his recorded performances.

In February 2007 Fantagraphics Books announced that it would begin publication of &quot;The Complete Pogo&quot;, a projected 12‑volume series collecting the complete chronological run of daily and Sunday strips, to be overseen by Jeff Smith and Kelly&#x27;s daughter Carolyn. The first volume in the series was scheduled to appear in October 2007 but was delayed, reportedly due to difficulty in locating early Sunday strips in complete form. It was finally released in October, 2011. Volume two was released in November, 2012, and three was released in November 2014. Four was released in January 2018 and five was released in October 2018. Volume six was planned for release in November 2019 but was delayed until January 2020. Volume seven was released in November 2020.

In 2013 Hermes Press began reprinting the comic book series of &quot;Pogo&quot; that predated the comic strip, originally published by Dell Comics. The first two volumes were nominated for the 2015 Eisner Awards, and the third volume came out in late 2015; followed in 2016 by the fourth volume. The fifth volume was released in 2017, with the sixth and final volume appearing in 2018.

Carolyn Kelly, having worked extensively on &quot;The Complete Pogo&quot;, died on April 9, 2017.

In Nickelodeon&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Loud House&quot;, the Loud Family&#x27;s canary was named after Walt Kelly. Joe Murray, (creator of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; and &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;) cited Kelly&#x27;s work as his inspiration to create wacky anthropomorphic animal characters.

==Awards and recognition==
Kelly has been compared to everyone from James Joyce and Lewis Carroll, to Aesop and &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;. He was elected president of the National Cartoonists Society in 1954, serving until 1956, and was also the first strip cartoonist to be invited to contribute originals to the Library of Congress.

<text>&quot;First They Came&quot; ( , or &quot;Habe ich geschwiegen&quot; ), is the poetic form of a 1946 post-war confessional prose piece by the German Lutheran pastor Martin Niemöller (1892–1984). It is about the silent complicity of German intellectuals and clergy following the Nazis&#x27; rise to power and subsequent incremental purging of their chosen targets. Many variations and adaptations in the spirit of the original have been published in the English language. 

==Text==

The best-known versions of the confession in English are the edited versions in poetic form that had begun circulating by the 1950s. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum quotes the following text as one of the many poetic versions of the speech:

A longer version by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, a charity established by the British government, is as follows:

The original German language writing, as preserved by , is as follows:
==Author==

Martin Niemöller was a German Lutheran pastor and theologian born in Lippstadt, Germany, in 1892. Niemöller was an anti-Communist and supported Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. But when Hitler rose to power and insisted on the supremacy of the state over religion, Niemöller became disillusioned. He became the leader of a group of German clergymen opposed to Hitler. 

In 1937 he was arrested and eventually confined in Sachsenhausen and Dachau. He was released in 1945 by the Allies. He continued his career in Germany as a cleric and as a leading voice of penance and reconciliation for the German people after World War II.

== Origin ==
Niemöller made confession in his speech for the Confessing Church in Frankfurt on 6 January 1946, of which is a partial translation:&quot;... The people who were put in the camps then were Communists. Who cared about them? We knew it, it was printed in the newspapers. Who raised their voice, maybe the Confessing Church? We thought: Communists, those opponents of religion, those enemies of Christians—&quot;should I be my brother&#x27;s keeper?&quot;

Then they got rid of the sick, the so-called incurables. I remember a conversation I had with a person who claimed to be a Christian. He said &quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s right, these incurably sick people just cost the state money, they are just a burden to themselves and to others. Isn&#x27;t it best for all concerned if they are taken out of the middle [of society]? &quot; Only then did the church as such take note.

Then we started talking, until our voices were again silenced in public. Can we say, we aren&#x27;t guilty/responsible? 

The persecution of the Jews, the way we treated the occupied countries, or the things in Greece, in Poland, in Czechoslovakia or in Holland, that were written in the newspapers. I believe, we Confessing-Church-Christians have every reason to say: mea culpa, mea culpa! We can talk ourselves out of it with the excuse that it would have cost me my head if I had spoken out.

We preferred to keep silent. We are certainly not without fault, and I ask myself again and again, what would have happened, if in the year 1933 or 1934—there must have been a possibility—14,000 Protestant pastors and all Protestant communities in Germany had defended the truth until their deaths? If we had said back then, it is not right when Hermann Göring simply puts 100,000 Communists in the concentration camps, in order to let them die. I can imagine that perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 Protestant Christians would have had their heads cut off, but I can also imagine that we would have rescued 30–40 million people, because that is what it is costing us now.&quot;This speech was translated and published in English in 1947, but was later retracted when it was alleged that Niemöller was an early supporter of the Nazis. The Communists, socialists, schools, Jews, the press, and the Church are named in a 1955 version of Niemöller&#x27;s speech that was cited in an interview with a German professor who quoted Niemöller. A representative in America made a similar speech in 1968, omitting Communists but including industrialists who were only targeted by the Nazis on an individual basis.

Niemöller is quoted as having used many versions of the text during his career, but evidence identified by professor Harold Marcuse at the University of California Santa Barbara indicates that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum version is inaccurate because Niemöller frequently used the word &quot;communists&quot; and not &quot;socialists.&quot; The substitution of &quot;socialists&quot; for &quot;communists&quot; is an effect of anti-communism, and most common in the version that has proliferated in the United States. According to Marcuse, &quot;Niemöller&#x27;s original argument was premised on naming groups he and his audience would instinctively not care about. The omission of Communists in Washington, and of Jews in Germany, distorts that meaning and should be corrected.&quot;

In 1976, Niemöller gave the following answer in response to an interview question asking about the origins of the poem. The &quot;Martin-Niemöller-Stiftung&quot; (&quot;Martin Niemöller Foundation&quot;) considers this the &quot;classical&quot; version of the speech:

== Role in Nazi Germany ==
Like many Protestant pastors, Niemöller was a national conservative, and openly supported the conservative opponents of the Weimar Republic. Thus he welcomed Hitler&#x27;s accession to power in 1933, believing that it would bring a national revival. By the autumn of 1934, Niemöller joined other Lutheran and Protestant churchmen such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in founding the Confessional Church, a Protestant group that opposed the Nazification of the German Protestant churches.

Still in 1935, Niemöller made pejorative remarks about Jews, while protecting those of Jewish descent who had been baptised in his own church, but were persecuted by the Nazis due to their racial origins. In a sermon in 1935, he once said, &quot;What is the reason for [their] obvious punishment, which has lasted for thousands of years? Dear brethren, the reason is easily given: the Jews brought the Christ of God to the cross!&quot;

In 1936, however, he decidedly opposed the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Aryan paragraph&quot;. Niemöller signed the petition of a group of Protestant churchmen which sharply criticized Nazi policies and declared the Aryan Paragraph incompatible with the Christian virtue of charity. The Nazi regime responded with mass arrests and charges against almost 800 pastors and ecclesiastical lawyers.

After his imprisonment he volunteered to act as a U-Boat commander, reprising his role in WWI, but this offer was rejected by the Nazi authorities.

==Usage==

At the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., the quotation is on display, and the museum website has a discussion of the history of the quotation.

A version of the poem is on display at the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem in West Jerusalem. The poem is also presented at the Virginia Holocaust Museum in Richmond, Virginia; the New England Holocaust Memorial in Boston, Massachusetts; the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida; and the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Skokie, Illinois.

<doc id="192611" wikidata="Q6085280" url="?curid=192611" title="Isobel Barnett">
<text>Isobel, Lady Barnett (born Isobel Morag Marshall; 30 June 1918 – 20 October 1980), was a Scottish radio and 
television personality, who had her highest profile during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early life==
Isobel Barnett was born Isobel Morag Marshall on 30 June 1918 in Aberdeen, Scotland, the daughter of a neurologist, Robert McNab Marshall, and Jane Minty. Her father was a respected physician in Glasgow who was serving in the army during World War I at the time of her birth and her mother went to her parents&#x27; home in Aberdeen where Barnett was born.
She attended the Laurel Bank School in Glasgow and the independent Mount School in York. Following in her father&#x27;s footsteps, she studied medicine at the University of Glasgow and qualified as a doctor in 1940. She worked as a general practitioner in Leicester during World War II where she met and, in 1941, married solicitor and company director Geoffrey Barnett, later Lord Mayor of Leicester, who was knighted for political and public services to the city of Leicester in 1953. Lady Barnett gave up her medical career in 1948, and for the next 20 years was a Justice of the Peace.

==Radio and television==
In 1953 Barnett arrived on BBC television as one of the panel of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, which made her a household name. She appeared on the programme for ten years but was not an original panelist, her seat having been previously occupied by Marghanita Laski.

She was regarded by audiences as elegant and witty, the epitome of the British aristocracy, although her title actually came from the fact that her solicitor husband had been knighted; the form &quot;Lady Barnett&quot; suggested she possessed a courtesy title, but she was not an aristocrat, nor had she married into the aristocracy. She also made regular appearances on the BBC radio series &quot;Any Questions&quot;, on the radio panel game &quot;Many a Slip&quot; and on the women&#x27;s discussion series &quot;Petticoat Line&quot;. She was greatly in demand as an after-dinner speaker, a role into which she slipped confidently.

In 1956, a reviewer predicted that an alien visiting from another planet could ask anyone between the ages of seven and 70 &quot;What is &quot;What&#x27;s my Line?&quot;&quot; and &quot;Who is Isobel Barnett?&quot; and be confident of getting an answer. She featured in the first revival of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; which ran for two series from 1973 to 1974.

==Later life and death==
In her last years Barnett became reclusive and eccentric. In 1980 she was found guilty of shoplifting, and fined £75 for stealing a can of tuna and a carton of cream worth 87 pence from her village grocer. This brought her briefly back into the public eye; four days later on 20 October, she was found dead at her home in Cossington, Leicestershire.

A coroner&#x27;s inquest subsequently ruled that Barnett killed herself with an overdose of painkillers in her bath. During the inquest, police testified that she wore an extra spacious pocket, known as a &quot;poacher&#x27;s pocket&quot;, inside her coat when she was caught stealing the groceries. Two days before her death, Lady Barnett told an interviewer she was a compulsive thief and had been shoplifting for years. Finding that Barnett, a trained physician, killed herself deliberately with an overdose of arthritis painkiller, the coroner, Guy Tooze, said, &quot;She had recently suffered one of the most traumatic experiences any woman could suffer&quot;. Tooze went on to say, &quot;I am satisfied she took a fatal overdose deliberately and knew what she was doing&quot;.

Barnett&#x27;s story was recounted by several of her friends and colleagues in a 1991 BBC Radio 4 documentary in the &quot;Radio Lives&quot; series, in which it was said that she gave no indication to any of her friends that she was planning to take her own life, and that she kept up a façade of &quot;business as usual&quot;.

==Personal life==
Barnett had one son, Alastair (who died 31 March 2020 aged 77). Her husband died in 1970. Her autobiography, &quot;My Life Line&quot;, was published in 1956.

<text>A satellite dish is a dish-shaped type of parabolic antenna designed to receive or transmit information by radio waves to or from a communication satellite. The term most commonly means a dish which receives direct-broadcast satellite television from a direct broadcast satellite in geostationary orbit.

== History ==
Parabolic antennas referred to as &quot;dish&quot; antennas had been in use long before satellite television. The term &quot;satellite dish&quot; was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry, and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites. Taylor Howard of San Andreas, California, adapted an ex-military dish in 1976 and became the first person to receive satellite television signals using it.

The first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the C-band analog, and were very large. The front cover of the 1979 Neiman-Marcus Christmas catalog featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale. The dishes were nearly in diameter. The satellite dishes of the early 1980s were in diameter and made of fiberglass with an embedded layer of wire mesh or aluminium foil, or solid aluminium or steel.

Satellite dishes made of wire mesh first came out in the early 1980s, and were at first in diameter. As the front-end technology improved and the noise figure of the LNBs fell, the size shrank to a few years later, and continued to get smaller reducing to feet by the late 1980s and by the early 1990s. Larger dishes continued to be used, however. In December 1988, Luxembourg&#x27;s Astra 1A satellite began transmitting analog television signals on the Ku band for the European market. This allowed small dishes (90 cm) to be used reliably for the first time.

In the early 1990s, four large American cable companies founded PrimeStar, a direct broadcasting company using medium power satellites. The relatively strong Ku band transmissions allowed the use of dishes as small as 90 cm for the first time. On 4 March 1996, EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network). This was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 inches (51 cm) to be used. This great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles. Dishes this size are still in use today. Television stations, however, still prefer to transmit their signals on the C-band analog with large dishes due to the fact that C-band signals are less prone to rain fade than Ku band signals.

==Principle of operation==
The parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish&#x27;s focal point. Mounted on brackets at the dish&#x27;s focal point is a device called a feedhorn. This feedhorn is essentially the front-end of a waveguide that gathers the signals at or near the focal point and &#x27;conducts&#x27; them to a low-noise block downconverter or LNB. The LNB converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked C-band and/or Ku-band to the L-band range. Direct broadcast satellite dishes use an LNBF, which integrates the feedhorn with the LNB. A new form of satellite antenna, which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the University of Waterloo in 2004.

The theoretical gain (directive gain) of a dish increases as the frequency increases. The actual gain depends on many factors including surface finish, accuracy of shape, feedhorn matching. A typical value for a consumer type 60 cm satellite dish at 11.75 GHz is 37.50 dB.

With lower frequencies, C-band for example, dish designers have a wider choice of materials. The large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework. At higher frequencies, mesh type designs are rarer though some designs have used a solid dish with perforations.

A common misconception is that the LNBF (low-noise block/feedhorn), the device at the front of the dish, receives the signal directly from the atmosphere. For instance, one BBC News downlink shows a &quot;red signal&quot; being received by the LNBF directly instead of being beamed to the dish, which because of its parabolic shape will collect the signal into a smaller area and deliver it to the LNBF.

Modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 cm (18 in) to 80 cm (31 in) in diameter, and are fixed in one position, for Ku-band reception from one orbital position. Prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services, home users would generally have a motorised C-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites. Overly small dishes can still cause problems, however, including rain fade and interference from adjacent satellites.

==Europe==
In Europe, the frequencies used by DBS services are 10.7–12.75 GHz on two polarisations H (Horizontal) and V (Vertical). This range is divided into a &quot;low band&quot; with 10.7–11.7 GHz, and a &quot;high band&quot; with 11.7–12.75 GHz. This results in two frequency bands, each with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz, each with two possible polarizations. In the LNB they become down converted to 950–2150 MHz, which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between LNBF and receiver. Lower frequencies are allocated to cable and terrestrial TV, FM radio, etc. Only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable, so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the LNBF to a switching matrix or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time.

==Systems design==
In a single receiver residential installation there is a single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the LNB on the dish. The DC electric power for the LNB is provided through the same coaxial cable conductors that carry the signal to the receiver. In addition, control signals are also transmitted from the receiver to the LNB through the cable. The receiver uses different power supply voltages (13 / 18 V) to select vertical / horizontal antenna polarization, and an on/off pilot tone (22 kHz) to instruct the LNB to select one of the two frequency bands. In larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable, so there are 4 cables from the LNB to a &#x27;multiswitch&#x27; switching matrix, which allows the connection of multiple receivers to the multiswitch in a star topology using the same signalling method as in a single receiver installation.

===Satellite finder===

A satellite finder (or sat finder) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit.
Professional satellite finder meters allow better dish alignment and provide received signal parameter values as well.

==Types==
===Motor-driven dish===
A dish that is mounted on a pole and driven by a stepper motor or a servo can be controlled and rotated to face any satellite position in the sky. 
There are three competing standards: DiSEqC, USALS, and 36 V positioners. Many receivers support all of these standards.

Motor-driven dishes come in a variety of sizes, but a dish of at least is required to receive signals from distant satellites which are intended to serve other areas.

With DiSEqC and USALS, the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote. Motor-driven satellite dishes using USALS can detect other satellites in a constellation after one has been found and aimed at.

Most receivers sold at present are compatible with USALS and DiSEqC 1.0 and 1.2.

===Multi-satellite===

Every standard-size dish enables simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish, just by adding additional LNB or using special duo LNB, or triple- or four-feed monoblock LNB.

However, some designs much more effectively optimize simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish. The vertical axis operates as an off-axis concave parabolic concave hyperbolic Cassegrain reflector, while the horizontal axis operates as a concave convex Cassegrain. The spot from the main dish wanders across the secondary, which corrects astigmatism by its varying curvature. The elliptic aperture of the primary is designed to fit the deformed illumination by the horns. Due to double spill-over, this makes more sense for a large dish.

Switching between satellites is possible by using DiSEqC switches added to a satellite installation, or built-in Duo LNBs or Monoblock LNBs.

Most receivers sold presently are compatible with at least DiSEqC 1.0, which can switch automatically between 4 satellites (all of contemporary Monoblock LNBs) as the user changes channels using the remote control.

DiSEqC 1.1 allows for switching automatically between 16 satellite positions or more (through cascading switches).

Motor-driven dishes assure better optimal focusing for the given dish size; LNB is always in central alignment with the broadcasting satellite, but DiSEqC switches are faster than DiSEqC motors as no physical movement is required.

===VSAT===
A common type of dish is the very small aperture terminal (VSAT). This provides two way satellite Internet communications for both individuals and private networks for organizations. At present, most VSATs operate in ; C band is restricted to less populated regions of the world. In 2005, dish manufacturers began moving towards new satellites operating at higher frequencies, offering greater performance at lower cost. These antennas vary from in most applications though C-band VSATs may be as large as .

===Homemade dishes===
Any metal surface which concentrates a significant fraction of the reflected microwaves at a focus can be used as a dish antenna, at a lower gain. This has led to trash can lids, woks, and other items being used as &quot;dishes&quot;. Only modern low noise LNBs and the higher transmission power of DTH satellites allows a usable signal to be received from such inefficient DIY antennas.

<text>Countries by [[Wealth|[[median]]]] wealth ([[US dollars]]) per adult; source: Credit Suisse
Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions. This includes the core meaning as held in the originating Old English word , which is from an Indo-European word stem. The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly so for growth economics and development economics, yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. A person possessing a substantial net worth is known as &quot;wealthy&quot;. Net worth is defined as the current value of one&#x27;s assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts).

At the most general level, economists may define wealth as &quot;the total of anything of value&quot; that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various people in different contexts. Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own. A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy.

The United Nations definition of &quot;inclusive wealth&quot; is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets. Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources, and minerals. Human capital is the population&#x27;s education and skills. Physical (or &quot;manufactured&quot;) capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

==History==

Around 35,000 years ago &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; groups began to adopt a more settled lifestyle, as evidenced by cave drawings, burial sites, and decorative objects.
Around this time, humans began trading burial-site tools and developed trade networks,
resulting in a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
Those who had gathered abundant burial-site tools, weapons, baskets, and food, were considered part of the wealthy.

Adam Smith, in his seminal work &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, described wealth as &quot;the annual produce of the land and labor of the society&quot;. This &quot;produce&quot; is, at its simplest, a good or service which satisfies human needs, and wants of utility.

In popular usage, wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value, or the state of controlling or possessing such items, usually in the form of money, real estate and personal property. A person considered wealthy, affluent, or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group.

In economics, net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time. Wealth can be categorized into three principal categories: personal property, including homes or automobiles; monetary savings, such as the accumulation of past income; and the capital wealth of income producing assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds, and businesses. All these delineations make wealth an especially important part of social stratification. Wealth provides some people &quot;safety nets&quot; of protection against unforeseen declines in their living standard in the event of emergency and can be transformed into home ownership, business ownership, or college education by its expenditure.

Wealth has been defined as a collection of things limited in supply, transferable, and useful in satisfying human desires. Scarcity is a fundamental factor for wealth. When a desirable or valuable commodity (transferable good or skill) is abundantly available to everyone, the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth. When a valuable or desirable commodity is in scarce supply, the owner of the commodity will possess great potential for wealth.

&#x27;Wealth&#x27; refers to some &quot;accumulation&quot; of resources (net asset value), whether abundant or not. &#x27;Richness&#x27; refers to an &quot;abundance&quot; of such resources (income or flow). A wealthy person, group, or nation thus has more accumulated resources (capital) than a poor one. The opposite of wealth is destitution. The opposite of richness is poverty.

The term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner. The concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies, but varies between different sections or regions in the same society. A personal net worth of US$10,000 in most parts of the United States would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale. Such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished developing countries.

Concepts of wealth also vary across time. Modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the sciences have vastly improved the standard of living in modern societies for even the poorest of people. This comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future; given this trend of human advancement, it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations.

Industrialization emphasized the role of technology. Many jobs were automated. Machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized. Labour specialization became critical to economic success. Physical capital, as it came to be known, consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital, became the focus of the &quot;analysis of wealth&quot;.

Adam Smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials, labour, land, and technology. The theories of David Ricardo, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics.

Marxian economics (&quot;see labor theory of value&quot;) distinguishes in the &quot;Grundrisse&quot; between material wealth and human wealth, defining human wealth as &quot;wealth in human relations&quot;; land and labour were the source of all material wealth. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta links wealth/poverty to rationality. Having a leading position in the development of rational sciences, in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth, while the opposite can be correlated with poverty.

== Global amount ==
The wealth of households worldwide amounts to US$280 trillion (2017). According to the eighth edition of the Global Wealth Report, in the year to mid-2017, total global wealth rose at a rate of 6.4%, the fastest pace since 2012 and reached US$280 trillion, a gain of US$16.7 trillion. This reflected widespread gains in equity markets matched by similar rises in non-financial assets, which moved above the pre-crisis year 2007&#x27;s level for the first time this year. Wealth growth also outpaced population growth, so that global mean wealth per adult grew by 4.9% and reached a new record high of US$56,540 per adult. Tim Harford has asserted that a small child has greater wealth than the 2 billion poorest people in the world combined, since a small child has no debt.

According to the 2021 global wealth report by McKinsey &amp; Company, the worldwide total net worth is currently at US$514 trillion in 2020, with China being the wealthiest nation with net worth of US$120 trillion. Another report, by Credit Suisse in 2021, suggests the total wealth of the US exceeded that of China, US$126.3 trillion to US$74.9 trillion.

==Philosophical analysis==
In Western civilization, wealth is connected with a quantitative type of thought, invented in the ancient Greek &quot;revolution of rationality&quot;, involving for instance the quantitative analysis of nature, the rationalization of warfare, and measurement in economics. The invention of coined money and banking was particularly important. Aristotle describes the basic function of money as a universal instrument of quantitative measurement&quot;for it measures all things [...]&quot;making things alike and comparable due to a social &quot;agreement&quot; of acceptance. In that way, money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities, such as gold and money. Modern philosophers like Nietzsche criticized the fixation on measurable wealth: &quot;Unsere &#x27;Reichen&#x27; – das sind die Ärmsten! Der eigentliche Zweck alles Reichtums ist vergessen!&quot; (&quot;Our &#x27;rich people&#x27; – those are the poorest! The real purpose of all wealth has been forgotten!&quot;)

==Economic analysis==
In economics, wealth (in a commonly applied accounting sense, sometimes savings) is the net worth of a person, household, or nation – that is, the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time. For national wealth as measured in the national accounts, the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world. The term may also be used more broadly as referring to the productive capacity of a society or as a contrast to poverty. Analytical emphasis may be on its determinants or distribution.

Economic terminology distinguishes between wealth and income. Wealth or savings is a &quot;stock&quot; variable – that is, it is measurable &quot;at a date&quot; in time, for example the value of an orchard on December 31 minus debt owed on the orchard. For a given amount of wealth, say at the beginning of the year, income from that wealth, as measurable &quot;over&quot; say a year is a &quot;flow&quot; variable. What marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time, such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year.

In macroeconomic theory the &#x27;wealth effect&#x27; may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth. One feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand, which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one-percent change in wealth.

There are several historical developmental economics points of view on the basis of wealth, such as from &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; by John Stuart Mill, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; by Adam Smith, &quot;Capital&quot; by Karl Marx, etc. Over the history, some of the key underlying factors in wealth creation and the measurement of the wealth include the scalable innovation and application of human knowledge in the form of institutional structure and political/ideological &quot;superstructure&quot;, the scarce resources (both natural and man-made), and the saving of monetary assets.

Wealth may be measured in nominal or real values – that is, in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes. The assets include those that are tangible (land and capital) and &quot;financial&quot; (money, bonds, etc.). Measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as human capital and social capital. In economics, &#x27;wealth&#x27; corresponds to the accounting term &#x27;net worth&#x27;, but is measured differently. Accounting measures net worth in terms of the historical cost of assets while economics measures wealth in terms of current values. But analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting (such as in national accounts). An example of the latter is generational accounting of social security systems to include the present value projected future outlays considered to be liabilities. Macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects investment and consumption through the wealth effect.

Environmental assets are not usually counted in measuring wealth, in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a non-market good. Environmental or green accounting is a method of social accounting for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero (as the implied valuation of environmental assets).

==Versus social class==

Social class is not identical to wealth, but the two concepts are related (particularly in Marxist theory), leading to the concept of socioeconomic status. Wealth at the individual or household level refers to value of everything a person or family owns, including personal property and financial assets.

In both Marxist and Weberian theory, class is divided into upper, middle, and lower, with each further subdivided (e.g., upper middle class).

The upper class are schooled to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations.

The middle class views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion. This class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home, planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement. They earn a significant income and consume many things, typically limiting their savings and investments to retirement pensions and home ownership.
Below the middle class, the working class and poor have the least amount of wealth, with circumstances discouraging accumulation of assets.

==Distribution==

Although precise data are not available, the total household wealth in the world, excluding the value of human capital, has been estimated at $418.3 trillion (US$418.3×1012) at the end of the year 2020.
For 2018, the World Bank estimated the value of the world&#x27;s produced capital, natural capital, and human capital to be $1,152 trillion. According to the Kuznets curve, inequality of wealth and income increases during the early phases of economic development, stabilizes and then becomes more equitable.

, about 90% of global wealth is distributed in North America, Europe, and &quot;rich Asia-Pacific&quot; countries, and in 2008, 1% of adults were estimated to hold 40% of world wealth, a number which falls to 32% when adjusted for purchasing power parity. According to Richard H Ropers, the concentration of wealth in the United States is &quot;inequitably distributed&quot;.

In 2013, 1% of adults were estimated to hold 46% of world wealth and around $18.5 trillion was estimated to be stored in tax havens worldwide.

<text>A potlatch is a gift-giving feast practiced by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and the United States, among whom it is traditionally the primary governmental institution, legislative body, and economic system. This includes the Heiltsuk, Haida, Nuxalk, Tlingit, Makah, Tsimshian, Nuu-chah-nulth, Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, and Coast Salish cultures. Potlatches are also a common feature of the peoples of the Interior and of the Subarctic adjoining the Northwest Coast, although mostly without the elaborate ritual and gift-giving economy of the coastal peoples (see Athabaskan potlatch).

A potlatch involves giving away or destroying wealth or valuable items in order to demonstrate a leader&#x27;s wealth and power. Potlatches are also focused on the reaffirmation of family, clan, and international connections, and the human connection with the supernatural world. Potlatch also serves as a strict resource management regime, where coastal peoples discuss, negotiate, and affirm rights to and uses of specific territories and resources. Potlatches often involve music, dancing, singing, storytelling, making speeches, and often joking and games. The honouring of the supernatural and the recitation of oral histories are a central part of many potlatches.

From 1885 to 1951, the Government of Canada criminalized potlatches. However, the practice persisted underground despite the risk of government reprisals including mandatory jail sentences of at least two months; the practice has also been studied by many anthropologists. Since the practice was decriminalized in 1951, the potlatch has re-emerged in some communities. In many it is still the bedrock of Indigenous governance, as in the Haida Nation, which has rooted its democracy in potlatch law.

The word comes from the Chinook Jargon, meaning &quot;to give away&quot; or &quot;a gift&quot;; originally from the Nuu-chah-nulth word &quot;paɬaˑč&quot;, to make a ceremonial gift in a potlatch.

==Overview==

A potlatch was held on the occasion of births, deaths, adoptions, weddings, and other major events. Typically the potlatch was practiced more in the winter seasons as historically the warmer months were for procuring wealth for the family, clan, or village, then coming home and sharing that with neighbors and friends. The event was hosted by a &quot;numaym&quot;, or &#x27;House&#x27;, in Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw culture. A &quot;numaym&quot; was a complex cognatic kin group usually headed by aristocrats, but including commoners and occasional slaves. It had about one hundred members and several would be grouped together into a nation. The House drew its identity from its ancestral founder, usually a mythical animal who descended to earth and removed his animal mask, thus becoming human. The mask became a family heirloom passed from father to son along with the name of the ancestor himself. This made him the leader of the &quot;numaym&quot;, considered the living incarnation of the founder.

Only rich people could host a potlatch. Tribal slaves were not allowed to attend a potlatch as a host or a guest. In some instances, it was possible to have multiple hosts at one potlatch ceremony (although when this occurred the hosts generally tended to be from the same family). If a member of a nation had suffered an injury or indignity, hosting a potlatch could help to heal their tarnished reputation (or &quot;cover his shame&quot;, as anthropologist H. G. Barnett worded it). The potlatch was the occasion on which titles associated with masks and other objects were &quot;fastened on&quot; to a new office holder. Two kinds of titles were transferred on these occasions. Firstly, each &quot;numaym&quot; had a number of named positions of ranked &quot;seats&quot; (which gave them a seat at potlatches) transferred within itself. These ranked titles granted rights to hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Secondly, there were a number of titles that would be passed between numayma, usually to in-laws, which included feast names that gave one a role in the Winter Ceremonial. Aristocrats felt safe giving these titles to their out-marrying daughter&#x27;s children because this daughter and her children would later be rejoined with her natal numaym and the titles returned with them. Any one individual might have several &quot;seats&quot; which allowed them to sit, in rank order, according to their title, as the host displayed and distributed wealth and made speeches. Besides the transfer of titles at a potlatch, the event was given &quot;weight&quot; by the distribution of other less important objects such as Chilkat blankets, animal skins (later Hudson Bay blankets) and ornamental &quot;coppers&quot;. It is the distribution of large numbers of Hudson Bay blankets, and the destruction of valued coppers that first drew government attention (and censure) to the potlatch. On occasion, preserved food was also given as a gift during a potlatch ceremony. Gifts known as &quot;sta-bigs&quot; consisted of preserved food that was wrapped in a mat or contained in a storage basket.

Dorothy Johansen describes the dynamic: &quot;In the &quot;potlatch&quot;, the host in effect challenged a guest chieftain to exceed him in his &#x27;power&#x27; to give away or to destroy goods. If the guest did not return 100 percent on the gifts received and destroy even more wealth in a bigger and better bonfire, he and his people lost face and so his &#x27;power&#x27; was diminished.&quot; Hierarchical relations within and between clans, villages, and nations, were observed and reinforced through the distribution or sometimes destruction of wealth, dance performances, and other ceremonies. The status of any given family is raised not by who has the most resources, but by who distributes the most resources. The hosts demonstrate their wealth and prominence through giving away goods.

Potlatch ceremonies were also used as coming-of-age rituals. When children were born, they would be given their first name at the time of their birth (which was usually associated with the location of their birthplace). About a year later, the child&#x27;s family would hold a potlatch and give gifts to the guests in attendance on behalf of the child. During this potlatch, the family would give the child their second name. Once the child reached about 12 years of age, they were expected to hold a potlatch of their own by giving out small gifts that they had collected to their family and people, at which point they would be able to receive their third name.

For some cultures, such as Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, elaborate and theatrical dances are performed reflecting the hosts&#x27; genealogy and cultural wealth. Many of these dances are also sacred ceremonies of secret societies like the hamatsa, or display of family origin from supernatural creatures such as the dzunukwa. 

Chief O&#x27;wax̱a̱laga̱lis of the Kwagu&#x27;ł describes the potlatch in his famous speech to anthropologist Franz Boas,
Among the various First Nations groups which inhabited the region along the coast, a variety of differences existed in regards to practises relating to the potlatch ceremony. Each nation, community, and sometimes clan maintained its own way of practicing the potlatch with diverse presentation and meaning. The Tlingit and Kwakiutl nations of the Pacific Northwest, for example, held potlatch ceremonies for different occasions. The Tlingit potlatches occurred for succession (the granting of tribal titles or land) and funerals. The Kwakiutl potlatches, on the other hand, occurred for marriages and incorporating new people into the nation (i.e., the birth of a new member of the nation.) The potlatch, as an overarching term, is quite general, since some cultures have many words in their language for various specific types of gatherings. It is important to keep this variation in mind as most of our detailed knowledge of the potlatch was acquired from the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw around Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island in the period 1849 to 1925, a period of great social transition in which many aspects of the potlatch became exacerbated in reaction to efforts by the Canadian government to culturally assimilate First Nations communities into the dominant white culture.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, gifts included storable food (oolichan, or candlefish, oil or dried food), canoes, slaves, and ornamental &quot;coppers&quot; among aristocrats, but not resource-generating assets such as hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Coppers were sheets of beaten copper, shield-like in appearance; they were about two feet long, wider on top, cruciform frame and schematic face on the top half. None of the copper used was ever of Indigenous metal. A copper was considered the equivalent of a slave. They were only ever owned by individual aristocrats, and never by numaym, hence could circulate between groups. Coppers began to be produced in large numbers after the colonization of Vancouver Island in 1849 when war and slavery were ended.
The arrival of Europeans resulted in the introduction of numerous diseases against which Indigenous peoples had no immunity, resulting in a massive population decline. Competition for the fixed number of potlatch titles grew as commoners began to seek titles from which they had previously been excluded by making their own remote or dubious claims validated by a potlatch. Aristocrats increased the size of their gifts in order to retain their titles and maintain social hierarchy. This resulted in massive inflation in gifting made possible by the introduction of mass-produced trade goods in the late 18th and earlier 19th centuries. Archaeological evidence for the potlatching ceremony is suggested from the ~1,000 year-old Pickupsticks site in interior Alaska.

Tlingit funerals conducted alongside potlatches usually had a celebratory element to them.

===Potlatch ban===

Potlatching was made illegal in Canada in 1884 in an amendment to the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. To some extent, this was at the urging of missionaries and government agents who considered it &quot;a worse than useless custom&quot; that was seen as wasteful, unproductive, and contrary to &#x27;civilized values&#x27; of accumulation. The Potlatch was seen as a key target in assimilation policies and agendas. Missionary William Duncan wrote in 1875 that the potlatch was &quot;by far the most formidable of all obstacles in the way of Indians becoming Christians, or even civilized&quot;. 

Sectors of native communities themselves also opposed the practices. In 1883 the department of Indian affairs received a petition from the Coast Tsimshian and Nisga’a Chiefs at Port Simpson, Kincolith, Green Ville &quot;praying that the system of Potlatching as practiced by many Indian Tribes on the Coast of British Columbia may be put down”. 

Thus in 1884, the &quot;Indian Act&quot; was revised to include clauses banning the Potlatch and making it illegal to practice. Section 3 of the Act read,

In 1888, the anthropologist Franz Boas described the potlatch ban as a failure:
Eventually the potlatch law, as it became known, was amended to be more inclusive and address technicalities that had led to dismissals of prosecutions by the court. Legislation included guests who participated in the ceremony. The Indigenous people were too large to police and the law too difficult to enforce. Duncan Campbell Scott convinced Parliament to change the offence from criminal to summary, which meant &quot;the agents, as justice of the peace, could try a case, convict, and sentence&quot;. Even so, except in a few small areas, the law was generally perceived as harsh and untenable. Even the Indian agents employed to enforce the legislation considered it unnecessary to prosecute, convinced instead that the potlatch would diminish as younger, educated, and more &quot;advanced&quot; Indians took over from the older Indians, who clung tenaciously to the custom.

===Persistence===
The potlatch ban was repealed in 1951. Sustaining the customs and culture of their ancestors, Indigenous people now openly hold potlatches to commit to the restoring of their ancestors&#x27; ways. Potlatches now occur frequently and increasingly more over the years as families reclaim their birthright. Anthropologist Sergei Kan was invited by the Tlingit nation to attend several potlatch ceremonies between 1980 and 1987 and observed several similarities and differences between traditional and contemporary potlatch ceremonies. Kan notes that there was a language gap during the ceremonies between the older members of the nation and the younger members of the nation (age fifty and younger) due to the fact that most of the younger members of the nation do not speak the Tlingit language. Kan also notes that unlike traditional potlatches, contemporary Tlingit potlatches are no longer obligatory, resulting in only about 30% of the adult tribal members opting to participate in the ceremonies that Kan attended between 1980 and 1987. Despite these differences, Kan stated that he believed that many of the essential elements and spirit of the traditional potlatch were still present in the contemporary Tlingit ceremonies.

==Anthropological theory==
In his 1925 book &quot;The Gift&quot;, the French ethnologist Marcel Mauss used the term potlatch to refer to a whole set of exchange practices in tribal societies characterized by &quot;total prestations&quot;, i.e., a system of gift giving with political, religious, kinship and economic implications. These societies&#x27; economies are marked by the competitive exchange of gifts, in which gift-givers seek to out-give their competitors so as to capture important political, kinship and religious roles. Other examples of this &quot;potlatch type&quot; of gift economy include the Kula ring found in the Trobriand Islands.

<text>Altötting (; Bavarian: &quot;Oidäding&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) Austria and the Bavarian districts of Traunstein, Mühldorf and Rottal-Inn.

== History ==
Altötting was one of the original parts of Bavaria. It was settled by Bavarian tribes shortly after the retreat of the Romans. During the rule of duke Tassilo III (748-788) the place of Ötting was mentioned for the first time (the towns of Altötting and Neuötting are derived from that place). Soon in the 9th century the region became a religious centre with famous churches and monasteries. In the 15th century it became a place of pilgrimage.

The district of Altötting was established in 1837. Pope Benedict XVI was born here 1927 in the village of Marktl.

The hearts of many of the rulers of Bavaria are buried in the Chapel of Grace in the middle of the town square.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the alpine upland on the Austrian border. The main axis of the region is the river Inn, which crosses the district from west to east. It is joined by two large tributaries, the Alz coming from the south and the Salzach, which forms the eastern border of the district. In addition there are several smaller rivers and brooks. The district once was covered with deciduous forests, but is now mainly agriculturally used. However, there are some nature reserves along the lower Alz River and at the mouth of the Salzach River.

<doc id="192628" wikidata="Q5449587" url="?curid=192628" title="Financial Crimes Enforcement Network">
<text>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau within the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyzes information about financial transactions to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.

==Mission==
FinCEN&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence.&quot; FinCEN serves as the U.S. Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and is one of 147 FIUs making up the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units. FinCEN&#x27;s self-described motto is &quot;follow the money.&quot; It is a network bringing people and information together, by coordinating information sharing with law enforcement agencies, regulators and other partners in the financial industry.

FinCEN collaborates with international partners to identify financial crimes and strengthen global financial security. The agency develops policies and practices to combat financial threats, including sharing intelligence with government and private organizations.

==History==
FinCEN was established by Treasury Order 105-08 on April 25, 1990. In May 1994, its mission expanded to involve regulatory responsibilities. In October 1994, Treasury&#x27;s Office of Financial Enforcement merged with FinCEN. On September 26, 2002, after passage of Title III of the PATRIOT Act, Treasury Order 180-01 designated FinCEN as an official bureau within the Department of the Treasury.

Since 1995, FinCEN has employed the FinCEN Artificial Intelligence System (FAIS).

In September 2012, FinCEN&#x27;s information technology called FinCEN Portal and Query System, migrated with 11 years of data into FinCEN Query, a search engine similar to Google. It is a &quot;one stop shop&quot; accessible via the FinCEN Portal allowing broad searches across more fields than before and returning more results. Since September 2012 FinCEN generates 4 new reports: Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), Currency Transaction Report (CTR), the Designation of Exempt Person (DOEP), and Registered Money Service Business (RMSB).

==Organization==

As of November 2013, FinCEN employed approximately 340 people, mostly intelligence professionals with expertise in the financial industry, illicit finance, financial intelligence, the AML/CFT (anti-money laundering / combating the financing of terrorism) regulatory regime, computer technology, and enforcement&quot;. The majority of the staff are permanent FinCEN personnel, with about 20 long-term detailees assigned from 13 different regulatory and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN shares information with dozens of intelligence agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the U.S. Secret Service; the Internal Revenue Service; the Customs Service; and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

* Andrea Gacki (July 2023 – Present)

==314 program==
The 2001 USA PATRIOT Act required the Secretary of the Treasury to create a secure network for the transmission of information to enforce the relevant regulations. FinCEN&#x27;s regulations under Section 314(a) enable federal law enforcement agencies, through FinCEN, to reach out to more than 45,000 points of contact at more than 27,000 financial institutions to locate accounts and transactions of persons that may be involved in terrorist financing and/or money laundering. A web interface allows the person(s) designated in §314(a)(3)(A) to register and transmit information to FinCEN. The partnership between the financial community and law enforcement allows disparate bits of information to be identified, centralized, and rapidly evaluated.

==Hawala==
In 2003, FinCEN disseminated information on &quot;informal value transfer systems&quot; (IVTS), including hawala, a network of people receiving money for the purpose of making the funds payable to a third party in another geographic location, generally taking place outside of the conventional banking system through non-bank financial institutions or other business entities whose primary business activity may not be the transmission of money. On September 1, 2010, FinCEN issued a guidance on IVTS referencing &quot;United States v. Banki&quot; and hawala.

==Office of Special Investigations==
The Enforcement Division is structured into three offices: Compliance and Enforcement, Special Measures, and Special Investigations. The Office of Special Investigations is responsible for investigating unauthorized BSA disclosures and providing criminal investigatory expertise and support to the rest of the division. The Office is staffed by FinCEN&#x27;s special agents.

==Virtual currencies==
In July 2011, FinCEN added &quot;other value that substitutes for currency&quot; to its definition of money services businesses in preparation for adapting the respective rule to virtual currencies. On March 18, 2013, FinCEN issued a guidance regarding virtual currencies, according to which, exchangers and administrators, but not users of convertible virtual currency are considered money transmitters, and must comply with rules to prevent money laundering/terrorist financing (&quot;AML/CFT&quot;) and other forms of financial crime, by record-keeping, reporting and registering with FinCEN. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of FinCEN said, &quot;Virtual currencies are subject to the same rules as other currencies. … Basic money services business rules apply here.&quot;

At a November 2013 Senate hearing, Calvery stated, &quot;It is in the best interest of virtual currency providers to comply with these regulations for a number of reasons. First is the idea of corporate responsibility,&quot; contrasting Bitcoin&#x27;s understanding of a peer to peer system bypassing corporate financial institutions. She stated that FinCEN collaborates with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, a congressionally-chartered forum called the &quot;Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Advisory Group&quot; and BSA Working Group to review and discuss new regulations and guidance, with the FBI-led &quot;Virtual Currency Emerging Threats Working Group&quot; (VCET) formed in early 2012, the FDIC-led &quot;Cyber Fraud Working Group&quot;, the Terrorist Financing &amp; Financial Crimes-led &quot;Treasury Cyber Working Group&quot;, and with a community of other financial intelligence units. According to the Department of Justice, VCET members represent the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, multiple U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Offices, and the Criminal Division&#x27;s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.

In 2021, amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act and the federal AML/CTF framework officially incorporated existing FinCEN guidelines on digital assets. The legislation was updated to encompass &quot;value that substitutes for currency,&quot; reinforcing FinCEN&#x27;s authority over digital assets. As a result, exchanges dealing in these assets were required to register with FinCEN and adhere to specific reporting and recordkeeping obligations for transactions involving certain types of digital assets. In 2021, FinCEN received 1,137,451 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from both traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrency trading entities. Within this total, there were reports of 7,914 suspicious cyber events and 284,989 potential money laundering activities.

== Beneficial Ownership Information Reports ==
FinCEN is the regulatory agency tasked with overseeing the Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting (BOIR) system in the U.S. This responsibility was established under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which mandates that certain business entities must disclose information about their beneficial owners to FinCEN. CTA aims to enhance transparency and combat financial crimes by preventing the use of anonymous shell companies for illicit purposes. On December 3, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction against nationwide implementation of the CTA, citing concerns about its constitutionality and impact on small businesses. Treasury filed a notice of appeal on December 5, 2024.

FinCEN administers the BOIR system to collect and maintain accurate records of beneficial ownership information. This information includes details such as the names, addresses, dates of birth, and identification numbers of individuals who ultimately own or control companies. By centralizing this data, FinCEN supports law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute financial crimes, ensuring greater accountability and integrity within the corporate sector.

==Controversies==
In 2009, the GAO found &quot;opportunities&quot; to improve &quot;interagency and state examination coordination&quot;, noting that the federal banking regulators issued an interagency examination manual, that SEC, CFTC, and their respective self-regulatory organizations developed Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) examination modules, and that FinCEN and IRS examining nonbank financial institutions issued an examination manual for money services businesses. Therefore multiple regulators examine compliance of the BSA across industries and for some larger holding companies even within the same institution. Regulators need to promote greater consistency, coordination and information-sharing, reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, and find concerns across industries. FinCEN estimated that it would have data access agreements with 80 percent of state agencies that conduct BSA examinations after 2012.

Since FinCEN&#x27;s inception in 1990, the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco has debated its benefits compared to its threat to privacy. FinCEN does not disclose how many Suspicious Activity Reports result in investigations, indictments or convictions, and no studies exist to tally how many reports are filed on innocent people. FinCEN and money laundering laws have been criticized for being expensive and relatively ineffective while violating Fourth Amendment rights, as an investigator may use FinCEN&#x27;s database to investigate people instead of crimes.

It has also been alleged that FinCEN&#x27;s regulations against structuring are enforced unfairly and arbitrarily; for example, it was reported in 2012 that small businesses selling at farmers&#x27; markets have been targeted, while politically connected people like Eliot Spitzer were not prosecuted. Spitzer&#x27;s reasons for structuring were described as &quot;innocent&quot;.

In February 2019, it was reported that Mary Daly, the oldest daughter of United States Attorney General William Barr, is to leave her position at the United States Deputy Attorney General&#x27;s office for a FinCEN position.

In September 2020, findings based on a set of 2,657 documents including 2121 suspicious activity reports (SARs) leaked from FinCEN were published as the FinCEN Files. The leaked documents showed that although both FinCEN and the banks that filed SARs knew about billions of dollars in dirty money being moved through the banks, both did very little to prevent the transactions.

== In popular culture ==
The 2016 film &quot;The Accountant&quot; features a FinCEN investigation into the title character.

In the first episode of the 2017 Netflix show &quot;Ozark&quot;, FinCEN is mentioned as one of the agencies (along with the DEA, ATF, and FBI) active in monitoring cartel activity in Chicago.

<doc id="192629" wikidata="Q2100584" url="?curid=192629" title="Pogo (comic strip)">
<text>Pogo (revived as Walt Kelly&#x27;s Pogo) was a daily comic strip that was created by cartoonist Walt Kelly and syndicated to American newspapers from 1948 until 1975. Set in the Okefenokee Swamp in the Southeastern United States, &quot;Pogo&quot; followed the adventures of its anthropomorphic animal characters, including the title character, an opossum. The strip was written for both children and adults, with layers of social and political satire targeted to the latter. &quot;Pogo&quot; was distributed by the Post-Hall Syndicate. The strip earned Kelly a Reuben Award in 1951.

==History==
Walter Crawford Kelly Jr. was born in Philadelphia on August 25, 1913. His family moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, when he was only two. He went to California at age 22 to work on &quot;Donald Duck&quot; cartoons at Walt Disney Studios in 1935. He stayed until the animators&#x27; strike in 1941 as an animator on &quot;The Nifty Nineties&quot;, &quot;The Little Whirlwind&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo&quot; and &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;. Kelly then worked for Dell Comics, a division of Western Publishing of Racine, Wisconsin.

===Dell Comics===
Kelly created the characters of Pogo the possum and Albert the alligator in 1941 for issue No. 1 of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Comics&quot; in the story &quot;Albert Takes the Cake&quot;. Both were comic foils for a young black character named Bumbazine (a corruption of bombazine, a fabric that was usually dyed black and used largely for mourning wear), who lived in the swamp. Bumbazine was retired early, since Kelly found it hard to write for a human child. He eventually phased humans out of the comics entirely, preferring to use the animal characters for their comic potential. Kelly said he used animals—nature&#x27;s creatures, or &quot;nature&#x27;s screechers&quot; as he called them—&quot;largely because you can do more with animals. They don&#x27;t hurt as easily, and it&#x27;s possible to make them more believable in an exaggerated pose.&quot; Pogo, formerly a &quot;spear carrier&quot; according to Kelly, quickly took center stage, assuming the straight man role that Bumbazine had occupied.

===&quot;New York Star&quot;===
In his 1954 autobiography for the Hall Syndicate, Kelly said he &quot;fooled around with the Foreign Language Unit of the Army during World War II, illustrating grunts and groans, and made friends in the newspaper and publishing business.&quot; In 1948 he was hired to draw political cartoons for the editorial page of the short-lived &quot;New York Star&quot;; he decided to do a daily comic strip featuring the characters from &quot;Animal Comics&quot;. The first comic series to make the permanent transition to newspapers, &quot;Pogo&quot; debuted on October 4, 1948, and ran continuously until the paper folded on January 28, 1949.

===Syndication===
On May 16, 1949, &quot;Pogo&quot; was picked up for national distribution by the Post-Hall Syndicate. George Ward and Henry Shikuma were among Kelly&#x27;s assistants on the strip. It ran continuously until (and past) Kelly&#x27;s death from complications of diabetes on October 18, 1973. According to Walt Kelly&#x27;s widow Selby Kelly, Walt Kelly fell ill in 1972 and was unable to continue the strip. At first, reprints, mostly with minor rewording in the word balloons, from the 1950s and 1960s were used, starting Sunday, June 4, 1972. Kelly returned for just eight Sunday pages, from October 8 to November 26, 1972, but according to Selby was unable to draw the characters as large as he customarily did. The reprints with minor rewording returned, continuing until Kelly&#x27;s death. Other artists, notably Don Morgan, worked on the strip. Selby Kelly began to draw the strip with the Christmas strip from 1973 from scripts by Walt&#x27;s son Stephen. The strip ended July 20, 1975. Selby Kelly said in a 1982 interview that she decided to discontinue the strip because newspapers had shrunk the size of strips to the point where people could not easily read it.

===1989–1993 revival===
Starting on January 8, 1989, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Syndicate revived the strip under the title &quot;Walt Kelly&#x27;s Pogo&quot;, written by Larry Doyle and drawn by Neal Sternecky. Doyle left the strip as of February 24, 1991, and Sternecky took over as both writer and artist until March 22, 1992. After Sternecky left, Kelly&#x27;s son Peter and daughter Carolyn continued to produce the daily strip until October 2, 1993. The strip continued to run for a couple months with reprints of Doyle and Sternecky&#x27;s work, and came to an end on November 28, 1993.

==Setting==
&quot;Pogo&quot; is set in the Georgia section of the Okefenokee Swamp; Fort Mudge and Waycross are occasionally mentioned.

The characters live, for the most part, in hollow trees amidst lushly rendered backdrops of North American wetlands, bayous, lagoons and backwoods. Fictitious local landmarks—such as &quot;Miggle&#x27;s General Store and Emporium&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Miggle&#x27;s Miracle Mart&quot;) and the &quot;Fort Mudge Memorial Dump&quot;, etc.—are occasionally featured. The landscape is fluid and vividly detailed, with a dense variety of (often caricatured) flora and fauna. The richly textured trees and marshlands frequently change from panel to panel within the same strip. Like the Coconino County depicted in &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and the Dogpatch of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, the distinctive cartoon landscape of Kelly&#x27;s Okefenokee Swamp became as strongly identified with the strip as any of its characters.

There are occasional forays into exotic locations as well, including at least two visits to Australia (during the Melbourne Olympics in 1956, and again in 1961). The Aussie natives include a bandicoot, a lady wallaby, and a mustachioed, aviator kangaroo named &quot;Basher&quot;. In 1967, Pogo, Albert and Churchy visit primeval &quot;Pandemonia&quot;—a vivid, &quot;prehysterical&quot; place of Kelly&#x27;s imagination, complete with mythical beasts (including dragons and a zebra-striped unicorn), primitive humans, arks, volcanoes, saber-toothed cats, pterodactyls and dinosaurs.

Kelly also frequently parodied Mother Goose nursery rhymes and fairy tales featuring the characters in period costume: &quot;Cinderola&quot;, &quot;Goldie Lox and the Fore-bears&quot;, &quot;Handle and Gristle&quot;, etc. These offbeat sequences, usually presented as a staged play or a story within a story related by one of the characters, seem to take place in the fairy tale dreamscapes of children&#x27;s literature, with European storybook-style cottages and forests, etc.—rather than in the swamp, per se.

==Cast of characters==
===Permanent residents===

* Pogo Possum: An amiable, humble, philosophical, personable, everyman opossum. Kelly described Pogo as &quot;the reasonable, patient, softhearted, naive, friendly person we all think we are&quot; in a 1969 &quot;TV Guide&quot; interview. The wisest (and probably sanest) resident of the swamp, he is one of the few major characters with sense enough to avoid trouble. Though he prefers to spend his time fishing or picnicking, his kind nature often gets him reluctantly entangled in his neighbors&#x27; escapades. He is often the unwitting target of matchmaking by Miz Beaver (to the coquettish Ma&#x27;m&#x27;selle Hepzibah), and has repeatedly been forced by the swamp&#x27;s residents to run for president, always against his will. He wears a simple red and black striped shirt and (sometimes) a crushed yellow fishing hat. His kitchen is well known around the swamp for being fully stocked, and many characters impose upon him for meals, taking advantage of his generous nature.
* Albert Alligator: An exuberant, dimwitted, irascible, and egotistical alligator. Albert is often the comic foil for Pogo, the rival of Beauregard and Barnstable, or the fall guy for Howland and Churchy. The cigar-chomping Albert is as extroverted and garrulous as Pogo is modest and unassuming, and their many sequences together tend to underscore their balanced, contrasting chemistry—like a seasoned comedy team. Albert&#x27;s creation actually preceded Pogo&#x27;s, and his brash, bombastic personality sometimes seems in danger of taking over the strip, as he once dominated the comic books. Having an alligator&#x27;s voracious appetite, Albert often eats things indiscriminately, and is accused on more than one occasion of having eaten another character. Albert is the troop leader of Camp Siberia, the local den of the &quot;Cheerful Charlies&quot; (Kelly&#x27;s version of the Boy Scouts), whose motto is &quot;Cheerful to the Death!&quot; Even though Albert has been known to take advantage of Pogo&#x27;s generosity, he is ferociously loyal to Pogo and can, in quieter moments, be found scrubbing him in the tub or cutting his hair. Like all Kelly&#x27;s characters, Albert looks great in costume. This sometimes leads to a classic Albert line (while admiring himself in a mirror): &quot;Funny how a good-lookin&#x27; fella look handsome in anything he throw on!&quot;
* Howland Owl: A horned owl and self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; scientist, &quot;perfessor&quot;, physician, explorer, astronomer, witch doctor, and anything else he thinks will generate respect for his knowledge. He wears thick rimmed eyeglasses and, in his earliest appearances, a pointed wizard&#x27;s cap festooned with stars and crescent moons (which also, fittingly, looks like a dunce cap in silhouette.) Thinking himself the most learned creature in the swamp, he once tried to open a school but had to close it for lack of interest. Actually, he is unable to tell the difference between learning, old wives&#x27; tales, and the use of big words. Most of the harebrained ideas characteristically come from the mind of Owl. His best pal is Churchy, although their friendship can be rocky at times, often given to whims and frequently volatile.
* Churchill &quot;Churchy&quot; LaFemme: A mud turtle by trade; he enjoys composing songs and poems, often with ridiculous and abrasive lyrics and nonsense rhymes. His name is a play on the French phrase &quot;Cherchez la femme&quot;, (&quot;Look for the woman&quot;). Perhaps the least sensible of the major players, Churchy is superstitious to a fault, for example, panicking when he discovers that Friday the 13th falls on a Wednesday that month. Churchy is usually an active partner in Howland&#x27;s outlandish schemes, and prone to (sometimes physical) confrontation with him when they (inevitably) run afoul. Churchy first appeared as buccaneer in &quot;Animal Comics #13&quot; (Feb 1945), with a pirate&#x27;s hat. He was sometimes referred to as &quot;Cap&#x27;n LaFemme&quot;. This seems incongruous for the guileless Churchy, however, who is far more likely to play-act with Owl at being a pantomime pirate than the genuine article.
* Beauregard Bugleboy: A hound dog of undetermined breed; scion of the Cat Bait fortune and occasional Keystone Cops-attired constable and Fire Brigade chief. He sees himself as a noble, romantic figure, often given to flights of oratory while narrating his own heroic deeds (in the third person). He periodically appears with &quot;blunked out&quot; eyes playing &quot;Sandy&quot;—alongside Pogo or Albert when they don a curly wig, impersonating &quot;Li&#x27;l Arf an&#x27; Nonny&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Lulu Arfin&#x27; Nanny&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s recurring parody of &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;). Beauregard also occasionally dons a trench coat and fedora, and squints his eyes and juts out his jaw when impersonating a detective in the style of &quot;Dick Tracy.&quot; However, his more familiar attire is a simple dog collar—or in later strips, a striped turtleneck sweater and fez. His canine revision of Kelly&#x27;s annual Christmas burlesque, &quot;Deck Us All with Boston Charlie&quot;, emerges as &quot;Bark Us All Bow-wows of Folly&quot;, although he can&#x27;t get anyone else to sing it that way. Usually just called &quot;Beauregard&quot; or &quot;ol&#x27; Houn&#x27; Dog&quot;, his full name is Beauregard Chaulmoogra Frontenac de Montmingle Bugleboy.
* Porky Pine: A porcupine, a misanthrope and cynic—prickly on the outside but with a heart of gold. The deadpan Porky never smiles in the strip (except once, allegedly, when the lights were out). Pogo&#x27;s best friend, equally honest, reflective and introverted, and with a keen eye both for goodness and for human foibles. The swamp&#x27;s version of Eeyore, Porkypine is grumpy and melancholy by nature, and sometimes speaks of his &quot;annual suicide attempt&quot;. He wears an undersized, plaid Pinky Lee-type hat (with an incongruously tall crown and upturned brim) and a perpetual frown, and is rarely seen without both. Porky has two weaknesses: his infatuation for Miz Ma&#x27;m&#x27;selle Hepzibah and a complete inability to tell a joke. He unfailingly arrives on Pogo&#x27;s doorstep with a flower every Christmas morning, although he&#x27;s always as embarrassed by the sentiment as Pogo is touched. He has a nephew named Tacky and a look-alike relation (see Frequent visitors) named Uncle Baldwin.
* Miz Mam&#x27;selle Hepzibah: A beautiful, coy French skunk modeled after a woman who later became Kelly&#x27;s second wife. Hepzibah has long been courted by Porky, Beauregard and others but rarely seems to notice. Sometimes she pines for Pogo, and isn&#x27;t too shy about it. She speaks with a heavy burlesque French dialect and tends to be overdramatic. The unattached Hepzibah has a married sister with 35 youngsters, including a nephew named Humperdunk. She is captivatingly sweet, frequently baking pies or preparing picnic baskets for her many admirers, and has every fellow in the swamp in love with her at one time or another. She is usually attired in a dainty floral skirt and parasol, is flirty but proper, and enjoys attention.
* Miz Beaver: A no-nonsense, corncob pipe-smoking beaver; She&#x27;s a washer, a traditional mother (she is frequently seen minding a perambulator, her pet fish, or a tadpole in a jar) and &quot;widder&quot; (she occasionally speaks of &quot;the Mister&quot;, always in the past tense), clad in a country bonnet and apron. Uneducated but with homespun good sense, she &quot;takes nothin&#x27; from nobody&quot;, and can be daunting when riled. She is Hepzibah&#x27;s best friend and occasional matchmaker, although she disapproves of menfolk as a general rule.
* Deacon Mushrat: A muskrat and the local man of the cloth, the Deacon speaks in blackletter text, and his views are just as modern. He is typically seen haranguing others for their undisciplined ways, attempting to lead the Bats in some wholesome activity (which they inevitably subvert), or reluctantly entangled in the crusades of Mole and his even shadier allies; in either role he is the straight man and often winds up on the receiving end of whatever scheme he is involved in. Kelly described him as the closest thing to an evil character in the strip, calling him &quot;about as far as I can go in showing what I think evil to be&quot;.
* Bewitched, Bothered, and Bemildred: A trio of grubby, unshaven bats—hobos, gamblers, good-natured but innocent of any temptation to honesty. They admit nothing. Soon after arriving in the swamp they are recruited by Deacon Mushrat into the &quot;Audible Boy Bird Watchers Society&quot; (a seemingly innocent play on the Audubon Society, but really a front for Mole&#x27;s covert surveillance syndicate). They wear identical black derby hats and perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadows. Their names, a play on the song title &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, are rarely mentioned. Often even they cannot say for sure which brother is which. They tell each other apart, if at all, by the patterns of their trousers—striped, checkered or plaid. (According to one of the bats, &quot;Whichever pair of trousers you puts on in the morning, that&#x27;s who you are for that partic&#x27;lar day.&quot;)
* Barnstable Bear: A simple-minded, henpecked &quot;grizzle bear&quot; who often plays second fiddle to Albert&#x27;s plots. He wears a pair of pants held up with a single suspender, and often a checkered cloth cap. Frequently short-tempered (and married to an even shorter-tempered &quot;missus&quot;, the formidable Miz Bear), he bellows &quot;Rowrbazzle!&quot; when his anger comes to a boil. Barnstable even tried to start his own rival comic strip in 1958, which he entitled &quot;Little Orphan Abner&quot; (with a wink to Kelly&#x27;s pal, fellow cartoonist Al Capp), just to spite Albert. Curiously, he can write but he can&#x27;t read. 
* Mister Miggle: A bespectacled stork or crane, and proprietor of the local general store, a frequent swamp hangout. He dresses like an old-fashioned &quot;country&quot; clerk—with apron, starched collar, suspenders, sleeve garters, and a straw boater or a bookkeeping visor. Miggle&#x27;s carries just about every undesirable product imaginable, such as &quot;salt fish in chocolate sauce&quot; and &quot;day-old ice, 25¢ per gallon&quot;, along with &quot;Aunt Granny&#x27;s Bitter Brittle Root&quot;—a local favorite beverage (after sassafras tea), and cure-all for the &quot;cold robbies&quot; and the &quot;whim-whams&quot;.
* Bun Rab: An enthusiastic white rabbit with a drum and drum-major hat who often accompanies P. T. Bridgeport and likes to broadcast news in the manner of a town crier. He lives in a grandfather clock, and frequently appears as a fireman in the swamp&#x27;s clownish Fire Brigade—where he serves as official hose carrier. Bridgeport never calls him by the same name twice, even in the same balloon.
* Rackety Coon Chile: One of the swamp &quot;sprats&quot;—a group of youngsters who seem to be the only rational creatures present, other than Pogo and Porky. A talkative, precocious raccoon, he mainly pesters his &quot;uncle&quot; Pogo, along with his pal Alabaster. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Rackety Coon, are a bickering couple occasionally featured. The father (&quot;Pa&quot;) owns a still, and is generally suspicious of Ma&#x27;s going through his overalls pockets while he sleeps.
* Alabaster Alligator: Not much is known about Alabaster except that he is considerably brighter than his Uncle Albert. Genial, inquisitive and only occasionally mischievous, he follows the cartoon tradition of the look-alike nephew (see Huey, Dewey, and Louie) whose parentage is never made specific.
* Grundoon: A diapered toddler groundhog (or &quot;groun&#x27;chunk&quot; in swamp-speak). Grundoon speaks only gibberish, represented by strings of random consonants like &quot;Bzfgt&quot;, &quot;ktpv&quot;, &quot;mnpx&quot;, &quot;gpss&quot;, &quot;twzkd&quot;, or &quot;znp&quot;. (&quot;Grs&quot; appears to attract fish.) Eventually, Grundoon learns to say two things: &quot;Bye&quot; and &quot;Bye-bye&quot;. He also has a baby sister called Honey Bunny Ducky Downy Sweetie Chicken Pie Li&#x27;l Everlovin&#x27; Jelly Bean.
* Pup Dog: An innocent &quot;li&#x27;l dog chile&quot; puppy. One of the very few characters who walks on all fours, he frequently wanders off and gets lost. Being, as Pogo puts it, &quot;&#x27;jus&#x27; a li&#x27;l ol&#x27; shirt-tail baby-size dog what don&#x27;t talk good yet&quot;, he says only &quot;Wurf!&quot; and &quot;Wurf wurf!&quot;, although for a time he repeats the non-sequitur phrase &quot;Poltergeists make up the principal type of spontaneous material manifestation.&quot;

===Frequent visitors===
* P. T. Bridgeport: A bear; a flamboyant impresario and traveling circus operator named after P. T. Barnum, the most famous resident of Kelly&#x27;s boyhood home, Bridgeport, Connecticut. One of Kelly&#x27;s most colorful characters, P. T. wears a straw boater, spats, vest, ascot tie with stickpin and outlandish, fur-lined plaid overcoat reminiscent of W. C. Fields. There is also sometimes a marked physical resemblance to the Dutch cartoon character Oliver B. Bumble. An amiable blowhard and charlatan, his speech balloons resemble 19th-century circus posters, symbolizing both his theatrical speech pattern and his customary carnival barker&#x27;s sales spiel. He usually visits the swamp during presidential election years, satirizing the media circus atmosphere of American political campaigns, energetically promoting Pogo for president to the bemusement of Pogo and Porky.
* Tammananny Tiger: A political operator, named in allusion to Tammany Hall, which was represented as a tiger in 19th-century editorial cartoons by Thomas Nast. He typically appears in election years to offer strategic advice to the reluctant candidate, Pogo. He first appears as a companion to P. T. Bridgeport, although more cynical and less self-aggrandizing than the latter, and is one of only a handful of animals not native to North America to frequent the swamp.
*Mole (in his original appearance in 1952 named Mole MacCarony, in later years sometimes called Molester Mole, his name pronounced not &quot;molester&quot; but, in keeping with his political aspirations, to rhyme with &quot;pollster&quot;): A nearsighted and xenophobic grifter. Considers himself an astute observer, but walks into trees without seeing them. Obsessed with contagion both literal and figurative, he is a prime mover in numerous campaigns against &quot;subversion&quot;, and in his first appearances has a paranoid habit of spraying everything and everyone with a disinfectant that may have been liberally laced with tar. Modeled somewhat after Senator Pat McCarran of the McCarran–Walter Act.
* Seminole Sam: A mercenary, carpetbagging fox and traveling huckster of the snake oil salesman variety. He often attempts to swindle Albert and others, for example by selling bottles of the &quot;miracle fluid&quot; H-two-and-O. Sam isn&#x27;t really an out-and-out villain—more of an amoral opportunist, even though he occasionally allies with darker characters such as Mole and Wiley. Sam&#x27;s Seminole moniker probably refers, not to any native blood ties, but more likely to a presumed history of selling bogus patent medicine (&quot;snake oil&quot;). These &quot;salesmen&quot; hucksters often pretended their products were tested and proven, ancient Indian remedies. The Seminoles are an Indian tribe in the neighborhood of Okefenokee Swamp.
*Sarcophagus MacAbre: A buzzard and the local mortician. He lives in a creepy, ruined mausoleum, and always wears a tall undertaker&#x27;s stove pipe hat with a black veil hung from its side. Early strips show him speaking in square, black bordered speech balloons with ornate script lettering, in the style of Victorian funeral announcements. MacAbre begins as a stock villain, but in later years gradually softens into a somewhat befuddled comic foil.
* The Cowbirds: Two beatnik freeloaders, their gender(s) uncertain, who speak in communist cant (albeit often in typical Okefenokee patois) and grift any food and valuables that cross their path. They associate with a pirate pig who resembles Nikita Khrushchev. Later they loudly renounce their former beliefs—without changing their behavior much. They typically address each other as Compeer and Confrere. It&#x27;s unclear whether these are proper names or titles (synonyms of Comrade).
* Wiley Catt: A wild-eyed, menacing, hillbilly bobcat who smokes a corncob pipe, carries a shotgun, and lives alone in a dilapidated, &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;-type shanty on the outskirts of the swamp. He frequently hangs out with Sarcophagus MacAbre, Mole and Seminole Sam, although none of them trusts him. All the swamp critters are rightly wary of him, and generally give him a wide path. During the &quot;Red scare&quot; era of the 1950s, he temporarily morphed into his &quot;cousin&quot; Simple J. Malarkey, a parody and caricature of Republican senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy (see Satire and politics).
* Miss Sis Boombah: A matronly, cheerleading Rhode Island Red hen, who is a gym coach and fitness enthusiast—as well as a close friend of Miz Beaver—usually attired in tennis shoes and a pullover. Boombah arrives at the swamp to conduct a survey for &quot;Dr. Whimsy&quot; on &quot;the sectional habits of U.S. mailmen&quot;, a neat parody of &quot;The Kinsey Reports.&quot; She also runs a Feminist organization (with Miz Beaver) called &quot;F.O.O.F.&quot; (Female Order Of Freedom), to un-subjugate the swamp womenfolk.
* Ol&#x27; Mouse: An otherwise unnamed, long-winded, worldly mouse with a bowler hat, cane and cigar who frequently pals around with Snavely, the Flea, Albert, or Pup Dog, the last of whom he was briefly imprisoned with in a cupboard and with whom he forged a bond as a fellow prisoner. He has a long and storied career as a rogue, in which he takes some pride, noting that the crimes he has been falsely accused of are far less interesting than the crimes he has actually committed. He is more often an observer and commentator than an actual participant in storylines. Something of a dandy, he sometimes takes the name &quot;F. Olding Munny&quot;—but only when Albert is posing as swami &quot;El Fakir&quot;, (a take-off on Daddy Warbucks and his Indian manservant Punjab from &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;).
* Snavely: A chatty, inebriated snake (he is prone to biting himself, then dipping into a bottle of &quot;snake bite remedy&quot;). Snavely usually wears a battered top hat, and pals around with Ol&#x27; Mouse or a group of angleworms that he is training to be cobras or rattlesnakes. In classic cartoon tradition, his intoxicated state is portrayed by a prominent red nose surrounded by tiny, fizzing bubbles. Although limbless, he is able to salute. Pogo saw this and was amazed. Unfortunately this act was accomplished behind the log Pogo was looking over, and the reader&#x27;s view was blocked.
* Choo Choo Curtis (a.k.a. Chug Chug Curtis): A natural-born mail carrier duck.
* Uncle Baldwin: Porky&#x27;s doppelgänger and compulsive &quot;kissing cousin&quot;, he wears a trenchcoat to hide his telltale bald backside. Uncle Baldwin usually tries to grab and kiss any female in the panel with him. Most of the females (and more than a few of the male characters) flee from the scene when Uncle Baldwin arrives. When assaulted by him, Hepzibah has hit him back.
* Reggie and Alf: Two Cockney insects that wander around bickering and looking for cricket matches. Kelly loved definite personality types, and had these two show up occasionally, even though they had nothing to do with anything else. Kelly stated the aim of their appearance &quot;was to please nobody but me&quot;.
* Flea (a.k.a. Miz Flea): An unnamed female flea, so small she is usually only drawn in black silhouette. She falls in love with Beauregard, calls him &quot;doll&quot; and &quot;sugar&quot;, and frequently gives him love nips on the nose or knee—much to his indignant irritation. (Flea: &quot;Two can live as cheap as one, &quot;sugar&quot;.&quot; Beauregard: &quot;Not on &quot;me&quot;, they can&#x27;t!&quot;) Her gender was vaguely indeterminate for much of the run of the strip, but in a 1970 sequence with ex-husband Sam the spider, the Flea is finally and definitively established as a &quot;girl&quot;. Thereafter, she is occasionally addressed as &quot;Miz&quot;. In &quot;The Pogopedia&quot; (2001), this character is identified as &quot;Ol&#x27; Flea&quot;.
* Fremount the Boy Bug: The swamp&#x27;s dark horse candidate, whose limited vocabulary (all he can say is &quot;Jes&#x27; fine&quot;) makes him suitable presidential timber, according to P. T. Bridgeport.
* Bug Daddy and Chile: Daddy&#x27;s indignant tag-line (&quot;Destroy a son&#x27;s faith in his father, will you?&quot;) invariably follows his being corrected by another character for an (inevitable) misunderstanding or erroneous explanation on his part. He wears a stove pipe hat and carries an umbrella, which he shakes threateningly at the slightest provocation. His child&#x27;s name is ever-changing, even from panel to panel within the same strip: Hogblemish, Nortleberg, Flimplock, Osbert, Jerome, Merphant, Babnoggle, Custard, Lorenzo, etc. (&quot;The Pogopedia&quot; identifies these characters as &quot;Bug Daddy&quot; and &quot;Bug Child&quot;.)
* Congersman Frog: An elected official, usually accompanied by his look-alike male secretary, with whose pay he lights his &quot;seegars&quot;. He practices disavowing his candidature for the presidency—not very convincingly. His seldom-used first name is Jumphrey, and his secretary/sidekick was occasionally referred to by name: Fenster Moop. (Fenster apparently rose to Congress himself. In later years he&#x27;s addressed as &quot;Congersman&quot;, and attended by his own look-alike secretary, Feeble E. Merely.)
* Solid MacHogany: A New Orleans-bound, clarinet-playing pig in a polka dot cap and striped necktie, headed to a paying gig in a &quot;sho&#x27; nuff&quot; jazz band on Bourbon Street.
* Horrors Greeley: A freckled, westward-traveling cow (hence the reference to Horace Greeley), who was sweet on Albert. (To Horrors, &quot;west&quot; being Milwaukee.)
* Uncle Antler: A disagreeable bullmoose, whom Albert insultingly addresses as &quot;Hatrack&quot;.
* Butch: A brick-throwing housecat. Like Tammananny, Butch is a direct homage to another cartoonist: George Herriman, whose &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; comic strip Kelly greatly admired. Butch feels compelled to hurl bricks at Beauregard, in honor of the traditional animus between dogs and cats. He always deliberately misses, however—and, after his initial appearance as an antagonistic rival, proves to be something of a pussycat.
* Basil MacTabolism: A door-to-door political pollster polecat and self-described &quot;taker of the public pulse&quot;.
* Roogey Batoon: A part-time snake oil salesman pelican in a flat cap, who claims to have made the careers of the &quot;Lou&#x27;siana Perches&quot;, an underwater songstress trio named Flim, Flam and Flo (mistakenly eaten by Albert and others). His name is a play on Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
* Picayune: A talkative frog that is a &quot;free han&#x27; pree-dicter of all kinds weather an&#x27; other social events—sun, hail, moonshine or ty-phoonery&quot;. (An identical frog known as Moonshine Sonata also appears on occasion; it is unclear if these were intended to be the same character.)

==Dialogue and &quot;swamp-speak&quot;==
The strip was notable for its distinctive and whimsical use of language. Kelly, a native northeasterner, had a sharply perceptive ear for language and used it to great humorous effect. The predominant vernacular in &quot;Pogo&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;swamp-speak&quot;, is essentially a rural southern U.S. dialect laced with nonstop malapropisms, fractured grammar, &quot;creative&quot; spelling and mangled polysyllables such as &quot;incredibobble,&quot; &quot;hysteriwockle&quot;, and &quot;redickledockle,&quot; plus invented words such as the exasperated exclamations &quot;Bazz Fazz!&quot;, &quot;Rowrbazzle!&quot; and &quot;Moomph!&quot; Here is an example:

Pogo has been engaged in his favorite pastime, fishing in the swamp from a flat-bottomed boat, and has hooked a small catfish. &quot;Ha!&quot; he exclaims, &quot;A small fry!&quot; At this point Hoss-Head the Champeen Catfish, bigger than Pogo himself, rears out of the swamp and the following dialogue ensues:

:Hoss-Head &quot;[with fins on hips and an angry scowl]:&quot; Chonk back that catfish chile, Pogo, afore I whops you!
:Pogo: Yassuree, Champeen Hoss-Head, yassuh yassuh yassuh yassuh yassuh ... &quot;[tosses infant catfish back in water]&quot;
:Pogo &quot;[walks away, muttering discontentedly]:&quot; Things gettin&#x27; so humane &#x27;round this swamp, us folks will have to take up eatin&#x27; MUD TURKLES!
:Churchy (a turtle) &quot;[eavesdropping from behind a tree with Howland Owl]:&quot; Horroars! A cannibobble! &quot;[passes out]&quot;
:Howland &quot;[holding the unconscious Churchy]:&quot; You say you gone eat mud turkles! Ol&#x27; Churchy is done overcame!
:Pogo: It was a finger of speech—I apologize! Why, I LOVES yo&#x27;, Churchy LaFemme!
:Churchy &quot;[suddenly recovered from his swoon]:&quot; With pot licker an&#x27; black-eye peas, you loves me, sir—&quot;HA!&quot; Us is through, Pogo!

==Satire and politics==
Kelly used &quot;Pogo&quot; to comment on the human condition, and, from time to time, this drifted into politics. &quot;I finally came to understand that if I were looking for comic material, I would never have to look long,&quot; Kelly wrote. &quot;The news of the day would be enough. Perhaps the complexion of the strip changed a little in that direction after 1951. After all, it is pretty hard to walk past an unguarded gold mine and remain empty-handed.&quot;

Pogo was a reluctant &quot;candidate&quot; for President (although he never campaigned) in 1952 and 1956. (The phrase &quot;I Go Pogo&quot;, originally a parody of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s iconic campaign slogan &quot;I Like Ike&quot;, appeared on giveaway promotional lapel pins featuring Pogo, and it was also used by Kelly as a book title.) A 1952 campaign rally at Harvard degenerated into chaos sufficient to be officially termed a riot, and police responded. The Pogo Riot was a significant event for the class of &#x27;52; for its 25th reunion, Pogo was the official mascot.

Kelly&#x27;s interest in keeping the strip topical meant that he sometimes worked closer to the deadline than the syndicate wanted. &quot;The syndicates and the newspapers always like to stay about eight weeks in advance,&quot; Kelly said in a 1959 interview, &quot;but because I like to stay as topical as I can and because I&#x27;m sure something will always come up that I&#x27;d like to comment on, I try to keep it somewhere between four and six weeks. Even then it gets rather difficult to forecast what is going to happen six weeks, four weeks, ahead of time. For example, I have a sequence coming on this moonshot that the Russians made. I was able to file it just by a month, but I wish I had known about it a little in advance because I could have hit it right on the nose.&quot;

===Simple J. Malarkey===
Perhaps the most famous example of the strip&#x27;s satirical edge came into being on May 1, 1953, when Kelly introduced a friend of Mole&#x27;s: a wildcat named &quot;Simple J. Malarkey&quot;, an obvious caricature of Senator Joseph McCarthy. This showed significant courage on Kelly&#x27;s part, considering the influence the politician wielded at the time and the possibility of scaring away subscribing newspapers.

When &quot;The Providence Bulletin&quot; issued an ultimatum in 1954, threatening to drop the strip if Malarkey&#x27;s face appeared in the strip again, Kelly had Malarkey throw a bag over his head as Miss &quot;Sis&quot; Boombah (a Rhode Island Red hen) approached, explaining &quot;no one from Providence should see me!&quot; Kelly thought Malarkey&#x27;s new look was especially appropriate because the bag over his head resembled a Klansman&#x27;s hood. (Kelly later attacked the Klan directly, in a comic nightmare parable called &quot;The Kluck Klams&quot;, included in &quot;The Pogo Poop Book&quot;, 1966.)

Malarkey appeared in the strip only once after that sequence ended, during Kelly&#x27;s tenure, on October 15, 1955. Again his face was covered, this time by his speech balloons as he stood on a soapbox shouting to general uninterest. Kelly had planned to defy the threats made by the &quot;Bulletin&quot; and show Malarkey&#x27;s face, but decided it was more fun to see how many people recognized the character and the man he lampooned by speech patterns alone. When Kelly got letters of complaint about kicking the senator when he was down (McCarthy had been censured by that time, and had lost most of his influence), Kelly responded, &quot;They identified him, I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Malarkey reappeared on April 1, 1989, when the strip had been resurrected by Larry Doyle and Neal Sternecky. It was hinted that he was a ghost. (A gag used several times in the original strip, for both Wiley Catt and Simple J Malarkey, was his unexpected reappearance to the Swamp with a frightened regular saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you was alive&quot; - responded to with &quot;Would you stop shakin&#x27; if I tole you...I AIN&#x27;T?!&quot;

===Later politics===
As the 1960s loomed, even foreign &quot;gummint&quot; figures found themselves caricatured in the pages of &quot;Pogo&quot;, including in 1962 communist leaders Fidel Castro, who appeared as an agitator goat named Fido, and Nikita Khrushchev, who emerged as both an unnamed Russian bear and a pig. Other Soviet characters include a pair of cosmonaut seals who arrive at the swamp in 1959 via Sputnik, initiating a topical spoof of the Space Race. In 1964, the strip spoofed the presidential election with P.T. Bridgeport providing wind-up dolls that looked like Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller and George W. Romney. The wind-up caricatures of Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller, George W. Romney, Ronald Reagan, Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy appeared in 1968, during the presidential election. 

Lyndon B. Johnson appeared in two caricatures in the strip. In 1966, he appeared as &quot;The Loan Arranger,&quot; a character that Pogo, Albert, and Churchy La Femme met in Pandamonia. In a reference to Johnson&#x27;s Texas heritage, the Loan Arranger was a centaur, half-human, half-horse, wearing a cowboy hat that was pulled down over his eyes, with Johnson&#x27;s famous chin visible beneath it. He also wore a cowboy shirt and a bandolero of bullets around his waist. Kelly satirized the Vietnam War by having the Loan Arranger compete against Gwhan Shi Foah (a Buddha-like caricature of Mao Zedong) in a hand-shaking contest, for the right to &quot;protect&quot; a young Asian girl named Sha-Lan (representing South Vietnam). Later, during the 1968 presidential election, Johnson reappeared in the strip as an aging, bespectacled Texas longhorn who knew his time was fading and was trying to make a graceful exit.

Because some newspapers were wary of printing political satire on the comics page, Kelly sometimes drew two strips for the same day — the regular satirical Pogo strip, and a less-pointed version that he called the &quot;Bunny Rabbit&quot; strips. The 1982 book &quot;The Best of Pogo&quot; reprinted some of the alternate strips from the presidential election years of 1964 and 1968.

In the early 1970s, Kelly used a collection of characters he called &quot;the Bulldogs&quot; to mock the secrecy and paranoia of the Nixon administration. The Bulldogs included caricatures of J. Edgar Hoover (dressed in an overcoat and fedora, and directing a covert bureau of identical frog operatives), Spiro Agnew (portrayed as an unnamed hyena festooned in ornate military regalia, a parody of the ridiculous uniforms supplied to the White House guards), and John Mitchell (portrayed as a pipe-smoking eaglet wearing high-top sneakers.)

==Nonsense verse and song parodies==
Kelly was an accomplished poet and frequently added pages of original comic verse to his &quot;Pogo&quot; reprint books, complete with cartoon illustrations. The odd song parody or nonsense poem also occasionally appeared in the newspaper strip. In 1956, Kelly published &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot;, an illustrated collection of his original songs, with lyrics by Kelly and music by Kelly and Norman Monath. The tunes were also issued on a vinyl LP, with Kelly himself contributing to the vocals.

The most well-known of Kelly&#x27;s nonsense verses is &quot;Deck Us All with Boston Charlie&quot;, the swamp creatures&#x27; interpretation of the Christmas carol &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;. Each year at Christmas time, it was traditional for the strip to publish at least the first stanza:
:Deck us all with Boston Charlie,
:Walla Walla Wash., and Kalamazoo!
:Nora&#x27;s freezin&#x27; on the trolley
:Swaller dollar cauliflower alleygaroo
:Don&#x27;t we know archaic barrel
:Lullaby, lilla boy, Louisville Lou
:Trolley Molly don&#x27;t love Harold
:Boola boola Pensacoola hullabaloo
Some years also included other verses and versions: for example, the dog Beauregard knew it as &quot;Bark us all bow-wows of folly, Polly wolly cracker &#x27;n&#x27; too-da-loo!&quot;

&quot;Deck Us All with Boston Charlie&quot; was recorded in 1961 by Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross for the album &quot;&quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;.

==Personal references==
Walt Kelly frequently had his characters poling around the swamp in a flat-bottomed skiff. Invariably, it had a name on the side that was a personal reference of Kelly&#x27;s: the name of a friend, a political figure, a fellow cartoonist, or the name of a newspaper, its editor or publisher. The name changed from one day to the next, and even from panel to panel in the same strip, but it was usually a tribute to a real-life person Kelly wished to salute in print.

==Awards and recognition==


The creator and series have received a great deal of recognition over the years. Walt Kelly has been compared to everyone from James Joyce and Lewis Carroll, to Aesop and Joel Chandler Harris (&quot;Uncle Remus&quot;). His skills as a humorous illustrator of animals have been celebrated alongside those of John Tenniel, A. B. Frost, T. S. Sullivant, Heinrich Kley and Lawson Wood. In his essay &quot;The Decline of the Comics&quot; (&quot;Canadian Forum&quot;, January 1954), literary critic Hugh MacLean classified American comic strips into four types: daily gag, adventure, soap opera and &quot;an almost lost comic ideal: the disinterested comment on life&#x27;s pattern and meaning.&quot; In the fourth type, according to MacLean, there were only two: &quot;Pogo&quot; and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner.&quot; When the first &quot;Pogo&quot; collection was published in 1951, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas declared that &quot;nothing comparable has happened in the history of the comic strip since George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Carl Sandburg said that many comics were too sad, but, &#x27;I Go Pogo.&#x27; Francis Taylor, Director of the Metropolitan Museum, said before the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; Forum: &#x27;Pogo has not yet supplanted Shakespeare or the King James Version of the Bible in our schools.&#x27; &quot; Kelly was elected president of the National Cartoonists Society in 1954, serving until 1956. He was the first strip cartoonist invited to contribute originals to the Library of Congress.
* Kelly received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Billy DeBeck Memorial Award for Cartoonist of the Year in 1951. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Kelly also retroactively received a Reuben statuette.)
* The prestigious Silver T-Square is awarded, by unanimous vote of the NCS board of directors, to persons who have demonstrated outstanding dedication or service to the Society or the profession; Kelly received one in 1972.
* The Comic-Con International Inkpot Award was given to Kelly posthumously in 1989.
* Kelly is one of only 31 artists elected to the Hall of Fame of the National Cartoon Museum (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art).
* Kelly was also inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1995.
* The Fantagraphics &quot;Pogo&quot; collections were a top vote-getter for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album for 1998.

==Influence and legacy==
Walt Kelly&#x27;s work has influenced a number of prominent comic artists:
* From 1951 to 1954, Famous Studios animator Irv Spector drew the syndicated &quot;Coogy&quot; strip, which was heavily influenced by Kelly&#x27;s work, for the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot;.
* In the &quot;Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book&quot;, cartoonist Bill Watterson listed &quot;Pogo&quot; as one of the three greatest influences on &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, along with &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;.
* &quot;Pogo&quot; has been cited as an influence by Jeff MacNelly (&quot;Shoe&quot;), Garry Trudeau (&quot;Doonesbury&quot;), Bill Holbrook (&quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; ) and Mark O&#x27;Hare (&quot;Citizen Dog&quot;), among others. MacNelly also gave a speech praising the strip and all of Walt Kelly&#x27;s work that was published in the book &quot;Outrageously Pogo&quot;, which was a collection of praise of the strip.
* René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo were both admirers of &quot;Pogo&quot;, and many of Walt Kelly&#x27;s visual devices resurfaced in &quot;Astérix&quot;. For example, the Goths speak in blackletter text, and a Roman tax-collector speaks in bureaucratic forms.
* Jim Henson acknowledged Kelly as a major influence on his sense of humor, and he based some early Muppet designs on Kelly drawings. One episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&#x27;s&quot; first season included a performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Sugar Me&quot; from &quot;Songs of the Pogo.&quot;
* Robert Crumb cites &quot;Pogo&quot; as an influence on &quot;Animal Town&quot;, an early series of comic strips he drew with his brother Charles that later formed the basis for R. Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;.
* Harvey Kurtzman parodied &quot;Pogo&quot; as &quot;Gopo Gossum&quot; for the comic book &quot;Mad&quot; No. 23, published by EC Comics in 1955. It was the first of many &quot;Mad&quot; references to &quot;Pogo&quot;, most of them drawn by Wally Wood. According to &quot;The Best of Pogo&quot; (1982), &quot;Walt Kelly was well aware of the &quot;Mad&quot; parodies, and loved them.&quot; Kelly directly acknowledged Wally Wood, and even had Albert spell out his name in &quot;Pogo Extra: Election Special&quot; (1960).
* Writer Alan Moore and artist Shawn McManus made the January 1985 issue (#32) of &quot;Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; a tribute to &quot;Pogo&quot; (titled &quot;Pog&quot;), with Kellyesque wordplay and artwork.
* Jeff Smith acknowledged that his &quot;Bone&quot; comic book series was strongly influenced by Walt Kelly&#x27;s work. Smith and Peter Kelly contributed artwork of the cast of &quot;Bone&quot; meeting Pogo and Albert for the 1998 &quot;Pogofest&quot; celebration.
* Jonathan Lemon cites Pogo as an inspiration or more as a &quot;hero&quot; for his comic strip &quot;Rabbits Against Magic&quot;
*American rock band Kaleidoscope released a song named &quot;Lulu Arfin Nanny&quot; on their 1970 album &quot;Bernice&quot;.
*The protagonist of the film &quot;Simon&quot; (1980) is brainwashed to think he is an alien living on Earth and pirates the TV broadcast airwaves to talk to the people. In a field with his girlfriend he muses &quot;I give em my best stuff too. Shakespeare, Pogo, the prophets.&quot;
*The American alternative rock group They Might Be Giants referenced a 1953 &quot;Pogo&quot; strip in their 1988 single Ana Ng in which Pogo and Churchy, per the lyrics of the song, &quot;Make a hole with a gun perpendicular to the name of this town in a desktop globe&quot; in order to find their antipode.

==&quot;Pogo&quot; in other media==
At its peak, Walt Kelly&#x27;s possum appeared in nearly 500 newspapers in 14 countries. Pogo&#x27;s exploits were collected into more than four dozen books, which collectively sold close to 30 million copies. &quot;Pogo&quot; already had had a successful life in comic books, previous to syndication. The increased visibility of the newspaper strip and popular trade paperback titles allowed Kelly&#x27;s characters to branch into other media, such as television, children&#x27;s records, and even a theatrical film.

In addition, Walt Kelly appeared as himself on television at least twice. He was interviewed live by Edward R. Murrow for the CBS program &quot;Person to Person&quot;, in an episode originally broadcast on January 14, 1954. Kelly can also be seen briefly in the 1970 NBC special &quot;This Is Al Capp&quot; talking candidly about his friend, the creator of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;.

While professional singers (including Bob McGrath, later famous as &quot;Bob&quot; on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) provided most of the vocals on the album, Kelly himself contributed lead vocals on &quot;Go Go Pogo&quot; (for which he also composed the music) and &quot;Lines Upon a Tranquil Brow&quot;, as well as a spoken portion for &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. Mike Stewart, who was later known for singing the theme song of &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, sang &quot;Whence that Wince&quot;, &quot;Evidence&quot; and &quot;Whither the Starling&quot;.

* &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot; was released on CD in 2004 by Reaction Records (Urbana, Illinois), including previously unreleased material.

===Animation and puppetry===
Three animated cartoons were created to date based on &quot;Pogo&quot;:
* &quot;The Pogo Special Birthday Special&quot; was produced and directed by animator Chuck Jones in honor of the strip&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 1969. It starred June Foray as the voice of both Pogo and Hepzibah, with Kelly and Jones contributing voice work as well. The critical consensus is that the special, which first aired on NBC-TV on May 18, 1969, failed to capture the charm of the comic strip. Kelly was not pleased with the results, and it was generally disliked by critics and fans of the comic strip.
* Walt and Selby Kelly themselves wrote and animated &quot;We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us&quot; in 1970, largely due to Kelly&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the &quot;Birthday Special.&quot; The short, with its anti-pollution message, was animated and colored by hand. While the project went unfinished due to Kelly&#x27;s ill health, the storyboards for the cartoon helped form the first half of the book of the same title.
* The theatrical, feature-length motion picture &quot;I Go Pogo&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Pogo for President&quot;) was released in late August 1980. Directed by Marc Paul Chinoy, this stop motion animated feature starred the voices of Skip Hinnant as Pogo; Ruth Buzzi as Miz Beaver and Hepzibah; Stan Freberg as Albert; Arnold Stang as Churchy; Jonathan Winters as Porky, Mole, and Wiley Catt; Kelly&#x27;s friend, New York journalist Jimmy Breslin as P. T. Bridgeport; and Vincent Price as the Deacon.

The &quot;Birthday Special&quot; and &quot;I Go Pogo&quot; were released on home video throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The &quot;Birthday Special&quot; was released on VHS by MGM/UA Home Video in 1986 and they alongside Turner Entertainment released it on VHS again on August 1, 1992.

&quot;I Go Pogo&quot; was handled by Fotomat for its original VHS and Betamax release in September 1980. HBO premiered a re-cut version of the film in October 1982, with added narration by Len Maxwell; this version would continue to air on HBO for some time, and then on other cable movie stations like Cinemax, TMC, and Showtime, until around February 1991. Walt Disney Home Video released a similar cut of the film in 1984, with some deleted scenes added/restored. This version of the film was released on VHS again on December 4, 1989, by Walt Disney Home Video and United American Video to the &quot;sell through&quot; home video market.

As of 2019, there&#x27;s still no word of Warner Archive planning to release &quot;Birthday Special&quot; on DVD. That special (along with &quot;I Go Pogo&quot;) have never officially been made available on DVD. Selby Kelly had been selling specially packaged DVDs of &quot;We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us&quot; prior to her death, but it is unknown whether or not further copies will be available.

==Licensing and promotion==
&quot;Pogo&quot; also branched out from the comic pages into consumer products—including TV sponsor tie-ins to the &quot;Birthday Special&quot;—although not nearly to the degree of other contemporary comic strips, such as &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Selby Kelly has attributed the comparative paucity of licensed material to Kelly&#x27;s pickiness about the quality of merchandise attached to his characters.
* 1951: &quot;Special Delivery Pogo&quot;, a 16-page promotional mailer from the Post-Hall Syndicate, designed to spark interest and boost circulation of the new strip.
* 1952: &quot;I Go Pogo&quot; tin litho lapel pinback. Approx. 1 inch in diameter, with Pogo&#x27;s face on a yellow background; issued as a promotional giveaway during the 1952 presidential election.
* 1954: &quot;Walt Kelly&#x27;s Pogo Mobile&quot; (issued by Simon and Schuster) was a 22-piece hanging mobile, die-cut from heavy cardboard in bright colors. Came unassembled, and included Pogo on a cow jumping over a crescent-shaped Swiss cheese moon, with Okefenokee characters sitting on the Moon or in a filigreed frame.
* 1959: Rare porcelain figurine of a sitting Pogo, with a bird in a nest atop his head; made in Ireland by Wade Ceramics Ltd.
* 1968: Set of 30 celluloid pinback buttons, quite rare. Approx. 1.75 inches in diameter, issued during the 1968 presidential elections.
* 1968: Set of 10 color character decals, very rare; coincided with the set of election pinbacks
* 1968: Poynter Products of Ohio issued a set of six plastic figures (now very rare) with glued-on artificial fur: Pogo, Albert, Beauregard, Churchy, Howland and Hepzibah. The figures displeased Kelly, but are highly sought-after by fans.
* 1969: Six vinyl giveaway figures of Pogo, Albert, Beauregard, Churchy, Howland and Porkypine, packaged with Procter &amp; Gamble soap products (Spic and Span, Top Job, etc.) as a tie-in with the &quot;Pogo&quot; animated TV special. Also known as the Oxydol figures, they are fairly common and easy to find. Walt Kelly was not satisfied with the initial sculpting, and—using plasticine clay—resculpted them himself.
* 1969: Six plastic giveaway cups with full-color character decals of Pogo, Albert, Beauregard, Churchy, Howland and Porkypine, coincided with the Oxydol figures.
* 1969: Pogo Halloween costume, manufactured by Ben Cooper.
* 1980: View-Master &quot;I Go Pogo&quot; set, 3 reels and booklet, GAF
* 2002: Dark Horse Comics issued two limited edition figures of Pogo and Albert as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters—statues No. 24 and No. 25, respectively.

==Book collections and reprints==
===Simon &amp; Schuster &quot;Pogo&quot; books===
Simon &amp; Schuster published a long series of &quot;Pogo&quot; books beginning in 1951. S&amp;S editor Peter Schwed writes, &quot;The first collection of &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strips burst upon the world in 1951 as the result of [editor] Jack Goodman&#x27;s insistence that there should be such a book for those who could not afford a daily newspaper, particularly since it was the only thing in the newspapers worth reading... &quot;Pogo&quot; was &quot;the&quot; comic strip of the nation and the many books that were published before Walt died each sold in the hundreds of thousands of copies.&quot;

Simon &amp; Schuster published 33 &quot;Pogo&quot; books between 1951 and 1972, often publishing two or three books a year. In addition to strip reprints, Kelly also published books of original material, including &quot;Uncle Pogo So-So Stories&quot;, &quot;The Pogo Stepmother Goose&quot; and &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot;.

All titles are by Walt Kelly:

<text>The Okefenokee Swamp is a shallow, 438,000-acre (177,000 ha), peat-filled wetland straddling the Georgia–Florida line in the United States. A majority of the swamp is protected by the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and the Okefenokee Wilderness. The Okefenokee Swamp is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia and is the largest &quot;blackwater&quot; swamp in North America.

The swamp was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974.

== Etymology ==
The name Okefenokee is attested with more than a dozen variant spellings of the word in historical literature. Though often translated as &quot;land of trembling earth&quot;, the name is likely derived from Hitchiti &quot;oki fanôːki&quot; &quot;bubbling water&quot;.

== Origin ==
The Okefenokee was formed over the past 6,500 years by the accumulation of peat in a shallow basin on the edge of an ancient Atlantic coastal terrace, the geological relic of a Pleistocene estuary. The swamp is bordered by Trail Ridge, a strip of elevated land believed to have formed as coastal dunes or an offshore barrier island. The St. Marys River and the Suwannee River both originate in the swamp. The Suwannee River originates as stream channels in the heart of the Okefenokee Swamp and drains at least 90 percent of the swamp&#x27;s watershed southwest toward the Gulf of Mexico. The St. Marys River, which drains only 5 to 10 percent of the swamp&#x27;s southeastern corner, flows south along the western side of Trail Ridge, through the ridge at St. Marys River Shoals, and north again along the eastern side of Trail Ridge before turning east to the Atlantic.

== History ==
The earliest known inhabitants of the Okefenokee Swamp were the Timucua-speaking Oconi, who dwelt in or on the margin of the swamp. The Spanish friars built the mission of Santiago de Oconi in order to convert them to Christianity. The Oconi&#x27;s boating skills, developed in the hazardous swamps, likely contributed to their later employment by the Spanish as ferrymen across the St. Johns River, near the riverside terminus of North Florida&#x27;s &quot;camino real.&quot;

Modern-day longtime residents of the Okefenokee Swamp, referred to as &quot;Swampers&quot;, are of overwhelmingly English ancestry. Due to relative isolation, the inhabitants of the Okefenokee used Elizabethan phrases and syntax, preserved since the early colonial period when such speech was common in England, well into the 20th century. The Suwannee Canal was dug across the swamp in the late 19th century in a failed attempt to drain the Okefenokee. After the Suwannee Canal Company&#x27;s bankruptcy, most of the swamp was purchased by the Hebard family of Philadelphia, who conducted extensive cypress logging operations from 1909 to 1927. Several other logging companies ran railroad lines into the swamp until 1942; some remnants remain visible crossing swamp waterways. On the west side of the swamp, at Billy&#x27;s Island, logging equipment and other artifacts remain of a 1920s logging town of 600 residents. Most of the Okefenokee Swamp is included in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.

The largest wildfire in the swamp&#x27;s history began with a lightning strike near the center of the refuge on May 5, 2007, eventually merging with another wildfire that began near Waycross, Georgia, on April 16 when a tree fell on a power line. Named the Bugaboo Scrub Fire, by May 31, it had burned more than , or more than 935 square miles, and remains the largest wildfire in both Georgia and Florida history.

In 2011, the Honey Prairie Fire consumed of land in the swamp.

==Access==

There are four public entrances:
* Suwannee Canal Recreation Area at Folkston, Georgia
* Kingfisher Landing at Race Pond, Georgia
* Stephen C. Foster State Park at Fargo, Georgia
* Suwannee Sill Recreation Area at Fargo, Georgia

In addition, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, Okefenokee Swamp Park, provides the northernmost access into the Okefenokee Swamp near Waycross, Georgia.

State Road 2 passes through the Florida portion between the Georgia cities of Council and Moniac.

The graded Swamp Perimeter Road encircles Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. Gated and closed to public use, it provides access for fire management of the interface between the federal refuge and the surrounding industrial tree farms.

==Tourism==
Many visitors enter the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge each year. The swamp provides an important economic resource to southeast Georgia and northeast Florida. More than 600,000 visitors from as many as 46 countries travel to the Okefenokee refuge each year to enjoy its unmatched wilderness. This tourism supports over 750 local jobs and contributes over $64 million to local economies.

==Titanium mining operations==
A 50-year titanium mining operation by DuPont was set to begin in 1997, but protests and public–government opposition over possibly disastrous environmental effects from 1996 to 2000 forced the company to abandon the project in 2000 and retire their mineral rights forever. In 2003, DuPont donated the it had purchased for mining to The Conservation Fund, and in 2005, nearly of the donated land was transferred to Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.

In 2018, Twin Pines Minerals LLC proposed another titanium mining operation near the Okefenokee Swamp. Over 60,000 people sent comments opposing the operation. Later, in 2020, a new rule by the first Trump administration reduced what was protected under the Clean Water Act, removing about in the proposed mining site from federal protections. The updated plan would include mining for titanium and zirconium, southeast of the Okefenokee Refuge. However, in 2022, U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff blocked the proposed titanium mine after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service warned of severe potential damage to the wildlife refuge.

The Okefenokee Swamp was listed as one of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Rivers in 2020 and again in 2023 on account of the mining threats.

==Environment==
The Okefenokee Swamp is part of the Southeastern conifer forests ecoregion. Much of the Okefenokee is a southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamp, forested by bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) and swamp tupelo (&quot;Nyssa biflora&quot;) trees. Upland areas support southern coastal plain oak domes and hammocks, thick stands of evergreen oaks. Drier and more frequently burned areas support Atlantic coastal plain upland longleaf pine woodlands of longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;).

The swamp has many species of carnivorous plants, including many species of &quot;Utricularia&quot;, &quot;Sarracenia psittacina&quot;, and the giant &quot;Sarracenia minor&quot; var. &quot;okefenokeensis&quot;. A species of mushroom-like fungus &quot;Rogersiomyces okefenokeensis&quot; is found in the swamp.

The Okefenokee Swamp is home to many wading birds, including herons, egrets, ibises, cranes, and bitterns, though populations fluctuate with seasons and water levels. The swamp also hosts numerous woodpecker and songbird species. Okefenokee is famous for its amphibians and reptiles such as toads, frogs, turtles, lizards, snakes, and an abundance of American alligators. The oldest known alligator, named &quot;Okefenokee Joe&quot; after environmentalist Okefenokee Joe, died in September 2021, at almost 80 years of age. The Okefenokee Swamp is also a critical habitat for the Florida black bear.

==Recent events==

More than of the Okefenokee region burned from April to July 2007. Essentially the entire swamp burned, but the degrees of impact are widely varied. Smoke from the fires was reported as far away as Atlanta and Orlando.

Four years later, in April 2011, the Honey Prairie wildfire began when the swamp was left much drier than usual by an extreme drought. As of January 2012, the Honey Prairie fire had already scorched more than of the Okefenokee, sending volumes of smoke across the southern Atlantic seaboard and with an unknown impact on wildlife. With the drought still continuing, the massive Honey Prairie fire continued to burn at only 75% containment. On April 17, 2012, the Honey Prairie Fire was finally declared out. Thousands of firefighters, refuge neighbors, and businesses contributed to the safe suppression of this fire. At the peak of fire activity on June 27, 2011, the Honey Prairie Complex had grown to and had 202 engines, 112 dozers, 20 water tenders, 12 helicopters, and 6 crews with a total of 1,458 personnel assigned. Over the duration of the fire, there were no fatalities or serious injuries. Firefighters managed to contain most of the fire within the boundaries of the 402,000 acre Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, with only burned outside the refuge.

On April 6, 2017, a lightning strike started the West Mims Fire, which burned about .

==In popular culture==
* The name &quot;Okefenokee&quot; has appeared many times in American pop culture, including Walt Kelly&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot;, where the characters made their home in the Okefenokee Swamp, and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, in which Scooby-Dum comes from the Okefenokee as well.
* The 1941 movie &quot;Swamp Water&quot;, directed by Jean Renoir, starring Walter Brennan and Walter Huston, and based on the novel by Vereen Bell, was shot on location in the Okefenokee near Waycross, Georgia.
* The 1952 movie &quot;Lure of the Wilderness&quot;, a remake of &quot;Swamp Water&quot; starring Jeffrey Hunter, Walter Brennan (reprising his &quot;Swamp Water&quot; role), and Jean Peters, was set in the Okefenokee Swamp.
* In 1974, two LP recordings of the sounds of the swamp were released as disk 6 of the &quot;Environments&quot; series.
* Tales of the Okefenokee was a mill chute ride at Six Flags Over Georgia that ran from 1967 to 1980, with theming inspired by the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler Harris.
* The 1976 movie Gator, starring and directed by Burt Reynolds, and the title song of the same name by Jerry Reed, are set in the Okefenokee swamp. 
* An illustrated children&#x27;s book, &quot;Deep in the Swamp&quot; by Donna M. Bateman (2007), describes the plant and animals of the Okefenokee Swamp.

<text>Charles John Stanley (17 January 1712 Old Style – 19 May 1786) was an English composer and organist.

==Biography==
John Stanley was born in London on 17 January 1712. At about the age of two, he fell on a marble hearth with a china basin in his hand, an accident which left him almost blind.

He began studying music at the age of seven. Under the guidance of Maurice Greene, composer and organist at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, he studied &quot;with great diligence, and a success that was astonishing&quot; (Burney). At the age of nine he played the organ, probably as an occasional deputy, at All Hallows, Bread Street. When he was eleven years old, Stanley was appointed organist to the church at a salary of £20 per annum.

When he was fourteen &quot;in preference to a great number of candidates&quot; (Burney) he was chosen as organist at St Andrew Holborn, and at the age of seventeen became the youngest person ever to obtain the Bachelor of Music degree (B.Mus.) from the University of Oxford.

In 1734 he was appointed organist to the Society of the Inner Temple, a position which he held until his death in 1786. It was at the ancient Temple Church that his brilliant playing upon the organ and harpsichord attracted the attention of many fine musicians including George Frideric Handel, who regularly visited the church to hear him. Stanley was also an outstanding violinist.

In 1738 Stanley married Sarah Arlond (daughter of Captain Edward Arlond of the East India Company), who brought him a dowry of £7,000 per annum. Sarah&#x27;s sister Ann, who at this time lived with them, became the blind composer&#x27;s copyist.

Though virtually blind, Stanley had a remarkable memory, which helped him direct many of Handel&#x27;s oratorios and to enjoy music-making and card games with his many friends. If he had to accompany a new oratorio he would ask his sister-in-law to play it through just once – enough to commit it to memory. He frequently played the organ at the Vauxhall Gardens and was first choice to play at charity events and at the launch of any newly built church organs. He even found time to teach. His oratorio &quot;Jephthah&quot; was first performed in 1757.

After Handel&#x27;s death in 1759, in 1760 Stanley began a partnership with the composer John Christopher Smith and later with Thomas Linley, in order to continue with the series of oratorio performances at Covent Garden. For the first season Stanley composed &quot;Zimri.&quot; Stanley accompanied all oratorios, and played a concerto during each interval. Also in 1760 he composed an ode in memory of George II and as homage to George III; it was first performed at the Drury Lane Theatre. On the occasion of the King&#x27;s wedding in 1762 he composed a dramatic pastoral oratorio, &quot;Arcadia.&quot;

Handel had been a governor of the Foundling Hospital, London. The hospital&#x27;s chapel organ was Handel&#x27;s gift, and Handel himself directed eleven performances of &quot;Messiah&quot; there, so raising £7,000 for the charity. Continuing yet again in Handel&#x27;s footsteps, Stanley was elected a governor of the Hospital in 1770, and from 1775 until 1777 he directed the annual performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in aid of the hospital funds.

In 1779 Stanley succeeded William Boyce as Master of the King&#x27;s Band of musicians. In this capacity he composed many New Year and birthday odes to the king but this music has not survived. Stanley&#x27;s last work was probably an ode written for the king&#x27;s birthday (4 June 1786). Stanley never heard its performance as he died at his home in Hatton Garden on 19 May 1786, aged 74.

Stanley&#x27;s works include the opera &quot;Teraminta&quot;, the dramatic cantata &quot;The Choice of Hercules&quot;, twelve other cantatas with texts by John Hawkins, the oratorios &quot;Jephtha&quot;, &quot;The Fall of Egypt&quot; and &quot;Zimri&quot;, and instrumental music, notably three volumes of voluntaries for organ (1748, 1752, and 1754). Nearly all of the voluntaries feature a short, slow introduction followed by either a solo-stop movement (such as the so-called trumpet voluntaries) or a fugue. Some of the former have been arranged in modern times for string chamber orchestra and trumpet.

<doc id="192639" wikidata="Q7868667" url="?curid=192639" title="USS Culgoa">
<text>USS &quot;Culgoa&quot; (AF-3) was a steam cargo liner. She was launched in England in 1889 for Blue Anchor Line, who ran her between England and Australia. In 1898 she was bought for the United States Navy as a stores ship. She served in the Philippine–American War; the Great White Fleet; and the First World War. In January 1909 she took part in the relief operation after the 1908 Messina earthquake. To date, she is the only US Navy ship to have been named &quot;Culgoa&quot;. In 1922 the United States Department of the Navy sold her to a civilian owner, who renamed her Champlain. She was scrapped in the United States in 1924.

==Building==
In 1889, shipyards in North East England launched two sister ships for Blue Anchor Line. The first was built by J Wigham Richardson &amp; Co of Newcastle, and launched on 28 August as . The second was built by J.L. Thompson and Sons of Sunderland as yard number 257; launched on 25 October as &quot;Culgoa&quot;; and completed on 4 January 1890. Her beam was a few inches greater than &quot;Bungaree&quot;″s, but they were otherwise identical. She was named after the town of Culgoa in Victoria. &quot;Culgoa&quot;″s lengths were overall and registered. Her beam was ; her depth was ; and her draft was . As built, her tonnages were ; ; and displacement. She had three masts. She had a well deck forward, but not aft. She had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine that was rated at 419 NHP and gave her a speed of .

Blue Anchor Line registered &quot;Culgoa&quot; in London. Her United Kingdom official number was 96681, and her code letters were LMSQ. By 1896, Blue Anchor had refrigerating equipment installed in of &quot;Culgoa&quot;″s holds to carry perishable cargo. Her tonnages were reassessed as and .

==US Navy service==
===Philippine–American War, 1898–1901===

The US Navy bought &quot;Calgoa&quot; in Cavite in the Philippines on 4 June 1898. She was commissioned on 3 December 1898, one week before the signing of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War. She was assigned to the Asiatic Squadron as a refrigerator supply ship, and operated from Cavite Navy Yard supplying ships and troops at Manila with ice and meat until August 1899. She was then appraised for possible sale, but instead was overhauled at Hong Kong between 20 October and 18 November 1899.

&quot;Culgoa&quot; made three voyages to Sydney, New South Wales and Brisbane, Queensland, for fresh stores in 1900 and 1901. On 21 January 1900, the Eastern and Australian Steamship Company coaster &quot;Airlie&quot; grounded on a reef at Chapman Island, Queensland. &quot;Culgoa&quot;, en route from Manila to Sydney, rescued &quot;Airlie&quot;″s mail and 32 passengers, and landed them at Townsville. &quot;Airlie&quot; was later refloated and repaired.

On 22 July 1901, &quot;Culgoa&quot; left Cavite and sailed via Ceylon, the Suez Canal, Malta, and Gibraltar to New York, arriving on 25 September. She was decommissioned on 16 October 1901 at Boston.

===North Atlantic Squadron, 1902–1905===
&quot;Culgoa&quot; was recommissioned on 1 October 1902, and assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron. Lieutenant Commander Robert Morris Doyle as her commanding officer from October 1902 to October 1904, when Lieut Cdr James Harrison Oliver relieved him.

On the evening of 9 November 1904, &quot;Culgoa&quot; accidentally rammed the schooner &quot;Wilson and Hunting&quot; about off Barnegat Lighthouse, New Jersey. The night was clear, and both ships were headed north along the coast, and the steamship approached the schooner from astern. There was a blustery northeast wind, and the schooner was on a starboard tack. &quot;Wilson and Hunting&quot; was correctly lit, and lit a flare three times, which was the customary signal from a sailing craft to a steamer approaching from astern. &quot;Culgoa&quot; maintained her course; struck the schooner; and almost cut her in two. The impact was such that one member of the steamship&#x27;s engine department crew was thrown against machinery and injured. Aboard the schooner, the steward and two seamen climbed the schooner&#x27;s rigging to reach safety aboard the steamship. The Mate tried to do the same, but &quot;Culgoa&quot; went astern, separating the two ships, and he was thrown into the sea. The steamship lowered a boat, whose crew threw the Mate a line and rescued him. But after the two ships separated, &quot;Wilson and Hunting&quot; capsized, killing its Captain; his wife; and two Norwegian seamen. (One later report said four seamen.) The capsized schooner stayed afloat and drifted landwards, and two of the steamship&#x27;s boats searched for more survivors, but found none. &quot;Culgoa&quot; then landed the four survivors at Tompkinsville, Staten Island. The capsized schooner drifted ashore at Long Beach, NJ. There it formed a hazard to other shipping, so a fortnight later it was destroyed with explosives.

&quot;Culgoa&quot; supplied ships and shore stations in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico until 11 August 1905, when she was decommissioned again. She was considered for sale, and on 7 May 1906 she was struck from the Navy List, but on 30 June she was reinstated.

===Great White Fleet, 1907–1909===

On 12 September 1907, &quot;Culgoa&quot; was recommissioned again. She was loaned to the Panama Canal Railway, and on 21 September 1907 left New York carrying an emergency shipment of 500 tons of beef. She got back to New York on 16 October 1907.

On 11 December 1907, &quot;Culgoa&quot; left New York to join the Atlantic Battleship Fleet at Santa Lucia as stores ship, as one of four auxiliaries accompanying the 16 battleships on the cruise of the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;. On the cruise, while on a planned supply run, she carried naval artist Henry Reuterdahl, who painted a number of scenes of the expedition. At Amoy (Xiamen) in China, and in the Taiwan Strait between 28 October and 5 November 1908, she helped to establish wireless communications with the Second Squadron.

On 28 December 1908, an earthquake struck Messina, Italy. On 3 January 1909 the Great White Fleet reached Port Said from Colombo. was immediately sent through the Suez Canal to make for Messina. &quot;Culgoa&quot; followed a few hours after her, carrying food and drink; beds and bedding; six surgeons; and a number of other hospital staff. &quot;Yankton&quot; reached Messina on 9 January, followed by &quot;Culgoa&quot;.

===Atlantic and Caribbean, 1909–1919===
&quot;Culgoa&quot; returned to Hampton Roads on 17 February 1909, and resumed her supply duties along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until 1 December 1910, when she went to supply ships serving in European waters. She called at Brest and Cherbourg in France, and Weymouth and Gravesend in England, and returned to New York on 20 January 1911. She left New York 11 February 1911 for the Caribbean, where she supplied US ships and shore detachments until 1918. Commander Julian Lane Latimer was her commanding officer from 11 October 1911 until 10 May 1912. She assisted US military invertentions in Mexico; the US invasion of Haiti; and the US invasion of the Dominican Republic. By 1914, &quot;Culgoa&quot; was equipped with wireless telegraphy. Her call sign was NDU. In November 1916, she struck a submerged obstruction off Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic,which caused her to lose her propeller. and the tugboat went to her aid.
In February 1918, &quot;Culgoa&quot; was then transferred to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service for the remainder of World War I. She made seven transatlantic convoy voyages to bases in France and Britain between 19 February 1918 and 10 May 1919. On 10 July 1918 she assisted , which sank after a collision with . She rescued survivors, and towed &quot;San Jacinto&quot; into Halifax, Nova Scotia.

===Pacific, 1920–1922===
&quot;Culgoa&quot; issued stores and provisions to Battle Squadron 2 at Guantanamo Bay from 24 March to 6 April 1920, then after supplying shore installations at Yorktown and Philadelphia, she left Brooklyn on 2 June for fleet maneuvers in the Pacific. On 17 July 1920 she was given the hull classification symbol AF-3. She joined Battle Squadron 2 at Colón, Panama, transited the Panama Canal, and joined in fleet problems on her way to Pearl Harbor, visiting Seattle and San Francisco. She returned to New York on 3 September 1920 for overhaul, and resumed supply operations on the East Coast and in the Caribbean from February to October 1921. The Navy decommissioned her for the final time at New York City on 31 December 1921.

==&quot;Champlain&quot;==
On 25 July 1922, LH Stewart bought &quot;Culgoa&quot;. He renamed her &quot;Champlain&quot;, and registered her in New York. Her US official number was 222721, and her code letters were MDWH. She was scrapped in New York in the third quarter of 1924.

<doc id="192640" wikidata="Q14369" url="?curid=192640" title="Inn (river)">
<text>The Inn (; ) is a river in Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The long river is a right tributary of the Danube, being the third largest tributary of the Danube by discharge. The highest point of its drainage basin is the summit of Piz Bernina at . The Engadine, the valley of the En, is the only Swiss valley whose waters end up in the Black Sea (via the Danube).

==Etymology==
The name Inn is derived from the old Celtic words &quot;en&quot; and &quot;enios&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot;. In a document of 1338, the river was named &quot;Wasser&quot; (German for water). The first written mention from the years 105 to 109 (Publii Corneli Taciti historiarium liber tertius) reads: &quot;... Sextilius Felix... ad occupandam ripam Aeni fluminis, quod Raetos Noricosque interfluit, missus...&quot; (&quot;... Sextilius Felix was sent to capture the banks of the Inn, which flows between the Rhaetian people and the Noric people.&quot;) The river is also mentioned by other authors of the Roman Empire as &quot;Ainos&quot; (Greek) or &quot;Aenus&quot; (Latin). In medieval Latin it was written as &quot;Enus&quot; or &quot;Oenus&quot;. The change in the old Bavarian language from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;i&quot; turned Enus to &quot;In&quot;. Until the 17th century, it was written like this or &quot;Yn&quot;, but also &quot;Ihn&quot; or &quot;Yhn&quot;. The double-n appeared only in the 16th century, for example in the Tyrolian Landreim of 1557, and since the 18th century this spelling and pronunciation with a short vowel has been customary.

The mentions in Roman times refer to the lower course. The Tyrolean section was first called Aenus by Venantius Fortunatus in the 6th century. The name Engadin and the Romansh name &quot;En&quot; indicate that the upper reaches of the river have always been called this way. Even though it was occasionally believed that the Inn originated near the Adige at the Reschen Pass, since the 16th century at the latest the origin has been seen uniformly in the area of the lakes at the Maloja Pass.

A connection may exist between the name Inn and the name of the French river Ain.

==Geography==
The source of the Inn is located in the Swiss Alps, west of St. Moritz in the Engadine region, which is named after the river (Romansh &quot;Engiadina&quot;; Latin &quot;vallis Eniatina&quot;). Shortly after it leaves its source, the Inn flows through the largest lakes on its course, Lake Sils and Lake Silvaplana. It runs north-eastwards, entering Austria, and from Landeck eastwards through the Austrian state of Tyrol and its capital, Innsbruck (&quot;bridge over the Inn&quot;), and crosses the border into Bavaria near Kufstein.

On Bavarian territory the river runs northwards and passes Rosenheim, Wasserburg am Inn, and Waldkraiburg; then it turns east, runs through Mühldorf and Neuötting and is enlarged by two major tributaries, the Alz and the Salzach. From here to the Danube, it forms the border between Germany (Bavaria) and Austria (Upper Austria). Towns on this last section of the river are Marktl am Inn, Simbach on Inn, Braunau am Inn and Schärding.

In Passau the Inn finally enters the Danube (as does the river Ilz there). Although the Inn has a greater average flow than the Danube when they converge in Passau, and its watershed contains the Piz Bernina, the highest point in the Danube watershed, the Inn is considered a tributary of the Danube, which has a greater length, drains a larger surface area, and has a more consistent flow.
The Inn is the only river originating in Switzerland that ends in the Black Sea (via the Danube).

===Tributaries===

* Right tributaries (in downstream order): Flaz, Spöl, Clemgia, Faggenbach, Pitzbach, Ötztaler Ache, Melach, Sill, Ziller, Alpbach, Wildschönauer Ache, Brixentaler Ache, Weißache, Kaiserbach, Rohrdorfer Ache, Sims, Murn, Alz, Salzach, Enknach, Mattig, Ach, Hartbach, Antiesen, Pram
* Left tributaries (in downstream order; two different rivers called Rott exist): Beverin, Schergenbach, Sanna, Gurglbach, Höttinger Bach, Mühlauer Bach, Brandenberger Ache, Kieferbach, Auerbach, Kirchbach, Mangfall, Rott, Attel, Isen, Rott

== Flow ==
The average discharge at the mouth of the Inn is .

=== 2013 flood ===

On 3 June 2013 the discharge of the Inn in Passau reached and the water levels reached , the highest recorded historic flood level since 1501. The historic centre of Passau, where the Danube, Inn and Ilz converge, was flooded severely.

== Hydroelectric power plants ==
Currently, there are 24 hydroelectric power plants on the Inn. 17 of them are operated by Verbund AG. The power plants are listed beginning at the headwaters:

<text>The Salzach (Austrian: [ˈsaltsax]; ) is a river in Austria and Germany. It is in length and is a right tributary of the Inn, which eventually joins the Danube. Its drainage basin of comprises large parts of the Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps. 83% of its drainage basin () lies in Austria, the remainder in Germany (Bavaria). Its largest tributaries are Lammer, Berchtesgadener Ache, Saalach, Sur and Götzinger Achen.

==Etymology==

The river&#x27;s name is derived from the German word &quot;&quot; &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;Aach&quot;. Until the 19th century, shipping of salt down the &quot;Salzach&quot; was an important part of the local economy. The shipping ended when the parallel Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line replaced the old transport system.

==Course==
The Salzach is the main river in the Austrian state of Salzburg. The source is located on the edge of the Kitzbühel Alps near Krimml in the western Pinzgau region. Its headstreams drain several alpine pastures at around (metres above the Adriatic), between Krimml and the Tyrolean state border, north of the Gerlos Pass on the slopes of the Salzachgeier () and the nearby Schwebenkopf peak ).

From here, it runs eastwards through a large valley via Bruck south of Lake Zell to Schwarzach im Pongau. It then turns northwards and passes Sankt Johann im Pongau. North of here, the Salzach forms the narrow Salzachöfen Gorge between the Berchtesgaden Alps and the Tennen Mountains and before flowing to Hallein and the city of Salzburg. 

From the junction with its Saalach tributary in the northern Salzburg basin, the Salzach forms the border between Bavaria, Germany and the Austrian states of Salzburg and Upper Austria for almost . Cities on the banks in this lower section include Laufen and its sister town Oberndorf bei Salzburg, Tittmoning, and Burghausen. All these towns have border crossings.
The river finally empties into the Inn in Haiming between Burghausen and Braunau.

== Tributaries ==
Upper and lower reaches: , and from the Kitzbühel Alps, Krimmler Ache, , , , , , , from the High Tauern, Pinzga from Lake Zell, Fuscher Ache, from the High Tauern, from the Salzburg Slate Alps, , , from the High Tauern, from the , and from the Hochkönig.

Lower reaches: Lammer from the east, (in the ) from the Berchtesgaden Alps, and Almbach from the , both from the Osterhorn Group, Königsseer Ache from the Königssee, , Fischach from the lake Wallersee, Klausbach, Saalach the largest tributaries, Sur and Götzinger Achen on the Bavarian side, Oichten near Oberndorf and Moosach in the Salzburg-Upper Austrian border region.

== Hydroelectric power plants ==
Currently, there are 12 hydroelectric power plants on the Salzach. The power plants are listed beginning at the headwaters:

<doc id="192648" wikidata="Q717996" url="?curid=192648" title="Cain and Abel">
<text>In the biblical Book of Genesis, Cain and Abel are the first two sons of Adam and Eve. Cain, the firstborn, was a farmer, and his brother Abel was a shepherd. The brothers made sacrifices, each from his own fields, to God. God had regard for Abel&#x27;s offering, but had no regard for Cain&#x27;s. Cain killed Abel and God cursed Cain, sentencing him to a life of transience. Cain then dwelt in the land of Nod (), where he built a city and fathered the line of descendants beginning with Enoch.

In the Qur&#x27;an, Cain and Abel are known as Qābīl () and Hābīl (), respectively. The events of the story in the Qur&#x27;an are virtually the same as the Hebrew Bible narrative. Both brothers offered individual sacrifices to God; God accepted Abel&#x27;s sacrifice and rejected Cain&#x27;s; out of jealousy, Cain slew Abel – the first case of murder committed on Earth. 

==Genesis narrative==
The story of Cain&#x27;s murder of Abel and its consequences is told in Genesis 4:1–18:

=== Translation notes ===
== Origins ==

=== Etymology ===

Cain and Abel are traditional English renderings of the Hebrew names. Cain (Hebrew, &quot;Kayin&quot;), derives from &quot;kinyan&quot;, or acquisition. Abel (Hebrew, &quot;Hevel&quot;) means empty, vain, or transitory.

=== Context of the story ===
The story has interpretations. Abel, the first murder victim, is sometimes seen as the first martyr, while Cain, the first murderer, is sometimes seen as an ancestor of evil. Some scholars suggest the pericope may have been based on a Sumerian story representing the conflict between nomadic shepherds and settled farmers. Modern scholars typically view the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, but when people first learned agriculture, replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer. It has also been seen as a depiction of nomadic conflict, the struggle for land and resources (and divine favour) between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers.

The academic theologian Joseph Blenkinsopp holds that Cain and Abel are symbolic rather than real. Like almost all of the persons, places and stories in the primeval history (the first eleven chapters of Genesis), they are mentioned nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible, a fact that for some scholars suggests that the history is a late composition attached to Genesis to serve as an introduction. The date is also disputed: the history may be as late as the Hellenistic period (first decades of the 4th century BCE) or as early as the 9th-8th centuries BCE, but the high level of Babylonian myth behind its stories has led others to date it to the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE). A prominent Mesopotamian parallel to Cain and Abel is &quot;Enlil Chooses the Farmer-God&quot;, in which the shepherd-god Emesh and the farmer-god Enten bring their dispute over which of them is better to the chief god Enlil, who rules in favor of Enten (the farmer).

== Christian interpretation ==


The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in Hebrews 11:4, makes a brief reference to the Cain and Abel story:

==Islamic interpretation==

The story of Cain and Abel appears in the Quran 5:27–31:

The story of Cain and Abel has been used as a deterrent from murder in Islamic tradition. Abdullah ibn Mas&#x27;ud reported that Muhammad said in a &quot;hadith&quot;:

Muslim scholars were divided on the motive for Cain&#x27;s murder of Abel, and why the brothers were obliged to offer sacrifices to God. Some scholars believed that Cain&#x27;s motives were jealousy and lust. Both Cain and Abel desired to marry their sister, Adam&#x27;s beautiful daughter, Aclima (Arabic: ). Seeking to end the dispute, Adam suggested that each present an offering to God. The one whose offering God accepted would marry Aclima. Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a bunch of grass and some worthless seeds. God accepted Abel&#x27;s offering and rejected Cain&#x27;s—an indication that Abel was more righteous than Cain, and thus worthier of Aclima. As a result, it was decided that Abel would marry Aclima. Cain would marry her less beautiful sister. Blinded by anger and lust for Aclima, Cain sought to get revenge on Abel and escape with Aclima.

According to another tradition, the devil appeared to Cain and instructed him how to exact revenge on Abel. &quot;Hit Abel&#x27;s head with a stone and kill him,&quot; whispered the devil to Cain. After the murder, the devil hurried to Eve shouting: &quot;Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!&quot; Eve did not know what murder was or how death felt. She asked, bewildered and horrified, &quot;Woe to you! What is murder?&quot; &quot;He [Abel] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [That is what murder and death are],&quot; answered the Devil. Eve burst into tears and started to wail madly. She ran to Adam and tried to tell him what happened. However, she could not speak because she could not stop wailing. Since then, women wail broken-heartedly when a loved one dies. A different tradition narrates that while Cain was quarreling with Abel, the devil killed an animal with a stone in Cain&#x27;s sight to show him how to murder Abel.

After burying Abel and escaping from his family, Cain married and had children. They died in Noah&#x27;s flood among tyrants and unbelievers.

Some Muslim scholars puzzled over the mention of offerings in the narrative of Cain and Abel. Offerings and sacrifices were ordained only after the revelation of to Moses in Islam. This suggested to some scholars, such as Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Musayyib, that the sons of Adam, as mentioned in the Quran, are actually two Israelites, not Cain and Abel.

== Gnostic interpretation ==
In the Apocryphon of John, a work used in Gnosticism, Cain and Abel are Archons, being the offspring of the lesser god or Demiurge called Yaldabaoth, placed over the elements of fire, wind, water and earth. In this narrative their true names are Yahweh and Elohim, but they are given their earthly names as a form of deception.

== Legacy and symbolism ==

Allusions to Cain and Abel as an archetype of fratricide appear in numerous references and retellings, through medieval art and Shakespearean works up to present day fiction.

The serpent seed explanation for Cain being capable of murder is that he may have been the offspring of a fallen angel or Satan himself, rather than being from Adam.

A treatise on Christian Hermeticism, &quot;Meditations on the Tarot: A Journey into Christian Hermeticism&quot;, describes the biblical account of Cain and Abel as a myth, in that it expresses, in a form narrated for a particular case, an &quot;eternal&quot; idea. It argues that brothers can become mortal enemies through the very fact that they worship the same God in the same way. According to the author, the source of religious wars is revealed. It is not the difference in dogma or ritual which is the cause, but the &quot;pretention to equality&quot; or &quot;the negation of hierarchy.&quot;

There were other, minor traditions concerning Cain and Abel, of both older and newer date. The apocryphal &quot;Life of Adam and Eve&quot; tells of Eve having a dream in which Cain drank his brother&#x27;s blood. In an attempt to prevent the prophecy from happening the two young men are separated and given different jobs.

=== Cultural references ===

Like other prominent biblical figures, Cain and Abel appear in many works of art, including works by Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and William Blake.

Multiple plays allude to the story. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the characters King Claudius and King Hamlet are parallels of Cain and Abel. Lord Byron also rewrote and dramatized the story in his own play &quot;Cain&quot; (1821), viewing Cain as symbolic of a sanguine temperament, provoked by Abel&#x27;s hypocrisy and sanctimony. The 2008 Danish stage play discusses and reenacts various Biblical stories, including Abel&#x27;s murder by Cain.

Many novels feature the characters, or are closely based on them. Miguel de Unamuno&#x27;s 1917 novel &quot;Abel Sánchez: A Story of a Passion&quot; is a re-telling of the Cain and Abel story. John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;East of Eden&quot; (also a 1955 film) refers in its title to Cain&#x27;s exile and contains discussions of the Cain and Abel story which then play out in the plot. James Baldwin&#x27;s 1957 short story, &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Blues&quot;, has been seen as alluding to the Cain and Abel story. Author Daniel Quinn, first in his novel &quot;Ishmael&quot; (1992) and later in &quot;The Story of B&quot; (1996), proposes that the story of Cain and Abel is an account of early Semitic herdsmen observing the beginnings of what he calls totalitarian agriculture, with Cain representing the first &#x27;modern&#x27; agriculturists and Abel the pastoralists. José Saramago&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;Cain (novel)&quot; is a ironical re-telling of Cain&#x27;s history.

They have also featured in television series and, allegorically, in film. In &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978), Bobby and J.R. Ewing have been described as variations of Cain and Abel. More direct references include the appearance of Cain and Abel as characters in DC Comics since the 1950s. In 1989, Neil Gaiman made the two recurring characters in his graphic novel series &quot;The Sandman&quot;. In Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s allegorical film &quot;Mother!&quot; (2017), the characters &quot;oldest son&quot; and &quot;younger brother&quot; represent Cain and Abel.

The Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Adam Raised a Cain&quot; (1978) invokes the symbolism of Cain. It is also the title of a season 2 episode of .

American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold has a song called &quot;Chapter Four&quot; (2003) which is based on the story of Cain and Abel. American heavy metal band Danzig has a song named Twist of Cain which lyrically is inspired by the story of Cain and Abel.

<doc id="192649" wikidata="Q1859616" url="?curid=192649" title="Peerage of Ireland">
<text>The Peerage of Ireland consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland, or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It was one of the five divisions of Peerages in the United Kingdom. The creation of such titles came to an end in the 19th century. The ranks of the Irish peerage were duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. As of 2016, there were claimants to 135 titles in the Peerage of Ireland, despite the fact that this &quot;peerage&quot; is not recognised by the Irish state, which is a Republic. These titles included two dukedoms, ten marquessates, 43 earldoms, 28 viscountcies, and 52 baronies. They have no official recognition in Ireland, with Article 40.2 of the Constitution of Ireland forbidding the state conferring titles of nobility and stating that an Irish citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Irish government.

In the following table, each peer is listed only by his highest Irish title, showing higher or equal titles in the other peerages. Those peers who are known by a higher title in one of the other peerages are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.

==History==

A modest number of titles in the peerage of Ireland date from the Middle Ages. Before 1801, Irish peers had the right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, on the abolition of which by the Union effective in 1801 by an Act of 1800 they elected a small proportion – twenty-eight &quot;Irish representative peers&quot; – of their number (and elected replacements as they died) to the House of Lords at Westminster.

Both before and after the Union, Irish peerages were often used as a way of creating peerages which did not grant a seat in the House of Lords of England (before 1707) or Great Britain (after 1707) and so allowed the grantee (such as Clive of India) to sit in the House of Commons in London. As a consequence, many late-made Irish peers had little or no connection to Ireland, and indeed the names of some Irish peerages refer to places in Great Britain (for example, the Earldom of Mexborough refers to a place in England and the Earldom of Ranfurly refers to a village in Scotland).

Irish peerages continued to be created for almost a century after the union, although the treaty of union placed restrictions on their numbers: three needed to become extinct before a new peerage could be granted, until there were only one hundred Irish peers (exclusive of those who held any peerage of Great Britain subsisting at the time of the union, or of the United Kingdom created since the union). There was a spate of creations of Irish peerages from 1797 onward, mostly peerages of higher ranks for existing Irish peers, as part of the negotiation of the Act of Union; this ended in the first week of January 1801, but the restrictions of the Act were not applied to the last few peers. In the following decades, Irish peerages were created at least as often as the Act permitted until at least 1856. But the pace then slowed, with only four more being created in the rest of the 19th century, and none in the 20th and 21st centuries.

The last two grants of Irish peerages were the promotion of the Marquess of Abercorn (a peerage of Great Britain) to be Duke of Abercorn in the Irish Peerage when he became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1868 and the granting of the Curzon of Kedleston barony to George Curzon when he became Viceroy of India in 1898. Peers of Ireland have precedence below peers of England, Scotland, and Great Britain of the same rank, and above peers of the United Kingdom of the same rank; but Irish peers created after 1801 yield to United Kingdom peers of earlier creation. Accordingly, the Duke of Abercorn (the junior duke in the Peerage of Ireland) ranks between the Duke of Sutherland and the Duke of Westminster (both dukes in the Peerage of the United Kingdom).

When one of the Irish representative peers died, the Irish Peerage met to elect his replacement; but the office required to arrange this were abolished as part of the creation of the Irish Free State. The existing representative peers kept their seats in the House of Lords, but they have not been replaced. Since the death of Francis Needham, 4th Earl of Kilmorey in 1961, none remains. The right of the Irish Peerage to elect representatives was abolished by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1971.

Titles in the Peerage of the United Kingdom have also referred to places in Ireland, for example Baron Arklow (created 1801 and 1881) or Baron Killarney (created 1892 and 1920). Since partition, only places in Northern Ireland have been used, although the 1880 title &quot;Baron Mount Temple, of Mount Temple in the County of Sligo&quot;, was recreated in 1932 as &quot;Baron Mount Temple, of Lee in the County of Southampton&quot;.

==Ranks==

In the following table of the Peerage of Ireland as it currently stands, each peer&#x27;s highest titles in each of the other peerages (if any) are also listed.

Irish peers possessed of titles in any of the other peerages (except Scotland, which only got the right to an automatic seat in 1963, with the Peerage Act 1963) had automatic seats in the House of Lords until 1999.

The Earl of Darnley inherited the Baron Clifton in the Peerage of England in 1722–1900 and 1937–1999 as the barony is in writ.

==Barons in the Peerage of Ireland==

In Ireland, &quot;barony&quot; may also refer to a semi-obsolete political subdivision of a county. There is no connection between such a barony and the noble title of baron.


==Extinct peerages==

Two Irish earldoms have become extinct since the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, both in 2011:
*Earl of Egmont (1733), Viscount Perceval (1722), Baron Perceval (1715), Baron Lovel and Holland (GB 1762), Baron Arden (1770), Baron Arden (UK 1802)
*Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl (1822), Viscount Mount-Earl (1816), Viscount Adare (1822), Baron Adare (1800), Baron Kenry (UK 1866)

<doc id="192669" wikidata="Q914752" url="?curid=192669" title="Lord-lieutenant">
<text>A lord-lieutenant ( ) is the British monarch&#x27;s personal representative in each lieutenancy area of the United Kingdom. Historically, each lieutenant was responsible for organising the county&#x27;s militia. In 1871, the lieutenant&#x27;s responsibility over the local militia was removed. However, it was not until 1921 that they formally lost the right to call upon able-bodied men to fight when needed.

Lord-lieutenant is now an honorary titular position usually awarded to a retired notable person in the county, and despite the name, may be either male or female.

==Origins==
===England and Wales===
Lieutenants were first appointed to a number of English counties by King Henry VIII in the 1540s, when the military functions of the sheriffs were handed over to them. Each lieutenant raised and was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of his county, and afterwards of the yeomanry and volunteers. He was commander of these forces, whose officers he appointed. These commissions were originally of temporary duration, and only when the situation required the local militia to be specially supervised and well prepared, often when invasion by Scotland or France might be expected.

Lieutenancies soon became more organised, probably in the reign of Henry&#x27;s successor King Edward VI, their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550. However, it was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties and counties corporate and became in effect permanent. Although some counties were left without lieutenants during the 1590s, following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the office continued to exist, and was retained by King James I even after the end of the Anglo-Spanish War.

The office of lieutenant was abolished under the Commonwealth, but was re-established following the Restoration under the City of London Militia Act 1662, which declared that:

Although not explicitly stated, from that date lieutenants were appointed to &quot;counties at large&quot;, with their jurisdiction including the counties corporate within the parent county. For example, lieutenants of Devon in the 17th and 18th centuries appointed deputy lieutenants to the City of Exeter, and were sometimes described as the &quot;Lieutenant of Devon and Exeter&quot;. The one exception was Haverfordwest, to which a lieutenant continued to be appointed until 1974. The origin of this anomaly may have lain in the former palatine status of Pembrokeshire.

The official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majesty&#x27;s &quot;Lieutenant for the county of x&quot;, but, as almost all office-holders were peers of the realm, they were referred to as &quot;Lord-Lieutenant&quot;.

The City of London was uniquely given a commission of lieutenancy, and was exempt from the authority of the lieutenant of Middlesex. The Constable of the Tower of London and the Warden of the Cinque Ports were &quot;ex officio&quot; lieutenants for the Tower Hamlets and the Cinque Ports respectively, which were treated as counties in legislation regarding lieutenancy and militia affairs.

===Ireland===
In the counties of Ireland, the officer in charge of the county militia was styled &quot;Lieutenant&quot; until James II and &quot;Governor&quot; thereafter. There could be up to three Governors in one county. Responsibility for recommending County magistrates lay with the Custos Rotulorum. The Custos Rotulorum (Ireland) Act 1831 cancelled the commissions of the Governors, transferred the militia and county magistrate functions to the (re)established office of Lieutenant (appointed by letters patent and styled &quot;Lord Lieutenant&quot;), and empowered the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to appoint deputy lieutenants. 

In the Republic of Ireland no Lord Lieutenants have been appointed since the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, and all relevant statutes have been repealed.

===Northern Ireland===
In 1921, with the establishment of Northern Ireland, lord lieutenants continued to be appointed through the Governor of Northern Ireland to the six counties and the two county boroughs of Derry and Belfast. Whereas in 1973 the counties and county boroughs were abolished as local government units, lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the King to &quot;counties and county boroughs ... as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973&quot;.

===Scotland===

Although Colin, Earl of Balcarres was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Fife in 1688, and lieutenants were appointed to a few counties from about 1715, it was not until 1794 that permanent lieutenancies were established by royal warrant. By the Militia Act 1797, the lieutenants appointed &quot;for the Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places&quot; were given powers to raise and command county militia units.

The Lord Provosts of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Dundee are, by virtue of office, also the lord-lieutenants of their respective city.

While in their lieutenancies, lord-lieutenants are among the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly the banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland, or &quot;The Lion Rampant&quot; as it is more commonly known.

==19th century==
The Militia Act 1802 (42 Geo. 3. c. 90) provided for the appointment of lieutenants to &quot;Lieutenants for the Counties, Ridings, and Places&quot; in England and Wales, and gave them command of the county militia. In the case of towns or cities which were counties of themselves, the &quot;chief magistrate&quot; (meaning the mayor, chief bailiff or other head of the corporation) had the authority to appoint deputy lieutenants in the absence of an appointment of a lieutenant by the crown. 
The Regulation of the Forces Act 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. 86) removed the lieutenant as head of the county militia, as the jurisdiction, duties and command exercised by the lieutenant were revested in the crown, but the power of recommending for first appointments was reserved to the lieutenant.

The Militia Act 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. 49) revested the jurisdiction of the lieutenants in the crown.

The lieutenancies were reestablished on a new basis by section 29 of the Militia Act 1882 which stated that &quot;Her Majesty shall from time to time appoint Lieutenants for the several counties in the United Kingdom&quot;. Counties for lieutenancy purposes were also redefined as &quot;a county at large, with the exception that each riding of the county of York shall be a separate county&quot;. The text of the letters patent appointing lieutenants under the act stated they were to be:

This was a formal recognition of the situation that had existed since 1662 that the lieutenancies for the majority of counties corporate in England were held jointly with their associated county—for example a lieutenant was now appointed for &quot;the County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Gloucester, and the City and County of City of Bristol&quot;.

Haverfordwest was permitted to retain a lieutenant while the Tower Hamlets and Cinque Ports were to continue to be regarded as counties for lieutenancy purposes.

From 1889 lieutenancy counties in England and Wales were to correspond to groupings of administrative counties and county boroughs established by the Local Government Act 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 41). The creation of a new County of London absorbed the former Tower Hamlets lieutenancy. The act also extinguished the lieutenancy of the Cinque Ports.

Section 69 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 37) realigned the lieutenancy counties with the new administrative counties created by the act. The one exception was County Tipperary, which although administered by two county councils, was to remain united for lieutenancy. In contrast to legislation in England and Wales, each county borough was to have its own lieutenant, and those counties corporate not made county boroughs were abolished. The effect of this was to create a lieutenant for the county boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and to abolish those for the city of Kilkenny, borough of Drogheda and town of Galway.

The office of lieutenant was honorary and held during the royal pleasure, but often for life. Appointment to the office is by letters patent under the great seal. Usually, though not necessarily, the person appointed lieutenant was also appointed custos rotulorum or keeper of the rolls. Appointments to the county&#x27;s bench of magistrates were usually made on the recommendation of the lieutenant.

==20th century==
The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7. c. 9) established county territorial force associations, of which the lieutenant was to be head, styled president of the county association. It restated the combination of counties and counties corporate as lieutenancy counties.

In 1921, with the establishment of Northern Ireland, lieutenants continued to be appointed through the Governor of Northern Ireland to the six counties and two county boroughs. The creation of the Irish Free State in the following year saw the remaining county lieutenancies in Ireland abolished. In 1973 the counties and county boroughs were abolished as local government units in Northern Ireland, and lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the sovereign to &quot;counties and county boroughs... as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973&quot;. In 1975 the term lord-lieutenant officially replaced that of lieutenant.

Local government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lieutenants to Greater London and Huntingdon and Peterborough, and the abolition of those of the counties of London, Middlesex and Huntingdon.

A more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and Wales (outside Greater London) created a new structure of metropolitan, non-metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974. Section 218 of the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70) that established the new system stated: &quot;Her Majesty shall appoint a lord-lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London...&quot; The act appears to be the first statutory use of the term &quot;lord-lieutenant&quot; for lieutenants to counties.

Existing lord lieutenants were assigned to one of the corresponding new counties wherever possible. Where this could not be done, the existing office-holder became a lieutenant of a county, junior to the lord-lieutenant. For example, the Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Powys, with those of Breconshire and Radnorshire each being designated as simply &quot;Lieutenant of Powys&quot;. This measure was temporary, and no lieutenants have been appointed in this way since 1974, although the power still exists.

In 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in Scotland. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (c. 65) replaced the counties with regions, and each region was to have one or more lord-lieutenants appointed. The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts.

==Present day==
In 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation, and since that date Lord-Lieutenants have been appointed to &quot;lieutenancy areas&quot;, in most places roughly equivalent to the historic Scottish counties.

Partial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so-called &quot;ceremonial counties&quot; to which Lord-Lieutenants are now appointed. The Lieutenancies Act 1997 (c. 23) is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used. Ceremonial counties may comprise combinations of county council areas and unitary authority areas, or even parts of them.

Since the local government re-organisation of 1996 in Wales, Lord-Lieutenants are now appointed to &quot;preserved counties&quot;, i.e. the counties used for administrative purposes from 1974 to 1996.

The City of London was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882. It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a Lord-Lieutenant, headed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London.

===Duties===
Lord-Lieutenants are the monarch&#x27;s representatives in their respective lieutenancies. It is their foremost duty to uphold the dignity of the Crown, and in so doing they seek to promote a spirit of co-operation and good atmosphere through the time they give to voluntary and benevolent organisations and through the interest they take in the business and social life of their counties.
The modern responsibilities of Lord-Lieutenants include:
* Arranging visits of members of the royal family and escorting royal visitors;
* Presenting medals and awards on behalf of the sovereign, and advising on honours nominations;
* Participating in civic, voluntary and social activities within the lieutenancy;
* Acting as liaison with local units of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army, Royal Air Force and their associated Cadet Forces;
* Leading the local magistracy as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Justices of the Peace; and
* Chairing the local Advisory Committee for the Appointment of the General Commissioners of Income Tax, a tribunal which hears appeals against decisions made by the HM Revenue and Customs on a variety of different tax-related matters.

As the Sovereign&#x27;s representative in each county, a Lord-Lieutenant remains non-political and may not hold office in any political party. They are appointed for life, although the customary age of retirement is 75 and the Sovereign may remove them.

===Deputies===
Each Lord-Lieutenant is supported by a Vice-Lieutenant and deputy lieutenants that he or she appoints. The Vice-Lieutenant takes over when the Lord-Lieutenant is abroad, ill, or otherwise incapacitated. The Lord-Lieutenant appoints between thirty and forty deputy lieutenants depending on the county&#x27;s population.

===Remuneration===
They are unpaid, but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help, mileage allowance and a driver. Lord-Lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform, worn when receiving members of the Royal Family and on other formal occasions.

===Uniform===

Since at least the 18th century, a military-style uniform has been worn by lord-lieutenants (appropriate to the military origins of the post). Since 1831 this has been analogous to the uniform worn by a general staff officer, but with silver lace in place of the gold worn by regular officers. Over time, the design of the uniform changed in line with changes made to army uniform.

At present, it is a dark blue uniform in the style of a General Officer&#x27;s Army No. 1 dress (but with buttons, epaulettes, sash, etc. in silver rather than gold). A cap is worn, as well as a sword with a steel scabbard. The badge used on the uniform varies depending on where the lieutenant&#x27;s county is situated – a rose is worn in England, shamrocks in Northern Ireland, a thistle in Scotland and Prince-of-Wales feathers in Wales. On the whole, the lord-lieutenant&#x27;s insignia resemble a Lieutenant-General of the British Army.

The uniform for a vice lord-lieutenant and for deputy lieutenants is of a similar style, but with features to distinguish it from that of a lord-lieutenant – on shoulder boards, no crown above the national symbol (rose, shamrocks, or thistle); blue cord instead of silver on the red collar patches (deputy lieutenants have a simple grey stripe); and only a single row of gold braid around the peak of the cap (deputy lieutenants have no oak leaf but simple gold tape). In addition, deputy lieutenants wear narrower shoulder boards than their superiors, and the red cap band is horizontally divided by a small grey stripe. The vice lord-lieutenant&#x27;s dress resembles that of a former Brigadier-General of the British Army, while a deputy lieutenant&#x27;s dress resembles that of a field officer.

The uniform is optional for female lord-lieutenants, vice lord-lieutenants, and deputy lieutenants. If not in uniform, female appointees wear a Badge of Office featuring their national symbol (rose, shamrocks, or thistle) on a bow of white and magenta – the Lieutenancy colours.

====Badge====

In 1975 a badge was provided for female lord-lieutenants to wear as an optional alternative to the uniform. It consists of an enamel version of the uniform cap badge topped by a jewelled crown, suspended from a ribbon of the same colour as the uniform sash.

==Lord Lieutenant of Ireland==
The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the head of the British administration in Ireland until the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922.

== Forms of address for lord-lieutenants ==

*Written: &#x27;(Title and name), His Majesty&#x27;s Lord-Lieutenant&#x27;
*Salutation: &#x27;Dear Lord-Lieutenant&#x27;
*In a speech: &#x27;My Lord-Lieutenant&#x27;
*In conversation: &#x27;(Title and name)&#x27; or &#x27;Lord-Lieutenant&#x27;.
*Plural: &#x27;Lord-lieutenants&#x27;, although the form of &#x27;Lords-Lieutenant&#x27; frequently appears.

==Colonial equivalents==
In the English colonies, and subsequently the British Empire, the duties of a Lord-Lieutenant were generally performed by the Commander-in-Chief or the Governor. Both offices may have been occupied by the same person.

By way of an example, this is still the case in Britain&#x27;s second, and oldest remaining, colony, Bermuda, where the Royal Navy&#x27;s headquarters, main base, and dockyard for the North America and West Indies Station was established following independence of the United States of America. The colony had raised militia and volunteer forces since official settlement in 1612 (with a troop-of-horse added later), and a small force of regular infantry from 1701 to 1783. Bermuda became an Imperial fortress (along with Halifax in Nova Scotia, Gibraltar, and Malta), a large regular army garrison was built up after 1794, and the reserve forces faded away following the conclusion of the American War of 1812 as the local government lost interest in paying for their upkeep. From this point until the 1960s, governors were almost exclusively senior British Army officers (particularly from the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers) who were also military Commanders-in-Chief (and initially also Vice-Admirals) of the regular military forces stationed in the colony and not simply the reserves. Attempts to rekindle the militia without a Militia Act or funds from the colonial government were made throughout the century under the authorisation of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, but none proved lasting. The colonial government was finally compelled to raise militia and volunteer forces (the Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps) by Act in the 1890s (the Bermuda Cadet Corps, Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, and Bermuda Militia Infantry were added at later dates), and these fell under the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, as well as under operational control of his junior, the brigadier in charge of the Bermuda Command (or Bermuda Garrison), which included the regular as well as the part-time military (as opposed to naval) forces in the colony. Although the Royal Naval and the regular army establishments have been withdrawn from Bermuda, the Governor of Bermuda remains the Commander-in-Chief (though most recent office holders have not been career army officers) of the Royal Bermuda Regiment (a 1965 amalgam of the BMA and BVRC, which had both been reorganised in line with the Territorial Army after the First World War).

==Approximate equivalents in other countries==
In France and Italy, the role of Prefect ( in French, &quot;prefetto&quot; in Italian) is different from that of lord-lieutenant, as the regional and departmental prefects of France are responsible for delivering as well as controlling functions of public services. Similarly to a lord-lieutenant, in Portugal, a representative of the Republic (&quot;representante da República&quot; in Portuguese) is the personal representative of the Head of State in each of the two autonomous regions of the country, having a limited political role, besides the ceremonial one. In Sweden (as &quot;landshövding&quot;) and Norway (as &quot;fylkesmann&quot;), the regional governor is responsible for administrative control functions of services delivered and decisions made by local and county municipalities, as well as representing the king in the region. In the Netherlands, King&#x27;s commissioners (&quot;Commissaris van de Koning&quot; in Dutch) are appointed by the monarch, but unlike a lord-lieutenant, belong to a political party.
The Lord-lieutenant (UK) and Governor (Indian states) are ceremonial representatives appointed by central authorities. They engage in community initiatives and act as intermediaries between higher authorities and local/state governments.

<doc id="192687" wikidata="Q28471" url="?curid=192687" title="El Escorial">
<text>El Escorial, or the Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial (), or  (), is a historical residence of the king of Spain located in the town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, up the valley ( road distance) from the town of El Escorial and about northwest of the Spanish capital Madrid. Built between 1563 and 1584 by order of King Philip II (who reigned 1556–1598), El Escorial is the largest Renaissance building in the world. It is one of the Spanish royal sites and functions as a monastery, basilica, royal palace, pantheon, library, museum, university, school, and hospital.

El Escorial consists of two architectural complexes of great historical and cultural significance: the royal monastery itself and &quot;La Granjilla de La Fresneda&quot;, a royal hunting lodge and monastic retreat about away. These sites have a dual nature: during the 16th and 17th centuries, they were places in which the power of the Spanish monarchy &quot;and&quot; the ecclesiastical predominance of the Roman Catholic religion in Spain found a common architectural manifestation. El Escorial was both a Spanish royal palace and a monastery. Established with a community of Hieronymite monks, it has become a monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine. It also contained a boarding school, now the Real Colegio de Alfonso XII, still in operation.

Philip II engaged the Spanish architect Juan Bautista de Toledo to be his collaborator in the building of the complex at El Escorial. Toledo had spent the greater part of his career in Rome, where he had worked on St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and in Naples serving the king&#x27;s viceroy, whose recommendation brought him to the king&#x27;s attention. Philip appointed him architect-royal in 1559, and, together, they designed El Escorial as a monument to Spain&#x27;s role as a center of the Christian world.

On 2 November 1984, UNESCO declared The Royal Seat of San Lorenzo of El Escorial a World Heritage Site. It is a popular tourist attraction, often visited by day-trippers from Madrid—more than 500,000 visitors come to El Escorial every year.

==Conception and design==
El Escorial is situated at the foot of Mount Abantos in the Sierra de Guadarrama. This austere location, hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace, was chosen by King Philip II of Spain, and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 Spanish victory at the Battle of St. Quentin in Picardy against King Henry II of France. King Phillip II&#x27;s goal was to have a princely mansion in a wooded countryside, while also being architecturally different from most buildings that were being commissioned at the time. Phillip&#x27;s decision to do this was inspired by his journeys in Europe exploring architecture, including the Ospedale Maggiore that inspired ideas for the design of the Escorial. One of Phillip II&#x27;s personal aspirations was to be a monk and a monarch, and this would come to influence the design. The result of all these ideas was an imposing three story tall, orthogonal, stronghold-like structure with a dual function as both a royal residence and monastery. Philip also intended the complex to serve as a necropolis for the interment of the remains of his parents, Charles I and Isabella of Portugal, himself, and his descendants. In addition, Philip envisioned El Escorial as a center for studies in aid of the Counter-Reformation cause. The Escorial would come to be so iconic that the design of the building became a new architectural style of Spanish renaissance architecture, known as the Herrerian style.

The building&#x27;s cornerstone was laid on 23 April 1563. The design and construction were overseen by Juan Bautista de Toledo, who did not live to see the completion of the project. With Toledo&#x27;s death in 1567, direction passed to his apprentice, Juan de Herrera, under whom the building was completed in 1584, in slightly less than 21 years. To this day, &quot;la obra de El Escorial&quot; (&quot;the work of El Escorial&quot;) is a proverbial expression for a thing that takes a long time to finish (comparable English proverb: &quot;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day&quot;).

Since then, El Escorial has been the burial site for most of the Spanish kings of the last five centuries, Bourbons as well as Habsburgs. The Royal Pantheon contains the tombs of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (who ruled Spain as King Charles I), Philip II, Philip III, Philip IV, Charles II, Louis I, Charles III, Charles IV, Ferdinand VII, Isabella II, Alfonso XII, and Alfonso XIII. Two Bourbon kings, Philip V (who reigned from 1700 to 1724 and again from 1724 to 1746) and Ferdinand VI (1746–1759), as well as King Amadeus (1870–1873), are not buried in the monastery.

The floor plan of the building is in the form of a gridiron. The traditional belief is that this design was chosen in honor of Saint Lawrence, who, in the third century AD, was martyred by being roasted to death on a grill. St. Lawrence&#x27;s feast day is 10 August, the same date as the 1557 Battle of St. Quentin.

However, the origin of the building&#x27;s layout is quite controversial. The grill-like shape, which did not fully emerge until Juan de Herrera eliminated from the original conception the six interior towers of the façade, was not unique to El Escorial. Other buildings had been constructed with churches or chapels fronting on interior courtyards: King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, dating from 1441, is one such example; the old Ospedale Maggiore, Milan&#x27;s first hospital, begun in 1456 by Antonio Filarete, is another grid-like building with interior courtyards. In fact, palaces of this approximate design were commonplace in the Byzantine and Arab world. Strikingly similar to El Escorial is the layout of the Alcázar of Seville and the design of the Alhambra at Granada, where, as at El Escorial, two courtyards in succession separate the main portal of the complex from a fully enclosed place of worship.The most persuasive theory for the origin of the floor plan is that it is based on descriptions of the Temple of Solomon by the Judeo-Roman historian Flavius Josephus: a portico followed by a courtyard open to the sky, followed by a second portico and a second courtyard, all flanked by arcades and enclosed passageways, leading to the &quot;holy of holies&quot;. Statues of David and Solomon on either side of the entrance to the basilica of El Escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design. A more personal connection can be drawn between the David-warrior figure, representing Charles V, and his son, the stolid and solomonically prudent Philip II. Echoing the same theme, a fresco in the center of El Escorial&#x27;s library, a reminder of Solomon&#x27;s legendary wisdom, affirms Philip&#x27;s preoccupation with the great Jewish king, his thoughtful and logical character, and his extraordinary, monumental temple.

The Temple of Solomon design, if indeed it was the basis for El Escorial, was extensively modified to accommodate the additional functions Philip II intended the building to serve. Besides being a monastery, El Escorial is also a pantheon, a basilica, a convent, a school, a library, and a royal palace. All these functional demands resulted in a doubling of the building&#x27;s size from the time of its original conception.

Built primarily from locally quarried gray granite, square and sparsely ornamented, El Escorial is austere, even forbidding, in its outward appearance, seemingly more like a fortress than a monastery or palace. It takes the form of a gigantic quadrangle, approximately , which encloses a series of intersecting passageways and courtyards. At each of the four corners is a square tower surmounted by a spire, and, near the center of the complex (and taller than the rest), rise the pointed belfries and round dome of the basilica. Philip&#x27;s instructions to Juan Bautista de Toledo were simple and clear, directing that the architects should produce &quot;simplicity in the construction, severity in the whole, nobility without arrogance, majesty without ostentation.&quot;

Aside from its explicit purposes, the complex is also an enormous storehouse of art. In it are displayed masterworks by Titian, Tintoretto, Benvenuto Cellini, El Greco, Velázquez, Rogier van der Weyden, Paolo Veronese, Bernini, Alonso Cano, José de Ribera, Claudio Coello, and others. Giambattista Castello designed the magnificent main staircase. The library contains thousands of priceless manuscripts: for example, the collection of the sultan Zidan Abu Maali, who ruled Morocco from 1603 to 1627, is housed here.

==Royal Monastery==
===Courtyard of the Kings===

The main entrance of the El Escorial is the west façade, which has three doors: the middle one leads to the Courtyard of the Kings (&quot;Patio de los Reyes&quot;) and the side ones lead to a school and to a monastery. Above the center door is a niche where the image of Saint Lawrence has been placed. The Courtyard of the Kings owes its name to the statues of the kings of Judah that adorn the façade of the basilica, located at the east end of the courtyard. Steps of red marble lead to the large, public chapel, past the narthex, which is one of the highlights of the basilica. The basilica has a floor in the shape of a Greek cross and an enormous dome, inspired by St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, above the crossing. The naves are covered over by barrel vaults decorated with frescoes by Luca Giordano. The main altarpiece is high and divided into compartments of different sizes where are found bronze sculptures, and canvases by Pellegrino Tibaldi, Federico Zuccari, and Leone Leoni. In the sacristy, paintings such as &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Coat&quot; by Velázquez, &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Titian, and &quot;The Adoration of the Sacred Host by Charles II&quot; by Claudio Coello are on exhibit.

Under the royal chapel of the Basilica is the Royal Pantheon crypt. This is the place of burial for the kings of Spain. It is an octagonal Baroque mausoleum made of marble where all of the Spanish monarchs since Charles I have been buried, with the exception of Philip V, Ferdinand VI, and Amadeus of Savoy. The remains of the Count of Barcelona, the father of King Juan Carlos I of Spain, also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that the Count never became king himself. The enclosure is presided over by an altar of veined marble, and the sarcophagi are bronze and marble. There is also the Pantheon of the Princes, where the bodies of the queens who did not have a crowned succession and the princes and princesses were laid to rest. This part was built in the nineteenth century.

Next to the basilica, to the south, is the Courtyard of the Evangelists. This is a gardened patio in whose center rises a magnificent pavilion, by Juan de Herrera, in which one can find sculptures of the Evangelists. Around the courtyard are the galleries of the main cloister, decorated with frescoes by Tibaldi and his workshop, in which scenes from the history of the Redemption are represented. In the East gallery, one finds the splendid main staircase with a fresco-decorated vaulted ceiling depicting &quot;The glory of the Spanish monarchy&quot;, painted by Luca Giordano in 1692.

The Palace of the Austrians (&quot;Palacio de los Austrias&quot;), also known as the House of the King (&quot;Casa del Rey&quot;), is found behind the presbytery of the basilica. The outbuildings of this palace, of Italian style, are distributed around the Courtyard of the Fountainheads (&quot;Patio de los Mascarones&quot;). Inside the House of the King are the &quot;Sala de las Batallas&quot; (Hall of Battles), which contains frescoes of the battles of San Quintín and Higueruela, among others. The next building contains the rooms of Philip II and of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia. Another outbuilding is that of &quot;Alcoba del Rey&quot;, housing the bed in which Philip II died.

===Basilica===

The basilica of San Lorenzo el Real, the central building in the El Escorial complex, was originally designed, like most of the late Gothic cathedrals of Western Europe, to take the form of a Latin cross. As such, it has a long nave on the east–west axis intersected by a shorter transept, about three-quarters of the way between the west entrance and the high altar. This plan was modified by Juan de Herrera to that of a Greek cross, a form with all four arms of equal length. Coincident with this shift in approach, the bell towers at the western end of the church were somewhat reduced in size and the small half-dome intended to stand over the altar was replaced with a full circular dome over the center of the church, where the four arms of the Greek cross meet.

Clearly Juan Bautista de Toledo&#x27;s experience with the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome influenced the design of El Escorial&#x27;s basilica. However, the Roman dome is supported by ranks of tapered Corinthian columns, with their extravagant capitals of acanthus leaves and their elaborately fluted shafts, while the dome at El Escorial, soaring nearly into the air, is supported by four heavy granite piers connected by simple Romanesque arches and decorated by simple Doric pilasters, plain, solid, and largely unprepossessing. It would not be a flight of fancy to interpret St. Peter&#x27;s as the quintessential expression of Baroque sensuality and the basilica at El Escorial as a statement of the stark rigidity and grim purposefulness of the Inquisition, the two sides of the Counter-Reformation.


The most richly decorated part of the church is the area surrounding the high altar. Behind the altar is a three-tiered &quot;reredos&quot;, or altar screen, made of red granite and jasper, nearly tall, adorned with gilded bronze statuary by Leone Leoni, and three sets of religious paintings commissioned by Philip II. To either side are gilded life-size bronzes of the kneeling family groups of Charles and Philip, also by Leoni, with help from his son Pompeo. In a shallow niche at the center of the lowest level is the tabernacle, a repository for the physical elements of the communion ceremony, a so-called &quot;House of the Sacrament&quot;, designed by Juan de Herrera in jasper and bronze. It was built between 1579 and 1586 by Jacopo da Trezzo.

To decorate the &quot;reredos&quot;, the King&#x27;s preferences had been Michelangelo or Titian, but both of these giants were already more than eighty years old and in frail health. Consequently, Philip consulted his foreign ambassadors for recommendations, and the result was a lengthy parade of the lesser European artists of that time, all swanning through the construction site at El Escorial seeking the King&#x27;s favor.

One chapel exhibits the famous &quot;Crucifix&quot; carved in white marble by Benvenuto Cellini. This statue of Christ is unusual because it was represented fully nude; although for modesty it wears one cloth covering the genitals.

===Palace of Philip II===
Situated next to the main altar of the Basilica, the residence of King Philip II consists of a series of austerely decorated rooms. It features a window from which the king could observe mass from his bed when incapacitated by the gout that afflicted him.

===Hall of Battles===
The gallery was originally called the King&#x27;s Gallery (&quot;Galería del Rey&quot;) but came to be known as the Hall of Battles (&quot;Sala de Batallas&quot;) for its fresco paintings depicting the most important Spanish military victories. These include a medieval victory over the Moors, as well as several of Philip&#x27;s campaigns against the French.

===Royal burial vaults===

====Pantheon of the Kings====

This chamber consists of twenty-six marble sepulchres containing the remains of the kings and queens regnant (the only queen regnant since Philip II being Isabella II) of the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, from Charles I to the present, except for Philip V and his son Ferdinand VI.

The sepulchres also contain the remains of royal consorts who were parents of monarchs. The only king consort is Francis of Asis de Bourbon, husband of Queen Isabella II and father of Alfonso XII. The most recent monarch interred in the pantheon is King Alfonso XIII, removed there from the Church of Santa Maria in Monserrato, Rome in 1980. The remains of Alfonso XIII&#x27;s wife, Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg were interred in the pantheon in 2011.The remains of Alfonso XIII&#x27;s third son Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, (d. 1993) and daughter-in-law Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (d. 2000); (the father and mother of King Juan Carlos I), lie at a prepared place called a &quot;pudridero&quot;, or decaying chamber, awaiting interment in the Pantheon of the Kings. With the interment of these remains, all the sepulchres in the pantheon will be filled. No decision has yet been announced as to the final resting place of now-abdicated Juan Carlos, Queen Sofía, Felipe VI, Queen Letizia, and any future monarchs and consorts.

There are two &quot;pudrideros&quot; at El Escorial, one for the Pantheon of the Kings and the other for the Pantheon of the Princes. These can only be visited by monks from the Monastery. In these rooms, the remains of the deceased are placed in a small leaden urn, which in turn will be placed in the marble sepulchres of the appropriate pantheon after the passage of fifty years, the estimated time necessary for the complete decomposition of the bodies.

The interment of the remains of Queen Victoria Eugenie and the Count and Countess of Barcelona in the Royal Pantheon will each constitute an exception to tradition. First, Victoria Eugenie, although the wife of a king, was never the mother of a king in the strict sense. Secondly, the Count of Barcelona never reigned as king, although he was head of the Spanish royal family between the renunciation of his father&#x27;s rights on 14 January 1941 and his renunciation of his own rights in favour of his son Juan Carlos I on 14 May 1977. Thirdly, the Countess of Barcelona was the mother of a king but not the wife of a king. However, some consider the Count of Barcelona to have been &quot;de jure&quot; king of Spain from 1941 to 1977, which in turn would make him, his mother, Queen Victoria Eugenie, and his wife, the Countess of Barcelona, eligible for interment in the Pantheon of Kings.

There has already been one exception to tradition: Elisabeth of Bourbon is for the moment the only queen in the pantheon who has not been mother to a king. That is because her only son, the presumed heir to the throne, died after her but before he could become king. But she was the great-grandmother of Philip V (by her daughter Maria Theresa of Spain) and she is an ancestor of the king of Spain.

The walls of polished Toledo marble are ornamented in gold-plated bronze. All of the wood used in El Escorial comes from the ancient forests of Sagua La Grande, on the so-called Golden Coast of Cuba.

====Pantheon of the Princes====

The pantheon&#x27;s name in Spanish is &quot;Panteón de Infantes&quot;. Completed in 1888, this group of nine burial chapels is the final resting place of princes, princesses, and consorts other than the parents of monarchs. With floors and ceiling of white marble, the tomb of Prince John of Austria is especially notable.

Among the more recent interments is that of Infante Alfonso in October 1992. The younger brother of King Juan Carlos I, he was buried originally in Portugal, after being killed in a still-mysterious 1956 shooting at the family home in Estoril, aged 14.

In 1994, King Juan Carlos I signed a decree raising his cousin and close personal friend Carlos, Duke of Calabria to the status of a Spanish &quot;infante&quot;, making him eligible for interment in the Pantheon of the Princes. Upon his death in October 2015, his funeral was held at El Escorial and his body placed in the &quot;pudridero&quot;, awaiting future interment in the pantheon.

Thirty-seven of the sixty available niches are filled.

===Art gallery===
Contains works of the German, Flemish, Venetian, Lombard, Ligurian, Italian and Spanish schools from the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. The painting gallery was closed in 2015, and subject to a major revitalisation from 2024.

===Architectural museum===
Its eleven rooms showcase the tools, cranes and other materials used in the construction of the edifice, as well as reproductions of blueprints and documents related to the project. The architecture gallery, which had been dormant, was subject to a major revitalisation from 2024.

===Gardens of the Friars===
Constructed at the order of Philip II, a great lover of nature, these constitute an ideal place for repose and meditation. Manuel Azaña, the Socialist who served as the last president of the Second Spanish Republic, studied in the monastery&#x27;s Augustinian-run school and mentions them in his &quot;Memorias&quot; (Memoirs) and his play &quot;El jardín de los frailes&quot; (The Garden of the Friars). Students at the school still use it today to study and pass the time.

===Library===

The Escorial has three libraries. One is located behind the Chorus of the basilica. Another, within the monastery itself, used to be distributed to the different cells and rooms of the monks and that the Augustine monks have gradually managed to make their own. Finally, the Royal Library, which is public and exists under a special papal bull of protection.

From the beginning, the Royal Library was meant to be a monumental work of art, and its execution was commissioned to prominent architects of the moment: Juan de Toledo and Juan de Herrera, who shared the King&#x27;s neoplatonic views and who also designed the library&#x27;s shelves. It constituted, along with the basilica, the heart of the entire project, and the project was redrafted several times to accommodate changes in the organization of the library itself. As was usual for Juan de Herrera&#x27;s work, it was the most advanced of its kind in Europe. It was the first library on the continent that broke with medieval design. Domenico Fontana was inspired by Herrera&#x27;s design, after a visit, for his design of the Vatican Library. Philip was involved in every part of the design process of the library.

The Royal Library, like everything else in El Escorial, forms part of a larger symbolic structure and has symbolic meaning. It links the monastery and the seminary across the principal axis of the building, symbolizing the union of the spiritual and physical world. The books on the profane subjects—such as history, geography, and botany—are located in the part closest to the entrance. The library corridors branch out into different sections just to re-converge in the end, and as they advance towards the basilica, the subjects are the more abstract forms—such as poetry, grammar, and mathematics. The subjects closest to the basilica are those the King conceived as being the most abstract distillations of the others, and the closest to the origin, which was God in the Basilica: theology, geometry, and mathematics. The visitor must leave the noisy world behind and walk through the halls of knowledge in a specific, comprehensible order from concreteness to abstraction before being able to reach God and understand His message, a notion quite in line with both Charles I and Philip II&#x27;s hermeticist view of religion.

During Philip II&#x27;s reign, the library introduced a novel way of arranging the library&#x27;s bookcases or &quot;book presses&quot;. Until then most book presses were combined with desks and stood at right angles to the library&#x27;s walls. This system was known as the &quot;stall system&quot; and allowed light from the library&#x27;s windows to illuminate the shelves. Phillip&#x27;s library began using a &quot;wall system&quot;, placing the bookcases along the walls.

Currently the library has more than 40,000 volumes, located in a great hall in length, wide, and tall, with marble floors and beautifully carved wood shelves. De Herrera and Italian construction engineer Giuseppe Flecha y Gamboa were careful to consider the security of the library&#x27;s holdings in armarios (large bookcases), as well as their display, safeguards against fire hazards, and use of available natural lighting. This library was a Renaissance statement of power, majesty, prowess, and intellectual world leadership, designed for both the preservation of the old (binding multiple cultural histories into a single Catholic Spanish culture) and discovery of the new (imprinted by that culture).

The vault of the library&#x27;s ceiling is decorated with frescoes, painted by Pellegrino Tibaldi, depicting the seven liberal arts: grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy. This arrangement of parallel book cases was initiated by Philip II and was called the &quot;wall system&quot;.

The fire of 1671, which engulfed the library, destroyed about 5,280 handwritten codices, but the printed collections were saved. The printed collection of the library is made up of more than 600 incunabulas, 10,608 books from the 16th century, 2,179 books from the 17th century, and an increasing number of books from the 18th century. The manuscript collection is made up of a few thousands of medieval codices.

====Collecting process====
Philip II donated his personal collection of documents to the building, and also undertook the acquisition of the finest libraries and works of Western European Humanism. During Phillip&#x27;s reign, there was an entire room dedicated to ancient manuscripts, most of them in Latin, many in Greek, but also some in Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, Italian, French, and Spanish. There were approximately 1,800 Arabic titles. The first of those books were acquired in 1571 through Juan Paez de Castro. After that many books were obtained as a &quot;peace price&quot; during the many battles of the Spanish Empire with the Ottoman Empire. As part of his active efforts, in 1571 Philip II bought a large portion of the collection of Gonzalo Pérez, one of his advisors. This meant 57 original Greek manuscripts from Sicily, and 112 Latin ones, from Calabria. He also bought 315 original volumes, in Greek and Arabic, from Juan Páez de Castro&#x27;s personal library. The King charged specific ambassadors with traveling through his empire and neighboring kingdoms searching and buying the best for El Escorial&#x27;s library. These ambassadors were coordinated by the head librarian, who had total authority to direct their movements, and who stayed in contact with them through all their travels. Diego Guzmán de Silva was one such ambassador and made one of the most important purchases for the library during his time in Venice: an ancient collection of Greek manuscripts and Latin codices (1569–1577).

An inventory prepared in 1576 counted 4,546 volumes, over 2,000 manuscripts, and 2,500 printed books. That same year the library of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, the most valuable in Spain at the time, was bought. It included 850 codices and over 1,000 printed volumes. At this point, the size of the library was such that Benito Arias Montano had to be specially hired to organize the books and classify them by language, in addition to subject. In the 1580s the Library acquired some of its most unique pieces. Jorge Beteta donated a manuscript of the &quot;Concilios visigóticos&quot; (the Visigothic Councils) from the ninth century. Philip acquired several books from the Library of Granada, that belonged to Isabella I of Castile, including her Libro de Horas of astonishing visual beauty. Other valuable libraries acquired by Philip were those of Pedro Fajardo, and of Antonio Agustín, one of the largest in Spain at the time. About a thousand of these books are still in El Escorial, with many others having been sent to the Vatican. The King actively purchased rare books—often on esoteric, scientific, or theological subjects—from the East. He also collected and preserved over four hundred books prohibited by the Inquisition, which he agreed should not be available for those likely to &quot;misunderstand&quot; them but only to experts. By 1602, the library had a large cartographic collection and over 150 mathematical instruments.
Philip II left in his will a pension for the Escorial Library, to ensure that it would still be able to acquire new volumes.

Philip III continued his father&#x27;s policy of protection and enrichment of the library, even though he was not theologically inclined. In addition to continuing the search for, and purchase of, especially valuable and old books, he promulgated a new decree, according to which the library of El Escorial was to receive a copy of every book published inside the empire. During his reign the orders of continuing to search for books for the library were still in place. Arias Montano donated a large number of original Hebrew manuscripts, and Admiral Luis Fajardo brought back the complete Zaydani library captured during his wars with Sultan Muley Zidán.

The library reached its peak under Philip IV. In 1671 a great fire destroyed 5280 codices; the main hall, in which the printed books were kept, was saved. Among the most important losses were the &quot;Concilios visigóticos&quot; and the &quot;Historia natural de las Indias&quot; (&quot;Natural History of the Indies&quot;), a 19-volume encyclopedia on biology and botany by Francisco Hernández de Toledo. After the fire, the priest Antonio de San José spent over 25 years reclassifying and taking inventories of the surviving copies. His list of surviving books counted 45,000. Shortly after, as the Habsburg dynasty came to its end and the Bourbons took the throne after the War of the Spanish Succession, a further loss took place, as the Bourbon kings reversed the trend of acquiring books for the library and instead proceeded to take books to send to France or to their own libraries.

Currently, the library has over 40,000 volumes. The library includes many important illuminated manuscripts, such as the Ottonian Golden Gospels of Henry III (1045–46). The only known copy of the &quot;Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar&quot;, a 12th-century Syrian autobiography, was found there in the 19th century.

===The reliquaries===
Following a rule approved by the Council of Trent dealing with the veneration of saints, Philip II donated to the monastery one of the largest reliquaries in all of Catholic Christendom. The collection consists of some 7,500 relics, which are stored in 570 sculpted reliquaries designed by Juan de Herrera, with most being constructed by the artisan Juan de Arphe y Villafañe. These reliquaries are found in highly varied forms (heads, arms, pyramidal cases, coffers, etc.) and are distributed throughout the monastery, with the most important being concentrated in the basilica.

In the basilica, the relics are kept within two altarpieces, with the door panels painted by Federico Zuccari. Within the altarpiece depicting the &quot;Annunciation&quot;) are relics of female saints; its companion includes the relics of male saints.

===Reorganisation===

In 2024 El Escorial was being reorganised for visitors over two years, funded by €6.5m from the EU. Instead of using a side entrance, visitors enter through the imposing Patio of Kings courtyard. The Patio of the Evangelists, a garden with fountains and statues, will be open to visitors. The painting and architecture galleries, long dormant, are being reopened, reorganised and revitalised. The building is being updated with LED lighting, electric vehicle charging points, and solar panels.

==Adjacent buildings==
Juan de Herrera also designed the Casas de Oficios (Official Buildings) opposite the monastery&#x27;s north façade; and his successor, Francisco de Mora, designed the Casa de la Compaña (Company Quarters).

<text>Biscay ( ; ; ) or &quot;Bizkaia&quot;, is a province of the Basque Autonomous Community, heir of the ancient Lordship of Biscay, lying on the south shore of the eponymous bay. The capital and largest city is Bilbao.

Biscay is one of the most renowned and prosperous provinces of Spain, historically a major trading hub in the Atlantic Ocean since medieval times and, later on, one of the largest industrial and financial centers of the Iberian Peninsula. Since the extensive deindustrialization that took place throughout the 1970s, the economy has come to rely more on the services sector.

==Etymology==
It is accepted in linguistics (Koldo Mitxelena, etc.) that &quot;Bizkaia&quot; is a cognate of &quot;bizkar&quot; (cf. Biscarrosse in Aquitaine), with both place-name variants well attested in the whole Basque Country and out meaning &#x27;low ridge&#x27; or &#x27;prominence&#x27; (&quot;Iheldo bizchaya&quot; attested in 1141 for the Monte Igueldo in San Sebastián).

== Names ==

=== &quot;Bizkaia&quot; ===
&quot;Bizkaia&quot; is the official name, and it is used on official documents and national media. It is also the name used in the Basque version of the Spanish constitution, and of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country.

&quot;Bizkaia&quot; is the only official name in Spanish or Basque approved for the historical territory by the General Council of the province and the Spanish laws.

=== &quot;Vizcaya&quot; ===
&quot;Vizcaya&quot; is the &quot;hispanized&quot; modulation for the given name, used in non-official documents, as recommended by the Royal Spanish Academy. It is also the co-official name used in the Spanish version of the Constitution, and of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country.

== History ==
Biscay has been inhabited since the Middle Paleolithic, as attested by the archaeological remains and cave paintings found in its many caves. The Roman presence had little impact in the region, and the Basque language and traditions have survived to this day.

According to Anton Erkoreka, the Vikings had a commercial base there from which they were expelled by 825. &quot;Mundaka&quot; is likely a Viking name, and the ria of Mundaka is the easiest route to the river Ebro and at the end of it, the Mediterranean Sea and trade.

The first time Biscay is mentioned with that name (in Latin in the forms &quot;Bizkai&quot; and &quot;Bizcai&quot;) is in the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot; in the late 9th century, which tells of the regions repopulated under orders of Alfonso I, and how some territories &quot;owned by their own&quot;, among them Biscay, were not affected by these repopulations. Biscay is mentioned again in the 10th-century &quot;Códice de Roda&quot;, which narrates the wedding between Velazquita, daughter of Sancho I of Pamplona, to Munio Velaz, Count of Álava, in Biscay. It is recorded in 1070 in a donation act to the &quot;monastery of Bickaga&quot;, located on the ria of Mundaka.

It is considered then, that Biscay was by this period controlled by the Kingdom of Navarre. It then became autonomous and finally a part of the Crown of Castile, as the Lordship of Biscay.

In the modern age, the province became a major commercial and industrial area. Its prime harbour of Bilbao soon became the main Castilian gateway to Europe. Later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the abundance of prime quality iron ore and the lack of feudal castes favored rapid industrialization.

===Paleolithic===

====Middle Paleolithic====
The first evidence of human dwellings (Neanderthal people) in Biscay happens in this period of prehistory. Mousterian artifacts have been found in three sites in Biscay: Benta Laperra (Karrantza), Kurtzia (Getxo) and Murua (Durangoaldea).

====Late Paleolithic====

* Chatelperronian culture (normally associated with Neanderthals as well) can be found in Santimamiñe cave (Kortezubi).

The most important settlements by anotomically modern humans (&quot;H. sapiens&quot;) can be considered the following:
* Aurignacian culture: Benta Laperra, Kurztia, and Lumentxa (Lekeitio)
* Gravettian culture: Santimamiñe, Bolinkoba (Durangoaldea) and Atxurra (Markina)
* Solutrean culture: Santimamiñe and Bolinkoba
* Magdalenian culture: Santimamiñe and Lumentxa

Paleolithic art is also present. The Benta Laperra cave has the oldest paintings, maybe from the Aurignacian or Solutrean period. Bison and bear are the animals depicted, together with abstract signs. The murals of Arenaza (Galdames) and Santimamiñe were created in later periods (Magdalenian). In Arenaza female deer are the dominant motif; Santimamiñe features bison, horses, goats and deer.

====Epi-paleolithic====
This period (also called &quot;Mesolithic&quot; sometimes) is dominated in Biscay by the Azilian culture. Tools become smaller and more refined and, while hunting remains, fishing and seafood gathering become more important; there is evidence of consumption of wild fruits as well. Santimamiñe is one of the most important sites of this period. Others are Arenaza, Atxeta (not far from Santimamiñe), Lumentxa and nearby Urtiaga and Santa Catalina, together with Bolinkoba and neighbour Silibranka.

===Neolithic===
While the first evidences of Neolithic contact in the Basque Country can be dated to the 4th millennium BCE, it was not until the beginning of the 3rd that the area accepted, gradually and without radical changes, the advances of agricultural cultivation and domestication of sheep. Biscay was not particularly affected by this change and only three sites can be mentioned for this period: Arenaza, Santimamiñe and Kobeaga (Ea) and the advances adopted seem limited initially to sheep, domestic goats and very scarce pottery.

Together with Neolithic technologies, Megalithism also arrives. It will be the most common form of burial (simple dolmen) until .

===Chalcolithic and Bronze Age===
While open-air settlement started to become common as the population grew, they still used caves and natural shelters in Biscay in the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age. Hunting game became a less important source of protein, as the people relied on sheep, goats and some bovine cattle. Metallic tools become more common but stone-made ones are also used.

Pottery types shows great continuity (not decorated) until the bell beaker makes its appearance.

The sites of this period now cover all the territory of Biscay, many being open air settlements, but the most important caves of the Paleolithic are still in use as well.

=== Iron Age ===
Few sites have been identified for this period. Caves are abandoned for the most part but they still reveal some remains. The main caves of prehistory (Arenaza, Santimamiñe, Lumentxa) were still inhabited.

===Roman period===

Roman geographers identified two tribes in the territory now known as Biscay: the &quot;Caristii&quot; and &quot;Autrigones&quot;. The &quot;Caristii&quot; dwelt in nuclear Biscay, east of the firth of Bilbao, extending also into Northern Araba and some areas of Gipuzkoa, up to the river Deba. The &quot;Autrigones&quot; dwelt in the westernmost part of Biscay and Araba, extending also into the provinces of Cantabria, Burgos and La Rioja. Based in toponymy, historical and archaeological evidence, it is thought that these tribes spoke the Basque language. The borders of the Biscayan dialect of Basque seem to be those of the Caristian territory, with an exception of the areas that have lost the old language.

There is no indication to resistance to Roman occupation in all the Basque area (excepting Aquitaine) until the late feudalizing period. Roman sources mention several towns in the area, Flaviobriga and Portus Amanus, though they have not been located. The site of Forua, near Gernika, has yielded archaeological evidence of Roman presence .

In the late Roman period, together with the rest of the Basque Country, Biscay seems to have revolted against Roman domination and the growing society organized by feudalism.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the Early Middle Ages, the history of Biscay cannot be separated from that of the Basque Country as a whole. The area was &quot;de facto&quot; independent although Visigoths and Franks attempted to assert their domination from time to time. Encounters between the Visigoths and Basques usually led to defeat for the latter. The Visigoths established an outlying post at the later city of Vitoria to counter incursions and the migration of Basques from the coastal regions to the north.

In 905, Leonese chronicles define for the first time the Kingdom of Pamplona as including all the western Basque provinces, as well as the Rioja region. The territories that would later constitute Biscay were included in that state.
In the conflicts that the newly sovereign Kingdom of Castile and Pamplona/Navarre had in the 11th and 12th century, the Castilians were supported by many landowners from La Rioja, who sought to consolidate their holdings under Castilian feudal law. These pro-Castilian lords were led by the house of Haro, who were eventually granted the rule of newly created Biscay, initially made up of the valleys of Uribe, Busturia, Markina, Zornotza and Arratia, plus several towns and the city of Urduina. It is unclear when this happened, but tradition says that Iñigo López was the first Lord of Biscay in 1043.

The title to the lordship was inherited by Iñigo López&#x27;s descendants until, by inheritance, in 1370 it passed to John I of Castile. It became one of the titles of the king of Castile. Since then it remained connected to the crown, first to that of Castile and then, from Charles I, to that of &quot;Spain&quot;, as ruler of the Crown of Castile. It was conditioned on the lord swearing to defend and maintain the fuero (Biscayan laws, derived from Navarrese and Basque customary rights), which affirmed that the possessors of the sovereignty of the lordship were the Biscayans and that, at least in theory, they could refute the lord.

The lords and later the kings, came to swear the Statutes to the oak of Gernika, where the assembly of the Lordship sits.

===Modern age===

In the modern ages commerce took on great importance, specially for the Port of Bilbao, to which the kings granted privileges in 1511 for trade with the ports of the Spanish Empire. Bilbao was already the main Castilian harbour, from where wool was shipped to Flanders, and other goods were imported.

In 1628, the separate territory of Durango was incorporated to Biscay. In the same century the so-called &quot;chartered&quot; municipalities west of Biscay were also incorporated in different dates, becoming another subdivision of Biscay: Encartaciones (Enkarterriak).
The coastal towns had a sizable fleet of their own, mostly dedicated to fishing and trade. Along with other Basque towns of Gipuzkoa and Labourd, they were largely responsible for the partial extinction of North Atlantic right whales in the Bay of Biscay and of the first unstable settlement by Europeans in Newfoundland. They signed separate treaties with other powers, particularly England.

After the Napoleonic wars, Biscay, along with the other Basque provinces, were threatened to have their self-rule cut by the now Liberal Spanish Cortes. Together with opposing factions that supported different parties for the throne, this desire to maintain foral rights contributed to the successive Carlist Wars. The Biscayan government and other Basque provinces supported Carlos V, who represented an autocratic monarch who would preserve tradition.

Many of the towns though, notably Bilbao, were aligned with the Liberal government of Madrid. In the end, with victory by anti-Carlists, the wars resulted in successive cuts of the wide autonomy held by Biscay and the other provinces.

In the 1850s extensive prime quality iron resources were discovered in Biscay. This brought much foreign investment mainly from England and France. Development of these resources led to greater industrialization, which made Biscay one of Spain&#x27;s richest provinces. Together with the industrialisation, important bourgeois families, such as Ybarra, Chávarri and Lezama-Leguizamón, developed from the new sources of wealth. The great industrial (Iberdrola, Altos Hornos de Vizcaya) and financial (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria- BBVA) groups were created.

===20th century===

During the Second Spanish Republic, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) governed the province. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Biscay supported the Republican side against Francisco Franco&#x27;s army and ideology. Soon after, the Republic acknowledged a statute of autonomy for the Basque Country. Due to fascist control of large parts of it, the first short-lived Basque Autonomous Community had power only over Biscay and a few nearby villages.

As the fascist army advanced westward from Navarre, defenses were planned and erected around Bilbao, called the Iron Belt. But the engineer in charge, José Goicoechea, defected to the Nationalists, causing the unfinished defenses to be of little value. In 1937, German airplanes under Franco&#x27;s control destroyed the historic city of Gernika, after having bombed Durango with less severity a few weeks before. Some months later, Bilbao fell to the fascists. The Basque army (Eusko Gudarostea) retreated to Santoña, beyond the limits of Biscay. There they surrendered to the Italian forces (Santoña Agreement), but the Italians yielded to Franco. Other Republican forces considered the surrender a betrayal by the Basques.

Under the dictatorship of Franco, Biscay and Gipuzkoa (exclusively) were declared &quot;traitor provinces&quot; because of their opposition and stripped of any sort of self-rule. Only after Franco&#x27;s death in 1975 was democracy restored in Spain. The 1978 constitution accepted the particular Basque laws (fueros) and in 1979 the Statute of Guernica was approved whereupon Biscay, Araba and Gipuzkoa formed the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country with its own parliament. During this recent democratic period, Basque Nationalist Party candidates have consistently won elections in Biscay. Recently the foral law was amended to extend it to the towns and the city of Urduina, which had previously always used the general Spanish Civil law.

== Geography ==
Biscay is bordered by the community of Cantabria and the province of Burgos (in the Castile and León community) to the west, the Basque provinces of Gipuzkoa to the east, and Álava to the south, and by the Cantabrian Sea (Bay of Biscay) to the north. Orduña (&quot;Urduña&quot;) is a Biscayan exclave located between Alava and Burgos provinces.

===Climate===

The climate is oceanic, with high precipitation all year round and moderate temperatures, which allow the lush vegetation to grow. Temperatures are more extreme in the higher lands of inner Biscay, where snow is more common during winter. The average high temperatures in main city Bilbao is between in January and in August.

=== Features ===

The main geographical features of the province are:
* The southern high mountain ranges, part of the Basque mountains, that form a continuous barrier with passes not lower than 600 m AMSL, forming the water divide of the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. These ranges are divided from west to east in Ordunte (Zalama, 1390 m), Salbada (1100 m), Gorbea (1481 m) and Urkiola (Anboto, 1331 m).
* The middle section which is occupied by the main river&#x27;s valleys: Nervion, Ibaizabal and Kadagua. Kadagua runs west to east from Ordunte, Nervion south to north from Orduña and Ibaizabal east to west from Urkiola. The Arratia river runs northwards from Gorbea and joins Ibaizabal. Each valley is separated by mountains like Ganekogorta (998 m). Other mountains, like Oiz, separate the main valleys from the northern valleys. The northern rivers are Artibai, Lea, Oka and Butron.
* The coast: the main features are the estuary of Bilbao where the main rivers meet the sea and the estuary of Gernika (Urdaibai). The coast is usually high, with cliffs and small inlets and coves.

== Administrative divisions ==

=== Historical ===
Historically, Biscay was divided into &quot;merindades&quot; (called &quot;eskualdeak&quot; in Basque), which were two, the Constituent ones and the ones incorporated later.

The constituent ones were (&quot;the number indicates their position on the map&quot;):

* Uribe1
* Busturia2
* Markina3
* Bedia4
* Amorebieta (also Zornotza)5
* Arratia6

Incorporated later:
* Durango
* Enkarterri
* Orozko
* Orduña
* Some other independent cities and towns.

=== Modern ===
Currently, Biscay is divided into seven &quot;comarcas&quot; or regions, each one with its own capital city, subdivisions and municipalities.

These are:
* Greater Bilbao, usually divided into subregions:
** Bilbao
** Left Bank
** Uribe-Kosta
** Txorierri
** Hego Uribe
* Mungialdea
* Enkarterri
* Busturialdea
* Durangaldea
* Lea-Artibai
* Arratia-Nerbioi

== Demographics ==
According to the 2010 INE census, Biscay had a population of 1,155,772 and a population density of 519.9 inhabitants/km2, only surpassed by the one of Madrid and Barcelona. In 1981 Biscay was the fifth Spanish province in population, and despite the strong demographic crisis the province has been living since the Transition it is today the ninth province in population.

A 2021 survey found that 30.6% of the population spoke the Basque language.



== Government and foral institutions ==
The government and foral institutions of Biscay, as a historical territory of the Basque Country are the &quot;Juntas Generales de Vizcaya&quot; and the Foral Diputation of Biscay.

=== Juntas Generales ===
The Juntas Generales of Biscay are a unicameral assembly that has normative authority in the province. Its members, called &quot;apoderados&quot;, are elected by universal suffrage. The elections are held every four years.

After the 2015 elections, the configuration of the Juntas is the following:

=== Foral Diputation ===
The Foral Diputation has an executive function and regulatory authority in Biscay. The Foral Diputation is configured by a General Deputy, who currently is Unai Rementeria (PNV) and who is chosen by the Juntas Generales and by the rest of deputies.

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===
Biscay is connected to the rest of provinces by two main highways, the Cantabric Highway, which connects Bilbao and Durango with the French border, with accesses in Eibar, Zarautz and Donostia (the three of them in the province of Gipuzkoa), and the Basque-Aragonese Highway, which connects Bilbao with Zaragoza via Tudela, Calahorra and Logroño.

As well, many secondary roads connect Bilbao with the different towns located in the province.
=== Air ===

Biscay&#x27;s main and only airport is Bilbao Airport, which is the most important hub in northern Spain, and the number of passengers using the new terminal continues to rise. It is located in the municipalities of Loiu and Sondika.

=== Commuter rail ===
Biscay has different commuter rail services, operated by different companies. Cercanías Bilbao is the commuter rail service &quot;cercanías&quot; offered by Renfe, the national rail company. It connects Bilbao and its neighborhoods with other municipalities and regions inside Biscay, like Barakaldo, Santurtzi, Portugalete, Muskiz, Orduña and others.
EuskoTren has three commuter rail lines in the province; all of them start in Bilbao; one connects the city and Greater Bilbao with the &quot;comarca&quot; of Durangaldea and finished in Donostia (in the province of Gipuzkoa), other line connecting Greater Bilbao with Busturialdea and other serving the Txorierri region. FEVE also offers a commuter rail service connecting the regions of the Greater Bilbao with Enkarterri.

=== Long distance railways ===
Bilbao-Abando is Biscay&#x27;s main train station, with regular trains to other Spanish provinces like Burgos, Madrid and Barcelona offered by Renfe. FEVE also offers long distance trains to Cantabria and the Province of León in the Castile and León community.

The Basque Y is the name given to the future high-speed rail that will connect the three cities of the Basque Country; Bilbao (in Biscay), Donostia (in Gipuzkoa) and Vitoria-Gasteiz in Álava.

=== Metro ===
Metro Bilbao is a metro system serving the city of Bilbao and its metropolitan area, the Greater Bilbao region. It connects the city with other municipalities like Basauri, Barakaldo, Santurtzi and Getxo, among others.

== Tourism ==
Biscay&#x27;s capital city, Bilbao, is famous for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and for its estuary.

<text>The Limmat is a river in Switzerland. The river commences at the outfall of Lake Zurich, in the southern part of the city of Zurich. From Zurich it flows in a northwesterly direction, continuing a further 35 km until it reaches the river Aare. The confluence is located north of the small town of Brugg and shortly after the mouth of the Reuss.

The main towns along the Limmat Valley downstream of Zurich are Dietikon, Wettingen, and Baden. Its main tributaries are the Linth, Wägitaler Aa and Jona, all via Lake Zurich, the Sihl in Zurich, and the Reppisch in Dietikon.

The hydronym is first attested in the 8th century, as &quot;Lindimacus&quot;. It is of Gaulish origin, from &quot;*lindo-&quot; &quot;lake&quot; (Welsh &quot;llyn&quot;) and &quot;*magos&quot; &quot;plain&quot; (Welsh &quot;maes&quot;), and was thus presumably in origin the name of the plain formed by the Linth.

== Power generation ==
Like many Swiss rivers, the Limmat is intensively used for production of hydroelectric power: along its course of , its fall is used by no less than ten hydroelectric power stations. These include:


== Navigation ==
Historically, the Limmat was an important navigation route. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, voyages from Zurich to Koblenz are recorded. In 1447, the Emperor Frederick III granted the privilege of free navigation on the Limmat and on the Rhine to Zurich. Because of the current, navigation was typically downstream only, with the barges being sold on arrival.

Today, the Limmat is navigable for much of its length by small craft only, with many of the hydroelectric power plants incorporating boat lifts. The traditional boat type used on the river is the weidling, a flat-bottomed vessel that is usually long.

The uppermost stretch of the river through the centre of Zurich is navigable by rather larger vessels, albeit limited by low bridges. On this stretch of the river ZSG (Lake Zurich Navigation Company) operates its Limmat boat service, from the Landesmuseum to Lake Zurich, using low-profile motor boats.

== Cultural heritage ==
Located on the swamp land between Limmat and Lake Zurich around Sechseläutenplatz on small islands and peninsulas in Zurich, prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Zurich were set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the Linth and Jona. Zürich–Enge Alpenquai is located on Lake Zurich lakeshore in Enge, a locality of the municipality of Zurich. It was neighbored by the settlements at Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner on a then peninsula respectively island in the effluence of the Limmat, within an area of about in the city of Zurich. As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps&quot;, the settlement is also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a &quot;Class object&quot;.

<text>James Braid (19 June 1795 – 25 March 1860) was a Scottish surgeon, natural philosopher, and &quot;gentleman scientist&quot;.

He was a significant innovator in the treatment of clubfoot, spinal curvature, knock-knees, bandy legs, and squint; a significant pioneer of hypnotism and hypnotherapy, and an important and influential pioneer in the adoption of both hypnotic anaesthesia and chemical anaesthesia. He is regarded by some, such as Kroger (2008, p. 3), as the &quot;Father of Modern Hypnotism&quot;; however, in relation to the issue of there being significant connections between Braid&#x27;s &quot;hypnotism&quot; and &quot;modern hypnotism&quot; (as practised), let alone &quot;identity&quot;, Weitzenhoffer (2000, p. 3) urges the utmost caution in making any such assumption:

Also, in relation to the clinical application of &quot;hypnotism&quot;,
== Early life ==
Braid was born on 19 June 1795, the third son, and the seventh and youngest child, of James Braid (–1840s) and Anne Suttie (–?). He was born at Ryelaw House, in the Parish of Portmoak, Kinross, Scotland on 19 June 1795.

On 17 November 1813, at the age of 18, Braid married Margaret Mason (1792–1869), aged 21, the daughter of Robert Mason (?–1813) and Helen Mason, née Smith. They had two children, both of whom were born at Leadhills in Lanarkshire: Anne Daniel, née Braid (1820–1881), and James Braid (1822–1882).

==Education==
Braid was apprenticed to the Leith surgeons Thomas and Charles Anderson (i.e., both father and son). As part of that apprenticeship, Braid also attended the University of Edinburgh from 1812 to 1814, where he was also influenced by Thomas Brown, M.D. (1778–1820), who held the chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh from 1808 to 1820.

Braid obtained the diploma of the Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of the City of Edinburgh, the Lic.R.C.S. (Edin), in 1815, which entitled him to refer to himself as a member of the college, rather than a fellow.

==Surgeon==
Braid was appointed surgeon to Lord Hopetoun&#x27;s mines at Leadhills, Lanarkshire, in 1816. In 1825, he set up in private practice at Dumfries, where he also &quot;encountered the exceptional surgeon, William Maxwell, MD (1760–1834)&quot;.

One of his Dumfries&#x27; patients, Alexander Petty (1778–1864), a Scot, employed as a traveller for Scarr, Petty and Swain, a firm of Manchester tailors, invited Braid to move his practice to Manchester, England. Braid moved to Manchester in 1828, continuing to practise from there until his death in 1860.

Braid was a well-respected, highly skilled, and very successful surgeon,
:&quot;[and] though he was best known in the medical world for his theory and practice of hypnotism, he had also obtained wonderfully successful results by operation in cases of club foot and other deformities, which brought him patients from every part of the kingdom. Up to 1841 [viz., when he first encountered hypnotism] he had operated on 262 cases of talipes, 700 cases of strabismus, and 23 cases of spinal curvature.&quot;

==Learned Society and Technical Institute Affiliations==
Braid was a member of a number of prestigious &quot;learned societies&quot; and technical/educational institutions: a member of both the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, a Corresponding Member of both the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh (in 1824), and the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh (in 1854), a Member of the Manchester Athenæum, and the Honorary Curator of the museum of the Manchester Natural History Society.

==Mesmerism==

Braid first observed the operation of animal magnetism, when he attended a public performance by the travelling French magnetic demonstrator Charles Lafontaine (1803–1892) at the &quot;Manchester Athenæum&quot; on 13 November 1841.

In &quot;Neurypnology&quot; (1843, pp. 34–35) he states that, prior to his encounter with Lafontaine, he had already been totally convinced by a four-part investigation of Animal Magnetism published in &quot;The London Medical Gazette&quot; (i.e., Anon, 1838) that there was no evidence of the existence of any magnetic agency for any such phenomena. The final article&#x27;s last paragraph read: 
::This, then, [in conclusion,] is our case. Every credible effect of magnetism has occurred, and every incredible is said to have occurred, in cases where no magnetic influence has been exerted, but in all which, excited imagination, irritation, or some powerful mental impression, has operated: where the mind has been alone acted on, magnetic effects have been produced without magnetic manipulations: where magnetic manipulations have been employed, unknown, and therefore without the assistance of the mind, no result has ever been produced. Why, then, imagine a new agent, which cannot act by itself, and which has never yet even seemed to produce a new phenomenon?

And, along with the strong impression made upon Braid by the &quot;Medical Gazette&#x27;s&quot; article, there was also the more recent impressions made by Thomas Wakley&#x27;s exposure of the comprehensive fraud of John Elliotson&#x27;s subjects, the Okey sisters,
::[all of which] determined me to consider the whole as a system of collusion or illusion, or of excited imagination, sympathy, or imitation. &quot;I therefore abandoned the subject as unworthy of farther investigation, until I attended the conversazioni of Lafontaine&quot;, where I saw one fact, the inability of a patient to open his eyelids, which arrested my attention; I felt convinced it was not to be attributed to any of the causes referred to, and I therefore instituted experiments to determine the question; and exhibited the results to the public in a few days after. – (Braid, &quot;Neurypnology&quot; (1843), p. 35; emphasis added).

Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine&#x27;s demonstration as an open-minded sceptic, eager to examine the presented evidence at first hand – that is, rather than &quot;entirely [depending] on reading or hearsay evidence for his knowledge of it&quot; – and, then, from that evidence, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine&#x27;s work. He was neither a closed-minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and naïvely credulous believer seeking authorization of his already formed belief.

Braid was amongst the medical men who were invited onto the platform by Lafontaine. Braid examined the physical condition of Lafontaine&#x27;s magnetised subjects (especially their eyes and their eyelids) and concluded that they were, indeed, in quite a different physical state. Braid always stressed the significance of attending Lafontaine&#x27;s &quot;conversazione&quot;.

==Hypnotism==
::&quot;Modern hypnotism owes its name and its appearance in the realm of science to the investigations made by Braid. He is its true creator; he made it what it is; and above all, he gave emphasis to the experimental truth by means of which he proved that, when hypnotic phenomena are called into play, they are wholly independent of any supposed influence of the hypnotist upon the hypnotised, and that the hypnotised person simply reacts upon himself by reason of latent capacities in him which are artificially developed. Braid demonstrated that … hypnotism, acting upon a human subject as upon a fallow field, merely set in motion a string of silent faculties which only needed its assistance to reach their development. — Jules Bernard Luys (1828–1897)

===Lafontaine===
Braid attended two more of Lafontaine&#x27;s demonstrations; and, by the third demonstration (on Saturday 20 November 1841), Braid was convinced of the veracity of some of Lafontaine&#x27;s effects and phenomena (see Yeates, 2018b, pp. 56–63).
In particular, whilst Braid was entirely convinced that a transformation from, so to speak, condition1 to condition2, and back to condition1 had really taken place, he was also entirely convinced that no &quot;magnetic agency&quot; of any sort (as Lafontaine emphatically claimed) was responsible for the (veridical) events he had witnessed at first hand. He also rejected outright the assertion that the transformation in question had &quot;proceeded from, or [had been] excited into action by another [person]&quot; (&quot;Neurypnology&quot;, p. 32).

===Braid&#x27;s &quot;experimentum crucis&quot;===

Braid then performed his own &quot;experimentum crucis&quot;. Operating on the principle of Occam&#x27;s Razor (that &#x27;entities ought not to be multiplied beyond necessity&#x27;), and recognising that he could diminish, rather than multiply entities, he made an extraordinary decision to perform a role-reversal and treat the operator-subject interaction as subject-internal, operator-guided procedure; rather than, as Lafontaine supposed, an operator-centred, subject-external procedure. Braid emphatically proved his point by his self-experimentation with his &quot;upwards and inwards squint&quot;.

The exceptional success of Braid&#x27;s use of &#x27;self-&#x27; or &#x27;auto-hypnotism&#x27; (rather than &#x27;hetero-hypnotism&#x27;), entirely by himself, on himself, and within his own home, clearly demonstrated that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the &#x27;gaze&#x27;, &#x27;charisma&#x27;, or &#x27;magnetism&#x27; of the operator; all it needed was a subject&#x27;s &#x27;fixity of vision&#x27; on an &#x27;object of concentration&#x27; at such a height and such a distance from the bridge of their nose that the desired &#x27;upwards and inwards squint&#x27; was achieved. And, at the same time, by using himself as a subject, Braid also conclusively proved that none of Lafontaine&#x27;s phenomena were due to magnetic agency.

===&quot;Auto-hypnotization&quot; and &quot;hetero-hypnotization&quot;===
Braid conducted a number of experiments with self-hypnotization upon himself, and, by now convinced that he had discovered the natural psycho-physiological mechanism underlying these quite genuine effects, he performed his first act of hetero-hypnotization at his own residence, before several witnesses, including Captain Thomas Brown (1785–1862) on Monday 22 November 1841 – his first hypnotic subject was Mr. J. A. Walker. (see &quot;Neurypnology&quot;, pp. 16–20.)

===Absence of physical contact===
The following Saturday, (27 November 1841) Braid delivered his first public lecture at the Manchester Athenæum, in which, amongst other things, he was able to demonstrate that he could replicate the effects produced by Lafontaine, without the need for any sort of physical contact between the operator and the subject.

== Hugh M&#x27;Neile&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Agency and Mesmerism&quot; sermon ==
On the evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842, at St Jude&#x27;s Church, Liverpool, the controversial cleric Hugh Boyd M&#x27;Neile preached a sermon against Mesmerism for more than ninety minutes to a capacity congregation; and, according to most critics, it was a poorly argued and unimpressive performance.

M&#x27;Neile&#x27;s core argument was that scripture asserts the existence of &quot;satanic agency&quot;; and, in the process of delivering his sermon, he provided examples of the various instantiations that &quot;satanic agency&quot; might manifest (observing times, divination, necromancy, etc.), and claimed that these were all forms of &quot;witchcraft&quot;; and, further, he asserted that, because scripture asserts that, as &quot;latter times&quot; approach, more and more evidence of &quot;satanic agency&quot; will appear, it was, M&#x27;Neile asserted, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, transparently obvious that the exhibitions of Lafontaine and Braid, in Liverpool, at that very moment, were concrete examples of those particular instantiations.

He then moved into a confusing admixture of philippic (against Braid and Lafontaine), and polemic (against animal magnetism), wherein he concluded that all mesmeric phenomena were due to &quot;satanic agency&quot;. In particular, he attacked Braid as a man, a scientist, a philosopher, and a medical professional. He claimed that Braid and Lafontaine were one and the same kind. He also threatened Braid&#x27;s professional and social position by associating him with Satan; and, in the most ill-informed way, condemned Braid&#x27;s important therapeutic work as having no clinical efficacy whatsoever.

The sermon was reported on at some length in the &quot;Liverpool Standard&quot;, two days later. Once Braid became fully aware of the newspaper reports of the conglomeration of matters that were reportedly raised in M&#x27;Neile&#x27;s sermon, and the misrepresentations and outright errors of fact that it allegedly contained, as well as the vicious nature of the insults, and the implicit and explicit threats which were levelled against Braid&#x27;s own personal, spiritual, and professional well-being by M&#x27;Neile, he sent a detailed private letter to M&#x27;Neile accompanied by a newspaper account of a lecture he had delivered on the preceding Wednesday evening (13 April) at Macclesfield, and a cordial invitation (plus a free admission ticket) for M&#x27;Neile to attend Braid&#x27;s Liverpool lecture, on Thursday, 21 April.

Yet, despite Braid&#x27;s courtesy, in raising his deeply felt concerns directly to M&#x27;Neile, in private correspondence, M&#x27;Neile did not acknowledge Braid&#x27;s letter nor did he attend Braid&#x27;s lecture. Further, in the face of all the evidence Braid had presented, and seemingly, &quot;without the slightest correction of its original contents&quot;, M&#x27;Neile allowed the entire text of his original sermon, as it had been transcribed by a stenographer (more than 7,500 words), to be published on Wednesday, 4 May 1842. It was this &#x27;most ungentlemanly&#x27; act of M&#x27;Neile towards Braid, that forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842; a pamphlet which, in Crabtree&#x27;s opinion is &quot;a work of the greatest significance in the history of hypnotism, and of utmost rarity&quot; (1988, p. 121).

==British Association for the Advancement of Science==
Soon after, he also wrote a report entitled &quot;Practical Essay on the Curative Agency of Neuro-Hypnotism&quot;, which he applied to have read before the British Association for the Advancement of Science in June 1842. Despite being initially accepted for presentation, the paper was controversially rejected at the last moment; but Braid arranged for a series of Conversaziones at which he presented its contents. Braid summarised and contrasted his own view with the other views prevailing at that time:
::&quot;The various theories at present entertained regarding the phenomena of mesmerism may be arranged thus: First, those who believe them to be owing entirely to a system of collusion and delusion; and a great majority of society may be ranked under this head. Second, those who believe them to be real phenomena, but produced solely by imagination, sympathy, and imitation. Third, the animal magnetists, or those who believe in some magnetic medium set in motion as the exciting cause of the mesmeric phenomena. Fourth, those who have adopted my views, that the phenomena are solely attributable to a peculiar physiological state of the brain and the spinal cord.&quot;

== Terminology ==

By at least 28 February 1842, Braid was using &quot;Neurohypnology&quot; (which he later shortened to &quot;Neurypnology&quot;); and, in a public lecture on Saturday, 12 March 1842, at the Manchester Athenæum, Braid explained his terminological developments as follows:
::I therefore think it desirable to assume another name [than animal magnetism] for the phenomena, and have adopted neurohypnology – a word which will at once convey to every one at all acquainted with Greek, that it is the rationale or doctrine of nervous sleep; sleep being the most constant attendant and natural analogy to the primary phenomena of mesmerism; the prefix &quot;nervous&quot; distinguishing it from natural sleep. There are only two other words I propose by way of innovation, and those are hypnotism for magnetism and mesmerism, and hypnotised for magnetised and mesmerised.

It is important to recognize three things; namely, that:
:(1) Braid was only using the term &quot;sleep&quot; metaphorically;
:(2) despite the constant mistaken assertions in the modern literature, Braid did not, even on a single occasion, ever use the term hypnosis; and
:(3) the term &#x27;hypnosis&#x27; comes from the work of the Nancy School in the 1880s.

Although Braid was the first to use the terms &quot;hypnotism&quot;, &quot;hypnotise&quot; and &quot;hypnotist&quot; in English, the cognate terms hypnotique, hypnotisme, hypnotiste had been intentionally used by the French magnetist Baron Etienne Félix d&#x27;Henin de Cuvillers (1755–1841) at least as early as 1820. Braid, moreover, was the first person to use &quot;hypnotism&quot; in its modern sense, referring to a &quot;psycho-physiological&quot; theory rather than the &quot;occult&quot; theories of the magnetists.

In a letter written to the editor of The Lancet in 1845, Braid emphatically states that:
:&quot;I adopted the term &quot;hypnotism&quot; to prevent my being confounded with those who entertain those extreme notions [sc. that a mesmeriser&#x27;s &quot;will&quot; has an &quot;irresistible power… over his subjects&quot; and that clairvoyance and other &quot;higher phenomena&quot; are routinely manifested by those in the mesmeric state], as well as to get rid of the erroneous theory about a magnetic fluid, or exoteric influence of any description being the cause of the sleep. I distinctly avowed that hypnotism laid no claim to produce any phenomena which were not &quot;quite reconcilable with well-established physiological and psychological principles&quot;; pointed out the various sources of fallacy which might have misled the mesmerists; [and] was the first to give a public explanation of the trick [by which a fraudulent subject had been able to deceive his mesmeriser]…
:[Further, I have never been] a supporter of the imagination theory – i.e., that the induction of [hypnosis] in the first instance is merely the result of imagination. My belief is quite the contrary. I attribute it to the induction of a habit of intense abstraction, or concentration of attention, and maintain that it is most readily induced by causing the patient to fix his thoughts and sight on an object, and suppress his respiration.&quot;

==Induction==
In his first publication (i.e., &quot;Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed&quot;, etc.), he had also stressed the importance of the subject concentrating both vision and thought, referring to &quot;the continued fixation of the mental and visual eye&quot;

The concept of the mind&#x27;s eye first appeared in English in Chaucer&#x27;s Man of Law&#x27;s Tale in his Canterbury Tales, where he speaks of a man &quot;who was blind, and could only see with the eyes of his mind, with which all men see after they go blind&quot;. as a means of engaging a natural physiological mechanism that was already &quot;hard-wired&quot; into each human being:
:&quot;I shall merely add, that my experiments go to prove that it is a law in the animal economy that, by the continued fixation of the mental and visual eye on any object in itself not of an exciting nature, with absolute repose of body and general quietude, they become wearied; and, provided the patients rather favour than resist the feeling of stupor which they feel creeping over them during such experiment, a state of somnolency is induced, and that peculiar state of brain, and mobility of the nervous system, which render the patient liable to be directed so as to manifest the mesmeric phenomena. I consider it not so much the optic, as the motor and sympathetic nerves, and the mind, through which the impression is made. Such is the position I assume; and I feel so thoroughly convinced that it is a law of the animal economy, that such effects should follow such condition of mind and body, that I fear not to state, as my deliberate opinion, that this is a fact which cannot be controverted.&quot;

In 1843, he published &quot;Neurypnology; or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep&quot; Considered in Relation with Animal Magnetism..., his first and only book-length exposition of his views. According to Bramwell, the work was popular from the outset, selling 800 copies within a few months of its publication.

Braid thought of hypnotism as producing a &quot;nervous sleep&quot; which differed from ordinary sleep. The most efficient way to produce it was through visual fixation on a small bright object held eighteen inches above and in front of the eyes. Braid regarded the physiological condition underlying hypnotism to be the over-exercising of the eye muscles through the straining of attention.

He completely rejected Franz Mesmer&#x27;s idea that a magnetic fluid caused hypnotic phenomena, because anyone could produce them in &quot;himself by attending strictly to the simple rules&quot; that he had laid down. The (derogative) proposal that &quot;Braidism&quot; be adopted as a synonym for &quot;hypnotism&quot; was rejected by Braid; and it was rarely used at the time of that proposition, and is never used today.

== Braid&#x27;s &quot;sources of fallacy&quot; ==
Nearly a year after the publication of &quot;Neurypnology&quot;, the secretary of the Royal Manchester Institution invited Braid to conduct a conversazione in the Institution&#x27;s lecture theatre on Monday, 22 April 1844.

Braid spoke at considerable length to a very large audience on hypnotism; and also gave details of the important differences he had identified between his &quot;hypnotism&quot; and mesmerism/animal magnetism. According to the extensive press reports, &quot;the interest felt by the members of the institution in the subject was manifested by the attendance of one of the largest audiences we ever recollect to have seen present&quot;.

In 1903, Bramwell published a list of eight &quot;sources of fallacy&quot; attributed to Braid; the final two having been directly paraphrased, by Bramwell, from other aspects of Braid&#x27;s later works (see text at right).

In 1853, Braid investigated the phenomenon of &quot;table-turning&quot; and clearly confirmed Michael Faraday&#x27;s conclusion that the phenomenon was entirely due to the ideo-motor influences of the participants, rather than to the agency of &quot;mesmeric forces&quot; – as was being widely asserted by, for example, John Elliotson and his followers.

== The mono-ideo-dynamic principle ==
On 12 March 1852, convinced (as both a scientist and physiologist) of the genuineness of Braid&#x27;s &quot;hypnotism&quot;, Braid&#x27;s friend and colleague William Benjamin Carpenter presented a significant paper, &quot;On the influence of Suggestion in Modifying and directing Muscular Movement, independently of Volition&quot;, to the Royal Institution of Great Britain (it was published later that year).

Carpenter explained that the &quot;class of phenomena&quot; associated with Braid&#x27;s hypnotism were consequent upon a subject&#x27;s concentration on a single, &quot;dominant idea&quot;: namely, &quot;the occupation of the mind by the &quot;ideas&quot; which have been suggested to it, and in the influence which these ideas exert upon the actions of the body&quot;. Moreover, Carpenter said, &quot;it is not really the &quot;will&quot; of the operator which controls the &quot;sensations&quot; of the subject; but the &quot;suggestion&quot; of the operator which excites a corresponding &quot;idea&quot;&quot;: the suggested &quot;idea&quot; &quot;not only [producing non-volitional] muscular movements [through this psychosomatic mechanism], but other bodily changes [as well]&quot; (1852, p. 148).

In order to reconcile the observed hypnotic phenomena &quot;with the known laws of nervous action&quot; (p. 153), and without elaborating on mechanism, Carpenter identified a new psycho-physiological reflex activity – in addition to the already identified excito-motor (which was responsible for breathing, swallowing, etc.), and the sensori-motor (which was responsible for startle responses, etc.) – that of &quot;the ideo-motor principle of action&quot;. At the conclusion of his paper, Carpenter briefly noted that his proposed &quot;ideo-motor principle of action&quot;, specifically created to explain Braid&#x27;s &quot;hypnotism&quot;, could also explain other activities involving objectively psychosomatic responses, such as the movements of divining rods:
::&quot;Thus the ideo-motor principle of action finds its appropriate place in the physiological scale, which would, indeed, be incomplete without it.And, when it is once recognized, it may be applied to the explanation of numerous phenomena which have been a source of perplexity to many who have been convinced of their genuineness, and who could not see any mode of reconciling them with the known laws of nervous action.&lt;br&gt;The phenomena in question are those which have been recently set down to the action of an &quot;Od-force&quot;, such, for example, as the movements of the &quot;divining-rod&quot;, and the vibration of bodies suspended from the finger; both which have been clearly proved to depend on the state of expectant attention on the part of the performer, his Will being temporarily withdrawn from control over his muscles by the state of abstraction to which his mind is given up, and the anticipation of a given result being the stimulus which directly and involuntarily prompts the muscular movements that produce it. – Carpenter (1852, p. 153)

Braid immediately adopted Carpenter&#x27;s ideo-motor terminology. In order to stress the importance (within Braid&#x27;s own representation) of the single, &quot;dominant&quot; idea concept, Braid spoke of a &quot;&quot;mono-ideo-motor&quot; principle of action&quot;. However, by 1855, based on suggestions that had been made to Carpenter by their friend in common, Daniel Noble that Carpenter&#x27;s innovation would be more accurately understood, and more accurately applied (viz., not just limited to divining rods and pendulums), if it were designated the &quot;ideo-dynamic principle&quot; Braid was referring to a &quot;&quot;mono-ideo-dynamic&quot; principle of action&quot;:
::&quot;[The explanation for] the power that serpents have to fascinate birds … is simply this – that when the attention of man or animal is deeply engrossed or absorbed by a given idea associated with movement, a current of nervous force is sent into the muscles which produces a corresponding motion, not only without any conscious effort of volition, but even in opposition to volition, in many instances; and hence they seem to be irresistibly drawn, or spell-bound, according to the purport of the dominant idea or impression in the mind of each at the time.&lt;br&gt;The volition is prostrate; the individual is so completely monoideised, or under the influence of the dominant idea, as to be incapable of exerting an efficient restraining or opposing power to the dominant idea; and in the case of the bird and serpent, it is first wonder which arrests the creature&#x27;s attention, and then fear causes that mono-ideo-dynamic action of the muscles which involuntarily issues in the advance and capture of the unhappy bird …&lt;br&gt;It is this very principle of involuntary muscular action from a dominant idea which has got possession of the mind, and the suggestions conveyed to the mind by the muscular action which flows from it, which led so many to be deceived during their experiments in &quot;table-turning&quot;, and induced them to believe that the table was drawing them, whilst all the while they were unconsciously drawing or pushing it by their own muscular force. – Braid, &quot;Physiology of Fascination, etc.&quot;, (1855, pp. 3–5).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In order that I may do full justice to two esteemed friends, I beg to state, in connection with this term monoideo-dynamics, that, several years ago, Dr. W. B. Carpenter introduced the term ideo-motor to characterise the reflex or automatic muscular motions which arise merely from ideas associated with motion existing in the mind, without any conscious effort of volition.&lt;br&gt;In 1853, in referring to this term, Dr. Noble said, &quot;Ideo-dynamic would probably constitute a phraseology more appropriate, as applicable to a wider range of phenomena&quot;.&lt;br&gt;In this opinion I quite concurred, because I was well aware that an idea could arrest as well as excite motion automatically, not only in the muscles of voluntary motion, but also as regards the condition of every other function of the body.&lt;br&gt;I have, therefore, adopted the term monoideo-dynamics, as still more comprehensive and characteristic as regards the true mental relations which subsist during all dynamic changes which take place, in every other function of the body, as well as in the muscles of voluntary motion. – Braid, (1855, footnote at p . 10).

==Death==
Braid maintained an active interest in hypnotism until his death.

Just three days before his death he sent a (now lost) manuscript, that was written in English – usually referred to as &quot;On hypnotism&quot; – to the French surgeon Étienne Eugène Azam.

Braid died on 25 March 1860, aged 64, in Manchester, after just a few hours of illness. According to some contemporary accounts he died from &quot;apoplexy&quot;, and according to others he died from &quot;heart disease&quot;. He was survived by his wife, his son James (a general practitioner, rather than a surgeon), and his daughter.

==Influence==
Braid&#x27;s work had a strong influence on a number of important French medical figures, especially Étienne Eugène Azam (1822–1899) of Bordeaux (Braid&#x27;s principal French &quot;disciple&quot;), the anatomist Pierre Paul Broca (1824–1880), the physiologist , and the eminent hypnotherapist, and co-founder of the Nancy School, Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault (1823–1904).

Braid hypnotised the English Swedenborgian writer J.J.G. Wilkinson, who observed him hypnotising others several times, and began using hypnotism himself. Wilkinson soon became a passionate advocate of Braid&#x27;s work and his published remarks on hypnotism were quoted enthusiastically by Braid several times in his later writings. However, Braid&#x27;s legacy was maintained in Great Britain largely by John Milne Bramwell who collected all of his available works and published a biography and account of Braid&#x27;s theory and practice as well as several books on hypnotism of his own (see below).

==Works==
Braid published many letters and articles in journals and newspapers; he also published several pamphlets, and a number of books (many of which were compendiums of his previously published works).

His first major publication was &quot;Neurypnology, or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep&quot; (1843), written less than two years after his discovery of hypnotism.

He continued revising his theories and his clinical applications of hypnotism, based on his experiments and his empirical experience. Six weeks before his death, in a letter to &quot;The Medical Circular&quot;, Braid spoke of continuously having the daily experience of applying hypnotism in his practice for nineteen years; and, in a letter to &quot;The Critic&quot;, written four weeks before his death (this was his last published letter), he spoke of how his experiments and clinical experience had convinced him that all of the effects of hypnotism were generated &quot;by influences residing entirely &quot;within&quot;, and &quot;not without&quot;, the patient&#x27;s own body&quot;.

In 1851, Garth Wilkinson published a description of Braid&#x27;s &quot;hypnotism&quot;, which Braid described, two years later, as &quot;a beautiful description of [my system of] hypnotism&quot;.

In April 2009, Robertson published a reconstructed English version, backward translated from the French, of Braid&#x27;s last (lost) manuscript, &quot;On Hypnotism&quot;, addressed by Braid to the French Academy of Sciences.

== Bramwell: promoter and defender of Braid&#x27;s heritage ==

John Milne Bramwell, M.B. C.M., a talented specialist medical hypnotist and hypnotherapist himself, made a deep study of Braid&#x27;s works and helped to revive and maintain Braid&#x27;s legacy in Great Britain.

Bramwell had studied medicine at Edinburgh University in the same student cohort as Braid&#x27;s grandson, Charles.

Consequently, due to his Edinburgh studies – especially those with John Hughes Bennett (1812–1875), author of &quot;The Mesmeric Mania of 1851, With a Physiological Explanation of the Phenomena Produced&quot; (1851) – Bramwell was very familiar with Braid and his work; and, more significantly, through Charles Braid, he also had unfettered access to those publications, records, papers, etc. of Braid that were still held by the Braid family. He was, perhaps, second only to Preyer in his wide-ranging familiarity with Braid and his works.

In 1896, Bramwell noted that, &quot;[Braid&#x27;s name] is familiar to all students of hypnotism and is rarely mentioned by them without due credit being given to the important part he played in rescuing that science from ignorance and superstition&quot;. He found that almost all of those students believed that Braid &quot;held many erroneous views&quot; and that &quot;the researches of more recent investigators [had] disproved [those erroneous views]&quot;.

Finding that &quot;few seem to be acquainted with any of [Braid&#x27;s] works except &quot;Neurypnology&quot; or with the fact that [&quot;Neurypnology&quot;] was only one of a long series on the subject of hypnotism, and that in the later ones his views completely changed&quot;, Bramwell was convinced that this ignorance of Braid, which sprang from &quot;imperfect knowledge of his writings&quot;, was further compounded by at least three &quot;universally adopted opinions&quot;; viz., that Braid was English (Braid was a Scot), &quot;believed in phrenology&quot; (Braid did not), and &quot;knew nothing of suggestion&quot; (when, in fact, Braid was its strongest advocate, and, also, was first to apply the term &quot;suggestion&quot; to the practice).

Bramwell rejected the mistaken view – very widely promoted by Hippolyte Bernheim – that Braid knew nothing of suggestion, and that the entire &#x27;history&#x27; of suggestive therapeutics began with the Nancy &quot;Suggestion&quot; School in the late 1880s, had no foundation whatsoever:
In 1897, Bramwell wrote on Braid&#x27;s work for an important French hypnotism journal (&quot;&quot;James Braid: son œuvre et ses écrits&quot;). He also wrote on hypnotism and suggestion, strongly emphasizing the importance of Braid and his work (&quot;La Valeur Therapeutique de l&#x27;Hypnotisme et de la Suggestion&quot;). In his response, Bernheim repeated his entirely mistaken view that Braid knew nothing of suggestion (&quot;&quot;A propos de l&#x27;étude sur James Braid par le Dr. Milne Bramwell, etc.&quot;). Bramwell&#x27;s response (&quot;James Braid et la Suggestion, etc.&quot;&quot;) to Bernheim&#x27;s misrepresentation was emphatic:
::&quot;I answered [Bernheim], giving quotations from Braid&#x27;s published works, which clearly showed that he not only employed suggestion as intelligently as the members of the Nancy school now do, but also that his conception of its nature was clearer than theirs&quot; (&quot;Hypnotism, etc.&quot; (1913), p. 28).
==James Braid Society==
In 1997 Braid&#x27;s part in developing hypnosis for therapeutic purposes was recognised and commemorated by the creation of the James Braid Society, a discussion group for those &quot;involved or concerned in the ethical uses of hypnosis&quot;. The society meets once a month in central London, usually for a presentation on some aspect of hypnotherapy.

<text>Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland held by the Lamb family.

This family descended from Matthew Lamb, who represented Stockbridge and Peterborough in the House of Commons. In 1755 he was created a baronet, of Brocket Hall in the County of Hertford, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. He married Charlotte, daughter of Thomas Coke, through which marriage Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire came into the Lamb family.

He was succeeded by his son, Peniston, the second Baronet, who sat as Member of Parliament for Ludgershall, Malmesbury and Newport, Isle of Wight, and who, in 1770, was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan. In 1781, he was created Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1815, he was made Baron Melbourne, of Melbourne in the County of Derby, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He was succeeded by his son, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was a noted Whig politician and served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1834 and 1835–1841. He was Queen Victoria&#x27;s first Prime Minister, and she greatly relied upon his wisdom and experience in her early days on the throne, to the point where Melbourne&#x27;s political foes complained that he had enthralled her. Since Melbourne&#x27;s mother had numerous lovers, it is very doubtful that he was in fact the first Viscount&#x27;s son.

On his death, the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Viscount, who was a prominent diplomat. In 1839, nine years before he succeeded his brother, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Beauvale, of Beauvale in the County of Nottingham. All five titles became extinct on his death in 1853.

The Honourable George Lamb, fourth and youngest son of the first Viscount, was also a politician.

<text>Cornelius Cardew (7 May 193613 December 1981) was an English experimental music composer, and founder (with Howard Skempton and Michael Parsons) of the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental performing ensemble. He later rejected experimental music, explaining why he had &quot;discontinued composing in an avantgarde idiom&quot; in his own programme notes to his Piano Album 1973.

==Biography==
Cardew was born in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire. He was the second of three sons whose parents were both artists—his father was the potter Michael Cardew. The family moved to Wenford Bridge Pottery Cornwall a few years after his birth where he was first nurtured as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral, and later at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury which had evacuated to the Carlyon Bay Hotel for the war. His musical career thus began as a chorister. From 1953 to 1957, Cardew studied piano, cello, and composition at the Royal Academy of Music in London.

===Career===
Having won a scholarship to study at the recently established Studio for Electronic Music in Cologne, Cardew served as an assistant to Karlheinz Stockhausen from 1958 to 1960. He was given the task of independently working out the composition plans for the German composer&#x27;s score &quot;Carré&quot;, and Stockhausen noted:

As a musician he was outstanding because he was not only a good pianist but also a good improviser and I hired him to become my assistant in the late 50s and he worked with me for over three years. I gave him work to do which I have never given to any other musician, which means to work with me on the score I was composing. He was one of the best examples that you can find among musicians because he was well informed about the latest theories of composition as well as being a performer.

====Indeterminacy and American experimentalists====
In 1958, Cardew witnessed a series of concerts in Cologne by John Cage and David Tudor which had a considerable influence on him, leading him to abandon post-Schönbergian serial composition and develop the indeterminate and experimental scores for which he is best known. He was particularly prominent in introducing the works of American experimental composers such as Morton Feldman, La Monte Young, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, and Cage to an English audience during the early to mid sixties.

Cardew&#x27;s most important scores from his experimental period are &quot;Treatise&quot; (1963–67), a 193-page graphic score which allows for considerable freedom of interpretation, and &quot;The Great Learning&quot;, a work in seven parts or &quot;Paragraphs,&quot; based on translations of Confucius by Ezra Pound. &quot;The Great Learning&quot; instigated the formation of the Scratch Orchestra. During those years, he took a course in graphic design and he made his living as a graphic designer at Aldus Books in London.

In 1966, Cardew joined the free improvisation group AMM as cellist and pianist. AMM had formed the previous year and included English jazz musicians Lou Gare, Eddie Prévost, Keith Rowe, and one of his first students at the Royal Academy Christopher Hobbs. Performing with the group allowed Cardew to explore music in a completely democratic environment, freely improvising without recourse to scores.

While teaching an experimental music class at London&#x27;s Morley College in 1968, Cardew, along with Howard Skempton and Michael Parsons formed the Scratch Orchestra, a large experimental ensemble, initially for the purposes of interpreting Cardew&#x27;s &quot;The Great Learning&quot;. The Scratch Orchestra gave performances throughout Britain and elsewhere until its demise in 1972. It was during this period that the question of &quot;art for whom&quot; was hotly debated within the context of the Orchestra, which Cardew came to see as elitist despite its numerous attempts to make socially accessible music.

===Political involvements===
Cardew became a member of the Communist Party of England (Marxist-Leninist) in the 1970s, and in 1979 was a co-founder and member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist). His creative output from the demise of the Scratch Orchestra until his death reflected his political commitment.

At a 1976 meeting of the Central London branch of the Musicians Union, he tabled a controversial motion denouncing David Bowie as a fascist, after Bowie said that &quot;Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader.&quot; The motion read:

Although the vote was a tie, at twelve for and twelve against, a second motion was passed with a majority of 15–2. At the time of the punk explosion, he wrote a tract called &quot;Punk Rock Is Fascist&quot;, where he called The Clash &quot;reactionary&quot;.

===Legacy===
Tony Harris (2013) argues that Cardew&#x27;s inclusion in Wikipedia or in other encyclopedias such as &quot;New Grove&quot; has the effect of taming his legacy as a composer and ignoring those aspects of his work other than those which fit with those of a contributor to the Western classical music canon. In other terms, it fails to &quot;define his attitude or approach to music making and (makes) no attempt to illustrate his influence or impact...Composers, if they are to be remembered and valued within the Western classical context, must leave behind masterworks&quot; to justify their being encyclopedized in a format whose guidelines implicitly dictate &quot;what a composer biography should look like&quot;.

===Death===
Cardew died on 13 December 1981 aged 45, the victim of a hit-and-run car crash near his London home in Leyton. The driver was never found.

Musician John Tilbury, in his book &quot;Cornelius Cardew—A Life Unfinished&quot; suggests that the possibility that Cardew was killed because of his prominent Marxist-Leninist involvement &quot;cannot be ruled out&quot;. Tilbury quotes a friend of Cardew&#x27;s, John Maharg; &quot;MI5 are quite ruthless; people don&#x27;t realise it. And they kill pre-emptively&quot;. However, Howard Skempton recalled the treacherous weather conditions prevailing at the time of Cardew&#x27;s death and suggests that Cardew could have been walking in the road to avoid the icy pavements and might have been hit by a drunken driver who drove off to avoid arrest.

A 70th Birthday Anniversary Festival, including live music from all phases of Cardew&#x27;s career and a symposium on his music, took place on 7 May 2006 at the Cecil Sharp House in London.

<text>USS &quot;San Marcos&quot; (LSD-25) was a the United States Navy, named for the Castillo de San Marcos, the oldest masonry fort still standing in the United States. In 1911, the second-class battleship had also briefly borne the name &quot;San Marcos&quot;, perhaps for the town of San Marcos, Texas. The ship served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1970. In 1971, the vessel was loaned to the Spanish Navy as &quot;Galicia&quot; (TA31), before being outright transferred in 1974. In 1980, the vessel&#x27;s pennant number was changed to L31. &quot;Galicia&quot; was taken out of service by the Spanish Navy in 1988 and was scrapped in 1989.

== U.S. Navy career ==
&quot;San Marcos&quot;″ keel was laid down on 1 September 1944 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was launched on 10 January 1945, and commissioned on 15 April 1945.

&quot;San Marcos&quot; completed shakedown in early May, took on a cargo of landing boats; and, on 19 May, sailed for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 24 June, she transferred her cargo of 40 boats, loaded a similar cargo, and departed on 29 May. After taking on dredging equipment at Guam, she anchored in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 12 August – three days before the cessation of hostilities. On 15 August, she shifted to Naha, repaired tank landing craft (LCTs) through 20 August, then, proceeded to Saipan. There, she loaded mechanized landing craft (LCM-6s), vehicle and personnel landing craft, (LCVPs, &quot;Higgins boats&quot;), and large personnel landing craft (LCPLs), for use by occupation forces in the Tokyo Bay area; and, on 4 September, she arrived in Japan to offload her cargo and to commence operation and maintenance of a boat pool. In early December, she was reassigned to cargo operations; and, through the end of the year, she ferried boats from Aomori to Yokohama.

In January 1946, &quot;San Marcos&quot; was assigned to Joint Task Force 1 (JTF 1) for Operation Crossroads, the series of atomic tests scheduled for Bikini Atoll during the summer. She first shifted south to Okinawa; then, in February, moved east to Kwajalein, whence she helped to prepare the test site. She remained in JTF 1 through the July tests, and, on 29 August, she was detached. In early September, the ship moved from the Marshall Islands to Hawaii; and, in October, she arrived at San Francisco.

Granted provisional radiological clearance, she resumed cargo operations along the west coast in early November; and, by the end of the month, was carrying supplies, boats, and vehicles to the Aleutian Islands. In December, she put into the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton; received final clearance in January 1947; and, in the spring, resumed cargo runs between the west coast and the Aleutians. She terminated those operations in September and proceeded to southern California where her capabilities as a temporarily converted seaplane drydock were tested. In December, she commenced inactivation, and, on 19 December, was decommissioned and berthed with the San Diego Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

=== 1950s ===
After the outbreak of war in Korea, &quot;San Marcos&quot; was ordered activated. Recommissioned on 26 January 1951, she completed shakedown in March, was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s Amphibious Force, and, in May, sailed for the Panama Canal and Little Creek, Virginia.

She arrived at the latter in late May and, soon thereafter, commenced arctic summer resupply operations, under the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), to bases in Canada and Greenland. With the fall, she moved to the Caribbean Sea for fleet exercises, then returned home. In November, she shifted to Baltimore, Maryland, for a shipyard overhaul, and with the new year, 1952, resumed active duty.

Caribbean exercises took her into March. In April she departed Norfolk, Virginia, embarked Marines and their equipment at Morehead City, and headed east for her first Mediterranean deployment. She transited the Straits of Gibraltar in early May and operated with the Sixth Fleet, ranging from the south of France to Benghazi and Phaleron Bay, into October. She then recrossed the Atlantic, and, after disembarking the Marines in North Carolina, proceeded to Little Creek. She resumed east coast operations with a joint Army–Navy exercise in November.

During 1953, &quot;San Marcos&quot; conducted exercises and carried cargo along the east coast and in the Caribbean and underwent overhaul at Boston, Massachusetts. Winter, spring, and fall of 1954 saw a continuation of those operations including a reserve training cruise, while the summer brought a return to arctic waters for resupply missions. In January 1955, she proceeded again to the Mediterranean Sea.

Completing that deployment in May, she resumed a schedule of east coast, Caribbean, and – during the summers of 1956 and 1957 – polar logistic support operations. In September 1958, she was again deployed to the Mediterranean for a six-month tour with the Sixth Fleet. She rejoined the Second Fleet in March 1959; and, in May, tested recovery methods for Project Mercury. During the summer, she participated in Operation Inland Seas, conducted in the Great Lakes and made possible by the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Amphibious force exercises and local operations occupied the remainder of the year.

=== 1960s ===
Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, &quot;San Marcos&quot; rotated regularly between the Second and Sixth Fleets. While with the Second, she participated in exercises and carried cargo and personnel from New England to the Caribbean. Severing of diplomatic relations and increased tension between the United States and Cuba and political unrest in the Dominican Republic brought extended operations in the Greater Antilles in early 1961.
In April, &quot;San Marcos&quot; supported the Bay of Pigs Invasion, carrying LCUs and LCVPs loaded with vehicles and equipment to a rendezvous a few miles off the coast with the ships carrying Brigade 2506.

Those operations were followed by duty in support of Project Mercury; and, in September, she received modifications which added helicopter operations to her capabilities. Then a five-month Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM II) overhaul in 1962 and 1963 modernized her equipment and living spaces and improved her operational abilities in transporting, launching, and controlling assault craft; besides providing drydocking and repair services to landing ships and craft.

Her annual (excluding 1964) Mediterranean deployments brought participation in fleet, binational, and multinational (NATO) exercises. In 1964, she deployed only briefly, in September, to participate in Operation Steel Pike, a large-scale amphibious operation held off the coast of Spain.

On 13 August 1970, &quot;San Marcos&quot; returned to Little Creek to complete her last Mediterranean tour. Local and Caribbean exercises took her into 1971, when she was designated for transfer to the government of Spain. The first detachment of her future Spanish crew arrived in mid-April; the remainder joined her on 30 May. June was spent in familiarization activities and, on 1 July 1971, &quot;San Marcos&quot; was decommissioned and turned over.

== Spanish Navy career ==
The former &quot;San Marcos&quot; was commissioned in the Spanish Navy as &quot;Galicia&quot; (TA31) on 1 July 1971. She was sold outright to Spain on 1 August 1974. &quot;Galicia&quot;″s pennant number was changed to L31 circa 1980. &quot;Galicia&quot; was stricken from the Spanish Navy list in early 1988, and scrapped in 1989.

<text>The IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, known as the Defense Calculator while in development, was IBM’s first commercial scientific computer and its first series production mainframe computer, which was announced to the public on May 21, 1952. It was designed and developed by Jerrier Haddad and Nathaniel Rochester and was based on the IAS machine at Princeton.

The IBM 701 was the first computer in the IBM 700/7000 series, which were IBM’s high-end computers until the arrival of the IBM System/360 in 1964.

The business-oriented sibling of the 701 was the IBM 702 and a lower-cost general-purpose sibling was the IBM 650, which gained fame as the first mass-produced computer.

==History==
IBM 701 competed with Remington Rand&#x27;s UNIVAC 1103 in the scientific computation market. In early 1954, a committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a Joint Numerical Weather Prediction project. Based on the trials, the two machines had comparable computational speed, with a slight advantage for IBM&#x27;s machine, however when it came to input/output the 701 was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input/output equipment.

Nineteen IBM 701 systems were installed. The first 701 was delivered to IBM&#x27;s world headquarters in New York. Eight went to aircraft companies. At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, having an IBM 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster.

&quot;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers&quot; is often attributed to Thomas Watson Sr., chairman and CEO of IBM, in 1943. This misquote may stem from a statement by his son, Thomas Watson Jr. at the 1953 IBM annual stockholders&#x27; meeting. Watson Jr. was describing the market acceptance of the IBM 701 computer. Before production began, Watson visited with 20 companies that were potential customers. This is what he said at the stockholders&#x27; meeting, &quot;as a result of our trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18”.

&quot;Aviation Week&quot; for 11 May 1953 says the 701 rental charge was about per month; &quot;American Aviation&quot; 9 Nov 1953 says &quot;$15,000 a month per 40-hour shift. A second 40-hour shift ups the rental to $20,000 a month&quot;.

The successor of the 701 was the index register-equipped IBM 704, introduced 4 years after the 701. The 704 was not compatible with the 701, however, as the 704 increased the size of instructions from 18 bits to 36 bits to support the extra features. The 704 also marked the transition to magnetic-core memory.

== Social impact ==
In 1952, IBM paired with language scholars from Georgetown University to develop translation software for use on computers. On January 7, 1954, the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the IBM 701 computer to translate from Russian to English. This was the Georgetown–IBM experiment. The Mark 1 Translating Device, which was developed for the US Air Force, was able to produce its first automated Russian-to-English translation in 1959 and was shown to the public in 1964.

In 1954, a group of scientists ran millions of simulated hands of blackjack on an IBM 701 looking to determine the best playing decision for every combination of cards. The result of the study was the set of correct rules for hitting, standing, doubling or splitting in a blackjack game which are still the same today.

The IBM 701 has a claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in Arthur Samuel&#x27;s checkers-playing program on February 24, 1956. The program, which was developed for play on the IBM 701, was demonstrated to the public on television. Self-proclaimed checkers master Robert Nealey played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won. It is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer.

The University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore developed a language compilation and runtime system called the KOMPILER for their IBM 701. Speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an IBM computer. The language was developed by John Backus in 1953 for the IBM 701 to support computation with floating-point numbers. The Fortran compiler also developed by Backus was not released by IBM until the IBM 704.

==Description==
===Hardware configuration===
The IBM 701 system was composed of the following units:
*IBM 701 - Analytical Control Unit (CPU)
*IBM 706 - Electrostatic Storage Unit (2048 words of Williams tube Memory)
*IBM 711 - Punched Card Reader (150 Cards/min.)
*IBM 716 - Printer (150 Lines/min.)
*IBM 721 - Punched Card Recorder (100 Cards/min.)
*IBM 726 - Magnetic Tape Reader/Recorder (100 Bits/inch)
*IBM 727 - Magnetic Tape Reader/Recorder (200 Bits/inch)
*IBM 731 - Magnetic Drum Reader/Recorder
*IBM 736 - Power Frame #1
*IBM 737 - Magnetic Core Storage Unit (4096 words of 12 μs Core Memory) 
*IBM 740 - Cathode Ray Tube Output Recorder
*IBM 741 - Power Frame #2
*IBM 746 - Power Distribution Unit
*IBM 753 - Magnetic Tape Control Unit (controlled up to ten IBM 727s)

The total weight (depending on configuration) was about .

===Memory===

The system used vacuum tube logic circuitry and electrostatic storage, consisting of 72 Williams tubes with a capacity of 1024 bits each, giving a total memory of 2048 words of 36 bits each. Each of the 72 Williams tubes was 3 inches in diameter. Memory could be expanded to a maximum of 4096 words of 36 bits by the addition of a second set of 72 Williams tubes or (later) by replacing the entire memory with magnetic-core memory. The Williams tube memory and later core memory each had a memory cycle time of 12 microseconds. The Williams tube memory required periodic refreshing, mandating the insertion of refresh cycles into the 701&#x27;s timing. An addition operation required five 12-microsecond cycles, two of which were refresh cycles, while a multiplication or division operation required 38 cycles (456 microseconds). In addition, magnetic drum and magnetic tape were utilized for secondary storage.

===Instruction set===
Instructions were 18 bits long, single address.
*Sign (1 bit) - Whole word (-) or Half word (+) operand address
*Opcode (5 bits) - 32 instructions
*Address (12 bits) - 4096 Half word addresses

Numbers were either 36 bits or 18 bits long, signed magnitude, fixed point. The full word has a precision of about ten decimal digits. A decimal digit corresponds to formula_1 or 3.322 bits.

The IBM 701 had only two programmer accessible registers:
#The accumulator was 38 bits long (adding two overflow bits).
#The multiplier/quotient was 36 bits long.

===Peripherals===
The Magnetic Drum Reader/Recorder was added on the recommendation of John von Neumann, who said it would reduce the need for high speed I/O.

The first magnetic tape drives were used on the Tape Processing Machine (TPM) and then adapted to the 701.

<text>Johan Vaaler (March 15, 1866 – March 14, 1910) was a Norwegian inventor and patent clerk. He has often erroneously been identified as the inventor of the common paper clip.

==Biography==
John was at Aurskog-Høland in Akershus, Norway. Vaaler worked from 1892 until his death in 1910 as a patent examiner and manager at the patent office of Alfred Jørgen Bryn (&quot;Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor&quot;) in Kristiania (now Oslo).
In 1900, Vaaler designed a kind of binding to hold paper together, consisting of a thread of steel wire. He applied for a German patent on November 12 of that year and it was granted on June 6, 1901. He also filed an application for a United States patent on January 9, 1901. The U.S. patent was granted on June 4, 1901.

Unknown to Vaaler, a more functional and practical paper clip was already in production by the British Gem Manufacturing Company Ltd, but not yet marketed in Norway. His design was inferior because it lacked the two full loops of the wire. Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the existence of a better product, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of earlier inventions. 

Several types of paper clips had been patented in the United States since 1867, but the &quot;Gem&quot; type was not then (and has never been) patented. As an employee of Bryns patent office in Kristiania, Vaaler was familiar with patent legislation and procedures in Norway. His reasons for applying abroad are unknown, but it is possible that he had an exaggerated confidence in his invention and saw the need to secure the commercial rights internationally. Also, he may have been aware that Norwegian inventors would meet difficulties on the small home market. Quite soon he must have had the disappointment of his life when he was confronted by the &quot;Gem&quot;, which was probably introduced in Norway during his own lifetime. He is not known to have tried to contact potential manufacturers in Norway or abroad, and this lack of initiative seems to confirm that he soon learned that a superior clip already existed. His patent was allowed to expire quietly. Meanwhile, the &quot;Gem&quot; conquered the world, including his own country. The Norwegian fish hook manufacturer O. Mustad &amp; Son AS of Gjøvik has produced &quot;Gem&quot;-type paper clips since 1928.

Vaaler&#x27;s alleged invention of the paper clip became known in Norway after World War II and found its way into some encyclopedias. Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip as a national symbol. During the German occupation of Norway during World War II, after pins or badges bearing national symbols or the initials of exiled King Haakon VII were banned, Norwegians began to wear paper clips in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the occupiers and local Nazi authorities. The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity (&quot;we are bound together&quot;). Their symbolism was even more obvious because paper clips are called &quot;binders&quot; in Norwegian. Their presumed Norwegian origin was not generally known at that time, but when that widely believed story was added to the war-time experience of many patriots, it strengthened their status as national symbols. Proofs of the national pride in Vaaler&#x27;s alleged invention are the postage stamp issued in 1999 and the giant paper clip erected in front of the BI commercial college in 1989.

<text>William Boyce (baptised 11 September 1711 – 7 February 1779) was an English composer and organist. Like Beethoven later on, he became deaf but continued to compose. He knew Handel, Arne, Gluck, Bach, Abel, and a very young Mozart, all of whom respected his work.

==Life==

Boyce was born in London, at Joiners Hall, then in Lower Thames Street, to John Boyce, at the time a joiner and cabinet-maker, and beadle of the Worshipful Company of Joiners and Ceilers, and his wife Elizabeth Cordwell. He was baptised on 11 September 1711 and was admitted by his father as a choirboy at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1719. After his voice broke in 1727, he studied music with Maurice Greene.

His first professional appointment came in 1734 when he was employed as an organist at the Oxford Chapel in central London. He went on to take a number of similar posts before being appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Musick in 1757 (he had applied for the post on the death of Maurice Greene in 1755) and becoming one of the organists at the Chapel Royal in 1758. He also gave lessons, his daughter telling the composer R. J. S. Stevens that both Thomas Linley the Elder and Thomas Linley the Younger had been his pupils in counterpoint in the period 1763–1768.

His work as a composer began in the 1730s, writing songs for Vauxhall Gardens. In 1736 he was named as composer to the Chapel Royal and wrote the oratorio &quot;David&#x27;s Lamentation over Saul and Jonathan. &quot;He was engaged as conductor to the Three Choirs Festival in 1737; many of his works, including the &quot;Worcester Overture&quot; (today known as his Symphony no. 8), will have been premiered at the Festival over the succeeding years. The 1740s saw his opera &quot;Peleus and Thetis&quot;, the serenata &quot;Solomon&quot;, and his &quot;Secular Masque&quot;, to a libretto by John Dryden. In 1749 he wrote an ode and the anthem &quot;O be joyful&quot; to celebrate the installation of the Duke of Newcastle as Chancellor of Cambridge University, and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Music. In 1747 he had published his first purely instrumental composition, a set of &quot;Twelve Sonatas for Two Violins and a Bass&quot; and these proved popular. Charles Burney wrote that they were &quot;not only in constant use, as Chamber music, in private concerts ... but in our theatres, as act-tunes [i.e. intermezzi] and public gardens, as favourite pieces, during many years.&quot;

In the 1750s Boyce supplied David Garrick with songs and other music for many productions at the Drury Lane Theatre. These included his own operas &quot;The Chaplet&quot; and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Lottery&quot;, both to libretti by Moses Mendez, and for Garrick&#x27;s 1759 pantomime &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Invasion&quot; which contained what became Boyce&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Heart of Oak&quot;.

As Master of the King&#x27;s Musick Boyce had the responsibility of writing music for royal occasions including funerals, weddings and coronations. He, however, refused to make a new setting of &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; for the coronation of George III and Charlotte in 1761 on the grounds that Handel&#x27;s setting of the anthem was unsurpassable – as a consequence of which Handel&#x27;s setting has been played at every subsequent British coronation. However, that coronation is the only one recorded where a single musician wrote nearly all the music, Boyce having composed a total of eight anthems specifically for the event.

By the year 1758, his deafness had increased to such an extent that he was unable to continue in his organist posts. He resolved to give up teaching and to retire to Kensington, and devote himself to editing the collection of church music which bears his name. He retired and worked on completing the compilation &quot;Cathedral Music&quot; that his teacher Greene had left incomplete at his death. This led to Boyce editing works by the likes of William Byrd and Henry Purcell. Many of the pieces in the collection are still used in Anglican services today.

On 7 February 1779 Boyce died from an attack of gout, aged 67. He was buried under the dome of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His only son, also William Boyce (25 March 1764 – 1824), was a professional double bass player.

==Legacy==

Boyce was largely forgotten after his death and he remains a little-performed composer today, although a number of his pieces were rediscovered in the 1930s and Constant Lambert edited and sometimes conducted his works. Lambert had already launched the early stages of the modern Boyce revival in 1928, when he published the first modern edition of the &quot;Eight Symphonies&quot; (Bartlett and Bruce 2001). The great exception to this neglect was his church music, which was edited after his death by Philip Hayes and published in two large volumes, &quot;Fifteen Anthems by Dr Boyce&quot; in 1780 and &quot;A Collection of Anthems and a Short Service&quot; in 1790 (Bartlett 2003, 54).

Church choral music saw a revival in the 1830s and 1840s, under the influences of the Tractarians, the Cambridge Camden Society, and the financial changes carried out under the &quot;Dean and Chapter Act&quot; (the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840). A new edition of Boyce&#x27;s works as &quot;Cathedral Music&quot;, edited by Joseph Warren, appeared in 1849.

The first movement (&quot;Allegro&quot;) of Boyce&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in B-flat was the first piece of music played during the procession of the bride and bridegroom at the conclusion of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018. His coronation anthem &quot;The King Shall Rejoice&quot;, initially composed for the coronation of George III in 1761, was also performed at the coronation of Charles III in 2023.

Boyce&#x27;s portraits were painted by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Hudson. He was drawn and engraved by John Keyse Sherwin, and a vignette made by Drayton after Robert Smirke.

<text>USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; (LHD-3) is the third of the United States Navy. She is the fifth ship to bear that name, but the fourth to serve under it, as the third was renamed before launching (after the prior was sunk).

==Namesake==
Named in honor of , a sloop-of-war that gained fame hunting Confederate raiders during the American Civil War. The sloop was named for Mount Kearsarge in Merrimack County, New Hampshire.

==Construction==
&quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s keel was laid down on 6 February 1990 at Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation of Pascagoula, Mississippi.

Ingalls built &quot;Kearsarge&quot; using efficient pre-outfitting and modular construction techniques. Hundreds of smaller sub-assemblies, containing piping, ventilation ducting and other hardware, as well as major machinery equipment, generators, and electrical panels were constructed. The sub-assemblies were then joined with others to form assemblies, which were in turn welded together to form five completed hull and superstructure modules. These giant modules, each weighing thousands of tons, were joined on land to form the completed ship&#x27;s hull. The result of this early outfitting was a ship that was over 70 percent complete at launch.

She was launched on 26 March 1992, in a ceremony attended by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell. The warship was christened on 16 May 1992, and commissioned on 16 October 1993.

==Characteristics==

The assault support system on the ship coordinates vertical and horizontal movement of troops, cargo and vehicles. A Monorail system, moving at speeds up to 600 ft/min (3 m/s), transports cargo and supplies from storage and staging areas throughout the ship to a well deck, which opens to the sea through huge gates in the ship&#x27;s stern. There, the cargo, troops and vehicles are loaded onto landing craft for transit to the beach. The air cushion landing craft can &quot;fly&quot; out of the dry well deck, or the well deck can be flooded so that conventional landing craft can float out on their way to the beach.

Simultaneously, helicopters can be lifted from the hangar deck to the flight deck by two deck-edge elevators and loaded with supplies from three massive cargo elevators.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s armament suite includes the NATO RIM-7 Sea Sparrow point defense system for anti-aircraft support, RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles, 25-mm chain guns and the Phalanx close-in weapon system to counter threats from low-flying aircraft and close-in small craft. Missile decoy launchers augment the anti-ship missile defenses.

==Operations==

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; is capable of amphibious assault, advance force and special purpose operations, as well as non-combatant evacuation and other humanitarian missions. Since her commissioning, she has performed these missions all over the world, including evacuating non-combatants from Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 31 May 1997 and rescuing Air Force Captain Scott O&#x27;Grady, whose F-16 aircraft had been shot down over Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia on 8 June 1995, while taking part of Operation Deny Fly.

Operation Noble Obelisk was the evacuation of civilians from Sierra Leone in 1997 undertaken by USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. More than 400 Americans and more than 3000 third-country nationals were taken aboard Kearsarge over 4 days.

Additionally, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; is fully equipped with state-of-the-art command and control (C&amp;C) systems for flagship command duty, and her medical facilities are second in capability only to the Navy&#x27;s hospital ships, and . These facilities allowed &quot;Kearsarge&quot; to serve a dual role during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, as a platform for bombing missions against Yugoslav forces in Operation Allied Force, and as a treatment facility for Kosovar refugees in Operation Shining Hope. In August 1999, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; participated in relief efforts for Operation Avid Response.

On 19 August 2005, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and were targeted by rockets while in port in Jordan. The rockets flew over &quot;Ashland&quot;″s bow and struck the pier adjacent to the ships. The vessels were not hit but one Jordanian soldier was killed and another was wounded. The sailors aboard both warships were awarded the Combat Action Ribbon as a result of the attack.
In 1994, 2006, 2008, and again in 2017, USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; served as the principal attraction for New York&#x27;s &quot;Fleet Week&quot;. In August 2007, the ship visited the port of Valletta, Malta on the way to a six-month deployment to Iraq (5th Fleet AOR). The ship deployed Sailors and Marines in a relief effort in Bangladesh following Cyclone Sidr and provided support for President George W. Bush&#x27;s January 2008 visit to Israel.

On 6 August 2008, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; deployed in support of Operation Continuing Promise. The ship&#x27;s crew, along with augments from the United States Marine Corps, the United States Air Force, the United States Army, the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service, Canadian Forces, and other multi-national forces and NGO&#x27;s, provided medical, construction and humanitarian services to six Central, South, and Caribbean American countries (Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Trinidad). The ship also provided Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) operations in Haiti following four Atlantic hurricanes.


On 2 March 2011, &quot;Kearsarge&quot;, along with , traveled through the Suez Canal in response to the 2011 Libyan civil war. Robert Gates had said days earlier that he ordered the two warships into the Mediterranean, along with an extra 400 Marines, in case they are needed to evacuate civilians or provide humanitarian relief. As of 20 March, AV-8B Harrier II attack aircraft from &quot;Kearsarge&quot; have been reported attacking Libyan targets as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. On 22 March, V-22 Ospreys from &quot;Kearsarge&quot; conducted a successful TRAP operation to recover the crew of a USAF F-15E Strike Eagle after it crashed in Libya due to a mechanical failure during a combat mission. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported a military source, stating that, during the rescue, strafing runs were carried out and two Harriers dropped two 500 lb bombs on a convoy of Libyan vehicles, with other reports alleging that Libyan civilians were wounded in the operation. The ship returned to home port at Norfolk on 16 May 2011.

Following a three-day delay due to bad weather, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; deployed from Naval Station Norfolk on 11 March 2013 for a scheduled eight-month deployment. One of her first port visits was to Cyprus. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; later docked at the Israeli port of Eilat for several days beginning on 14 May 2013 before continuing her deployment. One of her MV-22s exercised in a joint operation with .

In September 2017, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was called upon to assist in search-and-rescue operations during Hurricane Maria, after contact was lost with a ship carrying four people that issued a distress signal while battling seas and winds off the coast of Vieques, Puerto Rico. The United States Coast Guard, Navy, and the Royal Navy utilized an HC-130 aircraft, a fast response cutter, and Navy helicopters. A woman and two children were rescued, but a man died aboard their capsized vessel.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; participated in Ft. Lauderdale&#x27;s 2018 Fleet Week.

On 13 May 2022, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; took part in a PASSEX training with the Finnish and Swedish navies in the northern Baltic Sea. From 17 May to 23 May, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and her amphibious readiness group took part in the NATO vigilance activity, Neptune Shield 2022. On 27 May, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; docked at Tallinn, Estonia ahead of the Exercise BALTOPS 22. During BALTOPS 2022 &quot;Kearsarge&quot; trained operating UUVs and UAVs. On 2 June, she arrived in Stockholm, Sweden. On 20 August, she arrived in Klaipėda, Lithuania.

==Shield and crest==
Blue and gold are colors traditionally associated with the Navy and symbolize the sea and excellence. The green chevron suggests the green-peaked Mount Kearsarge in New Hampshire. The amphibious nature of the combat operations of the present USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; is represented by green and blue, alluding land and sea. The arrowheads, together with the white chevronel, which represents a shore line, allude to assault landings. The stars commemorate the battle stars the third &quot;Kearsarge&quot; received for Korean War and Vietnam War service.

The wings of the crest symbolize the aviation capabilities of both the present and the third &quot;Kearsarge&quot;; they are gold for the honor and achievement. The white anchor recalls the round-the-world cruise of the second &quot;Kearsarge&quot; of the Great White Fleet in 1907 and denotes the naval prowess of the USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;s. The blue-and-gray wavy bar highlights the Civil War service for the first USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. The swords (one a Navy cutlass and the other a Marine mameluke) are crossed, to denote cooperation and teamwork, as well as the combined combat mission of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Motto ~ &quot;Proud ... Bold ... Trustworthy.&quot;

<text>The canal network of the United Kingdom played a vital role in the Industrial Revolution. The UK was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network which, at its peak, expanded to nearly in length. The canals allowed raw materials to be transported to a place of manufacture, and finished goods to be transported to consumers, more quickly and cheaply than by a land based route. The canal network was extensive and included feats of civil engineering such as the Anderton Boat Lift, the Manchester Ship Canal, the Worsley Navigable Levels and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.

In the post-medieval period, some rivers were canalised for boat traffic. The Exeter Ship Canal was completed in 1567. The Sankey Canal was the first British canal of the Industrial Revolution, opening in 1757. The Bridgewater Canal followed in 1761 and proved to be highly profitable. The majority of the network was built in the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of canals, between the 1770s and the 1830s. From 1840 the canals began to decline, because the growing railway network was a more efficient means of transporting goods. From the beginning of the 20th century the road network became progressively more important; canals became uneconomic and were abandoned. In 1948, much of the network was nationalised. Since then, canals have been increasingly used for recreation and tourism.

Different types of boat used the canals: the most common was the traditional narrowboat. At the outset the boats were towed by horses, but later they were driven by diesel engines. Some closed canals have been restored, and canal museums have opened.

==History==
===Pre-Industrial Revolution transport systems===

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, some natural waterways were &quot;canalised&quot; or improved for boat traffic in the 16th century. The first act of Parliament was obtained by the City of Canterbury in 1515, Deepening River at Canterbury Act 1514 (6 Hen. 8. c. 17), to extend navigation on the River Stour in Kent, followed by the River Exe, with the River Exe Act 1539 (31 Hen. 8. c. 4), which led to the construction in 1566 of a new channel, the Exeter Canal. Simple flash locks were provided to regulate the flow of water and allow loaded boats to pass through shallow waters by admitting a rush of water, but these were not purpose-built canals as we understand them today.

The transport system that existed before the canals were built consisted of coastal shipping and horses and carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads (although there were some surfaced turnpike roads). There was also a small amount of traffic carried along navigable rivers. In the 17th century, as early industry started to expand, this transport situation was highly unsatisfactory. The restrictions of coastal shipping and river transport were obvious, and horses and carts could only carry one or two tons of cargo at a time. The poor state of most of the roads meant that they could often become unusable after heavy rain. Because of the small loads that could be carried, supplies of essential commodities such as coal and iron ore were limited, and this kept prices high and restricted economic growth. One horse-drawn canal barge could carry about thirty tonnes at a time, faster than road transport and at half the cost.

Some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1605, the government of King James I established the Oxford-Burcot Commission, which began to improve the system of locks and weirs on the River Thames, which were opened between Oxford and Abingdon by 1635. In 1635 Sir Richard Weston was appointed to develop the River Wey Navigation, making Guildford accessible by 1653. In 1670 the Stamford Canal opened, indistinguishable from 18th century examples with a dedicated cut and double-door locks. In 1699 legislation was passed to permit the Aire and Calder Navigation which was opened 1703, and the Trent Navigation which was built by George Hayne and opened in 1712. Subsequently, the Kennet built by John Hore opened in 1723, the Mersey and Irwell opened in 1725, and the Bristol Avon in 1727. John Smeaton was the engineer of the Calder and Hebble which opened in 1758, and a series of eight pound locks was built to replace flash locks on the River Thames between Maidenhead and Reading, beginning in 1772. The net effect of these was to bring most of England, with the notable exceptions of Birmingham and Staffordshire, within of a waterway.

By the early 18th century, river navigations such as the Aire and Calder Navigation were becoming quite sophisticated, with pound locks and longer and longer &quot;cuts&quot; (some with intermediate locks) to avoid circuitous or difficult stretches of rivers. Eventually, the experience of building long multi-level cuts with their own locks gave rise to the idea of building a &quot;pure&quot; canal, a waterway designed on the basis of where goods needed to go, not where a river happened to be.

===The Industrial Revolution===

The UK was the first country to develop a nationwide canal network.&lt;ref name=&quot;N/A 1978 990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The canals caused a great change in the economy of Britain. They supported the industries that allowed the country to become the world&#x27;s first industrial power and supported the economic powerhouse that was the British Empire in the Victorian Era. The canals were built because they offered the most economic and reliable way to transport goods and commodities in large quantities. The navigable water network grew rapidly at first and became an almost completely connected transport network. In addition to the building of new canals, older canals were improved. They were given new embankments, tunnels, aqueducts and cuttings. However, there was often fierce opposition to the building.

The Sankey Canal was the first British canal of the Industrial Revolution, opening in 1757. It connected St Helens with Spike Island in Widnes. The canal fuelled the growth of the chemical industry in Widnes, which subsequently became the centre of the industry in England. In the mid-18th century the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater built the Bridgewater Canal. Its purpose was to transport coal from his mines to the industrialising city of Manchester. He commissioned the engineer James Brindley to build the canal; the design included an aqueduct carrying the canal over the River Irwell. The aqueduct was an engineering wonder which attracted tourists. Its construction was funded entirely by the Duke. It opened in 1761 and was the longest canal constructed in Britain to that date. Canal boats could carry thirty tons at a time; one horse could tow more than ten times the amount of cargo that was possible with a cart. The Bridgewater Canal reduced the price of coal in Manchester by nearly two-thirds within a year of its opening. The canal was a huge financial success and repaid the cost of its construction within just a few years.

The 19th century saw some major new canals such as the Caledonian Canal and the Manchester Ship Canal. The new canals proved highly successful. The boats on the canals were horse-drawn with a towpath alongside the canal for the horse to walk along. This horse-drawn system proved to be highly economical and became standard across the British canal network. Commercial horse-drawn canal boats could be seen on the UK&#x27;s canals until as late as the 1950s, although by then diesel powered boats, often towing a second unpowered boat, had become standard. During the latter part of the 19th century the boat decoration of Roses and Castles began to appear. In this period, whole families lived aboard the boats.

===The Golden Age===
The period between the 1770s and the 1830s is often referred to as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of British canals. During this period of canal mania, huge sums were invested in canal building. The canal system expanded to nearly in length.

At the start of this age, canals were built by groups of private individuals with an interest in improving communications. In Staffordshire the potter Josiah Wedgwood saw an opportunity to bring bulky cargoes of clay to his factory doors, and to minimise breakages of his fragile finished goods as they travelled to market. Within just a few years an embryonic national canal network came into being.

Acts of Parliament were necessary to authorise construction. Canal proposals were put forward by financial investors interested in profiting from dividends, as well as industrial businesses that wanted to move their raw materials and finished goods. There was often out-and-out financial speculation. Speculators would try to buy shares in a newly floated company to sell them on for a profit, regardless of whether the canal was ever profitable, or even built. Rival canal companies were formed, and competition was rampant. For many years, a dispute about tolls meant that goods travelling through Birmingham had to be moved from boats in one canal to boats in the other. On the majority of British canals, the canal-owning companies did not own or run a fleet of boats, since the acts of Parliament setting them up usually prohibited this, in order to prevent monopolies developing. Instead, they charged private operators tolls to use the canal. These tolls were regulated by the acts. From the tolls the owners would try, with varying degrees of success, to maintain the canal, pay back initial loans and pay dividends to their shareholders.

===Railway competition and decline===
From about 1840, the railway network gained greater importance. With the transition from short-distance horse-drawn tramways to increasingly practical, powerful steam locomotives, trains could not only carry more than the canals, but could transport people and goods far more quickly than the walking pace of the canal boats. Most of the investment that had previously gone into canal building was diverted into railway building. By the second half of the 19th century, many canals were owned by railway companies or competing with them, and many were in decline, with decreases in mile-ton charges to try to remain competitive. After this, the less successful canals (particularly narrow-locked canals, whose boats could only carry about thirty tons) failed quickly. Faced with decline, there were at least two attempts by canal owners to convert their canal to a railway. This was vigorously opposed by competing rail interests, and so failed to gain the necessary acts of Parliament.

Canal companies could not compete against the speed of the new railways, and in order to survive, they had to slash their prices. This put an end to the huge profits that canal companies had enjoyed before the coming of the railways, and also had an effect on the boatmen who faced a drop in wages. Flyboat working (see § Boats below) virtually ceased, as it could not compete with the railways on speed and the boatmen found they could only afford to keep their families by taking them with them on the boats. This became standard practice across the canal system, often with families with several children living in tiny boat cabins, creating a considerable community of boat people. Though this community ostensibly had much in common with Gypsies, both communities strongly resisted any such comparison, and surviving boat people feel deeply insulted if described as &quot;water gypsies&quot;.

By the 1850s the railway system had become well established, and the amount of cargo carried on the canals had fallen by nearly two-thirds, lost mostly to railway competition. In many cases struggling canal companies were bought out by railway companies. Sometimes this was a tactical move by railway companies to gain ground in their competitors&#x27; territory, but sometimes canal companies were bought out either to close them down and remove competition, or to build a railway on the line of the canal. A notable example of this is the Croydon Canal. Some larger canal companies survived independently and continued to make profits. The canals survived through the 19th century largely by occupying the niches in the transport market that the railways had missed, or by supplying local markets such as the coal-hungry factories and mills of the big cities.

During the 19th century the canal systems of many European countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands were modernised and widened to take much larger boats. This did not happen on a large scale in the UK, mainly because of the power of the railway companies, who owned most of the canals and saw no reason to invest in a competing form of transport. The only significant exception to this was the modernisation carried out on the Grand Union Canal in the 1930s. Thus, almost uniquely in Europe, many of the UK&#x27;s canals remain as they have been since the 18th and 19th centuries: mostly operated with narrowboats. An exception to this stagnation was the Manchester Ship Canal, newly built in the 1890s using the existing River Irwell and River Mersey, to take ocean-going ships into the centre of Manchester via its neighbour Salford.

===Road competition and nationalisation===

The 20th century brought competition from road haulage, and the network declined further. In the 1920s and 1930s many canals in rural areas were abandoned due to falling traffic. The main network saw brief surges in use during World War I and World War II. Most of the canal system and inland waterways were nationalised in 1948 and came under the control of the British Transport Commission, whose subsidiary, the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, managed them into the 1950s. A report in 1955 by the British Transport Commission placed the canals into three categories according to their economic prospects: waterways to be developed, waterways to be retained, and waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation.

During the 1950s and 1960s freight transport on the canals declined rapidly in the face of mass road transport. Coal was still being delivered to waterside factories that had no other convenient access. But many factories that had formerly used coal either switched to using other fuels, often because of the Clean Air Act 1956, or closed completely.

This period was the most destructive for former waterways. The rise in road transport, and enthusiasm for development of new urban trunk roads and motorways, led to many routes being built over, such as parts of the Stroudwater Navigation for the M5, A38, A419, and Dr. Newton&#x27;s Way. Separately, old canal beds were used as landfill sites, destroyed by flood relief work on nearby rivers, or simply built over during the post-war housing boom.

Under the Transport Act 1962, the surviving canals were transferred in 1963 to the British Waterways Board (BWB), which later became British Waterways. In the same year the BWB decided to formally cease most of its narrowboat operations and transfer them to a private operator called Willow Wren Canal Transport Services. By then the canal network had shrunk to , half the size it was at its peak in the early 19th century. However, the basic network was still intact; many of the closures were of duplicate routes or branches. By the mid-1960s only a token traffic was left.

The Transport Act 1968 required the British Waterways Board to keep commercial waterways fit for commercial use, and cruising waterways fit for cruising. However, these obligations were subject to the caveat of being by the most economical means. There was no requirement to keep them in a navigable condition; they were to be treated in the most economic way possible, which could mean abandonment. British Waterways could also change the classification of an existing waterway. All or part of the canals could be transferred to local authorities; this allowed roads to be built over them, mitigating the need to build expensive bridges and aqueducts. The last regular long distance narrowboat commercial contract, transporting coal from Atherstone to the Kearley and Tonge jam factory at Southall in west London, ended in 1971. Lime juice continued to be carried between Brentford and Boxmoor until 1981. Substantial tonnages of aggregates were carried by narrowboat on the Grand Union Canal until 1996.

===Growth of the leisure industry===

The establishment in 1946 of a group called the Inland Waterways Association by L. T. C. Rolt and Robert Aickman helped revive interest in the UK&#x27;s canals to the point where they are a major leisure destination. In the 1960s the infant canal leisure industry was only just sufficient to prevent the closure of the remaining canals, but then the pressure to maintain canals for leisure purposes increased. Although out of commercial or leisure use, many canals survived because they formed part of local water supply and drainage networks. From the 1970s, increasing numbers of closed canals were restored by enthusiast volunteers.

The Canal and River Trust maintains a list of the sites it believes are the most important; it is called the Seven Wonders of the Waterways. The list includes:

* Standedge Tunnel, the longest, deepest, and highest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. 
* The Caen Hill Flight lock flight, one of the longest continuous lock flights in the country. 
* Barton Swing Aqueduct, the world&#x27;s only swinging aqueduct, on the Bridgewater canal. 
* The Anderton Boat Lift, the world&#x27;s first commercially successful boat lift and until the opening of the Falkirk Wheel the only boat lift in the United Kingdom. 
* Bingley Five Rise Locks, a staircase lock that is the steepest in the country. 
* Burnley Embankment, an innovative solution to a canal crossing a wide valley. 
* The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, the longest and highest aqueduct in the United Kingdom.

===Role in the slave trade===

During the Atlantic Slave Trade, some canals were also used to carry cotton, tobacco and sugar produced by slaves. Moses Benson, a Liverpool slaver, invested in the Lancaster Canal, which subsequently had a dramatic effect on the economy of Preston.

Other slavers like Lowbridge Bright sat on the board of Thames and Severn Canal Company. George Hyde Dyke was a shareholder in the Peak Forest Canal Company. William Carey owned shares in the Grand Junction Canal.

==Construction, features and maintenance==

Locks are the most common means of raising or lowering a boat from one water level to another. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber whose water-level can be changed. For reasons of economy and the constraints of 18th-century engineering technology, the early canals were built to a narrow width. The standard for the dimensions of narrow canal locks was set by Brindley with his first canal locks, those on the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1776. These locks were long by wide. The narrow width was perhaps chosen because he could only build Harecastle Tunnel to accommodate wide boats. His next locks were wider. He built locks long by wide when he extended the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn, where the canal&#x27;s only locks lowered boats to the River Mersey. The narrow locks on the Trent and Mersey limited the width (beam) of the boats (which came to be called &quot;narrowboats&quot;), and thus limited the quantity of the cargo they could carry to around thirty tonnes. This meant that in later years the canal network was economically uncompetitive for freight transport, and by the mid 20th century it was no longer possible to work a thirty-tonne load economically.

Where a large height difference has to be overcome, locks are built close together in a flight such as at Caen Hill Locks. Where the gradient is very steep, a set of staircase locks are sometimes used, like Bingley Five Rise Locks. At the other extreme stop locks have little or no change in level but were built to conserve water where one canal joined another. An interesting example is King&#x27;s Norton Stop Lock which was built with guillotine gates.
Canal aqueducts are structures that carry a canal across a valley, road, railway, or another canal. Dundas Aqueduct is built of stone in a classical style. Pontcysyllte Aqueduct is an iron trough on tall stone piers. Barton Swing Aqueduct opens to let ships pass underneath on the Manchester Ship Canal. Three Bridges, London is a clever arrangement allowing the routes of the Grand Junction Canal, a road, and a railway line to cross each other.

Boat lifts are mechanical elevators that raise a canal boat vertically in one motion, rather than being raised by a series of locks. Examples are the Anderton Boat Lift, Falkirk Wheel and Combe Hay Caisson Lock. Inclined planes raise a canal boat up a hill on a track, powered by a pulley mechanism. Examples are the Hay Inclined Plane, Foxton Inclined Plane and Worsley Underground Incline. Tunnels take canal boats horizontally through a rock formation. In winter, special icebreaker boats with reinforced hulls would be used to break the ice.

The engineers who designed and built the canals included: Henry Berry, James Brindley, James Dadford, John Dadford, Thomas Dadford, Thomas Dadford Jr., William Jessop, James Green, Sir Edward Leader Williams, Thomas Telford and John Rennie the Elder.

==Boats==
The boats used on canals were usually derived from local coasting or river craft, but on the narrow canals the narrowboat was the standard. Their length came from the boats used on the Mersey estuary, with their width of chosen as half that of existing boats. Packet boats carried packages up to in weight as well as passengers at relatively high speed day and night. To compete with railways, the flyboat was introduced, cargo-carrying boats working day and night. These boats were crewed by three men, who operated a watch system whereby two men worked while the other slept. Horses were changed regularly. When steam boats were introduced in the late nineteenth century, crews were enlarged to four. The boats were owned and operated by individual carriers, or by carrying companies who would pay the captain a wage depending on the distance travelled, and the amount of cargo.

Many different varieties of boats were used on the canals. They included cabin cruisers, fly-boats, Humber Keels, Mersey Flats, narrowboats, trows, sloops and tub boats.

==Restoration==

Waterway restoration organisations have returned many hundreds of miles of abandoned and remainder canals to use, and work is still ongoing to save many more. Many restoration projects have been led by local canal societies or trusts, who were initially formed to fight the closure of a remainder waterway or to save an abandoned canal from further decay. They now work with local authorities and landowners to protect historic routes or proposed future diversions from being built over, develop restoration plans, and secure funding. The physical work is sometimes done by contractors, sometimes by volunteers. In 1970 the Waterway Recovery Group was formed to co-ordinate volunteer efforts on canals and river navigations throughout the United Kingdom.

British Waterways began to see the economic and social potential of canalside development, and moved from hostility towards restoration, through neutrality, towards a supportive stance. While British Waterways was broadly supportive of restoration, its official policy was that it would not take on the support of newly restored navigations unless they came with a sufficient dowry to pay for their ongoing upkeep. In effect, this meant either reclassifying the Remainder Waterway as a Cruising Waterway or entering into an agreement for another body to maintain the waterway. Today the great majority of canals in England and Wales are managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust which, unlike its predecessor British Waterways, tries to have a more positive view of canal restoration and in some cases actively supports ongoing restoration projects such as the restoration projects on the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal and the Grantham Canal.

There has also been a movement to redevelop canals in inner city areas, such as Birmingham, Manchester, Salford and Sheffield, which have both numerous waterways and urban blight. In these cities, waterways redevelopment provides a focus for successful commercial/residential developments such as Gas Street Basin in Birmingham, Castlefield Basin and Salford Quays in Manchester, Victoria Quays in Sheffield. However, these developments are sometimes controversial. In 2005 environmentalists complained that housing developments on London&#x27;s waterways threatened the vitality of the canal system.

Restoration projects by volunteer-led groups continue. There is now a substantial network of interconnecting, fully navigable canals across the country. In places, serious plans are in progress by the Environment Agency and the Canal &amp; River Trust, for building new canals to expand the network, link isolated sections, and create new leisure opportunities for navigating &quot;canal rings&quot;, for example the Fens Waterways Link and the Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway. The Rochdale Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Droitwich Canals have all been restored to navigation since 2000.

==Geographic locations==

The bulk of the canal system was built in the industrial Midlands and the north of England, where navigable rivers most needed extending and connecting, and heavy cargoes of manufactured goods, raw materials or coal most needed carrying. The great manufacturing cities of Manchester and Birmingham were major economic drivers. Most of the traffic on the canal network was internal. However, the network linked with coastal port cities such as London, Liverpool, and Bristol, where cargo could be exchanged with seagoing ships for import and export. In the 19th century, Manchester&#x27;s merchants became dissatisfied with the poor service and high charges offered by the Liverpool docks, and the near-monopoly of the railways. They decided to bypass the Liverpool monopoly on coastal trade by converting a section of the Irwell into the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, turning Manchester into an inland port in its own right.

The industrial revolution saw Yorkshire towns and cities such as Leeds, Sheffield and Bradford develop large textile and coal mining industries, which required an efficient transport system. As early as the late 17th century, the Aire and Calder and Calder and Hebble navigations had been canalised, allowing navigation from Leeds to the Humber Estuary, whereas the River Don Navigation connected Sheffield to the Humber. Later in the 18th century, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was constructed, creating an east–west link, giving access to the port at Liverpool allowing export of finished goods.

London has a port, and as early as 1790 this was linked to the national network via the River Thames and the Oxford Canal. A more direct route between London and the national canal network, the Grand Junction Canal, opened in 1805. Relatively few canals were built in London itself.

South West England had several east–west cross-country canals, which connected the River Thames to the River Severn and the River Avon, allowing the cities of Bristol and Bath to be connected to London. These were the Thames and Severn Canal which linked to the Stroudwater Navigation, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Wilts and Berks Canal, which linked to these three rivers.

Within Scotland, the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union Canal connected the major cities in the industrial Central Belt; they also provide a short cut for boats to cross between the west and the east without a sea voyage. The Caledonian Canal provided a similar function in the Highlands of Scotland.

<text>Alois Maxwell &quot;Al&quot; Hirt (November 7, 1922 – April 27, 1999) was an American trumpeter and bandleader. He is best remembered for his million-selling recordings of &quot;Java&quot; and the accompanying album &quot;Honey in the Horn&quot; (1963), and for the theme music to &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. His nicknames included &quot;Jumbo&quot; and &quot;The Round Mound of Sound&quot;. Colin Escott, an author of musician biographies, wrote that RCA Victor, for which Hirt had recorded most of his best-selling recordings and for which he had spent most of his professional recording career, had simply dubbed him &quot;The King.&quot; Hirt was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in November 2009. He received eight Grammy nominations during his lifetime, including winning the Grammy award in 1964 for his version of &quot;Java&quot;.

==Biography==
Hirt was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of a police officer. At the age of six, he was given his first trumpet, which had been purchased at a local pawnshop. He played in the Junior Police Band with friend Roy Fernandez, the son of Alcide Nunez; by the age of 16, Hirt was playing professionally, often with his friend Pete Fountain, while attending Jesuit High School. During this time, he was hired to play at the local horse racing track, beginning a six-decade connection to the sport.

In 1940, Hirt went to Cincinnati, Ohio, to study at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music with Dr. Frank Simon (a former soloist with the John Philip Sousa Orchestra). After a stint as a bugler in the United States Army during World War II, Hirt performed with various swing big bands, including those of Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Ina Ray Hutton.

In 1950, Hirt became first trumpet and featured soloist with Horace Heidt&#x27;s Orchestra. After spending several years on the road with Heidt, Hirt returned to New Orleans working with various Dixieland groups and leading his own bands. Despite Hirt&#x27;s statement years later &quot;I&#x27;m not a jazz trumpeter and never was a jazz trumpeter&quot;, he made a few recordings where he demonstrated his ability to play in that style, during the 1950s with bandleader Monk Hazel, and a few other recordings on the local Southland Records label.

Hirt&#x27;s virtuoso dexterity and fine tone on his instrument soon attracted the attention of major record labels and he signed with RCA Victor. Hirt posted twenty-two albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the 1950s and 1960s. The albums &quot;Honey in the Horn&quot; and &quot;Cotton Candy&quot; were both in the Top 10 best sellers for 1964, the same year Hirt scored a hit single with his cover of Allen Toussaint&#x27;s tune &quot;Java&quot; (Billboard No. 4), and later won a Grammy Award for the same recording. Both &quot;Honey in the Horn&quot; and &quot;Java&quot; sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold discs.

Hirt&#x27;s Top 40 charted hit &quot;Sugar Lips&quot; in 1964 would be later used as the theme song for the NBC daytime game show &quot;Eye Guess&quot;, hosted by Bill Cullen and originally airing from January 1966 to September 1969. Hirt was chosen to record the frenetic theme for the 1960s TV show &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, by famed arranger and composer Billy May. Based on Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; from his opera &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;, it showcased Hirt&#x27;s technical prowess. In 2003, the recording again gained public attention when it was featured in the film &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.

From the mid-1950s to early 1960s, Hirt and his band played nightly at Dan&#x27;s Pier 600 at the corner of St. Louis and Bourbon Street. The nightclub was owned by his business manager, Dan Levy, Sr.
Hirt opened his own club on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, which he owned from 1962 to 1983. He also became a minority owner in the NFL expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967.

In 1962, in an effort to showcase him in a different musical setting, Hirt was teamed with arranger and composer Billy May and RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes to record an album titled &quot;Horn a Plenty&quot; that was a departure from the Dixieland material that he was generally associated with. Covering an eclectic variety of popular, standard and show tunes, it featured a big-band supplemented by timpani, French horns and harp. He also appeared opposite Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette in the 1962 motion picture, &quot;Rome Adventure&quot;.
In 1965, Hirt hosted the hour-long television variety series &quot;Fanfare&quot;, which aired Saturday nights on CBS as the summer replacement for &quot;Jackie Gleason and the American Scene Magazine&quot;.

Hirt starred along with Marguerite Piazza, Lionel Hampton, Doc Severinsen and the Southern University marching band at Super Bowl IV halftime show on January 11 1970.

On February 8, 1970, while performing in a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, Hirt was injured while riding on a float. It was widely reported that he was struck in the mouth by a thrown brick or a piece of concrete and required 12 stitches to the underside of his upper lip. Factual documentation of the details of the incident is sparse, consisting primarily of claims made by Hirt after the incident although police reported that the 1970 Mardi Gras was one of the worst for trouble, with hundreds arrested for drunkenness and violence. Whatever the actual cause of his injuries, Hirt underwent surgery and made a return to the club scene. This incident was parodied in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit from their second season Mardi Gras special, the &quot;Let&#x27;s Hit Al Hirt in the Mouth with a Brick Contest&quot;.

In 1987, Hirt played a solo rendition of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; for Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to New Orleans. He is referred to in the 1987 film &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;, in a broadcast made by Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby).

Hirt died of liver failure at the age of 76, after having spent the previous year in a wheelchair due to edema in his leg. He was survived by his wife, Beverly Essel Hirt, and eight children from a previous marriage.

<doc id="192723" wikidata="Q3818060" url="?curid=192723" title="The Mind's I">
<text>The Mind&#x27;s I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul is a 1981 collection of essays and other texts about the nature of the mind and the self, edited with commentary by philosophers Douglas R. Hofstadter and Daniel C. Dennett. The texts range from early philosophical and fictional musings on a subject that could seemingly only be examined in the realm of thought, to works from the twentieth century where the nature of the self became a viable topic for scientific study.

==Summary==

The book&#x27;s chapters are each made up of a previously published work by authors such as Jorge Luis Borges, Alan Turing, Richard Dawkins, Raymond Smullyan, John Searle, Stanisław Lem, Thomas Nagel (as well as Hofstadter and Dennett themselves), each followed up by a commentary by Hofstadter and/or Dennett. Dennett and Hofstadter both support the idea that we can learn much about human minds and souls by exploring human mentality in terms of information processing. Dennett and Hofstadter are both proponents of the idea that the wonders of human mentality can be accounted for by mechanical brain processes—which leaves nothing theoretical to prevent us from building human-like mental processes into our mechanical devices. A few views that run counter to this notion, such as John Searle&#x27;s widely known presentation of the Chinese room argument, are included in this book mainly as targets for refutation.

The book is divided into six sections, each focusing on a particular aspect of the problem of self.

===Part I===
Part I, &quot;A Sense of Self&quot;, begins with two works of fiction that challenge the notions of self and identity (including the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s &quot;Borges and I&quot;), provoking the reader to think more closely about just what is meant by &quot;self&quot;. It closes with an essay by Harold J. Morowitz on the reductionist view of the mind.

===Part II===
Part II, entitled &quot;Soul Searching&quot;, takes on the idea of soul—that spark which separates thinking beings from unthinking machines. Included here is Alan Turing&#x27;s famous article from 1950, in which he proposes an operational test—popularly known as the &quot;Turing test&quot;—for machine intelligence, judged successful if a machine can use human language well enough to pass as human. This goal was distant at the time. A dialogue of Hofstadter&#x27;s own picks up the idea of the Turing test and spins a thought-provoking scenario from it.

Two chapters excerpted from &quot;The Soul of Anna Klane&quot;, a novel by Terrel Miedaner, end the section. Hofstadter interprets them in accordance with his own atheistic beliefs, without acknowledgment of Miedaner&#x27;s opposite intent, which used them to support alternative ideas about the nature of mind and soul.

===Part III===
The formation of mind from elements individually incapable of thought is the central theme of Part III, &quot;From Hardware to Software&quot;. The evolution of the mind toward its current state is addressed in the first two reprinted works. Following that is a reprint of &quot;Prelude... Ant Fugue&quot; from Hofstadter&#x27;s Pulitzer-winning book, &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach,&quot; in which he builds up the metaphor of the mind as anthill: each individual part with only rudimentary function, coming together to be more than the sum of its parts.

===Part IV===
Part IV explores its titular issue, &quot;Mind as Program&quot;. What is the self: the mind, or the body? Can they be separated? Can the location of the consciousness be separate from one&#x27;s physical location. In that case, where are you, really? Dennett&#x27;s fantastical account of being separated from his brain and David Sanford&#x27;s response tackle these issues. In this section the mind is considered as software: as patterns of thought and action, as separate from the physical body housing it as a piece of software is from the machine it runs on.

===Part V===
Part V, &quot;Created Selves and Free Will&quot;, includes John Searle&#x27;s notorious &quot;Minds, Brains, and Programs&quot; (originally an article published in &quot;The Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot;, 1980), which states: &quot;...mental processes are computational processes over formally defined elements.&quot; Searle has objections to the idea that computer programs might ever produce mind, but the idea that mentality involves computation can be traced through the history of Western philosophy where it has long been explored in the context of trying to explain human reason in terms of formal logical systems. A dramatic and famous rejection of the formal systems idea was that of Ludwig Wittgenstein, a philosopher whom Dennett respects. After first embracing the idea of reducing everything to logical atoms (&quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;), Wittgenstein later rejected the idea that human language games should be formulated as formal systems (&quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;). However, many philosophers and artificial intelligence researchers remain captivated by the formal systems approach. For example, Dennett has tried to help the MIT Cog project develop formal computer programming methods towards the goal of producing human-like intelligence. In his book &quot;Contemporary Philosophy of Mind&quot;, Georges Rey provides an example of continuing attempts to express human intelligence in machines through computational processes over formally defined elements. An alternative but minority approach has grown out of the work of people like Gerald Edelman and his student Olaf Sporns through which it is suggested that machine intelligence can most efficiently be achieved by creating autonomous robotic systems that can learn the way human children learn through interacting with their environment.

===Part VI===
The book closes with &quot;The Inner Eye&quot;, a collection of short pieces on the subjective nature of experience. How can one describe what it is like to be a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know what it is like to be another self? For that matter, what can we know about what it is like to be ourselves? Hofstadter and Dennett&#x27;s commentary suggest that self-knowledge is elusive, to say nothing of the experience of other minds.

==Reception==
Historian of psychology Jeremy Burman, while calling &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; &quot;a wonderful book&quot;, described it as popularizing a non-metaphorical reading of Richard Dawkins&#x27; proposals regarding memes, leading to widespread misunderstanding (in the form of memetics) and the reification of the original idea-as-replicator metaphor.

Neuropsychologist Nicholas Humphrey, writing in The London Review of Books gave &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; a mixed review, stating &quot;People who like this kind of thing will undoubtedly find this book the kind of thing they like. Counting myself among them, I would reckon &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; cheap at twice the price.&quot; However, he criticized the emphasis the book places on paradoxes, stating &quot;Paradoxes are fun; they can be illuminating. But we should be wary of the temptation to celebrate paradoxes as a royal road to some higher level of reality.&quot;

Professor of philosophy William Barrett, writing in The New York Times gave &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot; a mixed review. He stated that the book represented a &quot;welcome sign of change&quot; from the prevailing attitudes in philosophy which emphasized the objective over the subjective but stated that &quot;for all its stimulation, I found the book rather confusing, and even confused, in its effect&quot;, criticizing Hofstadter&#x27;s contributions in particular. Dennett later wrote a letter to the New York Times defending Hofstadter and calling Barrett&#x27;s stance &quot;preposterous&quot;.

<text>James Keir Baxter (29 June 1926 – 22 October 1972) was a New Zealand poet and playwright. He was also known as an activist for the preservation of Māori culture. He is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most well-known and controversial literary figures. He was a prolific writer who produced numerous poems, plays and articles in his short life, and was regarded as the preeminent writer of his generation. He suffered from alcoholism until the late 1950s. He converted to Catholicism and established a controversial commune at Jerusalem, New Zealand, in 1969. He was married to writer Jacquie Sturm.

==Early life==
Baxter was born in Dunedin as the second son to Archibald Baxter and Millicent Brown and grew up near Brighton, 20 km south of Dunedin city. He was named after James Keir Hardie, a founder of the British Labour Party.

Baxter&#x27;s father had been a conscientious objector during World War I, and both his parents were active pacifists and socialists. His mother had studied Latin, French and German at the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Sydney, the University of Sydney and Newnham College, University of Cambridge. Baxter and his brother were not baptised, although their mother read to them sometimes from the Bible. On his first day of school at Brighton Primary School (now Big Rock Primary School), Baxter burned his hand on a stove and later used this incident to represent the failure of institutional education.

In 1936, when Baxter was ten, the family moved to Wanganui where he and his brother attended St Johns Hill School, and the following year they moved to England and attended Sibford School in the Cotswolds. Both schools were Quaker schools and boarding schools. In 1938 the family returned to New Zealand. Baxter said of his early life that he felt a gap between himself and other people, &quot;increased considerably by the fact that I was born in New Zealand, and grew up there till I was nine, and then attended an English boarding school for a couple of years, and came back to New Zealand at thirteen, in the first flush of puberty, quite out of touch with my childhood companions and uncertain whether I was an Englishman or a New Zealander&quot;.

Baxter began writing poetry at the age of seven, and he accumulated a large body of technically accomplished work both before and during his teenage years.

In 1940, Baxter began attending King&#x27;s High School, Dunedin, where he was bullied, because of his differences to other students (in personality, voice and background), his lack of interest in team sports and his family&#x27;s pacifism. His older brother, Terence, was a conscientious objector like their father and was detained in military camps between 1941 and 1945 for his refusal to fight in World War II. Between 1942 and 1946, Baxter drafted around 600 poems, saying later in life that his experiences as a teenager were painful but &quot;created a gap in which the poems were able to grow&quot;.

In 1943, Baxter&#x27;s final year of high school, he wrote to a friend that he was considering becoming a lawyer, but was &quot;not decided on it&quot;: &quot;If I should find it possible to live by writing I would gladly do so. Yet many men have thought they could, and found it an illusion.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Early literary career===

In March 1944, at age seventeen, Baxter enrolled at the University of Otago. That same year, he published his first collection of poetry, &quot;Beyond the Palisade&quot;, to much critical acclaim. Allen Curnow selected six poems from the collection for 1945 collection &quot;A Book of New Zealand Verse 1923–1945&quot;, and described Baxter&#x27;s poems as &quot;a new occurrence in New Zealand: strong in impulse and confident in invention, with qualities of youth in verse which we have lacked&quot;. In this year, Baxter also won the Macmillan Brown Prize for his poem &quot;Convoys&quot;. The prize was coincidentally named after his Scottish maternal grandfather, John Macmillan Brown.

Baxter&#x27;s work during this time was, as with his contemporary compatriots, most notably the experimental novelist Janet Frame, largely influenced by the modernist works of Dylan Thomas. He was a member of the so-called &quot;Wellington Group&quot; of writers that also included Louis Johnson, W.H. Oliver and Alistair Te Ariki Campbell. Baxter typically wrote short lyrical poems or cycles of the same rather than longer poems.

After his eighteenth birthday on 29 June 1944, like his father and brother, Baxter registered as a conscientious objector, citing &quot;religious and humanitarian&quot; grounds. The authorities did not pursue him however due to the late stage of the war.

Baxter failed to complete his course work at the University of Otago due to increasing alcoholism, and was forced to take a range of odd jobs from 1945–7. He fictionalised these experiences in his only novel &quot;Horse&quot;, published posthumously in 1985. It was during this time that he had his first significant relationship, with a young medical student, but the relationship ended due to his alcoholism. He wrote the collection of poems &quot;Cold Spring&quot; about this early failed relationship, but it was not published until after his death in 1996. In 1947 he met Jacquie Sturm, a young Māori student, who would later become his wife.

In late 1947, Baxter moved to Christchurch where he continued working odd jobs. Although he did not enrol at the University of Canterbury he became the literary editor of its student magazine, &quot;Canta&quot;, and attended some lectures. His behaviour could be erratic due to his alcoholism. His second collection, &quot;Blow, Wind of Fruitfulness&quot; was published in 1948, and its themes included the New Zealand landscape and solitude. Curnow, in a review, described Baxter as &quot;the most original of New Zealand poets now living&quot;.

===Marriage and later career===
In 1948 Baxter married Jacquie Sturm at St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Napier, and his developing interest in Christianity culminated in his joining the Anglican church and being baptised during that same year. They moved to Wellington and in February 1951 Baxter enrolled at Wellington Teachers&#x27; College. In 1952 Baxter&#x27;s poems were published in a collaborative volume, &quot;Poems Unpleasant&quot;, alongside poems from Louis Johnson and Anton Vogt. He completed his teaching course in December 1952, and subsequently published his third major collection of poems, &quot;The Fallen House&quot;. In 1954 he was appointed assistant master at Epuni School, Lower Hutt, and it was here that he wrote a series of children&#x27;s poems published later as &quot;The Tree House, and Other Poems for Children&quot; (1974).

Baxter and his wife had a daughter, Hilary, in 1949, and a son, John, in 1952.

In late 1954, Baxter joined Alcoholics Anonymous, successfully achieving sobriety, and in 1955, he finally graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Victoria University College. He had also received a substantial inheritance from a great-aunt in 1955 and was able to purchase a house for the family in Ngaio, Wellington. He left Epuni School early in 1956 to write and edit primary school bulletins for the Department of Education&#x27;s School Publications Branch. This period is likely to have influenced his later writing which criticised bureaucracy.

In 1957 Baxter took a course in Roman Catholicism and his collection of poems &quot;In Fires of No Return&quot;, published in 1958 by Oxford University Press, was influenced by his new faith. This was his first work to be published internationally, though it was not critically well-received. Through the late 50s and 60s Baxter visited the Southern Star Abbey, a Cistercian monastery at Kopua near Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay. Baxter admitted however in a letter to a friend that his conversion was &quot;just one more event in a series of injuries, alcoholism, and gross mistakes&quot;.

Baxter and Sturm separated in October 1957. While it has been reported that their separation was due to Baxter&#x27;s wife, a committed Anglican, having been dismayed by his conversion to Catholicism, their great-grandson Jack McDonald has stated that it was in fact “a loss of trust, which was only in part a result of his secretly taking instruction as a Catholic.”

Later in 1958, Baxter received a UNESCO stipend to study educational publishing and began an extended journey through Asia, and especially India, where Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s university Shantiniketan was one of the inspirations for Baxter&#x27;s later community at Jerusalem, New Zealand. In India he was reconciled with his wife and contracted dysentery. His writing after returning from India was more overtly critical of New Zealand society, evident in the collection &quot;Howrah Bridge and Other Poems&quot; (1961). He was particularly concerned about the displacement of Māori within the country.

In the late 1950s and 1960s Baxter became a powerful and prolific writer of both poems and drama, and it was through his 1958 radio play &quot;Jack Winter&#x27;s Dream&quot; that he became internationally known. The play was produced by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service for radio, and in 1978 was adapted for the screen by New Zealand filmmaker David Sims.

The first half of the 1960s also saw, however, Baxter struggling to make ends meet on a postman&#x27;s wage, having resigned from the Department of Education in 1963 and refused to take work as a schoolmaster. He also controversially criticised &quot;The Penguin Book of New Zealand Verse&quot;, an anthology published by his former champion Allen Curnow, for under-representing younger New Zealand poets. However, in 1966 Baxter&#x27;s critically acclaimed collection of poems &quot;Pig Island Letters&quot; was published in which his writing found a new level of clarity. In 1966, Baxter took up the Robert Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago, which eased the money worries for a time. He held the fellowship for two years during which time he participated in protests against the Vietnam War. During the fellowship he also had a number of his plays staged at the Globe Theatre by Dunedin director Patric Carey.

===Jerusalem===
In 1968 Baxter claimed in a letter to his friend John Weir that he had been instructed in a dream to &quot;Go to Jerusalem&quot;. Jerusalem, New Zealand was a small Māori settlement (known by its Māori transliteration, Hiruhārama) on the Wanganui River. He left his university position and a job composing catechetical material for the Catholic Education Board, with nothing but a bible. This was the culmination of a short period in which he struggled with family life and his vocation as a poet.

While planning his move to Jerusalem, in early 1969, Baxter spent some time in Grafton, Auckland where he set up a drop-in centre for drug addicts, acting on the same principles as Alcoholics Anonymous. Around this time, Baxter worked for three weeks as a cleaner at Chelsea Sugar Refinery, which inspired the poem &quot;Ballad of the Stonegut Sugar Works&quot;. He had been referred to the job by poet Hone Tuwhare. He also adopted the Māori version of his name, Hemi.

Around July or August 1969, Baxter travelled to Jerusalem, which according to John Weir was at that time &quot;a tiny Māori settlement – it had a marae, a resident priest, a church, a convent, resident nuns and some abandoned dwellings.&quot; Baxter stayed in a cottage owned by the Sisters of Compassion, and obtained permission for a long stay from the mother general of the sisters. He proceeded to form a commune structured around &quot;spiritual aspects of Māori communal life&quot;. It was a place where he felt he could embody both his Catholic faith and his interest in Māori culture. He lived a sparse and isolated existence and made frequent trips to the nearby cities where he worked with the poor and spoke out against what he perceived as a social order that sanctions poverty. His poems of this time, published in his final collections &quot;Jerusalem Sonnets&quot; (1970) and &quot;Autumn Testament&quot; (1972), have a conversational style but speak strongly of his social and political convictions.

The commune&#x27;s popularity grew, in part due to an article in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspaper in June 1970, and by mid-1970 around 25 people were living in the community. The population increased to 40 permanent residents by May 1971, mostly aged between 16 and 25, living in three abandoned houses, and the number of visitors was estimated by Baxter at about a thousand over the year. The five goals Baxter devised for the commune were: &quot;To share one&#x27;s goods; To speak the truth, not hiding one&#x27;s heart from others; To love one another and show it by the embrace; To take no job where one has to lick the boss&#x27;s arse; To learn from the Maori side of the fence&quot;. He was, however, reluctant to impose any kind of rules or work roster.

The increased numbers of residents and visitors, and the lack of order and regulation, led to growing concern from the Sisters of Compassion and Wanganui District Council, and opposition from local residents, particularly the local Māori iwi, Ngāti Hau. Baxter himself was often absent from the commune participating in protests or other social work. In September 1971, the commune was disbanded under pressure from the Council and local farmers. Baxter returned to live in Wellington, but in February 1972 was permitted to return to Jerusalem provided that only 10 people would be allowed to live on the land at any one time.

===Final years and death===

The harsh deprivations Baxter adopted at this time took their toll on his health. By 1972 he was too ill to continue living at Jerusalem and moved to another commune near Auckland. On 16 October Baxter visited his long-time friend the artist Michael Illingworth and wrote his last poem on the Illingworth’s dining room table before leaving on the 19th. Three days later on 22 October 1972 Baxter suffered a coronary thrombosis in the street and died in a nearby house, aged 46. He was buried at Jerusalem on Māori land in front of &quot;the Top House&quot; where he had lived, in a ceremony combining Māori and Catholic traditions. A river boulder on the burial site was inscribed with his Māori name Hemi.

Sturm was Baxter&#x27;s literary executor after his death. She collected and catalogued his prolific writing, arranged new and revised publications of his work, and negotiated the use and adaptation of his works. She set up the James K. Baxter Charitable Trust, which supported causes he had supported, for example prison reform and drug addiction rehabilitation programmes, and ensured that all proceeds of his work went to the trust.

==Evidence and allegations of sexual assault==
In January 2019, the Victoria University Press published a collection of Baxter&#x27;s personal letters as &quot;James K Baxter: Letters of a Poet&quot;. The collection was edited by his friend, John Weir. One letter in the collection revealed that in 1960, Baxter confided to another woman that he raped his wife, Jacquie Sturm, after she expressed low interest in sex. New Zealanders reacted with dismay to the revelations, describing them as &quot;awful&quot;, &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot;. In &quot;The Spinoff&quot; John Newton wrote that it is no longer possible to talk about Baxter without addressing how Baxter thinks and writes about women.

Paul Millar, a Baxter scholar and personal friend of Sturm, who had been appointed as her literary executor after her death, cautioned against reading the letter as turning Sturm into a victim: &quot;Leaving apart how appalling this letter is – a betrayal on so many levels from the brutal act described, the lack of shame in the description, and the profound betrayal of trust – its publicity is once again putting Jacquie in a subordinate position to Baxter, a bit player in his narrative. ... Jacquie deserves much more than to be remembered as Baxter’s victim ... despite everything she endured, she emerged victorious. If people really want to know Jacquie they should seek our her writing, not Baxter&#x27;s.&quot; Mark Williams, emeritus Professor of English at Victoria University, said the admission was consistent with what he knew of Baxter: &quot;He observed his own adulteries objectively as part of the fallen human condition. This even extended to marital rape. I’m not sure if he was simply a phoney, as some have observed. He was genuinely religious. The problem is that his religious faith allowed him to regard his sexual failings—small and great—at a quizzical remove.&quot;

Baxter and Sturm&#x27;s great-grandson, Jack McDonald, wrote that the account was &quot;sickening&quot; and that he believed his great-grandmother &quot;would never have wanted these brutal details made public&quot;. He also noted that she never received sufficient credit for connecting Baxter to the Māori world: &quot;The reality is that Nana had introduced Baxter to everything he knew about Māoritanga&quot;.

An allegation of attempted rape followed when, in April 2019, the New Zealand news outlet &quot;Stuff&quot; published an account by Rosalind Lewis (Ros), who had been at the Jerusalem commune in 1970 when she was aged 18 years. Ros described an &quot;attempted rape&quot;, which would have succeeded were it not for Baxter&#x27;s erectile dysfunction. She mentioned a friend of hers, &quot;Angela&quot;, who had told Ros that she was permitted to watch him flagellate himself (a variety of religious penance), and that she, Angela, knew of two other women who she claims were sexually abused. No charges were pressed at the time by the women. Lewis said: &quot;This truth needs to sit alongside Baxter&#x27;s literary achievements. It must be fully acknowledged and never glossed over. This is for the sake of women such as myself and for those who may not be able to find a voice as I have. As ever, in celebrating the genius of Baxter the artist, we cannot overlook the evils of Baxter the human being.&quot;

==Critical reception and legacy==
Criticism of Baxter&#x27;s poetry has generally focussed on his incorporation of European myths into his New Zealand poems, his interest in Māori culture and language, and the significance of his religious experiences and conversion to Roman Catholicism. New Zealand poet laureate Vincent O&#x27;Sullivan wrote in 1976 that Baxter is an inherently New Zealand poet: &quot;that is the proportion of Baxter&#x27;s achievement – the most complete delineation yet of a New Zealand mind. The poetic record of its shaping is as original an act as anything we have.&quot; A common theme in Baxter&#x27;s extensive body of writing was strong criticism of New Zealand society. His biographer Paul Millar said: &quot;If, at times, Baxter appears to evaluate New Zealand society harshly, his judgements are always from the perspective of one intimately involved in the social process.&quot;

Baxter&#x27;s use of te reo Māori has inspired both praise and criticism. W.H. Oliver described it as &quot;often a cosmetic device, or worse, an earnest affectation&quot;. By contrast, John Newton noted that at least some Māori welcomed Baxter&#x27;s engagement with their language and culture, and John Weir regards his use as &quot;a genuine attempt at using a bicultural language in this country when no other Pākehā was doing so&quot;.

In his critical study &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, Michael Schmidt claimed that Baxter was &quot;one of the most precocious poets of the century&quot; whose neglect outside of New Zealand is baffling. In Schmidt&#x27;s view, Baxter&#x27;s writing was affected by his alcoholism. Schmidt also commented on Baxter&#x27;s influences, noting that his work drew upon Dylan Thomas and W. B. Yeats; then on Louis MacNeice and Robert Lowell. Michael Schmidt identified &quot;an amalgam of Hopkins, Thomas and native atavisms&quot; in Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Prelude N.Z.&quot;.

The critic Martin Seymour-Smith ranked Baxter above Robert Lowell (&quot;Baxter knew all about narcissism and vanity, and is a much superior poet&quot;), and defended Baxter&#x27;s high reputation on the grounds of his spiritual and intellectual seeking: &quot;Baxter&#x27;s energy and sheer intelligence, his refusal to give way to mean cerebral impulses or to give up his terrible struggle with himself, are sufficient to justify his high position in New Zealand poetry&quot;. On the other hand, Smith said that Baxter &quot;remained, disappointingly, over-intoxicated with his own energy, and never convincingly manifested qualities of restraint to balance it.&quot;

A number of Baxter&#x27;s poems were written in the ballad form, and Baxter has been described by critics as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s principal lyricist&quot;. A number of Baxter&#x27;s works have since been translated into music by New Zealand musicians. In 2000, a collection of songs written to Baxter&#x27;s poems was released, titled &quot;Baxter&quot;, and featuring some of New Zealand&#x27;s most well-known musicians: for example Dave Dobbyn, Martin Phillipps, Emma Paki, Greg Johnson, David Downes and Mahinārangi Tocker. It was devised by New Zealand singer-songwriter Charlotte Yates.

<doc id="192727" wikidata="Q1970348" url="?curid=192727" title="Luck">
<text>Luck is the phenomenon and belief that defines the experience of improbable events, especially improbably positive or negative ones. The naturalistic interpretation is that positive and negative events may happen at any time, both due to random and non-random natural and artificial processes, and that even improbable events can happen by random chance. In this view, the epithet &quot;lucky&quot; or &quot;unlucky&quot; is a descriptive label that refers to an event&#x27;s positivity, negativity, or improbability.

Supernatural interpretations of luck consider it to be an attribute of a person or object, or the result of a favorable or unfavorable view of a deity upon a person. These interpretations often &quot;prescribe&quot; how luckiness or unluckiness can be obtained, such as by carrying a lucky charm or offering sacrifices or prayers to a deity. Saying someone is &quot;born lucky&quot; may hold different meanings, depending on the interpretation: it could simply mean that they have been born into a good family or circumstance; or that they habitually experience improbably positive events, due to some inherent property, or due to the lifelong favor of a god or goddess in a monotheistic or polytheistic religion.

Many superstitions are related to luck, though these are often specific to a given culture or set of related cultures, and sometimes contradictory. For example, lucky symbols include the number 7 in Christian-influenced cultures and the number 8 in Chinese-influenced cultures. Unlucky symbols and events include entering and leaving a house by different doors or breaking a mirror in Greek culture, throwing rocks into a whirlwind in Navajo culture, and ravens in Western culture. Some of these associations may derive from related facts or desires. For example, in Western culture opening an umbrella indoors might be considered unlucky partly because it could poke someone in the eye, whereas shaking hands with a chimney sweep might be considered lucky partly because it is a kind but unpleasant thing to do given the dirty nature of their work. In Chinese and Japanese culture, the association of the number 4 as a homophone with the word for death may explain why it is considered unlucky. Extremely complicated and sometimes contradictory systems for prescribing auspicious and inauspicious times and arrangements of things have been devised, for example feng shui in Chinese culture and systems of astrology in various cultures around the world.

Many polytheistic religions have specific gods or goddesses that are associated with luck, both good and bad, including Fortuna and Felicitas in the Ancient Roman religion (the former related to the words &quot;fortunate&quot; and &quot;unfortunate&quot; in English), Dedun in Nubian religion, the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology, mythical American serviceman John Frum in Polynesian cargo cults, and the inauspicious Alakshmi in Hinduism.

==Etymology and definition==
The English noun &quot;luck&quot; appears comparatively late, during the 1480s, as a loan from Low German, Dutch or Frisian &quot;luk&quot;, a short form of &quot;gelucke&quot; (Middle High German &quot;gelücke&quot;). Compare to old Slavic word &quot;lukyj&quot; (&quot;лукый&quot;) - &quot;appointed by destiny&quot; and old Russian &quot;luchaj&quot; (&quot;лучаи&quot;) - &quot;destiny, fortune&quot;. It likely entered English as a gambling term, and the context of gambling remains detectable in the word&#x27;s connotations; luck is a way of understanding a personal chance event. Luck has three aspects:
* Luck is good or bad.
* Luck is the result of chance.
* Luck applies to a sentient being.

Before the adoption of &quot;luck&quot; at the end of the Middle Ages, Old English and Middle English expressed the notion of &quot;good fortune&quot; with the word &quot;speed&quot; (Middle English &quot;spede&quot;, Old English &quot;spēd&quot;); &quot;speed&quot; besides &quot;good fortune&quot; had the wider meaning of &quot;prosperity, profit, &quot;; it is not associated with the notion of probability or chance but rather with that of fate or divine help; a bestower of success can also be called &quot;speed&quot;, as in &quot;Christ be our speed&quot; (William Robertson, &quot;Phraseologia generalis&quot;, 1693).

The notion of probability was expressed by the Latin loanword &quot;chance&quot;, adopted in Middle English from the late 13th century, literally describing an outcome as a &quot;falling&quot; (as it were of dice), via Old French &quot;cheance&quot; from Late Latin &quot;cadentia&quot; &quot;falling&quot;. Fortuna, the Roman goddess of fate or luck, was popular as an allegory in medieval times, and even though it was not strictly reconcilable with Christian theology, it became popular in learned circles of the High Middle Ages to portray her as a servant of God in distributing success or failure in a characteristically &quot;fickle&quot; or unpredictable way, thus introducing the notion of &quot;chance&quot;.

==Interpretations==
Luck is interpreted and understood in many different ways.

===Lack of control===
Luck refers to that which happens to a person beyond that person&#x27;s control. This view incorporates phenomena that are chance happenings, a person&#x27;s place of birth for example, but where there is no uncertainty involved, or where the uncertainty is irrelevant. Within this framework, one can differentiate between three different types of luck:
# Constitutional luck, that is, luck with factors that cannot be changed. Place of birth and genetic constitution are typical examples.
# Circumstantial luck—with factors that are haphazardly brought on. Accidents and epidemics are typical examples.
# Ignorance luck, that is, luck with factors one does not know about. Examples can be identified only in hindsight.

Circumstantial luck with accidental happenstance of favorable discoveries and/or inventions is serendipity.

===Fallacy===
Another view holds that &quot;luck is probability taken personally.&quot; A rationalist approach to luck includes the application of the rules of probability and an avoidance of unscientific beliefs. The rationalist thinks that the belief in luck is a result of poor reasoning or wishful thinking. To a rationalist, a believer in luck who asserts that something has influenced his or her luck commits the &quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot; logical fallacy: that because two events are connected sequentially, they are connected causally as well. In general, this fallacy is that:
#A luck-attracting event or action happens;
#Then a positive outcome happens;
#Therefore, the event or action influenced the outcome.

More contemporary authors writing on the subject believe that the definition of good destiny is: One who enjoys good health; has the physical and mental capabilities of achieving his goals in life; has good appearance, and; has happiness in mind and is not prone to accidents.

In the rationalist perspective, probability is only affected by confirmed causal connections.

The gambler&#x27;s fallacy and inverse gambler&#x27;s fallacy both explain some reasoning problems in common beliefs in luck. They involve denying the unpredictability of random events: &quot;I haven&#x27;t rolled a seven all week, so I&#x27;ll definitely roll one tonight&quot;.

Philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote that &quot;luck is &quot;mere&quot; luck&quot; rather than a property of a person or thing.

===Essence===

There is also a series of spiritual, or supernatural beliefs regarding fortune. These beliefs vary widely from one to another, but most agree that luck can be influenced through spiritual means by performing certain rituals or by avoiding certain circumstances.

Luck can also be a belief in an organization of fortunate and unfortunate events. Luck is a form of superstition which is interpreted differently by different individuals. Carl Jung coined the term synchronicity, which he described as &quot;a meaningful coincidence&quot;.

Abrahamic religions believe God controls future events; belief in luck or fate is criticised in :

Belief in the extent of Divine Providence varies; most acknowledge providence as at least a partial, if not complete influence on luck. Christianity, in its early development, accommodated many traditional practices which at different times, accepted omens and practiced forms of ritual sacrifice in order to divine the will of their supreme being or to influence divine favoritism. The concepts of &quot;Divine Grace&quot; or &quot;Blessing&quot; as they are described by believers closely resemble what is referred to as &quot;luck&quot; by others.

Mesoamerican religions, such as the Aztecs, Mayans and Incas, had particularly strong beliefs regarding the relationship between rituals and the gods, which could in a similar sense to Abrahamic religions be called luck or providence. In these cultures, human sacrifice (both of willing volunteers and captured enemies), as well as self-sacrifice by means of bloodletting, could possibly be seen as a way to propitiate the gods and earn favor for the city offering the sacrifice. An alternative interpretation would be that the sacrificial blood was considered as a necessary element for the gods to maintain the proper working order of the universe, in the same way that oil would be applied to an automobile to keep it working as designed.

Many traditional African practices, such as voodoo and hoodoo, have a strong belief in superstition. Some of these religions include a belief that third parties can influence an individual&#x27;s luck. Shamans and witches are both respected and feared, based on their ability to cause good or bad fortune for those in villages near them.

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===
Some evidence supports the idea that belief in luck acts like a placebo, producing positive thinking and improving people&#x27;s responses to events.

In personality psychology, people reliably differ from each other depending on four key aspects: beliefs in luck, rejection of luck, being lucky, and being unlucky. People who believe in good luck are more optimistic, more satisfied with their lives, and have better moods. People who believe they are personally unlucky experience more anxiety, and less likely to take advantage of unexpected opportunities. One 2010 study found that golfers who were told they were using a &quot;lucky ball&quot; performed better than those who were not.

Some people intentionally put themselves in situations that increase the chances of a serendipitous encounter, such as socializing with people who work in different fields.

==Social aspects==
===Games===

The philosopher Nicholas Rescher has proposed that the luck of someone&#x27;s result in a situation of uncertainty is measured by the difference between this party&#x27;s yield and expectation: λ = Y - E. Thus skill enhances expectation and reduces luck. The extent to which different games will depend on luck, rather than skill or effort, varies considerably. For example, chess does not involve any random factors (beyond the determination of which player moves first), while the outcome of Snakes and Ladders is entirely based on random dice rolls. In poker, especially games with a communal board, pure luck may decide a winning hand. Luck in games involving chance is defined as the change in a player&#x27;s equity after a random event such as a die roll or card draw. Luck is positive (good luck) if the player&#x27;s position is improved and negative (bad luck) if it is worsened. A poker player who is doing well (playing successfully, winning) is said to be &quot;running good&quot;.

Almost all sports contain elements of luck. A statistical analysis in the book &quot;The Success Equation&quot; attempted to elucidate the differing balance between skill and luck with respect to how teams finished in the major North American sports leagues. This analysis concluded that, on a luck-skill continuum, the NBA had the most skill-dependant result while that of the NHL was most luck-dependant.

===Lotteries===

A defining feature of a lottery is that winners are selected purely by chance. Marketing and other discussions regarding lotteries often mention luck but tend to underplay the actual prospects of winning, which are usually millions to one against.

===Means of resolving issues===
&quot;Leaving it to chance&quot; is sometimes a way of resolving issues for example, where there are two possible outcomes, flipping a coin may determine the outcome. This practice has gone on for thousands of years, a common contemporary example is the coin toss at the start of a sporting event which may determine who goes first.

===Numerology===
Most cultures consider some numbers to be lucky or unlucky. This is found to be particularly strong in Asian cultures, where the obtaining of &quot;lucky&quot; telephone numbers, automobile license plate numbers, and household addresses (such as those which contain the digit 6 or 8) are actively sought, sometimes at great monetary expense.

Numerology, as it relates to luck, is closer to an art than to a science, yet numerologists, astrologists or psychics may disagree. It is interrelated to astrology, and to some degree to parapsychology and spirituality and is based on converting virtually anything material into a pure number, using that number in an attempt to detect something meaningful about reality, and trying to predict or calculate the future based on lucky numbers. Numerology is folkloric by nature and started when humans first learned to count. Through human history it was, and still is, practiced by many cultures of the world from traditional fortune-telling to on-line psychic reading. Dudley describes numerology as, &quot;the delusion that numbers have power over events.&quot;

===Science===
Different thinkers like Thomas Kuhn have discussed the role of chance in scientific discoveries.
Richard Wiseman did a ten-year scientific study into the nature of luck that has revealed that, to a large extent, people make their own good and bad fortune. His research revealed that &quot;Lucky people generate their own good fortune via four basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, making lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, creating self-fulfilling prophecies via positive expectations, and adopting a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.&quot; Researchers have suggested that good luck and good mood often co-occur (Duong &amp; Ohtsuka, 2000) and that people who believe themselves to be lucky are often comparatively happy and optimistic whereas people who believe themselves to be unlucky may feel comparatively anxious and depressed (Day &amp; Maltby, 2003; Wiseman, 2003). Luck can also correlate with superstitious behaviors that increase opportunities of good fortune occurring like avoiding walking under ladders or blowing left and right for safe travels before crossing train tracks, which inadvertently increases your chances of seeing an oncoming train.

Although previous studies have explored the antecedents and consequences of luck using attribution theory (e. g., Fischoff,
1976; Weiner et al., 1987), personality variables (Darke &amp; Freedman, 1997a;b), and more recently a cognitive priming approach (DeMarree et al., 2005; Kramer &amp; Block, 2008) research on the underlying mechanism of how luck influences consumer judgment and behavior has been noticeably absent in the extant literature. Moreover, in much of this previous work, luck is manipulated in a way that is very likely to elicit positive affect as well. Thus, it is difficult to articulate whether the observed effects of luck are due to chronic beliefs about luck, temporary changes in how lucky people feel, or because of changes caused by the positive affect that is experienced. Their research showed that priming participants subliminally with luck-related stimuli made them feel luckier and happier. It was also found that the effects of priming luck using subliminal messages increased participants&#x27; estimates of the likelihood of favorable events, their participation in lotteries, the amount of money they invested in relatively risky financial options and these effects appeared to be mediated by temporary changes in perceptions of luck rather than by affect.

==In religion and mythology==

===Buddhism===
Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, taught his followers not to believe in luck. He taught that all things which happen must have a cause, either material or spiritual, and do not occur due to luck, chance or fate. The idea of moral causality, karma (Pali: kamma), is central in Buddhism. In the Sutta Nipata, the Buddha is recorded as having said the following about selling luck:
Whereas some religious men, while living of food provided by the faithful make their living by such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood as palmistry, divining by signs, interpreting dreams ... bringing good or bad luck ... invoking the goodness of luck ... picking the lucky site for a building, the monk Gautama refrains from such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood. D.I, 9–12

Belief in luck is prevalent in many predominantly Buddhist countries. In Thailand, Buddhists may wear verses (takrut) or lucky amulets which have been blessed by monks for protection against harm.

===Christianity and Judaism===
The book of Proverbs 16:33 states that &quot;the lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord&quot;. Ecclesiastes 9:11 states (in a passage that describes events with different outcomes - e.g. a race, a battle, the gaining of wealth and favour) that &quot;time and chance happeneth to them all&quot;. Whilst the latter passage from Ecclesiastes suggests no things in human affairs are certain, the extract from Proverbs indicates that the outcome of something as apparently random as the rolling of dice or the tossing of a coin remains subject to God&#x27;s will or sovereignty. In his book &quot;God, Chance and Purpose: Can God have it both ways?&quot;, Bartholomew argues that chance is part of God&#x27;s creation but that not even God can accurately predict what chance will do.

God&#x27;s sovereignty involves two aspects. God&#x27;s active will or sovereignty would involve something God causes to happen such as the leading of wicked King Ahab into battle (2 Chronicles 18:18-19). Ahab&#x27;s death was not merely the result of a randomly shot arrow, but as 2 Chronicles 18 reveals, God actively directed the events that led Ahab into battle and used that randomly shot arrow to accomplish his intended will for Ahab that day.

God&#x27;s passive will involves God allowing, rather than causing, something to happen. Chapter 1 of the book of Job illustrates this in what God allowed Satan to do in the life of Job. It is also involved in the evil that God allowed Joseph&#x27;s brothers to do to Joseph in order to accomplish a greater good, a good not apparent to Joseph until years later (Genesis 50:20).

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism the Bhagavad-Gita values &quot;Purushartha&quot; more than mere Luck or Fate.

The Gita says; &quot;Set thy heart upon selfless performance of thy natural duty (Svakarma, Svadharma), but never on its reward. Work not for a reward; but never cease to do thy work&quot; (Gita, 2.47).

There are five causes of all actions as given in the Samkhya wisdom; says Gita—

&quot;The physical body (adhisthana), the lower &#x27;I am&#x27; (karta), the means of perception (karanam), the varied multiple efforts (vividhasch pruthak cheshta) and the Cosmic Wheel of Action (daivam), these five sources together are responsible for success or failure of any action&quot; ( Gita, 18 . 14–15 ).

Here the word &quot;daivam&quot; does not mean luck, fate, fortune, providence, or destiny. None of these English words are the exact synonym for the Sanskrit word &quot;Daivam&quot; here. &quot;Daivam&quot; is the Cosmic Wheel of Action (Kshara-gati, Apara-Prakriti, Maya) that keeps the perfect account of our past and present actions.

A man who says &quot;Nothing is impossible for me; I am the only hero of all these achievements; who else is there like me?&quot; He is a man of clouded vision and he does not see the Truth.

===Islam===
The definition which is much closer to the concept of luck in Islam is &quot;a force that brings good fortune or adversity&quot; Quran 17:13: &quot;And (for) every man We have fastened to him his fate (fortune) in his neck, and We will bring forth for him (on the) Day (of) the Resurrection a record which he will find wide open&quot;. A very long discussion continues on how this prefixed destiny, fortune or luck defines attitudes and living behavior and so as to how much amends one can make in this predetermined fate by one&#x27;s own contribution through positive actions in accordance with the teachings of Islam. 
There is no concept of luck in Islam other than actions determined by Allah based on the merit of the choice made by human beings. It is stated in the Qur&#x27;an (Sura: Adh-Dhariyat (The Winds that Scatter) verse:22) that one&#x27;s sustenance is pre-determined in heaven when the Lord says: &quot;And in the heaven is your provision and that which ye are promised.&quot; One should supplicate to Allah to better one&#x27;s life rather than hold faith in un-Islamic acts such as using &quot;lucky charms&quot;. In the Arabic language there is a word which directly means &quot;luck&quot;, which is &#x27;, and a related word for &quot;lucky&quot;, &#x27;. It is also forbidden to believe in luck or anything else related to luck, as it is classified as &quot;shirk&quot; (associating partners to Allah or giving any share of any attribution which belongs to Allah and Allah alone).

The Tunisians retain some native beliefs of Berber origin such as the evil eye. A number of practices, such as shutters painted blue are also used to repel evil spirits.

==Belief measurement==
Darke and Freedman (1997) were the first researchers systematically to address directly both the concept and the measurement of belief in luck as a deterministic and personal attribute. They define luck belief as the perception that good luck is &quot;a somewhat stable characteristic that consistently favors some people but not others&quot;. They define disbelief in luck as &quot;a tendency to agree with the rational view of luck as random and unreliable&quot; (p. 490). To capture their unidimensional definition of irrational luck belief, Darke and Freedman developed a 12-item measure. Unfortunately, they found their measure &quot;does not seem particularly good at distinguishing between people who [say] they [are] typically lucky from those who [say] they [are] typically unlucky&quot;. They also found factor analyses of their measure produced a multi-component solution, as did Prendergast and Thompson (2008).

André (2006) proposed a model of luck-related perceptions that includes separate positive and negative beliefs. She found the positive and negative components of personal luck beliefs correlate highly, suggesting they are conceptually very close or in fact the same. Maltby et al. (2008) proposed a six-dimensional model of beliefs around luck, but empirical analyses supported only a four-dimensional model: belief in being personally lucky; belief in being personally unlucky; general belief in luck; and rejection of belief in luck.
Thompson and Prendergast (2013) clarified the concepts of belief in luck and belief in personal luckiness. They addressed the logical problem that nobody who disbelieves in luck could consider themselves lucky by differentiating between belief in luck as a deterministic phenomenon that affects the future, on one hand, and on the other, belief in personal luckiness as an appraisal of how fortunately or otherwise chance events in the past might have turned out. They developed and validated an internationally applicable scale to measure, respectively, belief in luck and personal luckiness constructs. They found no correlation between the constructs and no evidence of a distinction between positive and negative aspects of each, suggesting they represent two discrete and unidimensional constructs. Belief in luck and personal luckiness were also found to correlate differently with personality and psychological variables, such as the Big Five and affect.

<text>The Times Literary Supplement (TLS) is a weekly literary review published in London by News UK, a subsidiary of News Corp.

==History==
The &quot;TLS&quot; first appeared in 1902 as a supplement to &quot;The Times&quot; but became a separate publication in 1914. Many distinguished writers have contributed, including T. S. Eliot, Henry James and Virginia Woolf. Reviews were normally anonymous until 1974, when signed reviews were gradually introduced during the editorship of John Gross. This aroused great controversy. &quot;Anonymity had once been appropriate when it was a general rule at other publications, but it had ceased to be so&quot;, Gross said. &quot;In addition I personally felt that reviewers ought to take responsibility for their opinions.&quot;

Martin Amis was a member of the editorial staff early in his career. Philip Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Aubade&quot;, his final poetic work, was first published in the Christmas-week issue of the &quot;TLS&quot; in 1977. While it has long been regarded as one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent critical publications, its history is not without gaffes: it missed James Joyce entirely, and commented only negatively on Lucian Freud from 1945 until 1978, when a portrait of his appeared on the cover.

Its editorial offices are based in The News Building, London. It is edited by Martin Ivens, who succeeded Stig Abell in June 2020.

The &quot;TLS&quot; has included essays, reviews and poems by D. M. Thomas, John Ashbery, Italo Calvino, Patricia Highsmith, Milan Kundera, Philip Larkin, Mario Vargas Llosa, Joseph Brodsky, Gore Vidal, Orhan Pamuk, Geoffrey Hill and Seamus Heaney, among others.

Many writers have described the publication as indispensable. Mario Vargas Llosa, novelist and the 2010 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, described the &quot;TLS&quot; as &quot;the most serious, authoritative, witty, diverse and stimulating cultural publication in all the five languages I speak&quot;.

<doc id="192733" wikidata="Q1054157" url="?curid=192733" title="Cog (project)">
<text>Cog was a project at the Humanoid Robotics Group of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was based on the hypothesis that human-level intelligence requires gaining experience from interacting with humans, like human infants do. This in turn required many interactions with humans over a long period. Because Cog&#x27;s behavior responded to what humans would consider appropriate and socially salient environmental stimuli, the robot was expected to act more human. This behavior also provided the robot with a better context for deciphering and imitating human behavior. This was intended to allow the robot to learn socially, as humans do.

As of 2003, all development of the project had ceased.

Today Cog is retired to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology museum.

== Principal investigators ==
*Rodney Brooks
*Lynn Andrea Stein

== Purpose ==
*To study theories of cognitive science and artificial intelligence (AI).

== Goals ==
*To design and fabricate a humanoid face for each robot that fosters suitable social contact between robots and humans.
*To create a robot which is capable of interacting with humans and objects in a human-like way.
*To develop a relatively general system by which Cog can learn causal relations between commands to its motors and input from its sensors (primarily vision and mechanical proprioception).
*To shift the robot aesthetic to a design language that utilizes strong curvilinear and organic forms through state of the art design processes and materials.

== Research and advancements ==

*Development of a human-like face for Cog (complete).
*Obtaining major degrees of motor freedom in trunk (complete), head (complete), arms (complete), legs, and a flexible spine.
*Sight (through video cameras that respond to movement; complete).
*Hearing, touch, vocalization system, and hands.
*Allowing Cog to learn how its own movements alter its sensory inputs.
*Forcing Cog to take energy efficiency into account during movements.

== Justification ==
One motivation for making humanoid robots can be understood in the book &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot; by Mark Johnson and George Lakoff. They argue that the contents of human thoughts are to some degree dependent on the physical structure of our brains. By constructing artificial intelligence systems that have structural features similar to those of humans, we may be more likely to achieve human-like functionality.

Another motivation for building humanoid robotic systems is that a machine with a human-like form may have more human-like interactions with people. This could be particularly important for an artificial intelligence device to learn from people in the way that human children learn through interactions within a social group.

Marvin Minsky criticized the project, that Cog should be built as a software simulation, &quot;because robotics research is really a software problem&quot;.

==Media appearances==
Cog appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; in a segment drumming with They Might Be Giants titled &quot;Dan vs. Cog&quot;.

Cog appeared in the &quot;Understanding&quot; television series episode &quot;The Senses&quot;.

Cog appeared in Sherry Turkle&#x27;s book Alone Together

Cog&#x27;s earliest popular science appearance was the 1994 &quot;Bringing Up RoboBaby&quot; published in Wired and authored by David H. Freedman. As confirmed in the original project proposal by Brooks and Stein, Freedman reports AI consciousness was part of the original goal.

<text>Sir William George Cusins (14 October 183331 August 1893) was an English pianist, violinist, organist, conductor and composer.

==Biography==
Born in London, Cusins entered the Chapel Royal in his tenth year and studied music in Brussels under François-Joseph Fétis and later at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London, under Cipriani Potter, William Sterndale Bennett, Charles Lucas and Prosper Sainton.

He toured widely, in England, Leipzig, Berlin and other places, as a concert pianist and as a composer. He was appointed organist to Queen Victoria&#x27;s private chapel. He also played the violin in various orchestras in London. In 1851 he became assistant professor at the RAM, and later full professor. In 1867 he succeeded Sterndale Bennett as conductor of the Philharmonic Society and remained in this post until 1883.

He was appointed Master of the Queen&#x27;s Musick by Queen Victoria in 1870, succeeding George Frederick Anderson, who had retired. He was knighted on 5 August 1892 (the only Master to be knighted during his term of office) and received the Cross of Isabella the Catholic in 1893. 

He died at Remonchamps, Ardennes, France on 31 August 1893, of influenza, and was buried at Kensal Green, London. 

==Works==
Sir William Cusins produced editions of the piano music of Robert Schumann. Among his works as a composer are &quot;Royal Wedding Serenata&quot; (1863), concert overture &quot;Les Travailleurs de la mer&quot; (1869), the oratorio &quot;Gideon&quot; (produced Gloucester, 1871), overture to William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (1875), Piano Concerto in A minor, marches and songs.

<text>Sir Walter Parratt (10 February 184127 March 1924) was an English organist and composer.

==Biography==
Born in Huddersfield, son of a parish organist, Parratt began to play the pipe organ from an early age, and held posts as an organist while still a child. He was a child prodigy: on one occasion he played Bach&#x27;s complete &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; by heart, without notice, at age ten.

From 1854 to 1861 he was an organist at St Paul&#x27;s Church in his native town and, as successor to John Stainer, in 1872 at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he remained for ten years. From 1882 he held the post of organist of St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. He became Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University in 1908, taking over from Hubert Parry.

He became one of the foremost organ teachers of his day, with many important posts in Britain being filled by his students. He was president of the Royal College of Organists from 1905 to 1909.

Parratt was also a distinguished chess player, and was able to simultaneously play chess and a complex organ piece—at first sight. He served for a few months as president of the Oxford University Chess Club and for two years was captain of the eight chosen to play against Cambridge.
He died at Windsor Castle on 27 March 1924.

==Honours==
He was knighted in 1892. In 1893 he was appointed Master of the Queen&#x27;s Musick to Queen Victoria, and afterward held the same office under Kings Edward VII and George V.

Later honours included: Member (MVO, 1901), Commander (CVO, 1917), and Knight Commander (KCVO, 1921) of the Royal Victorian Order.

After Parratt&#x27;s death in 1924 a monument to him was erected in the grounds of Huddersfield Parish Church. There is also a monument to him in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, next to the entrance to King George VI Memorial Chapel where King George VI and the Queen Mother, and Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh are buried.

<doc id="192740" wikidata="Q18915287" url="?curid=192740" title="Block voting">
<text>Block or bloc voting refers to a class of electoral systems where multiple candidates are elected simultaneously. They do not guarantee minority representation and allow a group of voters (a voting bloc) to ensure that only their preferred candidates are elected. In these systems, a voter can select as many candidates as there are open seats. That is, the voter has as many votes to cast as the number of seats to fill. The block voting systems are among various election systems available for use in multi-member districts where the voting system allows for the selection of multiple winners at once. 

Block voting falls under the multiple non-transferable vote category, a term often used interchangeably with this term. Block voting may be also associated with the concept of winner-take-all representation in multi-winner electoral systems or the plurality election method.

Other variations of block voting include block approval voting, and party block voting (sometimes called a general ticket). Block voting is often contrasted with proportional representation, where the aim is to ensure that each voter&#x27;s vote carries equal weight. In contrast, block voting tends to favor the most popular party, resulting in a landslide victory.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;plurality at-large&quot; is common in representative elections where members represent an entire body (such as a city, state, province, or nation). In multi-member electoral districts, the system is often referred to as &quot;block voting&quot; or the &quot;bloc vote.&quot; This article&#x27;s description of block voting specifically pertains to &quot;unlimited voting,&quot; unlike &quot;limited voting,&quot; where voters have fewer votes than the available seats. The term &quot;block voting&quot; may also refer to a simple plurality election of slates (electoral lists) in multi-member districts.

== Types of block voting ==
Multiple winners are typically elected simultaneously in one non-transferable round of voting. In some cases, multiple non-transferable voting (MNTV) appears in a runoff or two-round version, as seen in certain local elections in France, where candidates without an absolute majority are thinned out before a second round. 

=== Plurality block voting ===

In a block voting election, all candidates compete for &quot;m&quot; positions, often referred to as the district magnitude. Each voter selects up to &quot;m&quot; candidates on the ballot. The &quot;m&quot; candidates with the most votes, but not necessarily a majority, are elected and fill the positions.

=== Two-round block voting ===
Two-round block voting is a variation of plurality-at-large where the field of candidates is thinned out before a second round.

=== General ticket / Party block voting ===

Party block voting (PBV) or the general ticket is the party-list version of block voting. In contrast to the classic block vote, where candidates may stand as non-partisan and some minority nominations can theoretically succeed, PBV associates each candidate with a party list voted on by electors, often leading to a landslide outcome. The Parliament of Singapore uses this system for most of its elections.

=== Approval block voting ===
Block approval voting permits every voter to vote for any number of candidates, provided that they do not vote more than once for the same candidate. Block voting, specifically plurality block voting, is compared with preferential block voting as both often produce landslide victories for similar candidates. Instead of checkboxes, preferential block voting utilizes a preferential ballot, making it a multiple &quot;transferable&quot; vote rather than a multiple &quot;non-transferable&quot; vote. Under both systems, a slate of the top preferred candidate and their clones typically secures every available seat.

=== Preferential block voting ===

Block voting, or plurality block voting, is often compared with preferential block voting as both systems tend to produce landslide victories for similar candidates. Instead of a series of checkboxes, preferential block voting uses a preferential ballot. A slate of clones of the top preferred candidate will win every seat under both systems, however in preferential block voting this is instead the instant-runoff winner.

== Similar voting systems ==

=== Limited voting (LV) / Partial block voting ===

Partial block voting, also known as limited voting, operates similarly to plurality-at-large voting. However, in partial block voting, each voter casts fewer votes than the number of candidates to be elected. This process enables reasonably sized minorities to achieve some representation, preventing a simple plurality from sweeping every seat. Partial bloc voting is employed in elections to the Gibraltar Parliament, allowing each voter ten votes for seventeen open seats. The typical outcome sees the most popular party winning ten seats and forming the ruling administration. In contrast, the second-most popular party secures seven seats to form the opposition. The Spanish Senate also adopts partial block voting, offering four seats per constituency, with each voter casting three votes. Historically, three- and four-member constituencies in the United Kingdom used partial block voting until the abolition of multimember constituencies.

With fewer votes per voter, the threshold to win decreases under partial block voting, making the results more akin to proportional representation, provided voters and candidates use effective strategies.

== Examples of voting systems ==

=== Plurality block voting and majority block voting ===
Consider a scenario with 12 candidates in a 3-member district among 10,000 voters. Both plurality block voting and majority block voting allow voters to cast three votes (although they need not use all three) but restrict voting to one vote per candidate.

Party A garners roughly 35% support among the electorate, Party B secures around 25%, and the remaining voters mainly support independent candidates but lean toward Party B if compelled to choose between the two parties. Assuming all voters cast their votes sincerely and avoid tactical voting, the following tabulation elucidates the outcomes:
In the second round, voters of independent candidates can vote for candidates of party B. As even fewer voters cast all their 3 votes, even in the second round, some winners do technically win with a majority, but only a plurality in fact (similar to differences between turnout levels in two-round voting).

=== Block voting and approval block voting ===
A 3-member district with 10,000 voters features 12 candidates. Block voting allows each voter to cast only one vote for a single candidate.

* Under &quot;unlimited&quot; block &quot;approval&quot; voting, voters can select any number of candidates.
* Under &quot;limited&quot; block approval voting, voters can cast up to six votes, twice the number of winners.
* Under &quot;plurality&quot; block voting, voters can cast up to three votes, though it&#x27;s not mandatory.
* Under &quot;limited&quot; (block) voting, voters can cast a maximum of two votes.
* Under the single non-transferable vote (which is not block voting), voters can cast only one vote.

Party A has an approximate 35% electorate support, notably due to one well-received candidate. Party B holds around 25% backing, comprising two popular candidates. The remaining voters primarily favor independent candidates, but tend to lean towards Party B if pressed to choose between the two main parties. All voters engage in sincere voting with no tactical influence.
* Under the single non-transferable vote, the three most popular candidates based on voters&#x27; initial preferences are elected, irrespective of party affiliation.
* In limited voting, it is probable that the party with a plurality secures two seats (reflecting the number of votes each voter has), while the minority party gains the remaining seats.
* Plurality block voting generally results in the party with the most support winning all available seats.
* Limited block approval voting allows independent candidates&#x27; supporters to use their additional votes to assist candidates other than their top three choices, possibly leading to a reversal of the outcome observed in plurality block voting.
* Block approval voting permits any popular party-affiliated or independent candidates to be elected, but it&#x27;s plausible that nearly half of the population might not have a representative elected.

<doc id="192741" wikidata="Q3568956" url="?curid=192741" title="William Shield">
<text>William Shield (5 March 1748 – 25 January 1829) was an English composer, violinist and violist. His music earned the respect of Haydn and Beethoven.

==Life and musical career==
Shield was born in Swalwell near Gateshead, County Durham, the son of William Shield and his wife, Mary, née Cash. He was first taught music by his father but, after both he and his mother died while Shield was still a child, he was apprenticed to a shipbuilder in South Shields, continuing however to study music with Charles Avison in Newcastle upon Tyne.

He became a noted violinist in Newcastle&#x27;s subscription concerts before moving to Scarborough to lead a theatre orchestra. In 1772, he was appointed by Felice Giardini to play violin in the opera at Covent Garden (now the Royal Opera House), and from 1773 he was principal violist there. In 1778 he provided the music for the comic opera &quot;The Flitch of Bacon&quot; to a libretto by Henry Bate.

On 21 February 1776 he was in Durham, where he attended the meeting of the city&#x27;s masonic lodge at the &quot;Marquis of Granby&quot; tavern. The lodge Minutes indicate that he was by this date already a member of the &quot;St. John&#x27;s&quot; lodge in Newcastle. He later also became a member of the Sunderland &quot;Phoenix&quot; lodge No.94 and The Sea Captain&#x27;s Lodge (later to become Palatine Lodge No.97), where he was admitted as a joining member on 14 June 1792. Details of the frequency of Shield&#x27;s attendance at these north-east lodges is not yet clear, but can only have been occasional, given his career in London.

Shield also worked as a composer for Covent Garden and, in that capacity, he met Joseph Haydn. In 1817, he was appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Musick. Like Haydn and Beethoven, not to mention several other composers of his time, Shield was a great plunderer of folk tunes (in his case mostly from his native Northumbria).

Shield&#x27;s compositions include a large number of operas and other stage works. These included one on &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1784), text by Macnally, as well as instrumental music, but he is principally known for his English light opera &quot;Rosina&quot; (1781). It was intended to be used as a light afterpiece to a more &quot;serious&quot; work sung in Italian. Such works were common at the time, although &quot;Rosina&quot; is the only one that has survived in the form of a complete score.

&quot;Rosina&quot; has a number of features associated with later English comic opera, and even modern musical comedy – including the use of English, spoken dialogue, lightness of theme, and the use of folk and popular medodies. At least to that degree, it may be regarded as one of the ancestors of the musical, and Shield as one of the first composers of musicals.

==Death and subsequent historical problems==

William Shield died on Sunday 25 January 1829 (the date celebrated as Robbie Burns Day) at his house at 31 Berners Street, London. His will (dated 29 June 1826) left his worldly goods and a glowing testimonial &quot;to my beloved partner, Ann, Mrs. Shield&quot;.

Victorian chroniclers skirted round the problem, but when the will was proved on 6 March 1829 the estate was claimed by, &quot;Ann Stokes, alias Shield, Spinster, belonging to Marleybone&quot;.

His favourite violin was given to King George IV, who insisted that the full value be given to Ann. Within six months she also sold his library of music, but nothing more is known of her.

Shield is buried in the same grave as Johann Peter Salomon in the floor of the south cloisters of Westminster Abbey. Surprisingly, it seems no marker of any kind was put in place at the time to show where he lay. There was quite a search made near the centenary of his death and eventually a small marble tablet was put as near the grave as could be ascertained.

John &#x27;Mad Jack&#x27; Fuller commissioned sculptor Peter Rouw (1771–1852), of Portland Lane, London, to create a memorial to mark the grave of his friend William Shield in Westminster Abbey. Dr Ireland, Dean of the Abbey, is said to have refused permission for the tablet to be installed as he took objection to the word &quot;gentleman&quot; being used in its text. Fuller subsequently had the tablet installed at his home church, St Thomas à Becket, Brightling, Sussex where it remains. A medallion portrait of William Shield in profile is accompanied by this inscription: 
&quot;Sacred to the memory of / WILLIAM SHIELD esquire / master of His Majesty&#x27;s band of music / who died January 25th 1829 / aged 80 years / and is buried in Westminster Abbey / This gentleman&#x27;s name[,] independent / of his high character and virtues / in private life[,] has a claim to be enroll&#x27;d / amongst the most eminent musical / composers that have hitherto prov&#x27;d / an ornament to the British nation / John Fuller of Rose Hill Esq, DDD&quot;. It is presumed that the words, &quot;and is buried in Westminster Abbey&quot; were inserted. DDD is an abbreviation for the Latin &quot;Dat, Dicat, Dedicat&quot; which can be translated to &quot;Gives, Devotes and Dedicates&quot;.

A memorial cross was erected to honour Shield in 1891 at Whickham Church, his native parish. 

Near it is the oldest Shield grave. &quot;Here lieth Peter Shield and Mary his wife, mother and children. Dep this life April Ye 8th 1747.&quot; 

In December 2009, Gateshead Council erected a memorial to William Shield in Swalwell, Gateshead. It is close to the place where he was born, now a garage carrying out MOTs. In addition there is a room named the William Shield Room at the Gateshead Dryden Centre, home of the Gateshead Schools Music Service. The Gateshead Youth Orchestra regularly performs music by Shield, including the overtures to &quot;Rosina&quot; and &quot;The Travellers in Switzerland&quot;.

==The &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; controversy==
The most recent revival of the &quot;Shield wrote Auld Lang Syne&quot; story seems to date from 1998, when John Treherne, Gateshead&#x27;s Head of Schools&#x27; Music Service, uncovered an original edition of the opera &quot;Rosina&quot; in the Gateshead Public Library, while he was looking for new works for the town&#x27;s youth orchestra. &quot;I thought it was appropriate to look at the work of a Gateshead-born composer. I picked out &quot;Rosina&quot; by Shield,&quot; Treherne said. &quot;I started to copy out the score and hummed the tune as I was writing it down. I was coming to the end when I realised the tune floating through my head was Auld Lang Syne.&quot;

Ballad operas generally quoted well known tunes, and in this case the tune is certainly much older. A fine and elaborate setting of an older tune with this name &quot;For Old Lang Syne, by Mr. Beck&quot;, with variation appears in the Balcarres Lute Book, from Scotland. Here attributions such as &quot;By Mr. Beck&quot; are generally used to indicate the composer of the setting, not the underlying tune. This book was compiled around 1700, it has remained in the possession of the same family since its compilation, and it is now held by the National Library of Scotland. As variation sets are generally composed on recognisable tunes, this is very probably older still. A later appearance of this old tune, was published by William McGibbon, who died in 1756. While both of these settings are on the earlier tune, the opening bars are immediately recognisable. Probably the first printed appearances of the modern tune are first, Shield&#x27;s use of it in &quot;Rosina&quot;. In the final allegro, what is essentially the modern form of the tune appears on the oboe; as this section contains Scotch snap rhythms, with a drone accompaniment on bassoon &#x27;in imitation of bagpipes&#x27;, it may well be that the use of this melody by Shield is also a quotation. Shield does not claim it as his own, as he does with some of the song tunes in the opera. &quot;Rosina&quot; premiered at the end of 1782. In 1784, Niel Gow published it, as &quot;Sir Alexander Don&#x27;s Strathpey&quot;, in his &quot;Collection of Strathspey Reels&quot;. Like Shield, Gow does not claim to have composed it; it is closely related to older strathspeys such as &quot;Coming Through the Rye&quot;, and &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.

== The William Shield Festival ==
A festival ran by Community Music Whickham &amp; Swalwell is held each year with concerts promoting the music of Shield, his contemporaries and community music. A performance of one of Shield’s operas has been given annually since inception. To date these include Rosina, The Woodman, The Farmer, The Poor Soldier and Robin Hood all performed by Rocket Opera and the William Shield Festival Orchestra, led by Bradley Creswick, conducted by John Treherne.

<text>Wordplay (born Tao Rogers-Wright, 11 November 1984) is a musician and actor of mixed British and Black African descent. 

==Early life==
Wordplay was born Tao Rogers-Wright in the south of London, where he grew up with his mother until their eventual move to the west of the city in the mid-90s. He appeared in advertising campaigns for Going Live! and Mr Blobby, television shows like &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and international films such as &quot;Dandi Dust&quot;.

In mid-2002, he met Lowkey, the UK rapper responsible for underground classics such as &quot;The Mad World Remix&quot; and the &quot;Key to the Game&quot; trilogy. With Lowkey&#x27;s influence, Wordplay began taking a more professional approach to the music industry.

==Career==
===Acting===
Wordplay gained worldwide exposure as an actor in 1998 through the Austrian Obscuro Gothic science fiction film &quot;Dandy Dust&quot; directed by Hans Scheirl. 

Wordplay is a member of the National Youth Theatre (associated actors include Sir Ben Kingsley, Sir Derek Jacobi, and Dame Helen Mirren). He has appeared in productions including &quot;The Deptford Tales&quot;.

===Music===
Wordplay has been a recording artist since 2006, described by britishhiphop.co.uk as being &quot;...among the absolute zenith of British MCs that are carrying more than their fair weight of intellect and integrity that keeps this scene rolling. Well recognised for his work with rapper Lowkey; Wordplay matches lyrical flow with mental faculty, conscious content with brilliant beats. A favourite all over the scene, and a reminder of the essence of hip hop for many.&quot;

It was not until 7 March 2009 that Wordplay appeared on an official release in the form of &quot;Alphabet Assassins&quot;, the 10th track from the debut Mongrel album &quot;Better Than Heavy&quot;, released through the label &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;.

Wordplay has toured with, opened for and appeared on stage with Mongrel and Reverend and the Makers at various festivals and concerts including Glastonbury, T in the Park and Oxegen.

In 2010 Wordplay released his latest project, &quot;An Emotional Victory&quot;. There was confusion as to whather this was a mixtape or an album, having been dubbed &quot;The Fixtape&quot; and being an entrant into the mixtape awards, then cited as being an album by blogs like Hip Hop Kings. Wordplay called it &quot;a street album&quot; on Twitter, which was supported by other official blogs. The album had an unofficial release on 2 March 2010 when 200 limited copies were sold out directly from Wordplay through his blog.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://amoderndaypanther.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="192744" wikidata="Q489750" url="?curid=192744" title="Fanaticism">
<text>Fanaticism (from the Latin adverb &quot;fānāticē&quot; [fren-&quot;fānāticus&quot;; enthusiastic, ecstatic; raging, fanatical, furious]) is a belief or behavior involving uncritical or an enthusiasm. 

==Definitions==
Philosopher George Santayana defines &quot;fanaticism&quot; as &quot;redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim&quot;. The fanatic displays very strict standards and little tolerance for contrary ideas or opinions. Tõnu Lehtsaar has defined the term &quot;fanaticism&quot; as the pursuit or defence of something in an extreme and passionate way that goes beyond normality. Religious fanaticism is defined by blind faith, the persecution of dissidents and the absence of reality.

==Causes==
Fanaticism is a result from multiple cultures interacting with one another. Fanaticism occurs most frequently when a leader makes minor variations on already existing beliefs, which then drives the followers into a frenzy. In this case, fanaticism is used as an adjective describing the nature of certain behaviors that people recognize as cult-like. Margaret Mead referred to the style of defense used when the followers are approached. The most consistent thing presented is the priming, or preexisting, conditions and mind state needed to induce fanatical behavior. Each behavior is obvious once it is pointed out; a closed mind, no interest in debating the subject of worship, and over reaction to people who do not believe.

In his book &quot;Crazy Talk, Stupid Talk&quot;, Neil Postman states that &quot;the key to all fanatical beliefs is that they are self-confirming...(some beliefs are) fanatical not because they are &#x27;false&#x27;, but because they are expressed in such a way that they can never be shown to be false.&quot;

==Similar behaviors==
The behavior of a fan with overwhelming enthusiasm for a given subject is differentiated from the behavior of a fanatic by the fanatic&#x27;s violation of prevailing social norms. Though the fan&#x27;s behavior may be judged as odd or eccentric, it does not violate such norms. A fanatic differs from a crank, in that a crank is defined as a person who holds a position or opinion which is so far from the norm as to appear ludicrous and/or probably wrong, such as a belief in a Flat Earth. In contrast, the subject of the fanatic&#x27;s obsession may be &quot;normal&quot;, such as an interest in religion or politics, except that the scale of the person&#x27;s involvement, devotion, or obsession with the activity or cause is abnormal or disproportionate to the average.

== Types ==

* Consumer fanaticism – the level of involvement or interest one has in the liking of a particular person, group, trend, artwork or idea
* Emotional fanaticism
* Ethnic or racial supremacist fanaticism
* Leisure fanaticism – high levels of intensity, enthusiasm, commitment and zeal shown for a particular leisure activity
* Nationalistic or patriotic fanaticism
* Political, ideological fanaticism. 
* Religious fanaticism – considered by some to be the most extreme form of religious fundamentalism. Entail promoting religious point of views
* Sports fanaticism – high levels of intensity surrounding sporting events. This is either done based on the belief that extreme fanaticism can alter games for one&#x27;s favorite team (Ex: Knight Krew), or because the person uses sports activities as an ultra-masculine &quot;proving ground&quot; for brawls, as in the case of football hooliganism.

<doc id="192746" wikidata="Q271766" url="?curid=192746" title="Gerald Edelman">
<text>Gerald Maurice Edelman (; July 1, 1929 – May 17, 2014) was an American biologist who shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work with Rodney Robert Porter on the immune system. Edelman&#x27;s Nobel Prize-winning research concerned discovery of the structure of antibody molecules. In interviews, he has said that the way the components of the immune system evolve over the life of the individual is analogous to the way the components of the brain evolve in a lifetime. There is a continuity in this way between his work on the immune system, for which he won the Nobel Prize, and his later work in neuroscience and in philosophy of mind.

==Early life and education==
Gerald Edelman was born in 1929 in Ozone Park, Queens, New York, to Jewish parents, physician Edward Edelman, and Anna (née Freedman) Edelman, who worked in the insurance industry. He studied violin for years, but eventually realized that he did not have the inner drive needed to pursue a career as a concert violinist, and decided to go into medical research instead. He attended public schools in New York, graduating from John Adams High School, and then attended Ursinus College, where he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a B.S. in 1950. He received an M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1954.

==Career==
After a year at the Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics, Edelman became a resident at the Massachusetts General Hospital; he then practiced medicine in France while serving with US Army Medical Corps. In 1957, Edelman joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a graduate fellow, working in the laboratory of Henry Kunkel and receiving a Ph.D. in 1960. The institute made him the assistant (later associate) dean of graduate studies; he became a professor at the school in 1966. In 1992, he moved to California and became a professor of neurobiology at The Scripps Research Institute.

After his Nobel prize award, Edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes, particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms, focusing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system. These studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form, and by which nervous systems are built. One of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity.

For his efforts, Edelman was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1968) and the American Philosophical Society (1977).

==Nobel Prize==
While in Paris serving in the Army, Edelman read a book that sparked his interest in antibodies. He decided that, since the book said so little about antibodies, he would investigate them further upon returning to the United States, which led him to study physical chemistry for his 1960 Ph.D. Research by Edelman and his colleagues and Rodney Robert Porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody&#x27;s chemical structure, opening a door for further study. For this work, Edelman and Porter shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1972.

In its Nobel Prize press release in 1972, the Karolinska Institutet lauded Edelman and Porter&#x27;s work as a major breakthrough:

===Disulfide bonds===

Edelman&#x27;s early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits. The protein subunits of antibodies are of two types, the larger heavy chains and the smaller light chains. Two light and two heavy chains are linked together by disulfide bonds to form a functional antibody.

===Molecular models of antibody structure===
Using experimental data from his own research and the work of others, Edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins. A key feature of these models included the idea that the antigen binding domains of antibodies (Fab) include amino acids from both the light and heavy protein subunits. The inter-chain disulfide bonds help bring together the two parts of the antigen binding domain.

===Antibody sequencing===
Edelman and his colleagues used cyanogen bromide and proteases to fragment the antibody protein subunits into smaller pieces that could be analyzed for determination of their amino acid sequence. At the time when the first complete antibody sequence was determined (1969) it was the largest complete protein sequence that had ever been determined. The availability of amino acid sequences of antibody proteins allowed recognition of the fact that the body can produce many different antibody proteins with similar antibody constant regions and divergent antibody variable regions.

===Topobiology===
Topobiology is Edelman&#x27;s theory which asserts that morphogenesis is driven by differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations and it explains how a single cell can give rise to a complex multi-cellular organism. As proposed by Edelman in 1988, topobiology is the process that sculpts and maintains differentiated tissues and is acquired by the energetically favored segregation of cells through heterologous cellular interactions.

==Theory of consciousness==
In his later career, Edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness, documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience, including &quot;Bright Air, Brilliant Fire&quot; (1992), &quot;A Universe of Consciousness&quot; (2001, with Giulio Tononi), &quot;Wider than the Sky&quot; (2004) and &quot;Second Nature: Brain Science and Human Knowledge&quot; (2007).

In &quot;Second Nature&quot; Edelman defines human consciousness as:
: &quot;... what you lose on entering a dreamless deep sleep ... deep anesthesia or coma ... what you regain after emerging from these states. [The] experience of a unitary scene composed variably of sensory responses ... memories ... situatedness ...&quot;

The first of Edelman&#x27;s technical books, &quot;The Mindful Brain&quot; (1978), develops his theory of Neural Darwinism, which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network in response to the environment. The second book, &quot;Topobiology&quot; (1988), proposes a theory of how the original neuronal network of a newborn&#x27;s brain is established during development of the embryo. &quot;The Remembered Present&quot; (1990) contains an extended exposition of his theory of consciousness.

In his books, Edelman proposed a biological theory of consciousness, based on his studies of the immune system. He explicitly roots his theory within Charles Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Natural Selection, citing the key tenets of Darwin&#x27;s population theory, which postulates that individual variation within species provides the basis for the natural selection that eventually leads to the evolution of new species. He explicitly rejected dualism and also dismissed newer hypotheses such as the so-called &#x27;computational&#x27; model of consciousness, which liken the brain&#x27;s functions to the operations of a computer. Edelman argued that mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena, arising from complex cellular processes within the brain, and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by Darwinian theory.

Edelman&#x27;s theory seeks to explain consciousness in terms of the morphology of the brain. A brain comprises a massive population of neurons (approx. 100 billion cells) each with an enormous number of synaptic connections to other neurons. During development, the subset of connections that survive the initial phases of growth and development will make approximately 100 trillion connections with each other. A sample of brain tissue the size of a match head contains about a billion connections, and if we consider how these neuronal connections might be variously combined, the number of possible permutations becomes hyper-astronomical – in the order of ten followed by millions of zeros. The young brain contains many more neural connections than will ultimately survive to maturity, and Edelman argued that this redundant capacity is needed because neurons are the only cells in the body that cannot be renewed and because only those networks best adapted to their ultimate purpose will be selected as they organize into neuronal groups.

===Neural Darwinism===
Edelman&#x27;s theory of neuronal group selection, also known as &#x27;Neural Darwinism&#x27;, has three basic tenets—Developmental Selection, Experiential Selection and Reentry.
# Developmental selection -- the formation of the gross anatomy of the brain is controlled by genetic factors, but in any individual the connectivity between neurons at the synaptic level and their organisation into functional neuronal groups is determined by somatic selection during growth and development. This process generates tremendous variability in the neural circuitry—like the fingerprint or the iris, no two people will have precisely the same synaptic structures in any comparable area of brain tissue. Their high degree of functional plasticity and the extraordinary density of their interconnections enables neuronal groups to self-organise into many complex and adaptable &quot;modules.&quot; These are made up of many different types of neurons which are typically more closely and densely connected to each other than they are to neurons in other groups.
# Experiential selection -- Overlapping the initial growth and development of the brain, and extending throughout an individual&#x27;s life, a continuous process of synaptic selection occurs within the diverse repertoires of neuronal groups. This process may strengthen or weaken the connections between groups of neurons and it is constrained by value signals that arise from the activity of the ascending systems of the brain, which are continually modified by successful output. Experiential selection generates dynamic systems that can &#x27;map&#x27; complex spatio-temporal events from the sensory organs, body systems and other neuronal groups in the brain onto other selected neuronal groups. Edelman argues that this dynamic selective process is directly analogous to the processes of selection that act on populations of individuals in species, and he also points out that this functional plasticity is imperative, since not even the vast coding capability of entire human genome is sufficient to explicitly specify the astronomically complex synaptic structures of the developing brain.
# Reentry —the concept of reentrant signalling between neuronal groups. He defines reentry as the ongoing recursive dynamic interchange of signals that occurs in parallel between brain maps, and which continuously interrelates these maps to each other in time and space (film clip: Edelman demonstrates spontaneous group formation among neurons with re-entrant connections). Reentry depends for its operations on the intricate networks of massively parallel reciprocal connections within and between neuronal groups, which arise through the processes of developmental and experiential selection outlined above. Edelman describes reentry as &quot;a form of ongoing higher-order selection ... that appears to be unique to animal brains&quot; and that &quot;there is no other object in the known universe so completely distinguished by reentrant circuitry as the human brain.&quot;

==Evolution theory==
Edelman and Gally were the first to point out the pervasiveness of degeneracy in biological systems and the fundamental role that degeneracy plays in facilitating evolution.

===Later career===
Edelman founded and directed The Neurosciences Institute, a nonprofit research center in San Diego that between 1993 and 2012 studied the biological bases of higher brain function in humans. He served on the scientific board of the World Knowledge Dialogue project.

Edelman was a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board.

==Personal==
Edelman married Maxine M. Morrison in 1950. They have two sons, Eric, a visual artist in New York City, and David, an adjunct professor of neuroscience at University of San Diego. Their daughter, Judith Edelman, is a bluegrass musician, recording artist, and writer. Some observers have noted that a character in Richard Powers&#x27; &quot;The Echo Maker&quot; may be a nod at Edelman.

===Health and death===
