<text>Cape Coloureds () are a South African group of multiracial people who are from the Cape region in South Africa which consists of the Western Cape, Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape. Their ancestry comes from the interracial mixing between the White, the indigenous Khoi and San, the Xhosa plus other Bantu people, labourers from South Asia, slaves imported from the Dutch East Indies, immigrants from the Levant or Yemen (or a combination of all). Eventually, all these ethnic and racial groups intermixed with each other, forming a group of mixed-race people that became the &quot;Cape Coloureds&quot;.
== Demographics ==
Although Coloureds represent only 8.15% of people within South Africa, they make up 42.1% of the population in the Western Cape, representing a plurality of the population of the province. (according to the 2022 South African census)
They are generally bilingual, speaking Afrikaans and English, though some speak only one of these. Some Cape Coloureds may code switch, speaking a patois of Afrikaans and English called Afrikaaps, also known as Cape Slang (Capy) or , meaning Kitchen Afrikaans. Cape Coloureds were classified under apartheid as a subset of the larger Coloured race group.

Recent studies of Cape Coloureds using genetic testing have found ancestry to vary by region. Khoe-San ancestry is higher in inland regions and towards the North into present-day Northern Cape. Although it is prevalent throughout the Cape, the partial Bantu-Speaking ancestry (most predominantly Xhosa) gets higher going Eastwards into present-day Eastern Cape. The European-related ancestry is highest along the coast. In Cape Town and the rest of the Western Cape province, the partial Asian ancestry is high and diverse due to the arrival of Asian and African slaves that mixed with Europeans(colonists/immigrants/tourists) and existing mixed race (Khoisan-European) which formed the modern day Cape Coloureds and Cape Malay due to the creolisation of all those populations. At least 4 genetic studies indicate that the average Cape Coloured has an ancestry consisting of the following, with large variation between individuals:
* Khoisan-speaking Africans: ~25.3%
* Bantu-speaking Africans: ~15.5%
* Ethnic groups in Europe: ~39.3%
* Asian peoples: ~19.9%

Below are the approximate ranges for each ancestral component based on genetic studies and historical accounts:

African Ancestry:

Range: ~ 30-68%

European Ancestry:

Range: ~ 20-70%

Asian Ancestry:

Range: ~ 20-40%

Middle Eastern Ancestry:

Range: ~ 5-15%

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and individual results may vary. The ancestry of Cape Coloureds can be diverse and complex.

The genetic reference cluster term &quot;Khoisan&quot; itself refers to a colonially admixed population cluster, hence the concatenation, and is not a straightforward reference to ancient African pastoralist and hunter ancestry, which is often demarcated by the L0 haplogroup ancestry common in the general South African native population, which is also integral part of other aboriginal genetic reference cluster terms like &quot;South-East African Bantu&quot;.

=== Religion ===
A separate Dutch Reformed Church, the &quot;Dutch Reformed Mission Church&quot; (DRMC), was formed in 1881 to serve the Cape Coloured Calvinist population separately from the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK). It was merged in 1994 with the &quot;Dutch Reformed Church in Africa&quot; (DRCA, formed 1963) to form the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa.

Success in the spread of Catholicism among Afrikaans speakers, including Coloured communities, remained minimal until the death throes of Apartheid during the mid to late 1980s. As Catholic texts began to be translated into Afrikaans, sympathetic Dutch Reformed pastors, who were defying the traditional anti-Catholicism of their Church, assisted in correcting linguistic errors. By 1996, the majority of Afrikaans-speaking Catholics came from the Coloured community, with a smaller number of Afrikaner converts, most of whom were from professional backgrounds.

Sunni Islam remains in practice among Cape Malays, who were generally regarded as a separate ethnoreligious group under apartheid.

==Origin and history==

The first and the largest phase of interracial marriages/Miscegenation in South Africa happened in the Dutch Cape Colony which began from the 17th century, shortly after the arrival of Dutch settlers, who were led by Jan van Riebeeck. When the Dutch settled in the Cape in 1652, they met the Khoi Khoi who were the natives of the area. After settling in the Cape, the Dutch established farms that required intensive labour therefore, they enforced slavery in the Cape. Some of the Khoi Khoi became labourers in the Cape. Despite this, there was resistance by the Khoi Khoi, which led to the Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars. As a result of this resistance, the Dutch imported slaves from other parts of the world, especially the Malay people from present-day Indonesia and the Bantu people from various parts of Southern Africa. To a smaller extent, slaves were also imported from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Madagascar, Mauritius and elsewhere in Africa. The slaves were almost invariably given Christian names but their places of origin were indicated in the records of sales and other documents so that it is possible to estimate the ratio of slaves from different regions. Often, slaves were given their masters&#x27; surnames, surnames that were of biblical origin (e.g. Adams, Thomas, Jacobs, Matthews, Peters, Daniels) or surnames that reflected the month in which they arrived (e.g. September, March, October, April). These slaves were, however, dispersed and lost their cultural identity over the course of time.

Because most of the Dutch settlers in the Cape were men, many of them married and fathered the first group of mixed-race children with Khoi Khoi women. Soon after the arrival of slaves in the Cape, the Dutch men also married and fathered mixed race children with the Malay from Indonesia, the Southern African Bantu, Indians and other enslaved ethnic groups in the Cape. To a certain extent, the slaves in the Cape also had interracial unions with each other and mixed-race children were also conceived from these unions as well because the slaves were of different races (African and Asian). Unlike the One-drop rule in the USA, mixed-race children in the Cape were not viewed as &quot;white enough to be white&quot;, &quot;black enough to be black&quot; nor &quot;asian enough to be asian&quot;, therefore, mixed race children from all these interracial unions in the Cape grew up and married amongst themselves, forming their own community that would later be known as the &quot;Cape Coloured&quot;.

The first interracial marriage in the Cape was between Krotoa (a Khoi Khoi woman who was a servant, a translator and a crucial negotiator between the Dutch and the Khoi Khoi. Her Dutch name was &quot;Eva Van Meerhof&quot;) and Peter Havgard (a Danish surgeon whom the Dutch renamed as &quot;Pieter Van Meerhof&quot;). Having conceived 3 mixed-race children, Krotoa was known as the mother that gave birth to the Coloured community in South Africa.

Eventually, more Dutch people settled in the Cape, amongst them were the Van Wijk family (whose descendants became &#x27;Van Wyk&#x27;) who arrived in the Cape in 1686 and the Erasmus family that arrived in 1689. The Huguenots (also known as &#x27;French Huguenots&#x27;) were French Protestants who escaped persecution and banishment by Roman Catholics in France and many of them immigrated to the Dutch Cape Colony to seek refuge amongst the existing Dutch community during the late 1600s and early 1700s. Coming from a country that has a rich history of wine production, these French refugees pioneered the vineyards of the Cape Winelands, turning it into one of the biggest wine producers in the world. Although many Huguenots who arrived in the Cape were already married, their children and descendants soon integrated with the Dutch and other ethnic groups in the Dutch Cape Colony and after a few generations, they spoke Dutch, not French. Due to integration with the Dutch and other ethnic groups in the Cape, there are many Afrikaans surnames of French origin e.g. Le Roux, De Villiers, Joubert, Marais, Visagie, Du Plessis, Pienaar, De Klerk(from &#x27;Le Clerc&#x27;), Meyer, Fourie, Theron, Cronje, Viljoen (from &#x27;Villion&#x27;), Du Toit, Reyneke, Malan, Naude, De Lille, Fouche, Blignaut, Retief, Boshoff, Rossouw, and Louw.

During the 1600s and the 1700s, Germany was the Netherlands&#x27; biggest trading partner in Europe and due to their good relations, hundreds of thousands of Germans were recruited by the VOC making Germans the largest foreign Europeans in the Dutch empire. Throughout the Dutch rule, the VOC sent nearly 15 000 Germans to the Dutch Cape Colony to work as officials, sailors, administrators and soldiers. The Germans learnt Dutch and it replaced German. Eventually, Germans in the Cape became farmers, teachers, traders and ministers. Almost all Germans who settled in the Cape throughout the Dutch rule were men and therefore, almost all German men in the Cape married women outside their culture (especially African and Asian women). Due to integration with the Dutch and other ethnic groups in the Cape, there are many Afrikaans surnames of German origin e.g. Botha, Grobler, Hartzenberg, Pretorius, Booysen, Steenkamp, Kruger (from &#x27;Krüger&#x27;), Botha, Venter, Cloete, Schoeman, Mulder, Kriel, Breytenbach, Engelbrecht, Potgieter, Maritz, Liebenberg, Fleischman, Weimers, and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; Some few Portuguese people also settled in the Cape and were integrated into the community which is how the Portuguese surname &#x27;Ferreira&#x27; ended up being an Afrikaans surname as well.

With the arrival of more Europeans (as mentioned above),more African and Asian slaves and the recruitment of more Khoi Khoi labourers in the Cape Colony, there were more interracial unions with more mixed-race children who were absorbed into the Cape Coloured community. The recruitment of Khoi Khoi labourers and the importation of African and Asian slaves continued until the Cape fell under British rule in the early 1800s and eventually, these slaves and labourers were absorbed into the Cape Coloured communtiy. The predominant Asian slaves in the Cape were the Malays who came from Indonesia while some also came from Malaysia. Because Indonesia and Malaysia are both predominantly muslim-states, the slaves who were taken from the 2 countries were the ones who introduced Islam in the Dutch Cape Colony. Many Malays were also sent to the Dutch Cape Colony as exiled prisoners who ended up as slaves as a punishment for rebelling against Dutch rule in Indonesia(which was then called the Dutch East Indies). Although most of them were interracially absorbed into the Cape Coloured community, a small minority of them preserved their own community and culture, therefore, they became known as the Cape Malay. Eventually, other muslims(especially Indian slaves and merchants from the Middle East and North Africa) were absorbed into the Cape Malay community. However, during the Apartheid regime, the Cape Malays were classified as a sub-group of the Coloured due to similar ancestry with the Cape Coloureds and because South Africa&#x27;s population was grouped into four races under the Population Registration Act, 1950: Black, White, Coloured and Indian. Therefore, many Cape Malays were forced to live in Coloured commuities during Apartheid.

During the 17th century (in this case, from 1652-1700), the Dutch Cape Colony consisted only of present-day Cape Town with its surrounding areas such as Paarl, Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. However, from the 18th century until the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the territory of the Cape expanded gradually to the north and east. The expansion of the Dutch Cape Colony was mainly caused by the dry and infertile nature of its immediate interior, therefore farmers needed fertile land because farms could only be settled where there were springs to provide permanent water. However, it was also influenced by emigration of the Trekboers who left the Cape and migrated into the Karoo during the 18th century and after British annexation of the Cape in the 19th century. By the mid-18th century, the territory of the Dutch Cape Colony had reached present-day Swellendam and by the end of the Dutch rule (after British annexation in 1814), the territory of the Cape had already reached certain parts of the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape, leading to the arrival of the Afrikaner/Boer with their multiracial slaves in different parts of the Cape. With the gradual expansion of the Cape, the migration of the trekboer, the arrival of the Afrikaner/Boer with their slaves and the additional arrival of various European nationalities, such as the British and Irish, there were more interracial unions, this time between the white and the Khoisans in the Northern Cape and between the white and the Xhosa in the Eastern Cape with more mixed race children being conceived, adding on to the Coloured population of the entire Cape.

Miscegenation in the eastern part of the Cape (which is now the Eastern Cape) dates to the late 1600s which began as a result of the shipwrecks. The Wild Coast Region of the Eastern Cape (which stretches from the provincial border with Natal to East London and Port Alfred) is named after its wilderness and the stormy seas that caused thousands of shipwrecks. Survivors of the shipwrecks (most of whom were Europeans while some were Asians) settled on the Wild Coast. Having no means to return home, most survivors remained permanently in the Eastern Cape and mixed with the Xhosa. Within the same period, many escaped slaves from the Dutch Cape Colony found refuge amongst the Xhosa and assimilated into Xhosa society, and they were soon followed by the Trekboers who were on their way to the Karoo while some of them settled in the Eastern Cape where they mixed with the Xhosa and the Khoi Khoi. The most notorious Trekboer to do so was the Coenraad De Buys who fathered many mixed race children with his many African wives (who were Khoi Khoi and Xhosa) and one of them was Chief Ngqika&#x27;s mother, Yese, wife of Mlawu kaRarabe. During the last years of Dutch rule, the territory of the Dutch Cape Colony had reached the Western portion of the Eastern Cape, especially in the Graaff-Reinet region which led to the arrival of the Boer/Afrikaner with their multiracial slaves. Miscegenation in the Eastern Cape continued during the 1800s until the early 1900s with the arrival of British, Irish and German settlers, many of whom mixed with the Xhosa and eventually multiracial people in the Eastern Cape also became part of the Cape Coloured.

In the Northern region of the Cape(which now the Northern Cape), miscegenation began in the 1700s, shortly after the arrival of the Trekboers that left the Dutch Cape Colony(fleeing from autocratic rule) and many settled in the Karoo while some settled in Namaqualand. Some Trekboers even went as far as the Orange River and beyond to the Southern part of the Kalahari and in all these regions, they met the Khoisans(the San and the Khoi Khoi). As a way of survival in this hot and dry region, the Trekboers adopted the nomadic lifestyle that the Khoisans were living and some even mixed with the Khoisans. During the last years of Dutch rule, the territory of the Dutch Cape Colony had reached the Southern portion of the Northern Cape, leading to the arrival of the Boer/Afrikaner with their multiracial slaves. In the early 1800s, the Griqua people left the Dutch Cape Colony and migrated to the North of the Karoo where they established Griqualand West. Then there was the arrival of the Basters, Oorlams and the Cape Coloured that migrated to the North as well and some of them even went as far as present-day Namibia. In the latter half of the 1800s, large sums of diamonds, Uranium, Copper and Iron ore were discovered in the Northern Cape which attracted many Europeans, many of whom mixed with the San, Khoi khoi, Tswana in the North-East and the Xhosa in the South-East and then multiracial people in the Northern Cape also became part of the Cape Coloured.

After British annexation in 1814, slavery was abolished in the Cape in 1834, which lead to the Great Trek when the Boere left the Cape as Voortrekkers and migrated into the interior of South Africa to form the Boer republics. Most of the freed slaves(who became Cape Coloureds) remained behind. Many freed slaves moved to an area in Cape Town that became known as District Six.

Throughout the 1800s(especially after the abolishment of slavery in 1834), the Cape received an influx of refugees, immigrants and indentured labourers from: Britain, Ireland, St Helena, China, Indonesia, Philippines, India, Middle East, West Africa, North Africa and East Africa(many of whom got married and absorbed into the Cape Coloured community). In the 1800s, the Philippines(which was a Spanish colony) went through harsh rebellion against the Spanish colonial rule which led to a large number of Filipinos that left the country and moved to different parts of the world for refuge. In the late 1830s, the first Filipinos to arrive in Cape Town, settled in Kalk Bay where they were fishing for a living and then Kalk Bay became their new home. When word reached home, many more Filipinos flocked to Kalk Bay, and they soon got scattered throughout Cape Town and its surroundings where they eventually got married and integrated into the Cape Coloured community. Many Filipinos that settled in Cape Town were also mixed with partial Spanish ancestry which is why some Cape Coloureds can also trace some of their roots from the Philippines and from Spain, due to the Filipinos of Kalk Bay. Within the Cape Coloured community, surnames that come from the Filipinos of Kalk Bay(which are mostly Spanish surnames given to the Filipinos by the Spaniards) are Pascal, Torrez, De La Cruz, Fernandes, Florez, Manuel, Garcia etc.

In 1888, Oromo slave children from Ethiopia (who were headed for Arabia) were rescued and freed by British troops. In 1890, the British troops brought these freed Oromo slaves to Lovedale Mission in present-day Eastern Cape where many of them became part of the Cape Coloured. The late Dr Neville Alexander&#x27;s grandmother, Bisho Jarsa, was a freed Oromo slave from Ethiopia.

By the turn of the 20th century, District six became more established and populated. Although its population was predominantly Cape Coloured, District Six (just like many places in the Cape) was diverse with different ethnicities, races and nationalities living there (this includes Blacks, Whites, Jews, Cape Malays and Asian immigrants such as the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese) Many of these groups were absorbed into the Cape coloured community. The Cape region(including the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape) also attracted many European immigrants of various nationalities(including Scandinavians[Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland], Portuguese, Greeks, Italians), many of whom married into the Cape Coloured community while some mixed with other ethnic groups, whose children got absorbed into the Cape Coloured community, adding to the ancestry of the Cape Coloureds.

As a result, the Cape Coloureds ended up having the most diverse ancestry in the world with a blend of so many different cultures mixed together.

==Cape Coloureds in the media==


A group of Cape Coloureds were interviewed in the documentary series &quot;Ross Kemp on Gangs&quot;. One of the gang members who participated in the interview mentioned that black South Africans have been the main beneficiaries of South African social promotion initiatives while the Cape Coloureds have been further marginalised.

The 2009 film &quot;I&#x27;m Not Black, I&#x27;m Coloured – Identity Crisis at the Cape of Good Hope&quot; (Monde World Films, US release) is one of the first historical documentary films to explore the legacy of Apartheid through the viewpoint of the Cape Coloured community, including interviews with elders, pastors, members of Parliament, students and everyday people struggling to find their identity in the new South Africa. The film&#x27;s 2016 sequel &quot;Word of Honour: Reclaiming Mandela’s Promise&quot; (Monde World Films, US release) 

Various books have covered the subject matter of Coloured identity and heritage.

Patric Tariq Mellet, heritage activist and author of &#x27;The Camissa Embrace&#x27; and co-creator of The Camissa Museum, has composed a vast online blog archive (&#x27;Camissa People&#x27;) of heritage information concerning Coloured ancestry tracing to the Indigenous San and Khoe and Malagasy, East African, Indonesian, Indian, Bengal and Sri Lankan slaves.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;coloureds&quot; is currently treated as a neutral description in Southern Africa, classifying people of mixed race ancestry. &quot;Coloured&quot; may be seen as offensive in some other western countries, such as Britain and the United States of America.

The most used racial slurs against Cape Coloureds are Hottentot or &quot;hotnot&quot; and Kaffir. The term &quot;hotnot&quot; is a derogatory term used to refer to Khoisan people and coloureds in South Africa. The term originated from the Dutch language, where &quot;Hottentot&quot; was used to describe a language spoken by the Khoisan people. It later came to be used as a derogatory term for the people themselves, based on European perceptions of their physical appearance and culture. The term is often used to demean and dehumanize Khoisan and coloured people, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discrimination against them. The term &quot;Kaffir&quot; is a racial slur used to refer to coloured people and black people in South Africa. It originated from Arabic and was used to refer to non-Muslims. Later, it was used by European-descended South Africans to refer to black and coloured people during the apartheid era, and the term became associated with racism and oppression. While it is still used against Coloured people, it is not as prevalent as it is against black people.

<text>The Iller (; ancient name Ilargus) is a river of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg in Germany. It is a right tributary of the Danube, long.

It is formed at the confluence of the rivers Breitach, Stillach and Trettach near Oberstdorf in the Allgäu region of the Alps, close to the Austrian border. From there it runs northwards, passing the towns of Sonthofen, Immenstadt, and Kempten. Between Lautrach near Memmingen and Ulm it forms the border between the two German States Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg for about . The river flows into the Danube in the city centre of Ulm.

The Iller has a catchment area of . It ranks as the seventh of Bavaria&#x27;s rivers by water flow, with an average throughput of at Senden, a short distance upstream from the Danube. The power of the river is used for the production of hydroelectricity via eight power stations with a total net capacity of 51 MW (1998).

A bicycle route follows the Iller, which is also a popular location for rafting and trekking.

===Olympic results===

Jones represented the United States at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games in the 156-pound weight class, being the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic Boxing Team, where he won the silver medal.
* 1/16: Defeated M&#x27;tendere Makalamba (Malawi) KO 1 
* 1/8: Defeated Michal Franek (Czechoslovakia) by unanimous decision, 5–0 
* 1/4: Defeated Yevgeni Zaytsev (Soviet Union) by unanimous decision, 5–0 
* 1/2: Defeated Richie Woodhall (United Kingdom) by unanimous decision, 5–0 
* Finals: Lost to Park Si-Hun (South Korea) by split decision, 2–3 
Jones did not lose a single round en route to the final. His quarterfinal match-up with Soviet boxer Yevgeni Zaytsev was the first U.S.–Soviet Olympic bout in 12 years (because each country had boycotted one Summer Olympics during that period). The final was met with controversy when Jones lost a 2–3 decision to South Korean fighter Park Si-Hun despite pummeling Park for three rounds, landing 86 punches to Park&#x27;s 32. Reportedly, Park himself apologized to Jones afterward and the Italian referee Aldo Leoni, while raising Park&#x27;s hand, told Jones that he was dumbstruck by the judges&#x27; decision, murmuring: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re doing this to you.&quot; One judge shortly thereafter admitted the decision was a mistake and all three judges voting against Jones were eventually suspended. Marv Albert, calling the bout on American television for NBC, reported that two judges from Communist countries, Hungary and the Soviet Union, scored the bout in favor of Jones, while those from Morocco and Uruguay favored Park. The fifth judge, from Uganda, scored the bout as a draw, leaving the outcome to be decided on other criteria.

An official IOC investigation ending in 1997 found that, although the offending judges had been wined and dined by South Korean organizers, there was no evidence of corruption in the boxing events in Seoul. Jones was awarded the Val Barker trophy as the best stylistic boxer of the 1988 games, which was only the third and to this day the last time in the competition&#x27;s history when the award did not go to one of the gold medal winners. The Val Barker trophy is awarded by the AIBA, an organization not directly connected with the Olympic authorities. The incident led Olympic organizers to establish a new scoring system for Olympic boxing.

The U.S. Olympic Committee called for an investigation in 1996 after documents belonging to East Germany&#x27;s Stasi secret police revealed reports of judges being paid to vote for South Korean boxers. East Germany ended the Seoul Olympics in second place on the medal table, ahead of the United States by one gold medal.

==Professional career==

===Early career===
On turning professional, he had already sparred with many professional boxers, including NABF Champion Ronnie Essett, IBF Champion Lindell Holmes and Sugar Ray Leonard. Jones began as a professional on May 6, 1989, knocking out Ricky Randall in two rounds in Pensacola at the Bayfront Auditorium. For his next fight, he faced the more experienced Stephan Johnson in Atlantic City, beating him by a knockout in round eight.

Jones built a record of 15–0 with 15 knockouts before stepping up in class to meet former World Welterweight Champion Jorge Vaca in a Pay Per View fight on January 10, 1992. He knocked Vaca out in round one to reach 16 knockout wins in a row. After one more KO, Jones went the distance for the first time against future world champion Jorge Castro, winning a 10-round decision in front of a USA Network national audience.

===Middleweight champion===
====Jones vs. Hopkins====

Jones made his first attempt at a world title on May 22, 1993. He beat future Undisputed middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins by unanimous decision in Washington, D.C., to capture the IBF middleweight championship. Jones was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards (116-112 three times). Jones landed 206 of 594 punches (35%) and Hopkins connected on 153 of 670 (23%). Jones claimed he had entered the bout with a broken right hand, but still managed to outpoint Hopkins and secure a unanimous decision win. Jones reminded the world of this claim on his hit single &quot;Ya&#x27;ll Must&#x27;ve Forgot&quot; later in his career.

For his next fight, he fought another future world champion, Thulane &quot;Sugar Boy&quot; Malinga, in a non-title affair. Jones beat Malinga by knockout in six rounds. Jones finished the year with another win, beating Fermin Chirino by decision. In 1994, Jones beat Danny &quot;Popeye&quot; Garcia by knockout in six, then retained his IBF title against Thomas Tate in two rounds at Las Vegas on May 27.

===Super middleweight champion===
====Jones vs. Toney====

On November 18, 1994, Jones was set to face undefeated IBF super middleweight Champion James Toney, who was ranked highly in the &quot;pound for pound&quot; rankings. Toney was undefeated after 46 bouts and was rated the best in the world at 168 lbs. Billed as &quot;The Uncivil War&quot;, Toney vs. Jones was heavily hyped and on PPV. Jones, for the first time in his career, was the underdog.

Over the course of the 12-round unanimous decision, Jones demonstrated his greatness. He danced circles around Toney, utilizing his speed and athleticism to dictate the action, and landing quick combinations whenever Toney pressured him. Jones scored a flash knockdown in the third round with a leaping left hook after goading Toney by imitating a fighting cock. Ring magazine called Jones&#x27; performance the most dominant of any big fight in 20 years. Jones landed 285 of 614 punches (46%) and Toney connected on 157 of 451 (35%). Jones was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards (117–110, 119–108 and 118–109). The fight generated 300,000 pay-per-view buys.

====Miscellaneous defenses====

In 1995, Jones defended his super middleweight title successfully multiple times. He began the year by knocking out IBF #1 Antoine Byrd in round one. This was the first time a championship fight took place at Pensacola. In a fight billed as &quot;&#x27;The Devil &amp; Mr Jones&quot;&#x27;, he faced former IBF lightweight Champion Vinny Pazienza and defeated him in round six, after knocking down Pazienza three times. In the fourth round, Jones became the first fighter in CompuBox history to go an entire round without being hit by his opponent. Pazienza was credited with throwing five punches and landing zero. Pazienza was guaranteed $1.35 million, while Jones, who worked off percentages of the gate and the pay-per-view revenue, was guaranteed at least $2 million. Jones then beat Tony Thornton in round three by KO three months later.

In 1996, Jones maintained his winning ways, defeating Merqui Sosa by knockout in two and future world champion Eric Lucas in round 11. When he boxed Lucas, he became the first athlete to participate in two paid sports events on the same day. He had played a basketball game in the morning and defended his boxing title in Jacksonville, Florida that evening. He also held a press conference in the ring just before his 3rd bout of the year, taking questions from a chair in the middle of the ring and defending his choice of Bryant Brannon as his opponent instead of Frankie Liles, his nemesis from the amateurs. He then defeated Bryant Brannon in a round two TKO.

===First reign as light heavyweight champion===
====Jones vs McCallum====

In November 1996 at Ice Palace, Tampa, Florida, Jones defeated 40-year-old former three-weight world champion Mike McCallum via a shutout decision (120–107, 3 times) before a crowd of 12,000, to win the vacant Interim WBC Light Heavyweight title. Jones scored a knockdown just before the bell at the end of round 10. Jones landed 254 of 535 punches (47%) throughout the 12 rounds and McCallum connected on 209 of 651 (32%) Jones was soon upgraded to full champion by the WBC when former titlist Fabrice Tiozzo moved up to cruiserweight. Jones made $2.8 million from the fight and McCallum got $750,000.

====Jones vs. Griffin====

In 1997 Jones had his first professional loss, a disqualification against Montell Griffin (26–0, 18 KOs) at the Taj Majal Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Griffin was trained by the legendary Eddie Futch, who had taught him how to take advantage of Jones technical mistakes and lack of basic boxing fundamentals. Griffin jumped out to an early lead on Jones but by round 9 Jones was ahead on the scorecards by a point and had Griffin on the canvas early in round nine. But as Griffin took a knee on the canvas to avoid further punishment, Jones hit him twice. Subsequently, Jones was disqualified and lost his title. At the time of disqualification, Jones was ahead on two of the judges&#x27; scorecards (75–76, 77–75, 76–75).

===Second reign as light heavyweight champion===
====Jones vs. Griffin II====

Jones sought an immediate rematch five months later at Foxwoods Resort, Connecticut, US, and regained the World Light Heavyweight title easily, knocking Griffin down within the first 20 seconds of the fight, then ending the fight by knocking Griffin out 2 minutes and 31 seconds in with a leaping left hand shot. The fight took place in a bingo hall before a sellout crowd of 4,500. Both Jones and Griffin earned a $1.5 million purse.

===Heavyweight ambitions===

Jones was linked to his WBC mandatory Michael Nunn after regaining the title, however in November he opted to vacate his belt in order to move up to heavyweight with a $6,000,000 deal to face former undisputed champion Buster Douglas on the table. Ultimately however Jones&#x27;s father convinced him to stay at light heavyweight, telling him he was &quot;risking his life&quot; by fighting Douglas. Instead Jones signed to fight former light heavyweight champion Virgil Hill at a 177 1/2 lb catchweight. He would also be named the WBC&#x27;s light heavyweight &quot;champion in recess&quot;.

Jones would become the first man to knockout Hill, stopping him in the 4th round with a huge right hand to the body that broke one of Hill&#x27;s ribs.

===Third reign as light heavyweight champion===

Jones would next sign to challenge WBA light heavyweight champion Lou Del Valle. Del Valle, a former sparring partner to Jones, had won the WBA belt in September 1997 (which had been vacated by Lineal champion Dariusz Michalczewski in July) by stopping Eddy Smulders of the Netherlands in the eighth round. Despite its billing as a unification bout, Jones was not recognized as the full WBC champion, that being Graciano Rocchigiani

Jones would win against Del Valle, by a decision in 12 on July 18, to became a three time champion. Jones had to climb off the canvas for the first time in his career, as he was dropped in round eight, but continued to outbox Del Valle throughout the rest of the fight and gained a unanimous decision.

By October the WBC had demoted its light heavyweight champion Rocchigiani to an &quot;interim champion&quot; after inexplicably claiming its references in promotions and contracts to the Rocchigiani-Nunn fight as a championship bout, and to Rocchigiani as the champion in its rankings, had been &quot;typographical errors&quot;. As a consequence Jones was elevated by the WBC to their full champion, making him a unified light heavyweight champion.

===Unified light heavyweight champion===
Jones would next make a defense against Otis Grant. He retained the crown by knocking Grant out in ten rounds.

Jones began 1999 by knocking out the WBC number one ranked contender at the time, Rick Frazier a 39 year old New York City police officer promoted by Don King.

===Undisputed light heavyweight champion===

On June 5 of that year, Jones beat IBF champion Reggie Johnson by a lopsided 12-round decision to become the undisputed light heavyweight champion, as well as the first to unify the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles at that weight since Michael Spinks in 1983. Jones dropped Johnson in the first round and hard in the third round but backed off and allowed Reggie to finish the fight.

A match with Graciano Rocchigiani was scheduled for November 1999 after Rocchigiani filed a lawsuit against Jones&#x27; promotional companies M&amp;M Sports and Square Ring Promotions Inc due to Jones&#x27; reluctance to box Rocchigiani. However, the match was canceled by Jones&#x27; promoter Murad Muhammad after Rocchigiani missed a press conference. After initially threatening to strip Jones of his title if he didn&#x27;t arrange another match with Rocchigiani, the WBC stripped Rocchigiani outright.

The year 2000 began with Jones easily beating the hard-punching David Telesco via a 12-round decision on January 15 at Radio City Music Hall to retain his titles, which was also the first fight hosted at the venue. Jones reportedly fractured his wrist a few weeks before the bout and fought almost exclusively one-handed. He also entered the ring to a live performance of &quot;Da Rockwilder&quot; by rappers Method Man and Redman. His next fight was also a first-time boxing event for a venue, as he traveled to Indianapolis and retained his title with an 11-round technical knockout over Richard Hall at the Conseco Fieldhouse. Jones ended 2000 with a 10-round stoppage of undefeated Eric Harding in New Orleans.

In 2001, Jones released &quot;Round One: The Album&quot;, a rap CD. That year he retained the title against Derrick Harmon by a knockout in ten and against future world champion Julio César González of Mexico by a 12-round unanimous decision before a crowd of 20,409. The three judges scored it (119–106, 118–107, 119–106) all for Jones. Jones knocked Gonzalez down in rounds one, five and twelve and earned a $1.5 million purse. Jones landed 192 of 375 punches (51%) whilst Gonzalez connected on a very low 91 of 609 (15%). Jones was awarded the World Boxing Federation&#x27;s light heavyweight title on in November 2001.

In 2002, Jones retained his title by knocking out Australian boxer Glen Kelly in seven rounds. Jones put both hands behind his back. As Kelly moved in behind a jab, Jones went over the jab with a right to the head. Kelly went down and was counted out. Jones landed 124 of 249 punches (50%) and Kelly connected on 42 of 171 (25%). Before this bout, Jones was awarded &quot;The Ring&quot; Championship belt.

Jones then defeated future world champion, WBC No. 1 Clinton Woods by technical knockout before a crowd of 16,229. He performed a song from his CD during his ring entrance. The bout was stopped in round 6 after Woods&#x27; corner threw in the towel. Jones landed 140 of 300 punches (47%) and Woods connected on 39 of 166 (23%).

===Heavyweight champion===
====Jones vs. Ruiz====

On March 1, 2003, at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Jones defeated John Ruiz, the man who defeated an aging Evander Holyfield, for the WBA Heavyweight title in front of 15,300 fans. Jones officially weighed in at and Ruiz at . Jones became the first former middleweight title holder to win a Heavyweight title in 106 years. Jones also became the first fighter to start his career as a light middleweight and win a heavyweight title, and the second reigning light heavyweight champion after Michael Spinks in 1985 to move up in weight and claim a major heavyweight championship in his first fight in the division. Jones was guaranteed $10 million against 60% of the profits. Ruiz had no guarantee. He received 40% of the profits, which he had to share with promoter Don King. Jones won on all three scorecards (116–112, 118–110 &amp; 117–111). According to Mark Taffet, HBO&#x27;s senior vice president of sports operations and pay-per-view, the fight generated 602,000 pay-per-view buys.

===Return to light heavyweight===
====Jones vs. Tarver====

Jones chose to return to the light heavyweight division and on November 8, 2003, he defeated Antonio Tarver to retain the IBO and &quot;The Ring&quot; Light Heavyweight Championships, win Tarver&#x27;s WBC title, and win the vacant WBA (Unified) title. Jones appeared a lot weaker after coming back down to the light heavyweight division, losing the muscle he gained for the heavyweight fight seemed to have taken a toll on his aging body and his cat-like reflexes appeared diminished. Jones won by majority decision, the judges giving him 117–111, 116–112 and 114–114.

===Fall from grace===
====Jones vs. Tarver II====

On May 15, 2004, Jones faced Tarver in a rematch. Jones was heavily favored to win, but Tarver knocked him down at 1:31 of the second round. Jones had won the first round (Tarver only landed two punches in the first round), but in the second, as Jones tried a combination, he was caught by a big counter left hook from Tarver. Jones got on his feet by the count, but for the first time in his career was ruled unable to continue by referee Jay Nady.

====Jones vs. Johnson====

On September 25, 2004, Jones attempted to win the IBF light heavyweight title from Glen Johnson in a match in Memphis, Tennessee. Johnson knocked out Jones 49 seconds into the ninth round. Jones lay on the canvas for three minutes after being counted out. Johnson was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards at the time of the knockout (77–75, 77–75, 78–74) and had landed 118 punches to Jones&#x27;s 75. Jones used the ring&#x27;s canvas that night as a billboard for his upcoming rap CD, which came out November 1.

====Jones vs. Tarver III====

After almost a year away from the ring, focusing on training and working as an analyst for HBO Boxing, Jones scheduled a third fight with Antonio Tarver, on October 1, 2005, a sellout crowd of 20,895 at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida, which aired on HBO PPV. For only the second time in his career, Jones was considered an underdog going into the fight.

Tarver won by unanimous decision (117–111, 116–112, 116–112) and had Jones out on his feet in the 11th round. Tarver landed 158 of 620 punches (25%) and Jones connected on 85 of 320 (27%). Despite being clearly behind from early in the contest, there was little urgency in either Jones&#x27; corner or his performance as he seemed content to make it to the end of the fight following his back-to-back knockout losses.

In the post-fight interview with ESPN&#x27;s Brian Kenny, Jones said that he would like to fight again. He would welcome a fourth bout with Tarver or another duel with Johnson. The fighters earned in excess of $4 million apiece plus a share of pay-per-view revenues, with the fight generating 440,000 pay-per-view buys.

====Fallout with HBO====

After the loss in the third Tarver bout, Jones resumed his duties as a commentator for &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;, calling the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Sharmba Mitchell fight on November 19, 2005, and the Jermain Taylor–Bernard Hopkins rematch on December 3, 2005. His return to the network was short-lived, as Jones was let go from his ringside analyst role in January 2006. HBO cited his reported lack of commitment to attending the network&#x27;s production meetings. Jones returned as a guest analyst for several bouts in 2010, and HBO brought him back the next year as their analyst for Boxing After Dark.

===Comeback trail===

====Back to winning ways====

Jones took on Prince Badi Ajamu (25–2–1, 14 KOs) on July 29, 2006, at the Qwest Arena in Boise, Idaho. Jones defeated Ajamu by a unanimous decision (119–106, 3 times), winning the WBO NABO light heavyweight title. Ajamu won the first round on all three official scorecards, however it was the only round he won. Ajamu also lost two points for repeated low blows in round seven and one more in round eight.

Next up for Jones was the undefeated 29-year-old Anthony Hanshaw (24–0–1, 14 KOs), on July 14, 2007, at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi. Hanshaw was ranked 11th by the IBF at super middleweight. Hanshaw was knocked down in the 11th round. Jones won the bout by unanimous decision (114–113, 117–110, 118–109) to claim the vacant International Boxing Council light heavyweight title.

====Jones vs. Trinidad====
On January 19, 2008, Jones faced former three-weight world champion Félix Trinidad at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trinidad had also won the WBA Middleweight Title by defeating then Champion William Joppy. The bout was fought at a catchweight of 170 lbs. Jones had a noticeable size and speed advantage, and in round seven, a short right hand to the temple dropped Trinidad to his knees. Jones fired a combination in the tenth round to send Trinidad down once more. Jones won the fight by scores of 117–109 and 116–110 (twice). This was the first time a former heavyweight champion returned to fight successfully at 170 lbs. The fight generated 500,000 pay-per-view buys and $25 million in domestic television revenue. This was also the last fight of Trinidad&#x27;s career.

====Jones vs. Calzaghe====

After Joe Calzaghe&#x27;s split from promoter Frank Warren, it was officially announced that Roy Jones Jr. and Joe Calzaghe had reached an agreement to fight for &quot;The Ring&quot; Light Heavyweight Championship in New York City at Madison Square Garden on September 20, 2008, on HBO PPV. However, Calzaghe claimed injury to his right hand in training, so the fight had to be postponed a couple of weeks, with November 8 being set as the new date.

In the first round, Jones caught Calzaghe with an uppercut and knocked him down, as well as cutting the Welshman on the bridge of the nose. However, Jones failed to capitalize on the knock down. In the 2nd round Calzaghe began to control the action and dominated Jones throughout the remainder of the fight. As the fight progressed Jones absorbed more and more punishment and suffered a cut over his left eye. Jones&#x27; corner, who had never seen Roy cut before, didn&#x27;t know how to properly handle the situation and blood covered the left side of his face. Ultimately, Jones lost by unanimous decision, winning only one round (10–8 in the first) on the 3 official judges&#x27; cards. There was a crowd of 14,152. The fight generated 225,000 pay-per-view buys. It was reported that Calzaghe was paid $10 million from the fight. The fight aired in the UK on Setanta Sports after 4:30 am local time, peaking at 500,000 viewers.

====Jones vs. Sheika====
It was announced that Jones would next fight Omar Sheika (27–8, 18 KOs) on March 21, 2009, at the Civic Center, Pensacola, Florida. Jones defeated Sheika via fifth-round technical knockout to claim the vacant WBO NABO light heavyweight title. The fight was the main event of a pay-per-view titled &quot;&quot;March Badness&quot;, which included both boxing and mixed martial arts matches. Sheika had previously defeated Glen Johnson, who had knocked out Jones in 2004 and came into this fight having lost six of his last ten bouts. It was only his second fight since September 2005. Jones came in ranked as the #6 light heavyweight in the world by &quot;The Ring&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==== Jones vs. Lacy ====

On August 15, 2009, Jones beat former super middleweight champion Jeff Lacy (25–2, 17 KOs) in 10 rounds after Lacy&#x27;s corner stopped the fight. The fight, billed as &quot;Hook City&quot;&quot;, going off the boxers&#x27; nicknames of &#x27;&quot;Captain Hook&quot;&#x27; and &quot;&#x27;Left Hook&quot;&#x27;, took place at the Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi. Lacy had never been knocked out or stopped before. Lacy had tried to pin Jones on the ropes throughout the fight, but Jones was unaffected by the tactic and seemed more worried about playing to the crowd than about Lacy&#x27;s punches. There was a discussion in Lacy&#x27;s corner after the ninth round about stopping it, but Lacy, convinced his team to give him another round. Jones landed 249 of 500 punches (50%) while Lacy connected on 104 of 429 (24%). Jones was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards at the time of stoppage (99–91, 100–89, 98–92).

===Consecutive defeats===

====Jones vs. Green====
In December 2009, Roy Jones was set to face Australian boxer Danny Green in Sydney, Australia. In the weeks leading up to this fight, there were reports in the newspapers indicating difficulties getting Roy&#x27;s sparring partners into Australia. Then on December 2, 2009, following an extensive pre-fight delay due to hand wrap protests, Danny Green defeated Jones via first-round TKO. Jones was initially gracious in his humbling defeat, stating that &quot;We don&#x27;t make excuses, it was a great performance by Danny.&quot; However, less than a month later, Jones would launch a formal complaint, accusing Green of using illegal hand wraps and demanding his loss be overturned, though the decision was upheld. Though Jones&#x27; rematch with Hopkins looked to be in trouble following Jones&#x27; loss, the two sides would officially come to an agreement in February 2010 for an April 3 bout.

====Jones vs. Hopkins II====

Roy Jones Jr. and Bernard Hopkins (50–5–1, 32 KOs) met in a rematch bout, on April 3, 2010, at the Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, 17 years after their first fight. Jones entered with a record of 5–5 in his previous ten bouts dating back to May 2004 whilst Hopkins came in 4–1 since June 2006. After going the distance, Hopkins was awarded with a unanimous decision (118–109, 117–110 twice). Hopkins landed 184 of 526 punches (35%), while Jones connected on 82 of 274 (30%). Hopkins collapsed to his knees in his dressing room, drained from a brutal fight and exhausted by the end of his 17-year wait for revenge against Jones. The fight generated 150,000 pay-per-view buys.

====Jones vs. Lebedev====
In February 2011, Vladimir Hryunov confirmed that negotiations were taking place for Denis Lebedev (21–1, 16 KOs) to fight Jones in Moscow. Lebedev had just come off a controversial split decision loss to Marco Huck. At the time, Lebedev was ranked #4 at cruiserweight by &quot;The Ring&quot;. On 24 March, a deal had been agreed which would see Jones earn a $500,000 purse. The fight, a 10-round bout, which was billed as the &quot;Battle of Two Empires&quot; was announced to take place on May 22 at Dynamo Palace of Sports in Krylatskoye. 2,000 tickets were reportedly sold on the day of release. The promoters expected a sellout.

Lebedev knocked Jones out with 2 seconds left in their 10-round bout. After round 9, the scorecards read (87–84, 85–86, 90–81). The controversy arose when Lebedev punched Jones, when it was, to some, clear that Jones was not responsive and was out on his feet. The final punch put Jones out cold on the canvas and he did not regain his senses for more than 5 minutes amid active medical help. After the bout, Lebedev said that he had nothing to be sorry about. Referee Steve Smoger was also accused of incompetence because he did not stop the fight even though Jones could no longer defend himself which led to Jones taking unnecessary damage. In a statement following the fight, Smoger said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t stop the fight because there were only a matter of seconds remaining in the fight and it seemed that Roy was pretending, trying to trick his opponent. He did this repeatedly in the fight. So I thought Jones was doing the same thing here, trying to deceive Lebedev in the final seconds of the fight in order to lure Denis in to land a big punch [which Jones managed to do in the previous round].&quot; Jones, when asked about his feelings on the punch responded, &quot;I forgive him&quot;.

===Cruiserweight===

====Jones vs. Alexander====
Jones won a 10-round unanimous decision against Max Alexander on December 10, 2011, in Atlanta, snapping a three-match losing streak, and winning the Universal Boxing Organisation (UBO) Intercontinental cruiserweight championship. The three judges scored the bout all in Jones&#x27; favour (100–90, 100–90 &amp; 99–91). Jones rarely pressed over the first seven rounds but put together several combinations in the eighth and 10th rounds to beat Alexander. After the fight, Jones said, &quot;I&#x27;m feeling wonderful. I want a cruiserweight title, the world title&quot;, said Jones, who weighed in at 189 pounds. &quot;This is just a start. I&#x27;m not through yet.&quot; The fight was aired live on Internet PPV channel Ustream for $9.99.

====Jones vs. Głażewski====
Jones was due to fight Polish boxer Dawid Kostecki (39–1, 25 KOs) in a ten-round bout at Atlas Arena, Poland on June 30.

====Jones vs. Maccarinelli====

On October 28, 2015, it was announced that Jones would be fighting former WBO cruiserweight champion Enzo Maccarinelli, 35, who had a career record of 40 wins and 7 losses, for the WBA &#x27;super&#x27; world cruiserweight title. However, this was a &#x27;false rumour&#x27;. It was however announced that they would fight on December 12, 2015, in a non-title cruiserweight battle. This was Jones&#x27; first fight since being granted Russian citizenship and he was going into it with eight straight victories, with the last four inside the distance. The fight took place at the VTB Ice Palace in Moscow.

After an evenly matched 3 rounds, the 4th round started more in Maccarinelli&#x27;s favour. Halfway through the round, Maccarinelli dropped Jones with an uppercut. Jones beat the count and carried on for 10–12 seconds more with his gloves to his face, eating several more uppercuts. Against the ropes, he then absorbed a huge right hook which caused him to stiffen and fall face down on the canvas. Referee Ingo Barrabas waved off the fight in what was Jones&#x27; 9th career defeat, the 5th by KO.

====Jones vs. Phillips====
On March 20, 2016, Jones fought in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Celebrity Theatre against 33-year-old MMA fighter Vyron Phillips, who had won the right to fight him after having been selected through a vote on Facebook. Phillips, who fought in his first boxing match, was 5–3 in MMA bouts and 6–1 as an amateur boxer.

====Jones vs. Moore====
Square Ring Promotions announced on July 29, Jones would return to his hometown, Pensacola Bay Center in Pensacola, Florida, on August 13 against journeyman &quot;Rockin&#x27;&quot; Rodney Moore (17–11–2, 7 KOs) in a cruiserweight bout. The fight headlined the &quot;Island Fights 38&quot; card, an ongoing series that combines boxing matches and MMA bouts on the same show. Jones last fought in Pensacola in March 2015, when he knocked out Paul Vasquez in the first round. Moore did not fight between 2005 and 2012 and has lost nine consecutive fights, although only one of them came by knockout. That was a second-round stoppage to top cruiserweight contender Murat Gassiev 13 months ago. On fight night, in front of more than 5,000 fans in attendance, in a slow-paced affair, Jones won a one-sided 10 round unanimous decision with shutout scores of 100–90 on all three cards.

It was noted that Jones incurred a tear in his right biceps in round five and fought the rest of the bout one handed and admitted after the bout the healing time required for his torn right biceps probably meant the end of his long career. In October, Jones stated his intentions to continue fighting on and not retiring from the sport.

====Jones vs. Gunn====

At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72–0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, &quot;I always do things that people don&#x27;t expect me to do. I promised Bobby a long time ago that I would give him the opportunity, and I am a man of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again.&quot; At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn in the beginning of the 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.

Jones spoke about his desire to continue his boxing career further, &quot;Anything is possible, I&#x27;m not going to make an immediate decision. Why would I stop when I looked that good though?... I want a shot at a cruiserweight title ... I do intend on fighting and we&#x27;ll see what happens in the future. I looked good.&quot; Jones later told On The Ropes Boxing Radio, &quot;Yeah I think it&#x27;s my last year in boxing, and I tell people all the time.&quot; Hinting he may retire at the end of 2017. On December 3, 2017, after Miguel Cotto&#x27;s farewell fight re-iterated his desire to continue boxing.

=== Retirement ===

==== Jones vs. Sigmon ====
On December 30, 2017, Jones announced that he would return to the Bay Center in Pensacola, Florida to headline the Island Fights 46 on February 8, 2018. Jones had previously headlined Island Fights, which is a show that included both boxing and MMA bouts. Speaking of the event, Jones said, &quot;My last day at the Bay. It&#x27;s my last one for the bayfront ... Civic Center, Pensacola, Bayfront Arena, whatever you want to call it. So if you want to come to see my last day in Pensacola, be there February 8. That&#x27;s my last one there.&quot; He stated it would be his final fight. Jones announced Scott Sigmon (30–11–1, 16 KOs) as his opponent for the 10 round bout. Jones ended his boxing career defeating Sigmon via a one-sided 10 round unanimous decision, also winning the vacant World Boxing Union cruiserweight title in the process. All three judges scored the fight 98–92 in favour of Jones. Jones started off the better boxer landed upper cuts and hooks and remained in control throughout the fight. Jones landed an uppercut in round 5 which knocked Sigmon&#x27;s mouthpiece out. In round 6, Sigmon began throwing more punches, although they were weak combinations easily blocked by Jones. Jones was also able to counter most of the shots Sigmon threw.

After the fight, Jones stated he had fought with a bicep injury. He also called for a boxing match against 42-year-old former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva. In the post-fight interview, he said, &quot;I knew Scott was tough, I knew Scott was game and I knew Scott would keep coming. However, I don&#x27;t make excuses, but last week I tore my biceps in my left arm again and I refused to pull out. Other than that [fight], chapter closed.&quot; Jones retired after 75 professional fights over 29 years; 66 wins, 47 coming inside the distance and 9 losses.

=== Return ===

==== Jones vs. Pettis ====

On February 6, 2023, it was announced that Jones would take on former UFC and WEC Lightweight Champion Anthony Pettis on April 1. The bout took place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the hometown of Pettis. Pettis defeated Jones Jr. via majority decision after 8 rounds.

==Exhibition bout==
It was announced in July 2020 that Jones had signed a contract to face former undisputed heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, in an eight-round exhibition fight. The bout—officially sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC)—was initially scheduled to take place on September 12 at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, however, the date was pushed back to November 28 in order to maximize revenue for the event. The fight lasted the full 8 rounds, and was declared a draw.

==Personal life==
Jones was born in Pensacola, Florida. His mother, Carol, was warm and easy-going, whereas his father, Roy Sr., was much like a Marine Drill Instructor with respect to his son. A decorated Vietnam veteran, ex-club fighter and retired aircraft engineer who had taken up hog farming, Roy Sr. was harsh on his son from early on, taunting the child, &quot;sparring&quot; with him, enraging him, yelling at him and abusing him, often for 20 minutes at a time. Roy Jr. lived in constant fear of his father&#x27;s verbal and physical violence against him.

Jones described his childhood in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;: &quot;After a while I didn&#x27;t care about gettin&#x27; hurt or dyin&#x27; anymore. I was in pain all day, every day, I was so scared of my father. He&#x27;d pull up in his truck and start lookin&#x27; for something I&#x27;d done wrong. There was no escape, no excuse, no way out of nothin&#x27;. ... Getting&#x27; hurt or dyin&#x27; might&#x27;ve been better than the life I was livin&#x27;. ... Used to think about killin&#x27; myself anyway.&quot;

Roy Sr. ran his own boxing gym, to which he devoted all his available time and financial resources. He offered direction to numerous youths and steered many of them away from trouble. Roy Sr. did everything possible to expand the program and help more kids. But toward his own son he was merciless, driving Roy Jr. to the brink of exhaustion, screaming at him in front of all the other fighters and assaulting him.&quot;

Using his birds as an image for his own predicament, Jones said in the same &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; piece: &quot;I spent all my life in my dad&#x27;s cage. I could never be 100 percent of who I am until I left it. But because of him, nothing bothers me. I&#x27;ll never face anything stronger and harder than what I already have.&quot;

On August 19, 2015, Roy Jones Jr. met with Vladimir Putin in Sevastopol, Crimea, to ask for Russian citizenship. Jones stated that he often visited Russia for business activity, and a passport would avoid inconvenient rides. Jones was granted Russian citizenship on September 12. He was banned from entering Ukraine after arriving to Russian-occupied Crimea from Russia.

Jones and his wife have three children. Their eldest son, Roy III, played basketball at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada. On June 24, 2024, Jones announced his son Deandre had committed suicide at age 32 two nights prior.

<text>Khoisan ( ) or  () is a catch-all term for the indigenous peoples of Southern Africa who traditionally speak non-Bantu languages, combining the Khoekhoen and the Sān peoples. Khoisan populations traditionally speak click languages. They are considered to be the historical communities throughout Southern Africa, remaining predominant until European colonisation in areas climatically unfavorable to Bantu (sorghum-based) agriculture, such as the Cape region, through to Namibia, where populations of Nama and Damara people are prevalent groups, and Botswana. Considerable mingling with Bantu-speaking groups is evidenced by prevalence of click phonemes in many Southern African Bantu languages, especially Xhosa.

Many Khoesān peoples are the descendants of a very early dispersal of anatomically modern humans to Southern Africa before 150,000 years ago. (However, see below for recent work supporting a multi-regional hypothesis that suggests the Khoisan may be a source population for anatomically modern humans.) Their languages show a limited typological similarity, largely confined to the prevalence of click consonants. They are not verifiably derived from a single common proto-language, but are today split among at least three separate and unrelated language families (Khoe-Kwadi, Tuu and Kxʼa). It has been suggested that the Khoekhoe may represent Late Stone Age arrivals to Southern Africa, possibly displaced by Bantu expansion reaching the area roughly between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago.

Sān are popularly thought of as foragers in the Kalahari Desert and regions of Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Northern South Africa. The word &quot;sān&quot; is from the Khoekhoe language and refers to foragers (&quot;those who pick things up from the ground&quot;) who do not own livestock. As such, it was used in reference to all hunter-gatherer populations who came into contact with Khoekhoe-speaking communities, and largely referred to the lifestyle, distinct from a pastoralist or agriculturalist one, and not to any particular ethnicity. While there are attendant cosmologies and languages associated with this way of life, the term is an economic designator rather than a cultural or ethnic one.

==Name==
The compound term &quot;Khoisan&quot; / &quot;Khoesān&quot; is a modern anthropological convention in use since the early-to-mid 20th century. &quot;Khoisan&quot; is a coinage by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s and popularised by Isaac Schapera. It entered wider usage from the 1960s based on the proposal of a &quot;Khoisan&quot; language family by Joseph Greenberg.

During the Colonial/Apartheid era, Afrikaans-speaking persons with partial Khoesān ancestry were historically also grouped as Cape Blacks () or Western Cape Blacks () to rather inaccurately distinguish them from the Bantu-speaking peoples, the other indigenous African population of South Africa who also had significant Khoe-San ancestry.

The term &quot;Khoisan&quot; (also spelled &quot;KhoiSan&quot;, &quot;Khoi-San&quot;, &quot;Khoe-San&quot;) has also been introduced in South African usage as a self-designation after the end of apartheid in the late 1990s. Since the 2010s, there has been a &quot;Khoisan activist&quot; movement, demanding recognition and land rights from the government and white minority which owns large parts of the country&#x27;s private land.


==History==
===Origins===


It is suggested that the ancestors of the modern Khoisan expanded to southern Africa (from East or Central Africa) before 150,000 years ago, possibly as early as before 260,000 years ago, so that by the beginning of the MIS 5 &quot;megadrought&quot; 130,000 years ago, there were two ancestral population clusters in Africa, bearers of mt-DNA haplogroup L0 in southern Africa ancestral to the Khoi-San, and bearers of haplogroup L1-6 in central/eastern Africa ancestral to everyone else. This group gave rise to the San population of hunter gatherers. A much later wave of migration, around or before the beginning of the Common Era, gave rise to the Khoe people, who were pastoralists.

Due to their early expansion and separation, the populations ancestral to the Khoisan have been estimated as having represented the &quot;largest human population&quot; during the majority of the anatomically modern human timeline, from their early separation before 150 kya until the recent peopling of Eurasia some 70 kya. They were much more widespread than today, their modern distribution being due to their decimation in the course of the Bantu expansion. They were dispersed throughout much of southern and southeastern Africa. There was also a significant back-migration of bearers of L0 towards eastern Africa between 120 and 75 kya. Rito et al. (2013) speculate that pressure from such back-migration may even have contributed to the dispersal of East African populations out of Africa at about 70 kya.
Recent work has suggested that the multi-regional hypothesis may be supported by current human population genetic data. A 2023 study published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; suggests that current genetic data may be best understood as reflecting internal admixtures of multiple population sources across Africa, including ancestral populations of the Khoisan.

===Late Stone Age===

The San populations ancestral to the Khoisan were spread throughout much of southern and eastern Africa throughout the Late Stone Age after about 75 ka. A further expansion dated to about 20 ka has been proposed based 
on the distribution of the L0d haplogroup. Rosti et al. suggest a connection of this recent expansion with the spread of click consonants to eastern African languages (Hadza language).

The Late Stone Age Sangoan industry occupied southern Africa in areas where annual rainfall is less than a metre (1000 mm; 39.4 in). The contemporary San and Khoi peoples resemble those represented by the ancient Sangoan skeletal remains.

Against the traditional interpretation that finds a common origin for the Khoi and San, other evidence has suggested that the ancestors of the Khoi peoples are relatively recent pre-Bantu agricultural immigrants to southern Africa who abandoned agriculture as the climate dried and either joined the San as hunter-gatherers or retained pastoralism.

With the hypothesised arrival of pastoralists &amp; bantoid agro-pastoralists in southern Africa starting around 2,300 years ago, linguistic development is later seen in the click consonants and loan words from ancient Khoe-san languages into the evolution of blended agro-pastoralist &amp; hunter-gatherer communities that would eventually evolve into the now extant, amalgamated modern native linguistic communities found in South Africa, Botswana &amp; Namibia (e.g. in South African Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Zulu people.)

Today these groups represent the quantitative majority of extant admixed ancient Khoe-San descendants by the millions.

===Historical period===

The Khoikhoi enter the historical record with their first contact with Portuguese explorers, about 1,000 years after their displacement by the Bantu. Local population dropped after the Khoi were exposed to smallpox from Europeans. The Khoi waged more frequent attacks against Europeans when the Dutch East India Company enclosed traditional grazing land for farms. Khoikhoi social organisation was profoundly damaged and, in the end, destroyed by colonial expansion and land seizure from the late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, some Khoikhoi people settled on farms and became bondsmen (bondservants) or farm workers; many were incorporated into existing Khoi clan and family groups of the Xhosa people. Georg Schmidt, a Moravian Brother from Herrnhut, Saxony, now Germany, founded Genadendal in 1738, which was the first mission station in southern Africa, among the Khoi people in Baviaanskloof in the Riviersonderend Mountains. Early European settlers sometimes intermarried with Khoikhoi women, resulting in a sizeable mixed-race population now known as the Griqua. The Griqua people too would migrate to what was by that time the frontierlands of the Xhosa native reserves and establish Griqualand East, which contained a mostly Xhosa population.

Andries Stockenström facilitated the creation of the &quot;Kat River&quot; Khoi settlement near the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. The settlements thrived and expanded, and Kat River quickly became a large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less autonomously. The people were predominantly Afrikaans-speaking Gonaqua Khoi, but the settlement also began to attract other Khoi, Xhosa and mixed-race groups of the Cape.

The so-called &quot;Bushman wars&quot;were to a large extent the response of the San after their dispossession.

At the start of the 18th century, the Khoikhoi in the Western Cape lived in a state dominated by the Dutch. By the end of the century the majority of the Khoisan operated as &#x27;wage labourers&#x27;, not that dissimilar to slaves. Geographically, the further away the labourer was from Cape Town, the more difficult it became to transport agricultural produce to the markets. The issuing of grazing licences north of the Berg River in what was then the Tulbagh Basin propelled colonial expansion in the area. This system of land relocation led to the Khoijhou losing their land and livestock as well as dramatic change in the social, economic and political development.

After the defeat of the Xhosa rebellion in 1853, the new Cape Government endeavoured to grant the Khoi political rights to avert future racial discontent. The government enacted the Cape franchise in 1853, which decreed that all male citizens meeting a low property test, regardless of colour, had the right to vote and to seek election in Parliament. The property test was an indirect way by the British Cape Government (who took over from the Dutch in 1812) to retain a racist based system of governance because on average only white people owned property adequate to meet the test.

In the Herero and Nama genocide in German South-West Africa, over 10,000 Nama are estimated to have been killed during 1904–1908.

The San of the Kalahari were described in &quot;Specimens of Bushman Folklore&quot; by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and Lucy C. Lloyd (1911). They were brought to the globalised world&#x27;s attention in the 1950s by South African author Laurens van der Post in a six-part television documentary. The Ancestral land conflict in Botswana concerns the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), established in 1961 for wildlife, while the San were permitted to continue their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In the 1990s, the government of Botswana began a policy of &quot;relocating&quot; CKGR residents outside the reserve. In 2002, the government cut off all services to CKGR residents. A legal battle began, and in 2006 the High Court of Botswana ruled that the residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed. The policy of relocation continued, however, and in 2012 the San people (Basarwa) appealed to the United Nations to force the government to recognise their land and resource rights.

Following the end of Apartheid in 1994, the term &quot;Khoisan&quot; has gradually come to be used as a self-designation by South African Khoikhoi as representing the &quot;first nations&quot; of South Africa vis-a-vis the ruling Bantu majority. A conference on &quot;Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage&quot; was organised by the University of the Western Cape in 1997. and &quot;Khoisan activism&quot; has been reported in the South African media beginning in 2015.

The South African government allowed Khoisan families (up until 1998) to pursue land claims which existed prior to 1913. The South African Deputy Chief Land Claims Commissioner, Thami Mdontswa, has said that constitutional reform would be required to enable Khoisan people to pursue further claims to land from which their direct ancestors were removed prior to 9 June 1913.

=== Discoveries ===
In 2019, scientists from the University of the Free State discovered 8,000-year-old carvings made by the Khoisan people. The carvings depicted a hippopotamus, horse, and antelope in the &#x27;Rain Snake&#x27; Dyke of the Vredefort impact structure, which may have spiritual significance regarding the rain-making mythology of the Khoisan.

== Violence against the Khoisan ==
===Herero and Nama genocide===

In the Herero and Nama genocide, about 10,000 Nama, a Khoekhoe group, and an unknown number of San people were killed in an extermination campaign by the German Colonial Empire between 1904 and 1908.

===Forced relocation in Botswana===

In Botswana, many of the indigenous San people have been forcibly relocated from their land to reservations. To make them relocate, they were denied access to water on their land and faced arrest if they hunted, which was their primary source of food. Their lands lie in the middle of the world&#x27;s richest diamond field. Officially, the government denies that there is any link to mining and claims the relocation is to preserve the wildlife and ecosystem, even though the San people have lived sustainably on the land for millennia. On the reservations they struggle to find employment, and alcoholism is rampant.

==Languages==

The &quot;Khoisan languages&quot; were proposed as a linguistic phylum by Joseph Greenberg in 1955. Their genetic relationship was questioned later in the 20th century, and the term now serves mostly as a convenience term without implying genetic unity, much like &quot;Papuan&quot; and &quot;Australian&quot; are. Their most notable uniting feature is their click consonants.

They are categorised in two families, and a number of possible language isolates.

The Kxʼa family was proposed in 2010, combining the ǂʼAmkoe (ǂHoan) language with the ǃKung (Juu) dialect cluster. ǃKung includes about a dozen dialects, with no clear-cut delineation between them. Sands et al. (2010) propose a division into four clusters:

* Northern ǃKung (Sekele), spoken in Angola around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers (but with many refugees now in Namibia),
* North-Central ǃKung (Ekoka), spoken in Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border,
* Central ǃKung, spoken around Grootfontein, Namibia, west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River
* Southeastern ǃKung (Juǀʼhoan), spoken in Botswana east of the Okavango Delta, and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu, Gobabis, and the Caprivi Strip.

The Khoi (Khoe) family is divided into a Khoikhoi (Khoekhoe and Khoemana dialects) and a Kalahari (Tshu–Khwe) branch. The Kalahari branch of Khoe includes Shua and Tsoa (with dialects), and Kxoe, Naro, Gǁana and ǂHaba (with dialects). Khoe also has been tentatively aligned with Kwadi (&quot;Kwadi–Khoe&quot;), and more speculatively with the Sandawe language of Tanzania (&quot;Khoe–Sandawe&quot;). The Hadza language of Tanzania has been associated with the Khoisan group due to the presence of click consonants.

== Physical characteristics and genetics ==
The Khoisan are one of the only populations with epicanthic folds outside of East Asia. They typically have hair texture of the tightest possible curl, a form of kinky hair sometimes referred to as &quot;peppercorn&quot; because of how it can roll into separate rounds on the scalp.

Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan and sexual selection in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; in 1882, commenting that their steatopygia, seen primarily in females, evolved through sexual selection in human evolution, and that &quot;the posterior part of the body projects in a wonderful manner&quot;. Historically, some females were observed by anthropologists to exhibit elongated labia minora, which sometimes projected as much as 10 cm below the vulva when standing. Though well documented, the motivations behind this practice and the voices of the women who perform it are rarely explored in the research.

In the 1990s, genomic studies of the world&#x27;s peoples found that the Y chromosome of San men share certain patterns of polymorphisms that are distinct from those of all other populations. Because the Y chromosome is highly conserved between generations, this type of DNA test is used to determine when different subgroups separated from one another, and hence their last common ancestry. The authors of these studies suggested that the San may have been one of the first populations to differentiate from the most recent common paternal ancestor of all extant humans. 

Various Y-chromosome studies since confirmed that the Khoisan carry some of the most divergent (oldest) Y-chromosome haplogroups. These haplogroups are specific sub-groups of haplogroups A and B, the two earliest branches on the human Y-chromosome tree.

Similar to findings from Y-chromosome studies, mitochondrial DNA studies also showed evidence that the Khoisan people carry high frequencies of the earliest haplogroup branches in the human mitochondrial DNA tree. The most divergent (oldest) mitochondrial haplogroup, L0d, has been identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African Khoi and San groups. The distinctiveness of the Khoisan in both matrilineal and patrilineal groupings is a further indicator that they represent a population historically distinct from other Africans.

Some genomic studies have further revealed that Khoisan groups have been influenced by 9 to 30% genetic admixture in the last few thousand years from an East African population who carried a Eurasian admixture component. Furthermore, they place an East African origin for the paternal haplogroup E1b1b found in these Southern African populations, as well as the introduction of pastoralism into the region. The paper also noted that the Bantu expansion had a notable genetic impact in a number of Khoisan groups. On the basis of PCA projections, the East African ancestry identified in the genomes of Khoe-Kwadi speakers and other southern Africans is related to an individual from the Tanzanian Luxmanda.

Geneticists in 2024 sampled ancient 10,000 year old remains from South Africa, Oakhurst Rockshelter. The examined population had a strong genetic continuity with the San and Khoe. The later advent of pastoralism and farming groups in the last 2,000 years would transform the genepool of most parts of Southern Africa, but many Khoisan preserve, and are identical to the genetic signature of the older hunter-gatherers.

==Centre==
On 21 September 2020, the University of Cape Town launched its new Khoi and San Centre, with an undergraduate degree programme planned to be rolled out in the following years. The centre will support and consolidate this collaborative work on research commissions on language (including Khoekhoegowab), sacred human remains, land and gender. Many descendants of Khoisan people still live on the Cape Flats.

<text>Dalarna (; ), also referred to by the English exonyms Dalecarlia and the Dales, is a (historical province) in central Sweden.

Dalarna adjoins Härjedalen, Hälsingland, Gästrikland, Västmanland and Värmland. It is also bordered by Norway in the west. The province&#x27;s borders mostly coincide with the modern administrative Dalarna County ().

The area is a holiday destination for Swedes from the south, who often travel there in the summer, drawn by its fishing lakes, campgrounds, and forests. Some Swedes own or rent a second home in Dalarna, where vegetable gardens and apple trees are commonplace. In mid-June, midsummer celebrations and dances are held in many of the small villages and in the larger cities. Dalarna is a region full of historical associations, and both its products and its people have strong local characteristics. In the western district Lima, some people in villages speak a traditional dialect, Dalecarlian, while in Älvdalen, they speak Elfdalian, a dialect which is very distinct from Swedish, Norwegian or Danish. Historically, the people of Dalecarlia – called Dalecarlians, or Dalesmen (&quot;dalkarlar, masar&quot;) and Daleswomen (&quot;kullor&quot;) – have been famous for their independent nature toward authority.

The Old Norse form of the province name is &quot;Járnberaland&quot;, which means &quot;the land of the iron carriers.&quot;

Dalarna is roughly the size of the whole of Jutland (Denmark).

== Administration ==
The provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes, but function as historical and cultural entities. In the case of &quot;Dalarna,&quot; a corresponding administrative Dalarna County has almost, but not exactly, the same boundaries as the province, except for a part of the northeast (Hamra parish, also known as Orsa Finnmark) which forms part of Ljusdal Municipality, Gävleborg County.

== Heraldry ==
Dalarna&#x27;s coat of arms dates from 1560; the use of two crossed arrows as a symbol precedes this. A Duchy of Dalecarlia also exists, and the provincial arms include a ducal coronet.

Blazon: &quot;Azure, two Dalecarlian Arrows Or in saltire point upwards pointed Argent and in chief a Crown of the first&quot;.

As early as 1525, the arrows appeared in use on a seal. Dalarna County uses the same coat of arms, granted for the then Kopparberg County in 1936.

== Geography ==
The northern part of the province is dominated by mountains and the vast Orsa Finnmark area. The southern part of the province is part of the Bergslagen region, and consists mostly of plains, hills and forested areas. There are several copper mines in the southern part, most notorious of which being the Falun Mine. The highest point is Storvätteshågna, at 1,204 meters above sea level. The lowest point is in the southeast, at 55 meters above sea level.

=== Lakes ===

* Dalarna&#x27;s largest lake is lake Siljan, in the middle part of Dalarna. There the Västerdal River and Österdal River join the Dal River. 
* Dalarna&#x27;s second largest lake is Runn, which lies between Falun and Borlänge. With of water and over 50 islands, the lake is a tourist destination.

*Falun (1641)
*Hedemora (approximately 1400)

== History ==
The province of Dalarna formed part of Svealand before the formation of Sweden in the 11th century.

Three historically notorious rebellions started in the Dalarna province:

* In 1434, led by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson, the miners rose against the oppression of the officers of Eric of Pomerania.
* In 1519–1523 Gustav Vasa found his first and staunchest supporters among the miners in his revolt against the Kalmar Union under King Christian II.
* In 1524–1533 the Dalecarlians and local nobles rebelled against Gustav&#x27;s increasingly autocratic rule and reformist religious policies; three uprisings were brutally suppressed. Some of the leaders were executed as alleged collaborators of King Christian during the liberation war.
* In 1743, the Dalecarlian Rebellion against the Hats, which was the last major peasants&#x27; uprising in Sweden.

== Culture ==

Historically, Dalarna has enjoyed a rich and unique folk culture, with distinct music, paintings, and handicrafts. The province preserved longer than any other the use of the Runic alphabet, a local dialect of which, the so-called Dalecarlian runes or Dalrunes, survived into the 19th century.

A symbol of the province is the Dalecarlian horse, in Swedish &quot;Dalahäst&quot;, a painted and decorated wooden horse. Sulky racing is common in the region. The high level of calcium in the soil favours horse breeding.

UNESCO has named the mining area of the Stora Kopparberg (&quot;Great Copper Mountain&quot;) in Falun a World Heritage Site.

Football in the province is administered by Dalarnas Fotbollförbund. Brage and Dalkurd are examples of football teams in Dalarna. Ice hockey is also popular in Dalarna. The two ice hockey teams and rivals from Dalarna are Leksands IF and Mora IK, both frequently in the highest ice hockey division.

<text>Jämtland () is a historical province () in the centre of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders Härjedalen and Medelpad to the south, Ångermanland to the east, Lapland to the north and Trøndelag and Norway to the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden&#x27;s total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 115,331, the majority of whom live in , the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland&#x27;s only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden. The historical province is one of the least densely populated.

Jämtland was originally an autonomous republic, its own nation with its own law, currency and parliament. Jämtland was conquered by Norway in 1178 and stayed Norwegian for over 450 years until it was ceded to Sweden in 1645. The province has since been Swedish for roughly 370 years, though the population did not gain Swedish citizenship until 1699. The province&#x27;s identity is manifested with the concept of a republic within the kingdom of Sweden, although this is only done semi-seriously.

Historically, socially and politically Jämtland has been a special territory between Norway and Sweden. This in itself is symbolized in the province&#x27;s coat of arms where Jämtland, the silver moose, is threatened from the east and from the west. During the unrest period in Jämtland&#x27;s history (1563–1677) it shifted alignment between the two states no less than 13 times.

==Etymology==

Jämtland&#x27;s name derives from its inhabitants, the Jamts. The name can be traced back to Europe&#x27;s northernmost runestone, the Frösö Runestone from the 11th century, where it is found as &quot;eotalont&quot; (normalized Old Norse: &quot;Jamtaland&quot;). The root of Jamt (Old West Norse: &quot;jamti&quot;), and thus Jämtland, derives from the Proto-Germanic word stem &quot;emat-&quot; meaning persistent, efficient, enduring and hardworking. The Proto-Norse prefix &quot;eota&quot; (&quot;jamta&quot;) is a genitive plural case.

It is not known how the Jamts got their name. One possible explanation is presented in the Icelandic work &quot;Heimskringla&quot; from the 13th century. In the Saga of Håkon Góði, Snorri Sturluson narrates about Kettil Jamti, a son of Anund Jarl from Sparbu in Trøndelag who fled from Norway when Harald Fairhair united the country with brute force in the 9th century. His descendants then came to bear his name. An alternative explanation comes from the excessive iron production that took place in the province before the Viking Age. A folk etymological theory is that the name ought to have something to do with the &quot;even&quot; (as in level or flat) parts around the lake Storsjön. This theory is based on the similarity between the Swedish words &quot;jämt&quot; (from &quot;emat-&quot;) and &quot;jämnt&quot; (from Germanic &quot;*ebna&quot;, &quot;even&quot;).

The name Jämtland with an Ä is a 20th-century Swedish alteration of the older spelling &quot;Jemtland&quot;. Localities settled by Jamtish emigrants such as Jemtland in Ringsaker, Norway and Jemtland in Maine, United States were founded before the alteration occurred. In the nearby Norwegian province of Trøndelag old settlements such as Jamtøya, Jamtgarden and Jamtåsen all use the prefix &quot;Jamt-&quot;, just like the regional name, however the Trøndersk name for Jämtland is &quot;Jamtlainn&quot;, whilst the Jamtish name is &quot;Jamtland&quot;. As the d is silent the form &quot;Jamtlann&quot; is also common. The regional name &quot;Jamtland&quot; has only status as an official form in Nynorsk and Icelandic, but is popularly used among locals which is one of the reasons as to why the regional museum was given the dialectal name Jamtli (Swedish &quot;jämtsk backsluttning&quot;), &quot;Jamtish hillside&quot;.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Some finds from the time before humans have been discovered in Jämtland, most notably the remains from a woolly mammoth in Pilgrimstad.

The first humans came to Jämtland from the west across the Keel approximately 7000–6000 BC, after the last ice age. The climate was at the time much warmer than today and trees such as oak were growing at the top of today&#x27;s mountains. Several thousand archaeological remains have been located in the province, predominantly near old camp-sites, beaches and lakes. The oldest settlement found is located at Foskvattnet, not far way from the so-called Fosna culture, this settlement has been dated to 6600 BC. In Jämtland the moose was the dominant prey, which is clearly shown on petroglyphs and rock paintings in for example Gärde and Glösa. Jämtland has over 20,000 documented ancient monuments, the oldest one being an arrowhead found in Åflo near Kaxås in Offerdal parish possibly older than 8,000 years, which would make it one of the oldest Stone Age finds in all of Sweden.

Rock paintings found in Jämtland often collocates with various trapping pits and well over 10,000 pits used for hunting have been located, which is much more than any other Scandinavian region. Trapping or hunting pits were placed in areas in close proximity of the hunted animal in question, usually in known places where the animals moved. Because of this there are several places where pits have been dug separately in lines stretching on for miles throughout the landscape. Several place names in Jämtland still display the significance these pits had to the tribes.

A Jamtish Neolithic culture emerged during late Roman Iron Age in Storsjöbygden, although the hunter-gatherers had come in contact with this lifestyle long before they settled down themselves. Since the hunts were rich and successful in Jämtland, it took a long time before a change occurred.

The Neolithic Revolution happened quickly once initiated since the Trønders had been farmers for a long time and some of the Jamts had already begun herding. The Jamtish farmers grew first and foremost barley, although palynological study also show hemp. At the end of the 4th century a fortress, Mjälleborgen, was established on Frösön to control the iron production and trade that took place. At the same time Kurgans start appearing in the Jamtish landscape, just like in Bertnem in Trøndelag and Högom in Medelpad. The western influence from Trøndelag through Jämtland to Norrland was at the time extensive.

The expansion of settlement was somewhat halted in the 7th century and Mjälleborgen was abandoned in the 8th century. A human migration occurred at the same time and the people concentrated themselves around Storsjön with villages such as Frösön, Brunflo, Rödön, Hackås, Lockne and Näs being larger communities. Storsjöbygden became an oasis in the middle of the Scandinavian inland, surrounded by dense forest. Horses were the only reliable means of transportation and therefore a necessity.

During the Viking Age, the settlement in the province grew. This confirms the sagas written by Snorri Sturluson, where he narrates about the Vikings who fled from Harald Fairhair and Norway and took residence in Jämtland, just like many Norwegians at the same time fled and colonized Iceland. When a climate change (which later resulted in the Medieval Warm Period) took place, Frösön acquired the position as regional centre. The warmer climate made the agriculture flourish, the stock-raising and the special inland Scandinavian herding or &quot;livestock drifting&quot;, &quot;buföring&quot;, was developed further. This is especially true for the southern parts of Jämtland when the so-called &quot;fell cow&quot; was introduced. The hunt for moose and other wild animals increased during this period. Religiously the Jamts had abandoned the indigenous Germanic tribal religion in favour of the Christian faith. In religious practice, Jämtland was dominated by the older Vanir gods (Freyr, Njord, Ullr etc.), although the Æsirs were also worshiped.

As the population continued to grow, the Jamts established a Thing (assembly), just like other Germanic tribes. Jamtamót came into existence shortly after the world&#x27;s oldest parliament, the Icelandic Althing, was instituted in 930 CE. Jamtamót is unique in Scandinavia since it is the only one referred to as &quot;mót&quot; instead of &quot;þing&quot;, although they have the same meaning.

===Medieval period===

Jämtland was Christianized in the middle of the 11th century when the Frösö Runestone appeared (the only one in the world that tells about the christening of a country), shortly after Olaf II of Norway died in the Battle of Stiklestad just west of Jämtland. During this period Jämtland turned into a Christian region and the first church, Västerhus chapel was built shortly after the runestone appeared.

According to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Sagas the Jamts sometimes paid taxes to Norwegian kings such as Håkon Adalsteinsfostre and Øystein Magnusson for protection. The Sagas also mentions that the Jamts at one occasion also paid taxes to a king in Svealand. The Sagas reliability on the matter has been defined as low. In the oldest written source for Norway, &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, it is however clearly stated that Norway borders in the north-east to Jämtland.

During the civil war era in Norway Jämtland was defeated by king Sverre of Norway after losing the Battle of Storsjön. This was the last war fought by the Jamts under their own elected leaders. The consequences of this defeat was less autonomy. Jämtland never became a fully integrated part of Norway and had the same status in the Kingdom of Norway (872–1397) as the Atlantic isles like Shetland and Orkney, even though Jämtland was connected by land with the rest of Norway. This is clearly shown when Haakon V of Norway refers to Jämtland as his &quot;eastern realm — &quot;öystræ rikinu&quot;&quot;.

===Turbulent times===
After Norway was forced into a personal union with Denmark (Denmark-Norway) in 1536 Jämtland came to be governed from Copenhagen. When the reformation (Catholicism survived in some places into the 17th century) was forced upon the population when the kings took control of the church. Sweden&#x27;s separation from the Kalmar Union transferred Jämtland from a central Scandinavian region into a border region between two aggressive states. This eventually led to conflict, first in 1563 during the Nordic Seven Years&#x27; War (after which Jämtland was put under the diocese of Nidaros), then in 1611 during the Kalmar War. Conflict continued and Jämtland was occupied yet again in 1644 during the Hannibal War by Swedish forces under the command of Henrik Fleming. The Swedish troops were however quickly driven out by Norwegians and locals. Sweden did however win that war in the south and received Jämtland as a part of the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645.

After this Denmark-Norway tried to regain the province, first in 1657 (Dano-Swedish war of 1657) where the Norwegians were hailed as liberators. Then for a longer period in 1677 with the &quot;conquest of Jemtland&quot;. The Jamts conducted snapphane (guerilla) warfare against the Swedish army and during this time a Jamt from Lockne, the first known Jamtish poet, wrote a scurrilous song that was sung throughout the province during the war. It involved the Swedish governor of Jämtland and he had the song translated into Swedish from Jamtish and sent to the king. The last segment of the song was the most derisive one (direct English translation to the right):

The conquest failed and once Jämtland was in Swedish hands a Swedification process began. The Diocese of Härnösand was instituted at the Swedish coast. Schools were established (to direct the Jamts away from Trondheim). The population did not receive Swedish citizenship until 1699. Thus the Jamts were the last people from an acquired territory in Sweden to become Swedish.

The Jamtish people maintained some self-governance. The Jamtamót had been transformed into a Danish landsting in the early 16th century. Even though it was banned in the end of the same century, it continued to be held in secret. After the transition to Sweden some parts were transmitted into a Swedish &quot;landsjämnadsting&quot;.

Sweden&#x27;s intentions in the province were first and foremost focused on defense, which led to a burden on the Jamtish farmers. The Jamts managed to enforce a treaty in 1688 which stated that Jamts were under no circumstances obligated to defend anything but their own province. This treaty was eventually broken by king Charles XII and Jamts participated in Carl Gustaf Armfeldt&#x27;s Norwegian campaign during the Great Northern War. The campaign was unsuccessful and when Charles XII died in southern Norway Armfeldt marched back to Jämtland. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1718 a massive blizzard arose and over 3,000 Caroleans succumbed in Jämtland&#x27;s mountains mostly due to poor clothing. The time that followed &quot;the Age of Liberty&quot; brought changes to the province&#x27;s agriculture, with significances such as the potato and better granaries through national politics. The standard of living was greatly improved during this period. However, the visions and ideas behind the improvements also led to one of the greatest environmental disasters in Scandinavia when the lake Ragundasjön was drained and the great rapid Gedungsen cut off, creating the so-called &quot;dead waterfall&quot;. It was the result of a project that sought to circumvent the obstacle posed by the waterfall for timber transportation on Indalsälven.

===Modern period===
In order to end the free trade conducted by &quot;faring-men&quot; or &quot;faring-farmers&quot; (&quot;fælmännan&quot; or &quot;fælbönnran&quot; in dialect), Jämtland&#x27;s first and only city, Östersund, was founded by Gustav III 1786, though plans had existed since the province was seceded. It took almost one hundred years after this before the province began industrializing when the rail road Mittbanan-Meråkerbanen was established between Sundsvall, Östersund and Trondheim. This evolved the logging process and also led to more people migrating to Jämtland, not to mention all the tourists who came for the &quot;fresh air&quot;. As a side effect the rail road also meant the end of the faring traditions.
After the unsuccessful (or successful, depending on the viewer) channelling of Gedungsen Jämtland&#x27;s rich forests could be used in sawmills along the coast. A great deal of the forest was sold to large corporations since for the first time in history the farmers could earn money from their forests.

In the late 19th century the province was struck by social movements. In Jämtland the &quot;free minded&quot; Good Templar movement (a part of the temperance movement) came to dominate completely, in fact, the movement drew its strongest support (in relation to the population) in Jämtland in the entire world, and it was also here, in Östersund, that the world&#x27;s largest order house was built. Jämtland failed to industrialize, mostly due to the residents opposition to industries, which were seen as the destroyers of society. Keeping Jämtland as a clean environment, but also making it a region of raw material extraction. Due to the rail road the city of Östersund quickly grew with settlers arriving from the countryside and southern Sweden, giving it the true character of a city, rather than a mere village with city status. The rise of Östersund brought a more excessive trade than before, handicrafts etc. Just like in the rest of the Western world a modernisation process started in the 20th century. New items such as cars, fridges, television etc. made their way into people&#x27;s lives.

With the establishment of the socialist Folkhemmet (&quot;the people&#x27;s home&quot;) and the Rehn-Meidner model Jämtland became a true neglected area in Sweden. The model deemed it necessary to concentrate the Swedish population in cities, at the coast and in the south. Jämtland an inland region in Norrland with the largest part of the population living in the countryside in Sweden was by far the most unprofitable region one could imagine. When the politics were launched Jämtland experienced the largest population loss in modern Swedish history. Local companies were forced into bankruptcy and unemployed people were encouraged to move to cities at the coast or in the south through subsidies and governmental commercials. At the same time taxes were rising and the public sector growing. Opposition to the loss of population and the centralist plans among officials regarding Jämtland County led to the creation of the &quot;Republic of Jamtland&quot; (see below).

===Subdivision and law===
Jämtland was originally divided into four parts, so called farthings (&quot;fjalingan&quot; or &quot;fjålingan&quot; in Jamtish), just like Iceland (&quot;fjórðungr&quot; in Icelandic). This division is similar to the hundred subdivision the rest of Scandinavia had. Just like on Iceland these farthings were named after cardinal directions. Exactly how the borders for each farthing went is unknown although it has been suggested that they all reached Storsjön in the center of the province. The eastern farthing at Brunflo, the western from Trångsviken to the Rödö peninsula and the south farthing from Oviken and Hackås and southwards. The northern farthing is assumed to have covered all the northern parts in addition to all the islands in Storsjön (like Frösön, Norderön, Andersön etc.) and Mörsil plus Hallen parish all the way to &quot;Oviksfjällen&quot;.

The farthings were lesser administrative regions, more or less juridical districts with their own assemblies, all parallel with the common assembly on Frösön. The old law used in Jämtland is the so-called Jamtish Law, referred to in old documents as e.g. &quot;Jamptskum laughom&quot;. Old documents also makes reference to a specific law book — &quot;Jamskre loghbok&quot;. The law book has never been recovered and it is assumed to have been destroyed in the 16th century, or never having existed at all. Nevertheless, the Jamtish law was either the same, or strongly influenced by the Frostating law applied on Trøndelag.

When Magnus the law-mender became the king of Norway he instituted a national law for Norway in 1276, however Jämtland was not applied by this law. Jämtland came under this law either in 1365 or in the middle of the 16th century. The divisions by farthings were replaced in the 16th century by Court Districts, shortly after Jämtland got its own Norwegian law thing.

;Court Districts in Jämtland

:Oviken Court District
:Ragunda Court District

There is also an historical subdivision of Jämtland in Jamtlandic. One area is referred to as &quot;Nol i bygdom&quot; &quot;the north countryside&quot; and consist of Lit-Hammerdal and the area further north. &quot;Sö i bygdom&quot; &quot;the south countryside&quot; or &quot;Sunna sjön&quot; consists of the area just south of Storsjön; Oviken, Berg, Sunne and Hallen. &quot;Öst i bygdom&quot; (also &quot;ast, äst, ust, åst&quot; etc. instead of &quot;öst&quot;) for eastern Jämtland, mainly Ragunda, Revsund and Brunflo. &quot;Opp i lännan&quot; &quot;up in the lands&quot; refers to western Jämtland, Undersåker and Offerdal. &quot;Fram på lännan&quot; &quot;the front&quot;, &quot;central lands&quot; or &quot;in på lännan&quot; &quot;in on the lands&quot; consists of the area around Storsjön like Frösön, Rödön etc. A person from this area is called a &quot;framlänning&quot; &quot;front lander&quot;.

===Churches===
After the conversion to Christianity several parishes (so called &quot;socknar&quot;, related to &quot;seek&quot;) were established in Jämtland, these are now replaced by over 40 &quot;församlingar&quot;, meaning &quot;assemblage&quot;. These are organized by so-called &quot;kontrakt&quot; &quot;contracts&quot;, collaboration units within the Swedish church&#x27;s each diocese. Jämtland is a part of the Härnösand diocese, established two years after Jämtland was ceded to Sweden. In Jämtland there are five contracts; Bräcke-Ragunda, Krokom-Åre, Strömsund and Östersund&#x27;s contract, along with Berg-Härjedalen. Although only half of the parishes in the last one are actually located in Jämtland, the rest are located in Härjedalen.

When the first churches were established in Jämtland during the medieval period they were done so by a small number of farmers. Estimations show that there were seldom more than 30 to 40 farmers in each parish. In some cases, like in Kyrkås, Marby and Norderö parish the farmers were probably 20 or less. These original parishioners built churches that&#x27;s lasted for centuries, many are still existing and functioning today. This is quite remarkable given that they built these churches in stones, much larger than their ordinary timber houses and in a material the parishioners were not accustomed to (given that they only used timber). The churches became a matter of concern for every parishioner, the centre in each parish. Everybody had to help build them and their descendants had to maintain them, this carried on for generations. Families have decorated the churches throughout history with various ornaments and art such as valuable inventories, wood carvings, paintings (predominantly biblical illustrations), textiles, silver and tin along with various handicrafts. Almost the entire older popular culture in Jämtland is tied to the churches. Making them the core of Jämtland&#x27;s cultural heritage.

The churches have symbolized a connection between Jämtland&#x27;s population through generations and this is still the case for many today. People are joined through cheerful moments such as christening, Holy Matrimony, confirmation, through crisis and mournful times like funerals. In Jämtland-Härjedalen the free church movement did not become near as widespread as in the rest of Sweden. Because of this Jämtland and Härjedalen have a large number of members in the Swedish church since nine out of ten in fact are members. Although nowadays church attendance is much lower, back then every parishioner gathered on the Sabbath because no one was allowed to work. Within each parish distinctive customs, bunads and dialects developed because of this, especially the dialects are known to differ from parish to parish in Jämtland.

Jämtland also had a great deal of equality between each parishioner, Jämtland lacked a nobility and there are no noble family coats of arms nor authorial marks in the churches, which is very common in the rest of Sweden. Jämtland also lacked a specific &quot;bench order&quot; (an order based on rank that defined where you were allowed to sit in the church), something that other churches had. In Jämtland the principle &quot;among farmers no other rank except age and life-time&quot; applied.

Each parish also had an assembly, where every parishioner was present and decisions were only taken unanimously. If they were not able to come to a mutual understanding the matter had to rest and be resumed later until everybody agreed. In the community houses the village&#x27;s prominent people, so called &quot;byalag&quot;, gathered to decide on mutual concerns such as split-rail fences, ditch construction and agricultural related stuff. The central figure in each district was the priest. He dealt with most matters since he was in contact with every parishioner. He meddled in conflicts and gave advice and comfort in various situations. Besides preaching and informing the priest was also a farmer himself, often a forerunner in the field. The priest did not always go the authority&#x27;s errand, sometimes he tried to help his fellow parishioners fend off extra taxes and military services.

==Sami people==

In Jämtland there are also Sami people. The Sami in Jämtland are Southern Sami people and speak Southern Sami (or &quot;åarjelsaemien giele&quot;, as it is known in Southern Sami), a language mutually unintelligible with the other Sami languages. The Sami in Jämtland have historically been referred to as &quot;Lapps&quot; and sometimes by using the vague word &quot;Finns&quot; (supposedly related to English &quot;find&quot;, see Fenni), though they prefer to call themselves Sami. There have been Sami peoples in Jämtland from pre-historic times; exactly how many, however, is disputed. The northernmost part of Jämtland, Frostviken, is originally a Sami area, historically referred to as a &quot;finnmark&quot;. However, the ancestors to the Sami people who live south of this area today probably did not come to the area before the 16th century, when large-scale reindeer herding began, leading to a nomadic lifestyle among the Sami people. This also led to several conflicts in court between Sami people in Jämtland and the land owners. At the dawn of the 20th century, the Swedish state had an official policy which stated that &quot;Lapp should be Lapp&quot; and that they should all live a &quot;traditional&quot; Sami life and not integrate in the society. This has now changed and only a minority are in fact reindeer-herders. The Sami people in Jämtland are closely connected to their brethren living in Trøndelag, and a distinctive feature of the Southern Sami culture is the yoik called &quot;vuoille&quot;.

== Heraldry ==
The arms are represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon:
:&quot;I blått fält en gående älg av silver med en lyftande falk på ryggen och i posten åtföljd av en vänstervänd, upprest hund, båda av guld.&quot;
English translation:
:&quot;In a blue field, a walking moose of silver [with red antlers] with a striking falcon on its back accompanied by a reared hound in front, both of gold.&quot;

The coat of arms of Jämtland, created for Karl X Gustav&#x27;s funeral, derived from a seal which had been granted to Jämtland in 1635 by the Danish-Norwegian king. The beasts on this seal were difficult to identify. (Is the primary animal a deer, moose or reindeer? Is it a dog, wolf or bear? An eagle or a falcon?) The identity of these animals as a moose between a dog and a falcon was settled in 1884. According to popular perception, these represent Jämtland torn between Norway and Sweden, though obviously this meaning was not officially assigned by any royal authority. Svante Höglin claimed the scene to portray a moose hunted by a trained hunting dog and falcon, and in 1935 the coat of arms was revised, adding a collar and a bell to aid in identifying the dog and the falcon, respectively. Strangely, the revised blazon does not mention the moose&#x27;s attire although the prototype in the &quot;Riksheraldikerämbetet&quot; (Swedish National Heraldry Office) is provided with secondary colours for the antlers, beak, hooves and claws.

Jämtland&#x27;s first seal was the one depicted above from the medieval period. It was abolished after the Nordic Seven Years&#x27; War and the second seal of Jämtland was used between 1575 and 1614. This seal contained two Olav-axes and was also abolished after a Swedish occupation, the one during the Kalmar War. When Jämtland became Swedish it was not suitable to use one of the older seals with such a strong Norwegian influence as a basis for a new Swedish coat of arms. So the latest seal was used instead, even though it was in fact of Danish origin.

== Current administration ==
Just like every other historical province of Sweden Jämtland serves no administrative purposes, but serves as an historical, geographical and cultural region. Jämtland makes up three quarters of the Swedish administrative province Jämtland County, though a small uninhabited part in northern Jämtland is a part of Västerbotten County and the area around Överturingen is a part of Västernorrland County. The landsting, &quot;County Council&quot;, is an elected assembly and the successor of Jamtamót. This County Council was the role model for the rest of the Swedish County Councils when they were established in 1863.

The province is also divided into primarily seven municipalities; Berg Municipality, Bräcke Municipality, Krokom Municipality, Ragunda Municipality, Strömsund Municipality, Åre Municipality and Östersund Municipality. The uninhabited part in northern Jämtland belongs to Dorotea Municipality and the area around Överturingen is a part of Ånge Municipality.

Though, even if these municipalities and the county are serving as administrative regions most Jamts still identify themselves with the parishes and with Jämtland as a province.

==Physical geography==
Jämtland is a large land-locked province in the heart of the Scandinavian peninsula in northern Europe. Jämtland stretches 315 kilometers in north–south direction and 250 kilometers in east–west direction and is equal in size with e.g. Ireland. Jämtland&#x27;s western border is made out by Kölen which stretches throughout the province from north to south with branches into the landscape&#x27;s southeastern parts. The fell massif is broken at some places by large valleys stretching all the way to the Norwegian Sea. These valleys have been used for centuries as paths connecting Jämtland to the west. The valleys were particularly heavily used during pilgrimages to Nidaros, the fourth most visited pilgrimage site during the medieval period. In fact no less than three pilgrim roads went through Jämtland.

The entire province is more or less a highland region with the highest peak being Storsylen, a peak in the Sylan mountain range with an altitude of 1 728 meters above sea level. Though this is not the highest peak in the mountain range, since that peak is in fact located on the other side of the border. Another large peak in Jämtland worthy of mention is Åreskutan (1 420 meters above sea level).
The lowest point in the province is as low as 35 meters above sea level and is located in the eastern part of Jämtland.

Approximately 8 per cent of Jämtland&#x27;s area is covered by water and the province has two larger streams, Ljungan and Indalsälven (also known as &quot;Jämtlandsälven&quot;). Both of which emanates from the Scandinavian Mountains and drains several lakes on their way eastwards to lower altitudes.

===Climate===
Jämtland has a temperate climate and belongs to the temperate zone&#x27;s northernmost area. The climate in Jämtland is both humid continental and subarctic, depending on the location. The climate is greatly affected by the Norwegian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, due to several mountain passes in Scandinavian mountain range.

In western Jämtland mild winters with excessive precipitation are common. This is because of the warm winds brought to the area by the Gulf Stream. The average precipitation in the Jamtish Fells is roughly 1 000 millimetres per year, with Skäckerfjällen as extreme with about 1 500 mm. The precipitation rates in the middle of the province are much more moderate. In fact the central and eastern parts of Jämtland have precipitation shortages, in Storsjöbygden the annual averages is as low as 500 mm. Due to the warm winds the temperature during the winters reaches its maximum in the fell region with about -7-8°C in Storlien and the environs. The coldest winter temperatures are found in the province&#x27;s outskirts like Börtnan with roughly -11 °C. Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 14 °C in Jämtland&#x27;s eastern parts to around 11 °C in the fell region. Though on certain mountain peaks the averages are usually as low as 5 °C.

The highest (34.0 °C) and lowest (-45.8 °C) temperatures ever recorded in Jämtland were found in its easternmost parts near Hammarstrand in 1947 and 1950, respectively.

Blizzards are common in Jämtland, and especially in the fell region. The most notable blizzard is the one that arose on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1718 (see above). The heaviest winds in Jämtland may gust to 55 metres/s (198 km/h, 123 mph).

==Wildlife==

===Flora===
The Jamtish flora is heavily characterized by temperate coniferous forest, taiga, a forest inhabited by Norway spruce and pine trees. Among the two the Norway spruce is more common. The Norway spruce actually grows most densely in Jämtland together with the southern parts of Lapland. Here roughly 60 percent of the forests consist of spruces.

In Jämtland over 2,300 mineral-rich marshes (wetlands) containing a very high pH level have been located. These marshes cover an area of 550 square kilometers. 400 of these marshes are also very rich in chalk and because of the chalk-rich soil Jämtland displays the largest concentration of these type of marshes on the entire European continent. The chalk-rich soil has attracted several chalk-dependent plants, such as orchids, in Jämtland there are 19 different kinds of orchids.

Each province in Sweden has symbols associated with them and Jämtland&#x27;s provincial flower is an extremely rare orchid, the &quot;Gymnadenia nigra&quot;, an orchid that&#x27;s only common in the province and a few other places in central Scandinavia. Several kinds of berries are found in Jämtland like e.g. bilberry (&quot;blåbär&quot;), lingonberry (&quot;lyngbär&quot;) and cloudberry (referred to as &quot;mylhta&quot; in Jämtland).

===Fauna===
Due to the diversified natural environment in Jämtland it displays a great deal of different animals. The animal most commonly associated with Jämtland is (as already hinted) the moose. It is Jämtland&#x27;s provincial animal and is referred to in dialect as simply &quot;djur&quot;, &quot;animal&quot;. Moose may be found throughout Jämtland but to a lesser extent in the mountainous area in the province&#x27;s eastern parts and in the north.

However northern Jämtland is the most densely populated brown bear habitat in the world. The brown bear (&quot;bjenn&quot; in Jamtish) is also more or less common throughout Jämtland. Other large predators in Jämtland include the cat &quot;gaupa&quot; (Eurasian lynx), the &quot;filfras&quot; meaning the glutton (wolverine) and smaller such as the Arctic fox. Jämtland has had populations of wolves (&quot;skrågg&quot;, &quot;gråbein&quot;) from time to time after it practically became extinct in Scandinavia during the 20th century. There are however currently no wolves with an established territory in Jämtland. There is also one large raptor in the province, the golden eagle.

The last native beaver in Sweden was shot in northern Jämtland 1871 at Bjurälven (&quot;bjur&quot; or &quot;björ&quot; is the Jamtish word for beaver). It was also in Jämtland that the beaver was reintroduced in Sweden from Norway in 1922. The current beaver population is quite large and common. Among the smaller mammals inhabiting Jämtland that are rare in the rest of Scandinavia are e.g. the taiga shrew and the northern birch mouse. The &quot;læmel&quot;, Norway lemming is also present in Jämtland and the latest major population boom usual for this species occurred in 2001.

Jämtland is inhabited by several mammals from the weasel family. Besides the already mentioned wolverine the &quot;oter&quot;, otter, is widespread in the province and common near several streams, the least or snow weasel exists, along with planted, released and escaped minks. The province is also home to the pine marten and the ermine. These mammals have often been hunted for their valuable fur, for Jämtland this is especially true for the ermine.

Among the deer the moose is as already stated common. Other deer are roe deer, red deer and reindeer, in the shape of Sami herds or wilded originally tame reindeers.

The provincial fish is the brown trout which is found together with common whitefish, grayling, European perch, Arctic char, burbot, salmon and the carnivorous northern pike. Roughly 250 types of birds have been observed in Jämtland. The species presence greatly varies, in the fells bluethroat, long-tailed skua, Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, Lapland and snow bunting are found. The forested region is inhabited by species such as hazel hen, black grouse, capercaillie, Siberian jay, three-toed woodpecker and rustic bunting. Several different types of owls dwells in the province and the provincial owl is the northern hawk owl.

==Economy==
The first humans came to Jämtland after the last ice age and later switched to a more agricultural lifestyle. Though the agriculture could not sustain the population so it was combined with a great deal of trading, hunting and iron production. When the rise of industrialism begun, Jämtland was one of the few Swedish regions that never became fully industrialized. Instead Jämtland supplied the Norrlandic coast with raw materials, mainly lumber. The focus in Jämtland&#x27;s economy was directed towards tourism after the construction of the railroad, starting with the &quot;clean air tourists&quot; who came to experience the fresh air, to see the snow clad fells, the waterfalls and the natural environment. Today the tourism in Jämtland is dominated by winter sports and especially alpine skiing in various facilities in Åre, Bydalen, Storlien, Klövsjö, etc.

As Jämtland never industrialized the agricultural sector is larger compared to the rest of Sweden. In Jämtland County this sector employs 4,4 per cent of the labour force compared to 1,8 per cent for Sweden as whole. Just like the rest of Sweden the public sector in Jämtland is large and the high taxes fund the public welfare.

Jämtland has large concentrations of uranium and deposits of e.g. gold, zinc, mica, silver, lead, iron and copper have been found. However, the only mines of importance in Jämtland&#x27;s history are the former copper mines in Fröå and Huså.

Jämtland is heavily dominated by many small businesses and together with Härjedalen Jämtland has the second highest number of company owners in Sweden (in relation to the population), the highest number of enterprising women and by far the most cooperatives. Östersund is the centre of trade and commerce in Jämtland.

==Population==
With the exception of the city of Östersund and its surrounding areas, Jämtland is a very sparsely populated region. In Jämtland as a whole, there are only 3.4 people per square kilometre, and the population of 115,331 is unevenly distributed, with more than half its population (approximately 60 000) living in the Östersund area.

In Jämtland County (including the province of Härjedalen) the number of people living outside an urban area is 34% of the total population, making Jämtland one of the largest rural regions in Scandinavia. Most people in Jämtland live in Storsjöbygden, the area around lake Storsjön which includes Jämtland&#x27;s only chartered city, Östersund, founded 1786 (now including Frösön), Krokom, Ås, Svenstavik, Nälden and Jämtland&#x27;s second largest town Brunflo. This region is actually quite densely populated. The largest urban areas outside Storsjöbygden are primly the municipality seats Strömsund, Järpen, Bräcke and Hammarstrand, along with towns such as Hammerdal, Lit, and the ski resort Åre.

A resident or native of Jämtland is commonly referred to as &quot;Jamt&quot; (Swedish: &quot;jämte&quot;).

==Culture==

The culture of Jämtland has been greatly affected by the fact that Jämtland&#x27;s never had an upper class, since the population have mostly consisted of free sovereign farmers with wide connections and a strong regional identity. This has been the case for many generations. When Christian IV of Denmark punished the Jamts severely after having sworn the Swedish king their allegiance (see above) by turning them into tenant farmers and abolished their seal, he told them to stay put on their farms. They did not heed this call but instead sought help from their own organized advisors and &quot;the land&#x27;s defense&quot;, an insolence that further outraged the Danish king. Jämtland started out free and remained autonomous during its time as a Norwegian dependency. Because of Jämtland&#x27;s historical background the local culture shows great similarities with the Norwegian farm culture.

Today, the history of Jämtland is exhibited in the regional museum Jamtli in Östersund. The museum consists of an open-air section with historical buildings, as well as an indoor museum which houses exhibitions about the region&#x27;s cultural history, from the Stone Age until modern times. Local history has been very popular in Jämtland for over 100 years, due to the extensive cultural home ground movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century. The movement founded Jamtli to preserve the cultural heritage.

===Lifestyle===
The culture in Jämtland has been marked by the stages in human development; the hunting-gathering stage, the semi-nomadic herding stage, the fully agricultural stage and the modern technological stage.

Remnants from the hunter-gathering stage is first and foremost hunting itself. Jämtland&#x27;s population remained in this stage for a very long time due to the hunters ability to sustain the population. Today the moose hunt is regarded by many Jamts as the major holiday of the year. When the first humans came to Jämtland they brought dogs with them as helpers. The local dog, Jämthund, is a canine breed eponymous to Jämtland. Even if it is not explicitly stated, popular perception holds that the dog depicted in the coat of arms is of that breed. The Jämthund is often described having a wolf-like appearance.

One of the first things Tacitus mentions in his work &quot;Germania&quot; is that the Germanic people treasure their animals above all else. Tacitus also concludes that the Germanic people found cultivation repulsive. Instead, he states, the Germanic people devote themselves to food and sleep and besides that they prefer to remain idle. All of this, to certain extents, applied to Jämtland. When the people of Jämtland settled down they relied mostly on pastoralism (transhumance). Their animals were the source of wealth and they were therefore loved by their owners. This love for the livestock has manifested itself in the dialect, a male nipple is called &quot;bokkjen&quot; (the buck) and a female nipple is known as &quot;geita&quot; (the goat).

In Jämtland the Scandinavian inland transhumance, &quot;buföring&quot;, has always been more important than cultivation. In fact it was crucial to take care of the livestock and supply them with food, and rewarding. Every summer for several weeks, from May to September, &quot;gjetaran&quot; (herd boys) and &quot;butøusan&quot; (herd girls, &quot;bu&quot; is cognate to &quot;booth&quot;) followed and guarded &quot;kreka&quot;, the critter, on their way to a grazing land on higher altitudes where several critter houses had been raised. The common animals taken out on these journeys were &quot;gjettran&quot; (Jämtland goats) and &quot;kynnan&quot; (the fell cows) a white, brisk and headstrong cow race, lacking horns. It was a hard work and it depended on cooperation between males and females. This lifestyle lived on for thousand years and it was first in the 1950s it became obsolete. This tradition has however been resurrected as of late, mostly for touristic purposes.

When the population settled down the society greatly changed, first coexisting with the older societies, later absorbing them. Trade became much more important, a political institution elected by the people came into existence, the very same institution whose successor is the current County Council. Jämtland got its name and a somewhat hierarchical social structure emerged, though, as already pointed out, Jämtland never had an upper class. Strong families such as Skanke and Blix did exist though and on the countryside in Jämtland people still live in networks of relatives, &quot;families&quot;. Where they provide a second social security for many, in the rest of Sweden and in e.g. Östersund this has completely or almost entirely been replaced by public welfare.

===Cuisine===

Much of Jämtland&#x27;s cuisine is remnant from the herding stage. Just like other Scandinavians, it is common among Jamts to drink milk throughout their entire life. There are many different types of Jamtish dairy products, especially cheese, since it was by far the easiest way to conserve milk. Mesost is particularly associated with Jämtland and also e.g. a local variant of cottage cheese called &quot;grynost&quot;. In Jämtland there are several small dairies in the villages, most famous is the one in Skärvången. Other products associated with Jämtland are the soft whey butter, long fil, kjesfil, &quot;flautgröt&quot; &quot;cream porridge&quot;, tunnbröd, a version of palt called &quot;kams&quot;, klobb etc.

The ancient practice of brewing &quot;Julöl&quot; (yule beer) persists even today with the microbrewery Jämtlands Bryggeri in Pilgrimstad.

Local projects such as the internet portal Food of Jämtland and the trading mark &quot;Smakriket Jämtland&quot; (the &quot;taste realm&quot; Jämtland) are two major contributors in marketing, preserving and developing the cuisine of Jämtland.

Some of the newest merchandises in Jämtland are a sparkling wine made of birch sap and a sausage called &quot;Jämtlandsfalu&quot;, wilderness juice, the snaps &quot;kallsup&quot; and tunnbröd 

===Folklore===

The folklore of Jämtland mostly correspond to Scandinavian folklore as whole, although the folklore is seldom regarded as popular belief nowadays, with one major exception, Storsjöodjuret.

According to legend it is believed that Storsjön (literally &quot;the Great Lake&quot;) harbors a large lake creature, Storsjöodjuret. There are many witness reports but the creature&#x27;s existence remains to be established conclusively. Regardless of any proven existence, Storsjöodjuret was officially placed under the protection of a degree issued in 1986 by the County Administrative Board to guarantee its safety from hunters and fortune seekers, the protection was lifted in November 2005. The first description of Storsjöodjuret was made in this tale from 1635;

&quot;Puken&quot; is a magical ball of yarn summoned by a witch to draw objects to her. It often steals milk to the witch by milking cows.

Just like in the rest of the world dragons have been known for a long time. In Jämtland they resemble brooms, that flies quickly and strikes down where treasuries are buried.

&quot;Sjörå&quot; is a keeper of freshwater, that master fish, aas and lakes. It is similar to the Jamtish &quot;skogskjæringa&quot; &quot;wife of the forest&quot;. A being that, at day, takes the appearance of a &quot;rauvtjuksa&quot; &quot;red tail&quot;, a bird seen as ominous in Jamtish folklore. When in physical form her tail is always apparent. She tries to lure men to have sexual intercourse with her. The &quot;skogsrå&quot; is not the same creature as skogskjæringa in Jamtish folklore, it is the keeper of the forest and master all the animals in it. It takes on the shape of a moose during hunting season, and grows larger and larger if hit by bullets and eventually forces the hunters out. It can however, be slain with a silver bullet.

Tomten is a common creature, it is quite tall and has an eye in the middle of his forehead. It is the keeper of barns and a very capricious being, though he usually brings luck.

The Nix, &quot;Näkkjen&quot;, is a common mythical creature, in Jämtland it refers to a male water spirit whose music was dangerous to women. Each year in the town of Hackås in southern Jämtland an annual traditional music contest &quot;Årets Näck&quot; is held where each contestant impersonates the Nix.

In Jämtland the vættir/dwarves goes by the name &quot;jolbyggar&quot; &quot;earth builders&quot;. They herd large white goats and cows and live underground, they are considered innocuous though sometimes they exchange an unbaptized child for a so-called &quot;bytningsbarn&quot;. They are commonly associated with the grazing lands. They also go by the names &quot;småruskan&quot;, &quot;smågubban&quot; and &quot;småtussan&quot;.

===Folk costumes===
Jämtland has several different types of folk costumes or &quot;bunads&quot;. Unlike certain regions in Scandinavia a unitary bunad did not exist in Jämtland&#x27;s parishes, with the exception of Hammerdal parish with its brown-striped clothing.

Usually Jämtland is divided into three different clothing parts, the North Jamtish (Hammerdal), the East Jamtish (Ragunda) and the Great Jamtish area, covering the rest and the majority of Jämtland.

The North Jamtish clothing part is typically influenced by the folk costumes of northern Ångermanland and to a lesser degree Lapland, with the exception of Frostviken parish settled by Trønders in the 18th century. The East Jamtish part is the least old-fashioned of the three with many changes done to the costumes through time, making them closer to the kind used at the Swedish coast, rather than the others in Jämtland. The Great Jamtish part has typically old-fashioned and conservative homogeneous bunads with blue socks, red knitted caps among the males, dark bounded caps for ladies and coloured for girls. The skirts are usually of a single colour and the men have blue or black hodden coats, with yellow chamois leather pants made from moose skin.

===Dialects===
The genuine dialect of Jämtland is Jamtish. The speakers of the dialect refer to it as &quot;Jamska&quot; (), which is a definite form that translates to English as &quot;the Jamtish&quot;. However, due to the lack of a well-established English name of the dialect both Jamtish and Jamtlandic are used.

Jamtish is in fact a group of dialects and there are distinctive dialects in every parish. Though they are usually classified in four groups; &quot;framlänningsmålet&quot; &quot;the Central Jamtish tongue&quot;, &quot;opplänningsmålet&quot; (spoken in Western Jämtland), Southwest Jamtish and Northern Jamtish. The dialects in eastern Jämtland are sometimes considered as a fifth group of Jamtish, but also as dialects more related to the Swedish dialects spoken in Ångermanland. In the very north of Jämtland &quot;lidmål&quot;, a version of Trøndersk, is spoken. Jamtish is spoken by 50 000 people at most living in Jämtland and in other areas of Sweden, particularly the capital Stockholm.
===Language===
Even if the Jamtish official status is a dialect many Jamtish people see it as an own language. There are multiple activists that are trying to make the Swedish government recognise Jamtish as a minority language just as Yiddish or Sami have become one. The claimers say to look at the different words and pronunciations of them. Whether or not it is its own language has been widely debated since the early 20th century.

===Provincial character===
Historically each province in Sweden has been known for a specific provincial character or &quot;volksgeist&quot;. This was a field of intense research in Sweden earlier but is viewed somewhat unmodern and considered prejudice today.

The provincial character of Jämtland was often portrayed as cheerful and the population have historically been known for their hospitality. Before the dawn of the railway it was common among farmers to leave their doors unlocked when the annual summer journey to the critter houses was due, often with the table set with food for travelers.

The faring traditions of Jämtland are also very characteristic. The Jamts were known to neglect the agriculture and instead take on long trading journeys all over Scandinavia to various markets such as the ancients ones in Levanger and Gregorius market on Frösön. This was regarded as sheer pleasure in itself and not as something they were obligated to do. In the middle of the 18th century Jämtland&#x27;s population was roughly and it was common that over were present during &quot;Marsimartnan&quot; in Levanger, it is also claimed that the city was built solely on spikes from Jämtland before the fire in the 19th century. The journeys took place during the winters when the landscape was more accessible (when swamps, lakes and tarns froze to ice) and was conducted by males, which left the females in complete charge of the household and the property. The journeys were well-organized expeditions and no one traveled alone. These traditions has awarded the Jamt with traits such as enterprising and energetic. The Jamts&#x27; attempts to avoid tariffs were very successful which greatly angered Swedish officials through time. These journeys eventually stopped once the railway came, though it has recently been renewed by locals. Some say that the heritage from this age lives on, given the high number of enterprises per capita.

=== Republic of Jamtland ===

In the 1960s, an independence movement calling itself the &quot;Republic of Jamtland&quot; was created by humorist/actor/director Yngve Gamlin. Motivated on paper as an attempt to return the province to Jamtlandic control, the republic was given some form of recognition in 1967 when Mr. Gamlin was invited to an event for visiting statesmen hosted by Swedish prime minister Tage Erlander. Described in some sources as a form of criticism against centralized Swedish government and in others as a marketing ploy, it is likely that both played some part in its foundation (Republic officials typically describe it as &quot;51 percent serious&quot;). The republic has a self-styled flag and national anthem (Jämtlandssången) and the independence movement hosts the annual Storsjöyran event in the capital, Östersund.

===Sports===
Football in the province is administered by Jämtland-Härjedalens Fotbollförbund. The clubs overseen by the association include Myssjö-Ovikens IF.

<text>The Swabian Jura ( , more rarely ), sometimes also named Swabian Alps in English, is a mountain range in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, extending from southwest to northeast and in width. It is named after the region of Swabia. It is part of the Table Jura ().
The Swabian Jura occupies the region bounded by the Danube in the southeast and the upper Neckar in the northwest. In the southwest it rises to the higher mountains of the Black Forest. The highest mountain in the region is the Lemberg (). The area&#x27;s profile resembles a high plateau, which slowly falls away to the southeast. The northwestern edge is a steep escarpment (called the Albtrauf or Albanstieg, rising up , covered with forests), while the top is flat or gently rolling.

In economic and cultural terms, the Swabian Jura includes regions just around the mountain range. It is a popular recreation area. The whole &quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot; area is a UNESCO global geopark covering 6,688 km2 (2582 sq mi.); it was designated as a National Geopark in Germany in 2002 and became a member of the European Geoparks Network in 2004; in 2015 it was included in the newly established scheme of UNESCO Global Geoparks. In its central area it comprises a Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve of 852.69 km2 (330 sq. mi.). 

== Geology ==
The geology of the Swabian Jura is mostly limestone, which formed the seabed during the Jurassic period. The sea receded 50 million years ago. Three layers of different limestones are stacked over each other to form the range: Black Jurassic, Brown Jurassic, and White Jurassic. White Jurassic may be as pure as 99% calcium carbonate. Since limestone is soluble in water, rain seeps through cracks everywhere, forming a karst landscape, featuring subterranean rivers which flow through a large system of caves before they emerge. As a result there are hardly any rivers, lakes or other forms of surface water on the plateau.

In some places, former volcanic activity has left traces, such as maars and hills. In the west, the Zollerngraben (a geological depression in a tectonically active region) sometimes causes mild earthquakes. The Nördlinger Ries is a large meteorite crater (15 million years old).

Tertiary relicts can be found in the southern part of Swabian Jura. Famous locations are known in the Ulm area (e.g., Turritellenplatte of Ermingen).

Constant rain and other weather influences are slowly dissolving the entire range. Each year, it recedes approximately . Some millions of years ago, the mountains reached as far as Stuttgart. In some places, the limestone was more resistant to decay and thus the recession of the main range has left small mountains (called &quot;Zeugenberge&quot;—&quot;witness mountains&quot; or outliers; e.g. the &quot;Achalm&quot; or the &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot;) which testify to the former territory of the range. The omnipresent caves are great tourist spots, beautiful and not very crowded. Many different types can be found, from dry dripstone caves to caves that can only be entered by boat. Sometimes the discharge of the water from subterranean rivers can be spectacular, too, e.g. the Blautopf, a source for a tributary of the Danube. Also because of the porous limestone, the Danube nearly disappears near Immendingen (in 1911, 1921, 1928 and 1943 it disappeared completely), only to reappear several kilometers further down. Most of the water lost by the Danube resurfaces in the Aachtopf, a spring for a tributary to the Rhine.

The soil is not very fertile, the humus is often as thin as . Many small limestone pebbles are found on the surface.

== Landscape ==

Much of the Swabian Jura consists of gentle to moderate hills often covered with forest or cleared for small-scale agriculture. The traditional landscape was grass fields with juniper bushes. Today this has become a comparatively rare sight. However, in certain places it is protected by the government of Baden-Württemberg.

The highest elevations reach just over . They are all in the southwestern part of the Jura, in the region of the &quot;Großer Heuberg&quot;.
* Lemberg (, highest point of the Swabian Jura)
* Oberhohenberg ()
* Hochberg ()
* Wandbühl ()
* Rainen ()
* Montschenloch ()
* Plettenberg ()
* Bol ()
* Hochwald ()
* Hummelsberg ()
* Kehlen ()
* Schafberg ().

There are many other peaks in the Alb, such as the Hornau, Ochsenberg, and Achalm.

== Fossils ==

Fossils can be found everywhere in the Swabian Jura. Many large and important fossils were found here. At Holzmaden, outside of Weilheim unter Teck, a small private museum, called Urwelt-Museum Hauff, provides visitors with the opportunity to &quot;dig&quot; for fossils in their shale deposits. The Urwelt-Museum Hauff houses the world&#x27;s largest petrified crinoid (sea-lily) colony with a size of and an age of about 180 million years.

== History and culture ==
=== Prehistoric culture ===

In a number of caves (including Vogelherd, Hohlenstein-Stadel, Geißenklösterle and Hohle Fels), all just a few kilometers apart, some of the oldest signs of human artifacts were found. Best known are: a mammoth, a horse head, a water bird, and two statues of a lion man all of surprising quality and all more than 30,000 years old. The oldest known musical instruments have been found here, too: flutes made from the bones of swans and griffon vultures, some 35,000 years old, and in 2004 a flute carved from the tusk of a mammoth dating from the Ice Age, around 37,000 years ago, and the oldest representation of the human body, the Venus of Schelklingen.

=== The Roman Empire ===

This region, located south of the limes, was part of the Roman Empire from around the first to third century A.D.

A Roman road ran along the Neckar river and over the plateau. In Hechingen-Stein a Roman outpost along this road was discovered in the 1970s and has been turned into an outdoor museum. The limes actually cuts across the plateau at Aalen, which gets its name from the original Roman cavalry post, or &quot;ala&quot;, on the outskirts of the modern town. Here too, the Roman ruins are being excavated and a museum has been open to the public since the late 1980s.

=== Traditional life ===

Life was extremely hard in the Swabian Jura. The lack of water and the poor quality of the soil made it a backward region. For many villages fetching water required a long journey by horse. Since water often needed to be stored over a long time, it was often stagnant. Thus disinfection via alcohol was very popular: &quot;Most&quot; (cider) was mixed with water and even given to babies. A modern water supply system (outstanding for its time) was built in the late 1880s, which eased the situation.

=== Language ===

Locals in the areas speak the distinct German dialect known as Swabian German, which varies even throughout the Jura and is difficult to understand for speakers of Standard German. The dialect at the top of the plateau () is markedly different from, and stronger than, even the broadest Swabian of the lowland areas. Across the whole Swabian region, many phrases and grammar are highly localized, even down to the village level; however, the Swabian dialect of the highland regions is characterised by a &quot;sing-song&quot; melody, and some of the verb forms are also distinct, not only from Standard German, but also from those of the rest of Swabia.
In former times, Yiddish, Pleißne and Romani was also spoken.
The &quot;Pleißne&quot; was spoken by hawkers selling items such as baskets, brushes, and whips, and belongs to Rotwelsch. It was used as a code.

=== Tradition ===

The &quot;Swabian–Alemannic&quot; carnival is an important tradition in many of the villages, called variously &quot;Fastnacht&quot;, &quot;Fasnacht&quot;, &quot;Fasnet&quot;, or &quot;Fasching&quot;.
Of particular cultural importance is the Fasnet celebration in Rottweil. 
Typical of the Allemannic tradition are the witches and forest- or well-spirits, who typically signify Winter or the forces of nature coming to drive Winter out. The various roles are often claimed to have been defined in pre-Christian times and here the exact traditions vary from village to village, creating a fantastic variety of heroes, villains and good and evil creatures. 
It is also often the case that, while in one town a strong tradition of celebrating Fasnet has survived, the neighboring town will have almost no tradition. This is in many instances linked to the after-effects of the Protestant Reformation and the later influence of the Calvinistic Pietists, who more or less strictly opposed such frivolous - even heathen - behaviour. Catholic regions to this day tend to have a stronger Fasnet tradition. 
A Swabian Fasnet celebration in any case has little or nothing in common with the simultaneous celebrations along the Middle Rhein, which are well known across Germany because they are televised every year. Swabians generally are expected to go to work as normal on Rose Monday and Fat Tuesday, unlike their neighbors to the northwest.

== Industry ==

Since raising crops was not easy, raising sheep was popular. This yielded the development of a strong textile industry. In the 1950s, Reutlingen was the German town with the highest number of millionaires, until the decline of the German textile industry hit them as well. Still, many high quality textile companies can be found, such as Hugo Boss, Merz b. Schwanen, Trigema, Reusch, Groz-Beckert and others (the town of Metzingen is widely known as a &quot;luxury outlet town&quot;, with people from all over Europe coming to buy expensive clothes cheaper).

From this, machine building and advanced engineering developed. With the invention of cars and the founding of Daimler-Benz nearby, the car industry and later also electronics and computer industries developed. The &quot;Neckar-Alb&quot; region is the third largest industrial zone in Germany, and the most stable. The best known company is still Daimler-Benz, today known simply as Daimler AG, followed by Robert Bosch.

The region has one of the highest patents-to-population ratios in the world. Many products fall into the high-tech category. The small and medium enterprise sector (100-5,000 employees) predominates. Perhaps as a result, the unemployment rate is low. In general, products are expensive but compete through high quality. Several districts are recognised as especially attractive to business, e.g. Reutlingen as the town in Germany where it is simplest to open a new business. Educational resources are at a high level. The schools and universities of the region all enjoy top rankings within Germany. The Swabian Jura and the neighbouring region have developed from one of the poorest regions of Germany to one of its richest within the past 150 years.

== Climate ==

In winter it often snows. Skiing is popular (though the hills are not steep or high) and numerous small resorts can be found. It is often windy and a bit colder than the rest of Germany. Because of a special micro climate, a small weather station near the town of Stetten am kalten Markt is known as the &quot;coldest spot in Germany&quot;.

== Locations ==

The Swabian Jura are not densely populated by German standards. Most of the larger towns are outside the region, though they are often counted as part of it. These towns often have some of the highest rents in Germany, while land on the plateau itself is considered cheap (by south German standards). Many town names end in &quot;-ingen&quot;. There were several military training grounds, some also used by NATO troops. On the Münsingen training ground which existed for over 100 years, a biosphere reserve is in the making. The region has several larger and many small nature reserves.

=== Important towns ===

;On the plateau
* Engstingen
* Münsingen

* Tübingen (University Town)
* Ulm (south-eastern border)

The towns in the foreland of the Swabian Jura officially don&#x27;t belong to it.

A good way for tourists to get to know the Swabian Jura is to travel on the &quot;Schwäbische Albstraße&quot;, a &quot;National Scenic Byway&quot;, leading from Tuttlingen or Trossingen to Nördlingen or Aalen.

== Food and drink ==

* Brenntar, was a Swabian staple foodstuff, particularly prominent in the Swabian Jura and in the Allgäu. It is made of a specially roasted flour called &quot;Musmehl&quot;.
* Alb-Leisa, traditional lentil varieties of this region.

== Note on terminology in English and German ==
The name &quot;&quot; (related to &quot;Jurassic&quot;) derives from the Jura mountains, of which the Swabian and Franconian plateaux are geographically part. 
In German, at least outside geological circles, the word &quot;Alb&quot; is used almost universally in place of &quot;Jura&quot;. The origin of the word is uncertain. One theory is that it derives form the Latin &quot;albus&quot; (&quot;white&quot;). Another is that it is from a pre-Indo-European word &quot;albhros&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;). It is related to the German words &quot;Alpe&quot;, &quot;Alm&quot; or &quot;Alp&quot; (from Old High German &quot;alpâ&quot;), meaning an &quot;upland pasture&quot;. The word &quot;Alb&quot; functions as a proper noun referring more or less exclusively to the Swabian and the Franconian Jura () areas however, and as such has no direct translation into most other languages. It is perhaps for this reason that &quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot; has sometimes been translated into English as &#x27;Swabian Alps&#x27;, thus avoiding the lesser-known name &quot;Jura&quot;. However, the area is not part of the Alps (despite its proximity), nor is it ever referred to as such in German, the Alps being &quot;die Alpen&quot; in German (plural).

<text>Södermanland ( ), locally Sörmland, sometimes referred to under its Latinized form Sudermannia or Sudermania, is a historical province (or ) on the south eastern coast of Sweden. It borders Östergötland, Närke, Västmanland and Uppland. It is also bounded by lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea.

Södermanland means &quot;(The) Land of the Southern Men&quot;, where the &quot;southern men&quot; () were the people living south of Uppland.

== Administration ==
The traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes, but are historical and cultural entities. There is a corresponding administrative Södermanland County. However, the bulk of the population is within Stockholm County.

== Heraldry ==
The coat of arms was granted in 1560. The arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: &quot;Or, a Griffin rampant Sable beaked, langued, membered and armed Gules.&quot; The same CoA was granted for the county in 1940.

== Geography ==

Södermanland is situated between lake Mälaren to the north and the Baltic Sea to the south and east. In the south, the border to Östergötland is comprised by the Kolmården forest.

The terrain is flat, with its highest altitude being &quot;Skogsbyås&quot; at elevation. The terrain largely consists of water filled hollows covered with woods on the heights.

There are three major water regions. One in the west, where lake Hjälmaren drains into Mälaren. There is a second water region on Södertörn, which is rather small in size and has no larger lakes. Smaller lakes in that region include Bornsjön (), Orlången (), and Magelungen () as well as Naten lake. The third region is to the south towards Kolmården.

Both the city of Stockholm and Stockholm County are divided in the middle between Södermanland (southern part) and Uppland (northern part).

*Kolsnaren
*Likstammen
*Lockvattnet
*Näsnaren
*Orrhammaren
*Tornbergssjön
*Träskaten
*Visnaren

== Population ==
The population of Södermanland is 1,320,477 as of 31December 2016. It is distributed over three counties as follows:
Södermanland is, with , the most densely populated of the provinces. A great part of Stockholm urban area is situated within its limits.

== History ==
Södermanland is one of the ancient Swedish provinces. People probably settled there in the early Stone Age, from which time the earliest remains date. There are a total of 96,000 known ancient remains such as grave fields, coins, knives, etc. There are prominent finds especially from the Neolithic, but also a substantial amount from the Nordic Bronze Age. From the early Iron Age, before 1 AD, the finds are however more sparse. Then from the 5th and 6th centuries AD, the finds are again plenty, now of gold. In 1774, a treasure of of gold from that time was found on a farm in Tureholm.

From the Viking Age 300 runestones remain, second only to Uppland in quantity. The oldest, which is dated from the late 6th century, is the Skåäng Runestone.

The earliest recorded history is generally of the legendary kind. Before the 7th century it is deemed to have been governed by petty kingdoms. This period ended when Ingjald the Ill-Ruler allegedly had a number of local rulers arsoned around 640.

Nyköping has remnents of city structures in the archeological record from around 600. The excavated remnants if buildings were of several types with boat houses for longboats, according to the excavations 2010-2011 at Åkroken 3 (Report 2016:77). The boat houses were in use for about 400 years, during vendel era and viking age.

The oldest city with the historical city status in Södermanland was Södertälje, a privilege granted around 1000. Nyköping received the privilege in 1187. In the 13th century, Stockholm was granted the privilege; in the 14th century followed by Strängnäs, Torshälla and Trosa.

Around 1100, Strängnäs became the episcopal seat with a bishop and cathedral. It was for a long time the only diocese of the province. In 1942 the Diocese of Stockholm was established, claiming parts of the Strängnäs territory.

The first affirmative records date from the 13th century. King Magnus Ladulås was given the province in 1266, and settled himself on the manor at Nyköping. Nyköping became one of the most important cities in Sweden. In 1317, Nyköping become the location of the infamous Nyköping Banquet where King Birger had both his brothers murdered to take possession of the crown and avenge earlier wrong-deeds.

In 1523 the King Gustav Vasa, referred to as the Sweden&#x27;s Father of the Nation, was crowned in Strängnäs. The date, 6June, eventually is commemorated as the national holiday. Charles IX, a son of Gustav Vasa, favoured the province, fortifying castles and establishing early industries.

The largest of very many paintings made by David von Krafft is the Hildebrand family portrait from 1713 (at Nynäs Manor, in Södermanland), depicting the merchant and industrialist Henrik Jacob Hildebrand and his wife Anna Sofia Amya on the occasion of their 50th anniversary surrounded by their over twenty children and grandchildren, as well as some deceased relatives in paintings on the wall in the background.

<text>Värmland () is a &quot;landskap&quot; (historical province) in west-central Sweden. It borders Västergötland, Dalsland, Dalarna, Västmanland, and Närke, and is bounded by Norway in the west. 

== Name ==
Several Latinized versions of the name exist, including &quot;Varmelandia&quot;, &quot;Vermelandia&quot;, &quot;Wermelandia&quot;, &quot;Værmalandia&quot;, &quot;Værmolandia&quot;, &quot;Virmolandia&quot; and &quot;Vermillandia&quot;.

Some of the Latinised forms show the origin of the name to come from the large local lake by the name of (from older &quot;*Virmil&quot;); others from the river name &quot;*Værma&quot;, the main outlet of that lake. The province was originally part of Götaland, and became part of Svealand in 1815.

&quot;Wermland&quot; is an obsolete Swedish spelling of the name, which may still be seen in proper names such as &quot;Nya Wermlands-Tidningen&quot;, a newspaper.

==Administration==
===Sub-divisions===
Sweden&#x27;s provinces were sub-divided into hundreds or districts. Värmland was historically divided into chartered cities and districts. One district formed part of Bergslagen and was a mountain district, and all the other districts were hundreds.

*Edsberg Hundred
*Fryksdal Hundred
*Färnebo Hundred
*Gillberg Hundred
*Grums Hundred
*Jösse Hundred
*Karlstad Hundred
*Karlskoga Mountain District
*Kil Hundred
*Nordmark Hundred
*Nyed Hundred
*Näs Hundred
*Visnum Hundred
*Väse Hundred
*Älvdal Hundred
*Ölme Hundred
==Geography==

The largest lake is Vänern. Most streams of importance lead to Vänern. However, the province is rich in small lakes, ponds and streams. The scenery, with mountains and lakes, is usually regarded as picturesque and has inspired painters and writers.

===Western Värmland===
There are several mountain plateaus in the western part of Värmland, which is in the Scandinavian Mountains. The highest elevations are found in the northern parts, with plateaus of . The highest peak is also located here, Granberget at Höljes, .

===Eastern Värmland===
The eastern part of Värmland is counted as part of the Bergslagen, the &quot;Central Swedish Mining District&quot;. Its terrain is rather hilly, with a few high hills: &quot;Hvitklinten&quot; , &quot;Dalkarlsberget&quot; and &quot;Vålbergsrös&quot; .

This part of Värmland is rich in minerals, most notably iron ore which exists in large quantities. Some notable sites in this area are around Långban and Nordmark Hundred. In the southeast, the ridge of Kilsbergen marks the border with Närke.

==Demographics==
===Population===
The population of Värmland is 322,612 as of 31 December 2022. It is distributed over three counties as follows:

==History==
The province was sparsely populated in the pre-historic age compared to Sweden&#x27;s southern half. Its 5,500 registered ancient remains are few, compared to other areas. The province was considered to be of minor importance in the Swedish Realm. There are, however, interesting histories told by Snorri Sturlasson about Värmland in the 13th century. It extends back to Ingjald Illråde a legendary king in the 7th century. These stories say that Olof Trätälja, the son of Ingjald, was not accepted as king and had to flee and settled in the then sparsely populated Värmland. More men had to flee the brutal successor of Ingjald and settled in Värmland. Archaeology shows that at this time there was indeed a large increase in population, and memorials of powerful men were constructed. According to Snorri and other Icelandic sources, Värmland came under Norwegian control in the late 9th and through the 10th century. However, by the time of Adam of Bremen in the 11th century the region is described as Swedish. In Adam&#x27;s account, the &quot;värmlänningar&quot; are described as a distinct &quot;Swedish tribe&quot; along with the Sviar, Geats and Skridfinnar (commonly taken to be Sami people).

The early history strongly influenced was not only by the proximity to Västergötland, but also by its western neighbour Norway. Sweden&#x27;s war with Norway had a strong effect on Värmland too. In 1225, Haakon IV of Norway (&quot;Haakon the Old&quot;) invaded Sweden and burnt down all villages if they did not pay a ransom. This feud was eventually settled in 1249.

Värmland was originally considered a part of Götaland, and had a strong connection to its southern neighbour Västergötland. Eastern Värmland traditionally belongs to the Bergslagen area, Sweden&#x27;s central mining district.
In 1582, Värmland was granted its first city privileges, Kristinehamn, but those were revoked. The second city, Karlstad, on the north shore of lake Vänern, was granted by &quot;Duke Charles&quot;, later king Charles IX of Sweden, in 1584. It became the capital of the province and its name is derived from the King, and literally means &quot;Charles&#x27; City&quot;. The third city was Filipstad in 1611; however, its privilege was revoked in 1694 after a devastating fire. King Charles IX took great personal interest in expanding mining in the province and the industry developed significantly during his reign.

The early 17th century marked the beginning of substantial immigration from Finland. The areas where they centred were known as &quot;Finnskog&quot;. They kept their Finnish customs and language until the late 19th century. The last native resident to speak Finnish here died in the 1980s.

The most significant coup d&#x27;état of modern Swedish history had its beginning in Karlstad. The man behind the uprising was a liberal nobleman and a prominent man of the opposition, major general Georg Adlersparre. He was backed up by the radical guards captain Carl Henrik Anckarsvärd and used the part of the western army that was stationed in Värmland to occupy Karlstad on the night of 7 March 1809. From there he officially proclaimed a revolution, a proclamation which held the view that wars and oppression had ruined the country and the government therefore had to be overthrown. On 9 March, Adlersparre and his enthusiastic soldiers (many of Finnish origin) finally began their march towards Stockholm, and in the events that followed, the king Gustav IV Adolf abdicated under pressure.

Under the Continental system (1806–1814), the timber industry flourished in Värmland and continuing into the modern era, forestry became industrialized and is still the economic backbone of the province.
Bordering on Norway, Värmland was affected by Sweden&#x27;s last war, Crown Prince Jean Baptiste Bernadottes military campaign against Norway in 1814. The province saw large troop movement and many soldiers originating from the province were involved in battles. The Värmland Regiment had three battalions attached to the 9th Brigade under Colonel Klingspor and one battalion attached to the 10th Brigade under Colonel Gahn af Colqhoun. Both brigades were part of the 5th Army Division under Major General Rosenblad. The 9th Brigade crossed the border to Norway on 30 July 1814 and participated in the siege of Fredrikstad Fortress, which capitulated on 4 August, while other parts of the regiment a few days later followed later Lieutenant General Vegesacks department north and participated in battles at Rakkestad and Langenäs on 6 August 1814 and Askim on 9 August 1814. A battalion of the regiment, commanded by Major Lagerlöv, managed to fight back a Norwegian attack from the bridgehead at Langenäs. The 10th Brigade crossed the border on 1 August 1814 and went in the direction of Morast. It participated in the Battle of Lier south of Kongsvinger on 2 August 1814 and then retreated to the border, where the battalion participated in the battle of Midskog on 5 August 1814 and suffered heavy losses.
During World War II, western Värmland was again an area of heavy military deployment. A major part of the Swedish Armed Forces was concentrated to Värmland following the German invasion of Norway. Approximately 150,000 military personnel were mobilised to Värmland in June 1941, by the time of German demands to transport the fully armed Division Engelbrecht through the country and before the launch of Operation Barbarossa, and with several large military exercises being conducted in the province during the period. Even more military personnel, possibly as many as 250,000, were mobilised to Värmland in the fall of 1943, due to the pending Swedish announcement to end German military transits and fear of a German attack.

An agreement from the dissolution of the union with Norway in 1905 stated that no fortification was allowed on the border between the two nations, but after the German occupation of Norway, old fortifications were renovated and many new constructed. Notably is the fortification &quot;Skansen Hultet&quot; (Skans 153 Hultet) in Eda Municipality, constructed 1940-1941 (although improvements continued until 1945), and equipped with a network of machine gun emplacements, casemates and other concrete bunkers, surrounded by barbed wire, walls and several lines of tank traps. The fortifications have been renovated by locals and are now open to the public. Formerly classified Swedish military documents shows that the Swedish Armed Forces spent approximately SEK 30 million on fortifications in Värmland during the 1940s. There are around 12,000 military objects, including 123 fortified sites, in Värmland dating from World War II.

The film &quot;Gränsen&quot; (Eng. &quot;Beyond the Border&quot;) from 2011, telling the story about the life of the young soldiers guarding the border between Sweden and German-occupied Norway in 1942, takes place in northern Värmland and was filmed near Torsby.

==Culture==
===Literature===

The province has powerful literary and musical traditions and has spawned some of the most well-known and loved authors of Sweden. In the 19th century several leading authors had their origin here, and retained links to Värmland, among them Erik Gustaf Geijer, Esaias Tegnér, Gustaf Fröding and Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Lagerlöf&#x27;s novel, Gösta Berlings Saga, is a neo-romantic saga that takes place in Värmland in the 1820s and 1830s. It was also made into a film starring Greta Garbo. It was also made into an opera, I cavalieri di Ekebù, by Italian composer Riccardo Zandonai in 1925.

Education, theatre and a somewhat glamorous lifestyle were buoyed by the landed gentry and the wealth being generated through a lively local iron trade, and also by the position of the landscape on the edge between civilization and wilderness, which inspired art, literature and folklore. During the second half of the 19th century, the iron processing industry was largely put out of business by the revolution in the steel industry which made Central Europe and the United States vastly superior in this field, and the overall economic crisis throughout Europe of the 1870s and 1880s, and the subsequent emigration to North America, shook the landscape. The consequence, however, was to make authors like Lagerlöf and Fröding more aware of the heritage of their province, and they both drew on what they felt to be an oral tradition of story-telling and local legends. This emphasis on richly textured, often romantic or burlesque tales which nonetheless transcend the local has remained a focus of later writers, such as Göran Tunström (1937–2000) and Lars Andersson (b. 1954).

The musical traditions have inspired a number of prominent musicians, such as singers Zarah Leander, Monica Zetterlund and Rigmor Gustafsson.

==Sports==
===Ice hockey===
Ice hockey is a popular sport in Värmland. The two most prominent teams in recent years are Färjestads BK from Karlstad and BIK Karlskoga from Karlskoga.

<text>Västmanland ( ) is a historical Swedish province, or , in middle Sweden. It borders Södermanland, Närke, Värmland, Dalarna and Uppland.

Västmanland means &quot;(The) Land of the Western Men&quot;, where the &quot;western men&quot; () were the people living west of Uppland, the core province of early Sweden.

== Administration ==
The traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes (except sometimes as sport districts), but are historical and cultural entities. In the case of Västmanland the corresponding administrative county, Västmanland County, constitutes the eastern part of the province. The western part is in Örebro County where the municipalities of Hällefors, Lindesberg, Ljusnarsberg and Nora are located.

== Heraldry ==
The coat of arms was granted in 1560. At the time, it featured one fire mountain, to represent the mine of Sala Municipality. Soon, their numbers were increased to three, to also symbolize the Lindesberg and Norberg/Skinnskatteberg mines and the present blazon was ratified in 1943. Blazon: &quot;Argent, in base triple Mount Azure issuant from each Flames Gules.&quot; When crowned with a ducal coronet it represents the province. However rather different in size Västmanland County was granted the same CoA in 1943.

== Geography ==
The terrain is to the north and north-west rocky. In these parts the highest mountains are located: Älvhöjden with 422 meters, and Gillersklack with 408 meters.

In the other parts it consists mostly of plains.

The largest lake is Mälaren marking the southern border, Sweden&#x27;s third largest lake.
* National parks: Färnebofjärden

Western Västmanland traditionally belonged to the mining district of Bergslagen.

In 2014, the area around Ramnäs saw the largest forest fire in Sweden in modern times.

== History ==
The oldest city of Västmanland is Västerås, founded sometime around 990. The city was once the provincial capital; further, from 1120, it became the seat of the diocese of Västerås. Västerås is today also the largest city in the province, with 140,000 inhabitants in the municipality.

After that Arboga, was chartered in the 12th century, Köping in 1474, Sala in 1624; Lindesberg and Nora both in 1643, and finally Fagersta in 1944. With city status in Sweden being abolished in 1971, these are solely historical titles.

The mines of Norberg and Skinnskatteberg began being in use in the 14th century. The mine of Lindesberg was being cultivated in the early 16th century.

=== Dukes of Västmanland ===
Since 1772, Swedish Princes have been created Dukes of various provinces. This is solely a nominal title.
* Prince Erik (1889–1918)

== Culture ==
Engelsberg Ironworks is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Notable residents==
* Johan Wilhelm Dalman (1787–1828), physician and naturalist
* Carl Wilhelm von Scheele
* Mikael Mogren, bishop
* Axel Grönberg (1918-1988), wrestler

==Sports==

Västerås SK is the most successful Swedish bandy team with 20 titles as of 2017. Several Bandy World Championship finals have been played in Västerås.

==Subdivisions==
Västmanland was historically divided into districts. Within Bergslagen they were called mountain districts (&quot;bergslag&quot;), and in the rest of the province hundreds.

<text>Electronic publishing (also referred to as e-publishing, digital publishing, or online publishing) includes the digital publication of e-books, digital magazines, and the development of digital libraries and catalogues. It also includes the editing of books, journals, and magazines to be posted on a screen (computer, e-reader, tablet, or smartphone).

==About==
Electronic publishing has become common in scientific publishing where it has been argued that peer-reviewed scientific journals are in the process of being replaced by electronic publishing. It is also becoming common to distribute books, magazines, and newspapers to consumers through tablet reading devices, a market that is growing by millions each year, generated by online vendors such as Apple&#x27;s iTunes bookstore, Amazon&#x27;s bookstore for Kindle, and books in the Google Play Bookstore. Market research suggested that half of all magazine and newspaper circulation would be via digital delivery by the end of 2015 and that half of all reading in the United States would be done without paper by 2015.

Although distribution via the Internet (also known as online publishing or web publishing when in the form of a website) is nowadays strongly associated with electronic publishing, there are many non-network electronic publications such as encyclopedias on CD and DVD, as well as technical and reference publications relied on by mobile users and others without reliable and high-speed access to a network. Electronic publishing is also being used in the field of test-preparation in developed as well as in developing economies for student education (thus partly replacing conventional books) – for it enables content and analytics combined – for the benefit of students. The use of electronic publishing for textbooks may become more prevalent with Apple Books from Apple Inc. and Apple&#x27;s negotiation with the three largest textbook suppliers in the U.S.

Electronic publishing is increasingly popular in works of fiction. Electronic publishers are able to respond quickly to changing market demand, because the companies do not have to order printed books and have them delivered. E-publishing is also making a wider range of books available, including books that customers would not find in standard book retailers, due to insufficient demand for a traditional &quot;print run&quot;. E-publication is enabling new authors to release books that would be unlikely to be profitable for traditional publishers. While the term &quot;electronic publishing&quot; is primarily used in the 2010s to refer to online and web-based publishers, the term has a history of being used to describe the development of new forms of production, distribution, and user interaction in regard to computer-based production of text and other interactive media.

==History==
===Digitization===
The first digitization initiative was in 1971 by Michael S. Hart, a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who launched Project Gutenberg, designed to make literature more accessible to everyone, through the internet. It took a while to develop, and in 1989 there were only 10 texts that were manually recopied on computer by Michael S. Hart himself and some volunteers. But with the appearance of the Web 1.0 in 1991 and its ability to connect documents together through static pages, the project moved quickly forward. Many more volunteers helped in developing the project by giving access to public domain classics.

In the 1970s, the French National Centre for Scientific Research digitized a thousand books from diverse subjects, mostly literature but also philosophy and science, dating back to the 12th century to present times. In this way were built the foundations of a large dictionary, the &quot;Trésor de la langue française au Québec&quot;. This foundation of e-texts, named Frantext, was published on a compact disc under the brand name &quot;Discotext&quot;, and then on the worldwide web in 1998.

===Mass-scale digitization===
In 1974, American inventor and futurist Raymond Kurzweil developed a scanner which was equipped with an Omnifont software that enabled optical character recognition for numeric inputs. The digitization projects could then be more ambitious since the time needed for digitization decreased considerably, and digital libraries were on the rise. All over the world, e-libraries started to emerge.

The ABU (&quot;Association des Bibliophiles Universels)&quot;, was a public digital library project created by the Cnam in 1993. It was the first French digital library in the network; suspended since 2002, they reproduced over a hundred texts that are still available.

In 1992, the Bibliothèque nationale de France launched a vast digitization program. The president François Mitterrand had wanted since 1988 to create a new and innovative digital library, and it was published in 1997 under the name of Gallica. In 2014, the digital library was offering 80 255 online books and over a million documents, including prints and manuscripts.

In 2003, Wikisource was launched, and the project aspired to constitute a digital and multilingual library that would be a complement to the Wikipedia project. It was originally named &quot;Project Sourceberg&quot;, as a word play to remind the Project Gutenberg. Supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikisource proposes digitized texts that have been verified by volunteers.

In December 2004, Google created Google Books, a project to digitize all the books available in the world (over 130 million books) to make them accessible online. 10 years later, 25 000 000 books, from a hundred countries and in 400 languages, are on the platform. This was possible because by that time, robotic scanners could digitize around 6 000 books per hour.

In 2008, the prototype of Europeana was launched; and by 2010, the project had been giving access to over 10 million digital objects. The Europeana library is a European catalog that offers index cards on millions of digital objects and links to their digital libraries. In the same year, HathiTrust was created to put together the contents of many university e-libraries from USA and Europe, as well as Google Books and Internet Archive. In 2016, over six millions of users had been using HathiTrust.

===Electronic publishing===
The first digitization projects were transferring physical content into digital content. Electronic publishing is aiming to integrate the whole process of editing and publishing (production, layout, publication) in the digital world.

Alain Mille, in the book &quot;Pratiques de l&#x27;édition numérique&quot; (edited by Michael E. Sinatra and Marcello Vitali-Rosati), says that the beginnings of Internet and the Web are the very core of electronic publishing, since they pretty much determined the biggest changes in the production and diffusion patterns. Internet has a direct effect on the publishing questions, letting creators and users go further in the traditional process (writer-editor-publishing house).

The traditional publishing, and especially the creation part, were first revolutionized by new desktop publishing softwares appearing in the 1980s, and by the text databases created for the encyclopedias and directories. At the same time the multimedia was developing quickly, combining book, audiovisual and computer science characteristics. CDs and DVDs appear, permitting the visualization of these dictionaries and encyclopedias on computers.

The arrival and democratization of Internet is slowly giving small publishing houses the opportunity to publish their books directly online. Some websites, like Amazon, let their users buy eBooks; Internet users can also find many educative platforms (free or not), encyclopedic websites like Wikipedia, and even digital magazines platforms. The eBook then becomes more and more accessible through many different supports, like the e-reader and even smartphones. The digital book had, and still has, an important impact on publishing houses and their economical models; it is still a moving domain, and they yet have to master the new ways of publishing in a digital era.

===Online edition===
Based on new communications practices of the web 2.0 and the new architecture of participation, online edition opens the door to a collaboration of a community to elaborate and improve contents on Internet, while also enriching reading through collective reading practices. The web 2.0 not only links documents together, as did the web 1.0, it also links people together through social media: that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called the Participative (or participatory) Web.

Many tools were put in place to foster sharing and creative collective contents. One of the many is the Wikipedia encyclopedia, since it is edited, corrected and enhanced by millions of contributors. OpenStreetMap is also based on the same principle. Blogs and comment systems are also now renown as online edition and publishing, since it is possible through new interactions between the author and its readers, and can be an important method for inspiration but also for visibility.

==Process==

The electronic publishing process follows some aspects of the traditional paper-based publishing process but differs from traditional publishing in two ways: 1) it does not include using an offset printing press to print the final product and 2) it avoids the distribution of a physical product (e.g., paper books, paper magazines, or paper newspapers). Because the content is electronic, it may be distributed over the Internet and through electronic bookstores, and users can read the material on a range of electronic and digital devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers, smartphones or e-reader tablets. The consumer may read the published content online on a website, in an application on a tablet device, or in a PDF document on a computer. In some cases, the reader may print the content onto paper using a consumer-grade ink-jet or laser printer or via a print-on-demand system. Some users download digital content to their devices, enabling them to read the content even when their device is not connected to the Internet (e.g., on an airplane flight).

Distributing content electronically as software applications (&quot;apps&quot;) has become popular in the 2010s, due to the rapid consumer adoption of smartphones and tablets. At first, native apps for each mobile platform were required to reach all audiences, but in an effort toward universal device compatibility, attention has turned to using HTML5 to create web apps that can run on any browser and function on many devices. The benefit of electronic publishing comes from using three attributes of digital technology: XML tags to define content, style sheets to define the look of content, and metadata (data about data) to describe the content for search engines, thus helping users to find and locate the content (a common example of metadata is the information about a song&#x27;s songwriter, composer, genre that is electronically encoded along with most CDs and digital audio files; this metadata makes it easier for music lovers to find the songs they are looking for). With the use of tags, style sheets, and metadata, this enables &quot;reflowable&quot; content that adapts to various reading devices (tablet, smartphone, e-reader, etc.) or electronic delivery methods.

Because electronic publishing often requires text mark-up (e.g., HyperText Markup Language or some other markup language) to develop online delivery methods, the traditional roles of typesetters and book designers, who created the printing set-ups for paper books, have changed. Designers of digitally published content must have a strong knowledge of mark-up languages, the variety of reading devices and computers available, and the ways in which consumers read, view or access the content. However, in the 2010s, new user friendly design software is becoming available for designers to publish content in this standard without needing to know detailed programming techniques, such as Adobe Systems&#x27; Digital Publishing Suite and Apple&#x27;s iBooks Author. The most common file format is .epub, used in many e-book formats. .epub is a free and open standard available in many publishing programs. Another common format is .folio, which is used by the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite to create content for Apple&#x27;s iPad tablets and apps.

==Academic publishing==

After an article is submitted to an academic journal for consideration, there can be a delay ranging from several months to more than two years before it is published in a journal, rendering journals a less than ideal format for disseminating current research. In some fields, such as astronomy and some areas of physics, the role of the journal in disseminating the latest research has largely been replaced by preprint repositories such as arXiv.org. However, scholarly journals still play an important role in quality control and establishing scientific credit. In many instances, the electronic materials uploaded to preprint repositories are still intended for eventual publication in a peer-reviewed journal. There is statistical evidence that electronic publishing provides wider dissemination, because when a journal is available online, a larger number of researchers can access the journal. Even if a professor is working in a university that does not have a certain journal in its library, she may still be able to access the journal online. A number of journals have, while retaining their longstanding peer review process to ensure that the research is done properly, established electronic versions or even moved entirely to electronic publication.

==Copyright==
In the early 2000s, many of the existing copyright laws were designed around printed books, magazines and newspapers. For example, copyright laws often set limits on how much of a book can be mechanically reproduced or copied. Electronic publishing raises new questions in relation to copyright, because if an e-book or e-journal is available online, millions of Internet users may be able to view a single electronic copy of the document, without any &quot;copies&quot; being made.

Emerging evidence suggests that e-publishing may be more collaborative than traditional paper-based publishing; e-publishing often involves more than one author, and the resulting works are more accessible, since they are published online. At the same time, the availability of published material online opens more doors for plagiarism, unauthorized use, or re-use of the material. Some publishers are trying to address these concerns. For example, in 2011, HarperCollins limited the number of times that one of its e-books could be lent in a public library. Other publishers, such as Penguin, are attempting to incorporate e-book elements into their regular paper publications.

<doc id="190835" wikidata="Q208841" url="?curid=190835" title="Coevolution">
<text>In biology, coevolution occurs when two or more species reciprocally affect each other&#x27;s evolution through the process of natural selection. The term sometimes is used for two traits in the same species affecting each other&#x27;s evolution, as well as gene-culture coevolution.

Charles Darwin mentioned evolutionary interactions between flowering plants and insects in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859). Although he did not use the word coevolution, he suggested how plants and insects could evolve through reciprocal evolutionary changes. Naturalists in the late 1800s studied other examples of how interactions among species could result in reciprocal evolutionary change. Beginning in the 1940s, plant pathologists developed breeding programs that were examples of human-induced coevolution. Development of new crop plant varieties that were resistant to some diseases favored rapid evolution in pathogen populations to overcome those plant defenses. That, in turn, required the development of yet new resistant crop plant varieties, producing an ongoing cycle of reciprocal evolution in crop plants and diseases that continues to this day.

Coevolution as a major topic for study in nature expanded rapidly from the 1960s, when Daniel H. Janzen showed coevolution between acacias and ants (see below) and Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven suggested how coevolution between plants and butterflies may have contributed to the diversification of species in both groups. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed (e.g., the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution), and demonstrate that coevolution can play an important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution can influence the structure and function of ecological communities, the evolution of groups of mutualists such as plants and their pollinators, and the dynamics of infectious disease.

Each party in a coevolutionary relationship exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other&#x27;s evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, is not the only possibility; in multi-species coevolution, which is sometimes called guild or diffuse coevolution, several to many species may evolve a trait or a group of traits in reciprocity with a set of traits in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles. There are a suite of specific hypotheses on the mechanisms by which groups of species coevolve with each other.

Coevolution is primarily a biological concept, but researchers have applied it by analogy to fields such as computer science, sociology, and astronomy.

== Mutualism ==

Coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other, sometimes creating a mutualistic relationship between the species. Such relationships can be of many different types.

=== Flowering plants ===

Flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record, creating what Charles Darwin described as the &quot;abominable mystery&quot; of how they had evolved so quickly; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation. He first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, and developed the concept further in &quot;Fertilisation of Orchids&quot; (1862).

====Insects and insect-pollinated flowers====

Modern insect-pollinated (entomophilous) flowers are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted.

Several highly successful insect groups—especially the Hymenoptera (wasps, bees and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) as well as many types of Diptera (flies) and Coleoptera (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with flowering plants during the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous. A group of wasps sister to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera. Further, all the major clades of bees first appeared between the middle and late Cretaceous, simultaneously with the adaptive radiation of the eudicots (three quarters of all angiosperms), and at the time when the angiosperms became the world&#x27;s dominant plants on land.

At least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.

The yucca, &quot;Yucca whipplei&quot;, is pollinated exclusively by &quot;Tegeticula maculata&quot;, a yucca moth that depends on the yucca for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.

====Birds and bird-pollinated flowers====

Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers have evolved a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar suited to the birds&#x27; diet, their color suits the birds&#x27; vision and their shape fits that of the birds&#x27; bills. The blooming times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds&#x27; breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers also tend to be more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species can be attributed to the direction of the shift in pollinator preference.

Flowers have converged to take advantage of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects. This meets the birds&#x27; high energy requirements, the most important determinants of flower choice. In &quot;Mimulus&quot;, an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of &quot;Mimulus cardinalis&quot; may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In &quot;Penstemon&quot;, flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers&#x27; evolutionary change than &#x27;pro-bird&#x27; adaptations, but adaptation &#x27;towards&#x27; birds and &#x27;away&#x27; from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as &quot;Heliconia angusta&quot; appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by &quot;Trigona&quot; stingless bees. These bees are largely pollen robbers in this case, but may also serve as pollinators.

Following their respective breeding seasons, several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a particular way when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird&#x27;s body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.

Ornithophilous flowers need to be conspicuous to birds. Birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum, so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may also be able to see ultraviolet &quot;colors&quot;. The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers. Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the Phaethornithinae (hermits) and the Trochilinae, has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species.
===Fig reproduction and fig wasps===
The genus &quot;Ficus&quot; is composed of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconia, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.

===Acacia ants and acacias===

The acacia ant (&quot;Pseudomyrmex ferruginea&quot;) is an obligate plant ant that protects at least five species of &quot;Acacia&quot; (&quot;Vachellia&quot;) from preying insects and from other plants competing for sunlight, and the tree provides nourishment and shelter for the ant and its larvae. Such mutualism is not automatic: other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating, following different evolutionary strategies. These cheater ants impose important host costs via damage to tree reproductive organs, though their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.

==Hosts and parasites==
===Parasites and sexually reproducing hosts===
Host–parasite coevolution is the coevolution of a host and a parasite. A general characteristic of many viruses, as obligate parasites, is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts. Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot keep up with the other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. This race is known as the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the Red Queen&#x27;s race in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;: &quot;it takes all the running &quot;you&quot; can do, to keep in the same place&quot;. The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.

The parasite–host relationship probably drove the prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a better chance of developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.

===Brood parasites===
Brood parasitism demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite, for example in some cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host&#x27;s reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.

===Antagonistic coevolution===

Antagonistic coevolution is seen in the harvester ant species &quot;Pogonomyrmex barbatus&quot; and &quot;Pogonomyrmex rugosus&quot;, in a relationship both parasitic and mutualistic. The queens are unable to produce worker ants by mating with their own species. Only by crossbreeding can they produce workers. The winged females act as parasites for the males of the other species as their sperm will only produce sterile hybrids. But because the colonies are fully dependent on these hybrids to survive, it is also mutualistic. While there is no genetic exchange between the species, they are unable to evolve in a direction where they become too genetically different as this would make crossbreeding impossible.

==Predators and prey==

Predators and prey interact and coevolve: the predator to catch the prey more effectively, the prey to escape. The coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in anti-predator adaptations.

The same applies to herbivores, animals that eat plants, and the plants that they eat. Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964 proposed the theory of escape and radiate coevolution to describe the evolutionary diversification of plants and butterflies. In the Rocky Mountains, red squirrels and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole&#x27;s cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making it more difficult for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole&#x27;s cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.

==Competition==
Both intraspecific competition, with features such as sexual conflict and sexual selection, and interspecific competition, such as between predators, may be able to drive coevolution.

Intraspecific competition can result in sexual antagonistic coevolution, an evolutionary relationship analogous to an arms race, where the evolutionary fitness of the sexes is counteracted to achieve maximum reproductive success. For example, some insects reproduce using traumatic insemination, which is disadvantageous to the female&#x27;s health. During mating, males try to maximise their fitness by inseminating as many females as possible, but the more times a female&#x27;s abdomen is punctured, the less likely she is to survive, reducing her fitness.

== Multispecies ==

The types of coevolution listed so far have been described as if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This is not always the case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is variously called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar at the end of a long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.

== Geographic mosaic theory ==

Mosaic coevolution is a theory in which geographic location and community ecology shape differing coevolution between strongly interacting species in multiple populations. These populations may be separated by space and/or time. Depending on the ecological conditions, the interspecific interactions may be mutualistic or antagonistic. In mutualisms, both partners benefit from the interaction, whereas one partner generally experiences decreased fitness in antagonistic interactions. Arms races consist of two species adapting ways to &quot;one up&quot; the other. Several factors affect these relationships, including hot spots, cold spots, and trait mixing. Reciprocal selection occurs when a change in one partner puts pressure on the other partner to change in response. Hot spots are areas of strong reciprocal selection, while cold spots are areas with no reciprocal selection or where only one partner is present. The three constituents of geographic structure that contribute to this particular type of coevolution are: natural selection in the form of a geographic mosaic, hot spots often surrounded by cold spots, and trait remixing by means of genetic drift and gene flow. Mosaic, along with general coevolution, most commonly occurs at the population level and is driven by both the biotic and the abiotic environment. These environmental factors can constrain coevolution and affect how far it can escalate.

== Outside biology ==

Coevolution is primarily a biological concept, but has been applied to other fields by analogy.

=== In algorithms ===

Coevolutionary algorithms are used for generating artificial life as well as for optimization, game learning and machine learning. Daniel Hillis added &quot;co-evolving parasites&quot; to prevent an optimization procedure from becoming stuck at local maxima. Karl Sims coevolved virtual creatures.

===In architecture===

The concept of coevolution was introduced in architecture by the Danish architect-urbanist Henrik Valeur as an antithesis to &quot;star-architecture&quot;. As the curator of the Danish Pavilion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture, he created an exhibition-project on coevolution in urban development in China; it won the Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion.

At the School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape, Newcastle University, a coevolutionary approach to architecture has been defined as a design practice that engages students, volunteers and members of the local community in practical, experimental work aimed at &quot;establishing dynamic processes of learning between users and designers.&quot;

===In cosmology and astronomy===
In his book &quot;The Self-organizing Universe&quot;, Erich Jantsch attributed the entire evolution of the cosmos to coevolution.

In astronomy, an emerging theory proposes that black holes and galaxies develop in an interdependent way analogous to biological coevolution.

===In management and organization studies===
Since year 2000, a growing number of management and organization studies discuss coevolution and coevolutionary processes. Even so, Abatecola el al. (2020) reveals a prevailing scarcity in explaining what processes substantially characterize coevolution in these fields, meaning that specific analyses about where this perspective on socio-economic change is, and where it could move toward in the future, are still missing.

===In sociology===
In &quot;Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and A Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future&quot; (1994) Richard Norgaard proposes a coevolutionary cosmology to explain how social and environmental systems influence and reshape each other. In &quot;Coevolutionary Economics: The Economy, Society and the Environment&quot; (1994) John Gowdy suggests that: &quot;The economy, society, and the environment are linked together in a coevolutionary relationship&quot;.

===In technology===
Computer software and hardware can be considered as two separate components but tied intrinsically by coevolution. Similarly, operating systems and computer applications, web browsers, and web applications. All these systems depend upon each other and advance through a kind of evolutionary process. Changes in hardware, an operating system or web browser may introduce new features that are then incorporated into the corresponding applications running alongside. The idea is closely related to the concept of &quot;joint optimization&quot; in sociotechnical systems analysis and design, where a system is understood to consist of both a &quot;technical system&quot; encompassing the tools and hardware used for production and maintenance, and a &quot;social system&quot; of relationships and procedures through which the technology is tied into the goals of the system and all the other human and organizational relationships within and outside the system. Such systems work best when the technical and social systems are deliberately developed together.

<text>Evolutionary algorithms (EA) reproduce essential elements of the biological evolution in a computer algorithm in order to solve “difficult” problems, at least approximately, for which no exact or satisfactory solution methods are known. They belong to the class of metaheuristics and are a subset of population based bio-inspired algorithms and evolutionary computation, which itself are part of the field of computational intelligence. The mechanisms of biological evolution that an EA mainly imitates are reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.

==Generic definition==

The following is an example of a generic evolutionary algorithm:

# Generate the initial population of individuals, the first generation, randomly.
# Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
# Check, if the goal is reached and the algorithm can be terminated.
# Select individuals as parents, preferably of higher fitness.
# Produce offspring with optional crossover (mimicking reproduction).
# Apply mutation operations on the offspring.
# Select individuals preferably of lower fitness for replacement with new individuals (mimicking natural selection).
# Return to 2

==Types==
Similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details, and the nature of the particular applied problem.
* Genetic algorithm – This is the most popular type of EA. One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers (traditionally binary, although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved), by applying operators such as recombination and mutation (sometimes one, sometimes both). This type of EA is often used in optimization problems.
* Genetic programming – Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs, and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem. There are many variants of Genetic Programming:
** Cartesian genetic programming
** Gene expression programming
** Grammatical evolution
** Linear genetic programming
** Multi expression programming
* Evolutionary programming – Similar to evolution strategy, but with a deterministic selection of all parents.
* Evolution strategy (ES) – Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions, and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates. The method is mainly used for numerical optimization, although there are also variants for combinatorial tasks.
** CMA-ES
** Natural evolution strategy
* Differential evolution – Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems.
* Coevolutionary algorithm – Similar to genetic algorithms and evolution strategies, but the created solutions are compared on the basis of their outcomes from interactions with other solutions. Solutions can either compete or cooperate during the search process. Coevolutionary algorithms are often used in scenarios where the fitness landscape is dynamic, complex, or involves competitive interactions.
* Neuroevolution – Similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights. The genome encoding can be direct or indirect.
* Learning classifier system – Here the solution is a set of classifiers (rules or conditions). A Michigan-LCS evolves at the level of individual classifiers whereas a Pittsburgh-LCS uses populations of classifier-sets. Initially, classifiers were only binary, but now include real, neural net, or S-expression types. Fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based reinforcement learning or supervised learning approach.
* Quality–Diversity algorithms – QD algorithms simultaneously aim for high-quality and diverse solutions. Unlike traditional optimization algorithms that solely focus on finding the best solution to a problem, QD algorithms explore a wide variety of solutions across a problem space and keep those that are not just high performing, but also diverse and unique.

== Theoretical background ==
The following theoretical principles apply to all or almost all EAs.

=== No free lunch theorem ===
The no free lunch theorem of optimization states that all optimization strategies are equally effective when the set of all optimization problems is considered. Under the same condition, no evolutionary algorithm is fundamentally better than another. This can only be the case if the set of all problems is restricted. This is exactly what is inevitably done in practice. Therefore, to improve an EA, it must exploit problem knowledge in some form (e.g. by choosing a certain mutation strength or a problem-adapted coding). Thus, if two EAs are compared, this constraint is implied. In addition, an EA can use problem specific knowledge by, for example, not randomly generating the entire start population, but creating some individuals through heuristics or other procedures. Another possibility to tailor an EA to a given problem domain is to involve suitable heuristics, local search procedures or other problem-related procedures in the process of generating the offspring. This form of extension of an EA is also known as a memetic algorithm. Both extensions play a major role in practical applications, as they can speed up the search process and make it more robust.

=== Convergence ===
For EAs in which, in addition to the offspring, at least the best individual of the parent generation is used to form the subsequent generation (so-called elitist EAs), there is a general proof of convergence under the condition that an optimum exists. Without loss of generality, a maximum search is assumed for the proof:

From the property of elitist offspring acceptance and the existence of the optimum it follows that per generation formula_1 an improvement of the fitness formula_2 of the respective best individual formula_3 will occur with a probability formula_4. Thus:
:formula_5
I.e., the fitness values represent a monotonically non-decreasing sequence, which is bounded due to the existence of the optimum. From this follows the convergence of the sequence against the optimum.

Since the proof makes no statement about the speed of convergence, it is of little help in practical applications of EAs. But it does justify the recommendation to use elitist EAs. However, when using the usual panmictic population model, elitist EAs tend to converge prematurely more than non-elitist ones. In a panmictic population model, mate selection (see step 4 of the generic definition) is such that every individual in the entire population is eligible as a mate. In non-panmictic populations, selection is suitably restricted, so that the dispersal speed of better individuals is reduced compared to panmictic ones. Thus, the general risk of premature convergence of elitist EAs can be significantly reduced by suitable population models that restrict mate selection.

=== Virtual alphabets ===
With the theory of virtual alphabets, David E. Goldberg showed in 1990 that by using a representation with real numbers, an EA that uses classical recombination operators (e.g. uniform or n-point crossover) cannot reach certain areas of the search space, in contrast to a coding with binary numbers. This results in the recommendation for EAs with real representation to use arithmetic operators for recombination (e.g. arithmetic mean or intermediate recombination). With suitable operators, real-valued representations are more effective than binary ones, contrary to earlier opinion.

==Comparison to other concepts==
===Biological processes===

A possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype–phenotype distinction. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype. This indirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the evolvability of the organism. Such indirect (also known as generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment. Recent work in the field of artificial embryogeny, or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype–phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes.

===Monte-Carlo methods===
Both method classes have in common that their individual search steps are determined by chance. The main difference, however, is that EAs, like many other metaheuristics, learn from past search steps and incorporate this experience into the execution of the next search steps in a method-specific form. With EAs, this is done firstly through the fitness-based selection operators for partner choice and the formation of the next generation. And secondly, in the type of search steps: In EA, they start from a current solution and change it or they mix the information of two solutions. In contrast, when dicing out new solutions in Monte-Carlo methods, there is usually no connection to existing solutions.

If, on the other hand, the search space of a task is such that there is nothing to learn, Monte-Carlo methods are an appropriate tool, as they do not contain any algorithmic overhead that attempts to draw suitable conclusions from the previous search. An example of such tasks is the proverbial &quot;search for a needle in a haystack&quot;, e.g. in the form of a flat (hyper)plane with a single narrow peak.

==Applications==

The areas in which evolutionary algorithms are practically used are almost unlimited and range from industry, engineering, complex scheduling, agriculture, robot movement planning and finance to research and art. The application of an evolutionary algorithm requires some rethinking from the inexperienced user, as the approach to a task using an EA is different from conventional exact methods and this is usually not part of the curriculum of engineers or other disciplines. For example, the fitness calculation must not only formulate the goal but also support the evolutionary search process towards it, e.g. by rewarding improvements that do not yet lead to a better evaluation of the original quality criteria. For example, if peak utilisation of resources such as personnel deployment or energy consumption is to be avoided in a scheduling task, it is not sufficient to assess the maximum utilisation. Rather, the number and duration of exceedances of a still acceptable level should also be recorded in order to reward reductions below the actual maximum peak value. There are therefore some publications that are aimed at the beginner and want to help avoiding beginner&#x27;s mistakes as well as leading an application project to success. This includes clarifying the fundamental question of when an EA should be used to solve a problem and when it is better not to.

== Related techniques and other global search methods ==
There are some other proven and widely used methods of nature inspired global search techniques such as

* Memetic algorithm – A hybrid method, inspired by Richard Dawkins&#x27;s notion of a meme. It commonly takes the form of a population-based algorithm (frequently an EA) coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements. Emphasizes the exploitation of problem-specific knowledge and tries to orchestrate local and global search in a synergistic way.
* A cellular evolutionary or memetic algorithm uses a topological neighbouhood relation between the individuals of a population for restricting the mate selection and by that reducing the propagation speed of above-average individuals. The idea is to maintain genotypic diversity in the poulation over a longer period of time to reduce the risk of premature convergence.
* Ant colony optimization is based on the ideas of ant foraging by pheromone communication to form paths. Primarily suited for combinatorial optimization and graph problems.
* Particle swarm optimization is based on the ideas of animal flocking behaviour. Also primarily suited for numerical optimization problems.
* Gaussian adaptation – Based on information theory. Used for maximization of manufacturing yield, mean fitness or average information. See for instance Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory.

In addition, many new nature-inspired or methaphor-guided algorithms have been proposed since the beginning of this century. For criticism of most publications on these, see the remarks at the end of the introduction to the article on metaheuristics.

==Examples==

In 2020, Google stated that their AutoML-Zero can successfully rediscover classic algorithms such as the concept of neural networks.

The computer simulations &quot;Tierra&quot; and &quot;Avida&quot; attempt to model macroevolutionary dynamics.

<text>William Wotton (13 August 166613 February 1727) was an English theologian, classical scholar and linguist. He is chiefly remembered for his remarkable abilities in learning languages and for his involvement in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. In Wales he is remembered as the collector and first translator of the ancient Welsh laws.

==Life==
===Early years===
William Wotton was the second son of the Rev. Henry Wotton, rector of Wrentham, Suffolk. He was a child prodigy who could read verses from the Bible in English, Latin, Greek and Hebrew before he was six. In April 1676, when he was not yet ten years old, he was sent to Catharine Hall, Cambridge, and graduated in 1679. By this time Wotton had acquired Arabic, Syriac, and Aramaic, as well as a knowledge of logic, philosophy, mathematics, geography, chronology, and history. His parents died whilst he was still at Cambridge, and as a teenager he was taken into the household of Gilbert Burnet, later bishop of Salisbury. He was awarded a fellowship at St John&#x27;s College, from where he obtained an M.A. in 1683 and a B.D. in 1691. In 1686 he was appointed curate of Brimpton in Berkshire and the following year he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In January 1689 he was appointed vicar of Lacock in Wiltshire, which he held until his resignation in 1693. Soon after ordination he was also appointed chaplain to Daniel Finch Earl of Nottingham, and tutor to his family. Finch presented him with the rectory of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in 1693.

===Educational controversy===
Wotton began his scholarly career as the translator of Louis Dupin&#x27;s &quot;A new history of ecclesiastical writers&quot;, (13 vols. 1692–99). However, he is chiefly remembered for his share in the controversy about the respective merits of ancient and modern learning. In his &quot;Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning&quot; (1694, and again 1697) he took the part of the moderns, although in a fair and judicial spirit. According to Joseph Levine, &#x27;of all the works in the controversy that had yet appeared in English or French his was easily the most judicious.&#x27; He was attacked for pedantry by Swift in &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot; and &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, but his book proved that &#x27;Wotton was no mere pedant, but a wide-ranging intellect with a thorough command of learning, both ancient and modern.&#x27; Wotton responded calling Swift&#x27;s &quot;A Tale&quot; &quot;one of the profanest banters upon the religion of Jesus Christ, as such, that ever yet appeared.&quot; He also began to write a biography of the chemist Sir Robert Boyle, but his notes were lost and the work was never completed.

Wotton wrote a &quot;History of Rome&quot; in (1701) at the request of Bishop Burnet, which was later used by the historian Edward Gibbon. In recognition, Burnet appointed him as a prebend of Salisbury from 1705. In 1707 Wotton was awarded a &quot;Lambeth degree&quot; of Doctor of Divinity by Archbishop Thomas Tenison in recognition of his writings in support of the established Church of England against the Deists. Around 1713 Wotton also developed ideas concerning the relationship between languages introducing the concept of an early proto-language by relating Icelandic, the Romance languages and Greek. This pre-dated Sir William Jones&#x27; famous lecture comparing Sanskrit with the Classical languages, by more than seventy years. These theories were later published after Wotton&#x27;s death, as &quot;A discourse concerning the confusion of languages at Babel&quot; (1730).

===&quot;A Drunken Whoring Soul&quot;===
Throughout his adult life, Wotton was known to be &quot;a most excellent preacher, but a drunken whoring soul&quot;. He was also very extravagant, transforming his rectory into a 32-roomed mansion. He was, however, able to borrow money against future expectations of ecclesiastical preferment as a result of his close friendship with William Wake, then bishop of Lincoln. Between the summer of 1711 and the Spring of 1712, Wotton appears to have experienced a mid-life crisis, and he scandalised the neighbourhood on many occasions by being found drunk in public, or else was known to have spent prolonged periods in local brothels. As a result, he was initially warned about his behaviour by Wake, who later broke off their friendship and rescinded his promise of providing an additional living in Buckinghamshire. As soon as it became known that the rector&#x27;s expectations had been dashed, local tradesmen began to press for the payment of their debts. In May 1714, Wotton was forced to abandon his rectory at Milton Keynes to avoid his creditors, and for seven years he lived at Carmarthen in south-west Wales under the assumed name of Dr. William Edwards.

===Studies in Wales===
Whilst at Carmarthen, Wotton reformed his character and returned to his studies. He was also able to re-establish his friendship with Wake, who had become Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1715.

Wotton began to study Welsh, and produced an important bilingual parallel text edition of the Welsh and Latin texts of the medieval Welsh laws traditionally attributed to Hywel Dda at the request of his friend. To do this he had first to identify and obtain transcripts of a fifteen or so known manuscripts in either Latin or Mediaeval Welsh, and establish a text, and then begin the difficult task of translating the Mediaeval Welsh terminology which appeared in both the Latin and Welsh versions, but the meaning of which had been lost by the 18th century. From 1721 Wotton was assisted by the Welsh scholar Moses Williams. Wotton lived to complete the translation but was working on an accompanying glossary when he died. This was completed by Williams, and the whole work was published in 1730 by his son-in-law William Clarke in a large folio edition under the title &quot;Leges Wallicae&quot;.

Whilst at Carmarthen he also conducted surveys of the cathedrals of St David&#x27;s and Llandaff which were published by his friend Browne Willis in 1717 and 1718. He published &quot;Miscellaneous Discourses relating to the Traditions and Usages of the Scribes and Pharisees&quot; which included a translation of part of the &quot;Mishnah&quot; in (1718).

===Death===
Wotton had repaid his creditors and was able to return to Bath in October 1721 and London in June 1722 but was in very poor health. He was still working on his &quot;Leges Wallicae&quot;, when he died of dropsy at Buxted, Sussex, on 13 February 1727.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1982 was the 27th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Harrogate, United Kingdom, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; by Bucks Fizz. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the contest was held at the Harrogate International Centre on 24 April 1982 and was hosted by English television presenter and newsreader Jan Leeming.

Eighteen countries took part in the contest with deciding not to enter this year. Due to internal issues, regarding a reform of telecommunications laws was left without a broadcaster responsible for its participation for the first time in history.

The winner was with the song &quot; by Nicole. This was the first time that Germany had won the contest after having competed every year since the contest&#x27;s inception. Germany received 1.61 times as many points as runner-up , which was a record under the current scoring system until , when received 1.78 times as many points as . The song also cemented Ralph Siegel and Bernd Meinunger, the song&#x27;s composers, into German Eurovision tradition, writing 18 Eurovision songs between them before and after &quot;, 13 of which were for Germany.

==Location==
Harrogate is a spa town in North Yorkshire, England. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the town is a tourist destination and its visitor attractions include its spa waters and RHS Harlow Carr gardens. Nearby is the Yorkshire Dales national park and the Nidderdale AONB. Harrogate grew out of two smaller settlements, High Harrogate and Low Harrogate, in the 17th century. The town became known as &#x27;The English Spa&#x27; in the Georgian Era, after its waters were discovered in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries its &#x27;chalybeate&#x27; waters (containing iron) were a popular health treatment, and the influx of wealthy but sickly visitors contributed significantly to the wealth of the town.

The Harrogate International Centre was chosen as the host venue for the contest. The grand convention and exhibition centre opened short time prior to the contest, and was the first big event held in the main 2000-seat auditorium.

== Participating countries ==

With 18 participating countries, this was the last Eurovision contest to have such a low number of entries.

 was due to participate in the contest with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Themis Adamantidis. Although drawn to perform in position number 2, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) withdrew a few weeks before the contest. According to press reports, Greek Minister of Culture and Sports Melina Mercouri had voiced her opposition to the chosen entry as being too low in quality.

In November 1981, the French participating broadcaster, (TF1), declined to enter the Eurovision Song Contest 1982, with the head of entertainment, Pierre Bouteiller, saying, &quot;The absence of talent and the mediocrity of the songs is where annoyance sets in. [Eurovision is] a monument to insanity [sometimes translated as &quot;drivel&quot;].&quot; became the new French participating broadcaster after public outcry, entering the contest for the first time in .

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Anita Skorgan had represented and , and had provided backing vocals ; Jahn Teigen had represented ; Fatima Padinha and Teresa Miguel, members of Doce, had represented as part of Gemini; Sally Ann Triplett, a member of Bardo, had represented the as part of Prima Donna. In addition, Anna Vissi representing Cyprus, had represented along with the Epikouri; and Stella Maessen representing Belgium, had represented the as part of Hearts of Soul and as part of Dream Express. Olcayto Ahmet Tuğsuz, who represented as part of Nazar, provided backing vocals for Turkey.

==Format==
The opening of the contest showed a map of Europe, with the translation &quot;Where is Harrogate?&quot; popping up on-screen from the languages of the participating countries. The question was always in the language in which the respective country&#x27;s song was performed, with the exception of Ireland. The Irish entry was sung in English, but the translation of the question in the map was in Irish. Then the map zoomed into Harrogate&#x27;s location in Yorkshire, followed by an introduction video spotlighting the town.

This year, before the postcard of a specific country (with the exceptions of Israel, who had no commentator, and Yugoslavia, whose commentators were in their own country), the camera would zoom into the commentary box of that country&#x27;s broadcaster, where the commentator/s would give a hand gesture, e.g. wave. The postcard would start with the country&#x27;s flag on the screen and an excerpt of the country&#x27;s national anthem (though in the case of the host country, the UK, the song played was &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; instead of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, while the Israeli postcard began with an excerpt of &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; instead of &quot;Hatikvah&quot;). The postcards themselves, utilizing state-of-the-art video technology (for its time), were a montage of footage of the artist in Harrogate town or at the International Flower Festival. Some of the postcards also incorporated footage from the preview videos submitted by each participating broadcaster; only preview videos which did not consist of a performance of the song from a national final were used. Apart the national anthem, the postcards also used either a popular song or tune from the country being shown or a song performed at previous editions of Eurovision (i.e. for the Yugoslav entry, &quot;Jedan dan&quot; from 1968 was used, and for Israel, the winning song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; by Milk and Honey from 1979 was used). After the conclusion of the video clip, Jan Leeming introduced the conductor and then the artist for each nation.

== Contest overview ==

After coming second in the Hague in 1980 and in Dublin in 1981, Ralph Siegel and Bernd Meinunger took the first win for Germany. The country led the voting process from start to finish, with no competing country threatening at any point. At the end of 204 available points, Germany had gained 161, with Israel finishing with 100 in second place. For the winning country, this moment was also historic because around 13 million people in West Germany were tuned in to their televisions at that exact moment.

Nicole went on to sing the reprise of her song in English, French and Dutch, as well as German. The English version (also produced by Siegel and ) of her Eurovision winner, &quot;A Little Peace&quot;, subsequently shot to No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart.

<doc id="190846" wikidata="Q3132744" url="?curid=190846" title="Henry Dodwell">
<text>Henry Dodwell (October 16417 June 1711) was an Anglo-Irish scholar, theologian and controversial writer.

==Life==

Dodwell was born in Dublin in 1641. His father, William Dodwell, who lost his property in Connacht during the Irish rebellion, was married to Elizabeth Slingsby, daughter of Sir Francis Slingsby and settled at York in 1648. Henry received his preliminary education at St Peter&#x27;s School, York.

In 1654 he was sent by his uncle to Trinity College, Dublin, where he became a scholar and fellow, receiving the Bachelor of Arts in 1662 and Master of Arts in 1663. Having conscientious objections to taking religious orders, he relinquished his fellowship in 1666, but in 1688 was elected Camden professor of history at Oxford. In 1691 he was deprived of his professorship for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary.

Dodwell retired to Shottesbrooke in Berkshire to be near his friend, Francis Cherry. As the movement behind the refusal to swear allegiance declined, with the death of William Lloyd who had been deprived of his bishopric, and the decision by Thomas Ken to relinquish his claim to the See of Bath and Wells, Dodwell returned to the Church of England in 1710.

He died in Shottesbrooke.
==Works==

Living on the produce of a small estate in Ireland, he devoted himself to the study of chronology and ecclesiastical polity, providing a defence of the deprived nonjuring bishops. Edward Gibbon speaks of his learning as &quot;immense,&quot; and says that his &quot;skill in employing facts is equal to his learning,&quot; although he severely criticises his method and style. Dodwell&#x27;s works on ecclesiastical polity are more numerous than those on chronology.

In his ecclesiastical writings he was regarded as one of the greatest champions of the non-jurors; but the doctrine which he afterwards promulgated, that the soul is naturally mortal, and that immortality could be enjoyed only by those who had received baptism from the hands of one set of regularly ordained clergy, and was therefore a privilege from which dissenters were hopelessly excluded, did not strengthen his reputation.

Bishop Burnet thus addresses him in one of his letters : &quot;You are a learned man ; and your life has been not only without blemish, but exemplary ; but you do not seem to remember, or enough to consider, the woe our Saviour has denounced against those by whom scandals come ; and, according to the true notion of scandal, I know no man, that has laid more in the way of the little ones, or weaker Christians, than you have done. I do assure you, I would rather wish that I could neither read nor write, than to have read or writ to such purposes as you have been pursuing now above thirty years. You seem to love novelties and paradoxes, and to employ your learning to support them. I do assure you, I have a just value for many valuable things that I know to be in you ; and do heartily lament every thing that is otherwise.&quot;

==Dissertations upon Irenaeus==

Printed 1689 in Latin under the title of &quot;Dissertationes in Irenaeum&quot;. These Dissertations are only to what he further designed to show what the ancient heresies were, what disturbed the primitive Church, and their foundation.

We have at this day, certain most authentic ecclesiastical writers of the times, as Clemens Romanus, Barnabas, Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, who wrote in the same order wherein I have named them, and after all the writers of the New Testament. But in Hermas you will not find one passage, or any mention of the New Testament, nor in all the rest is any one of the evangelists named. If sometimes they cite passages like those we read in our gospels, you will find them so changed, and for the most part so interpolated, that it cannot be known whether they produced them out of ours, or some apocryphal gospels. Nay, they sometimes cite passages which most certainly are not in our present gospels.

==Bibliography==

His chief works on classical chronology are:
*&quot;A Discourse concerning Sanchoniathon&#x27;s Phoenician History&quot; (1681)
*&quot;Dissertations upon Irenaeus&quot; (1689)
*&quot;Chronologia Graeco-Romana pro hypothesibus Dion. Halicarnassei&quot; (1692)
*&quot;Annales Velleiani, Quintilianei, Statiani&quot; (1698)
*a larger treatise entitled &quot;De veteribus Graecorum Romanorumque Cyclis&quot; (1701).
*&quot;Annales Thucydidei et Xenophontei&quot; (1702)

==Family==

His eldest son, also named Henry Dodwell, was the author of a pamphlet entitled &quot;Christianity not founded on Argument&quot;, to which a reply was published by his brother William Dodwell (1709–1785), who was concurrently engaged in a controversy with Conyers Middleton on the subject of miracles. The pamphlet received many published replies at the time, and even as late as 1904 replies were still being made. Even the great Jonathan Swift was moved to write a reply against it.

<doc id="190847" wikidata="Q203509" url="?curid=190847" title="Uppland">
<text>Uppland () is a historical province or &quot;&quot; on the eastern coast of Sweden, just north of Stockholm, the capital. It borders Södermanland, Västmanland and Gästrikland. It is also bounded by lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. On the small uninhabited island of Märket in the Baltic, Uppland has a very short and unusually shaped land border with Åland, an autonomous province of Finland.

The name literally means &quot;up land&quot;, a name which is commonly encountered in especially older English literature as &quot;Upland&quot;. Its Latinised form, which is occasionally used, is &quot;Uplandia&quot;. Uppland is famous for having the highest concentration of runestones in the world, with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone left by the Vikings.

== Administration ==
The traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes, but are historical and cultural entities. The corresponding administrative county, or &quot;&quot;, is Uppsala County, which occupies the larger part of the territory. The bulk of the population, however, is within Stockholm County. Minor parts of the province are also in Västmanland, Gävleborg, and Södermanland Counties.

== Heraldry ==
Uppland&#x27;s arms were granted in 1560, distinctive in its depiction of a . Historically, Uppland ranked as a duchy and the coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet, blazoned thus: &quot;Gules, a Royal Orb Or gemmed of the field and Azure with the cross bottoned Argent.&quot; Despite the fact that the Uppsala County has a different name and a smaller territory, it was granted the same coat of arms in 1940.

== Geography ==
Uppland was historically divided into chartered cities and districts. Within Roslagen they were called &quot;&quot; (which roughly means &quot;ship district&quot;), and in the rest of the province hundreds. The abovementioned districts and cities have no administrative function today.

===Cities===
*Djursholm (1913)
*Enköping (approximately 1300)
*Lidingö (1926)
*Norrtälje (1622)
*Sigtuna (approximately 990)
*Solna (1943)
*Stockholm (1252)
*Sundbyberg (1927)
*Uppsala (1286)
*Vaxholm (1652)
*Öregrund (1491)
*Östhammar (approximately 1300)

===Districts===

===Facts===
*Highest mountain: Upplandsberget at Siggeforasjön, 117 metres
*Most Runestones: as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone
*Largest lake: Mälaren
*Archipelago: Roslagen
*National Parks: Ängsö, Färnebofjärden

=== Population ===
The population of Uppland was 1,602,652 as of 31 December 2016. The provincial population corresponds to the different overlapping counties as follows:

== History ==

Uppland is the birthplace of Bridget of Sweden (1303 – 23 July 1373).

The earliest unambiguous mention of the province of Uppland comes from the 1296, when it was mentioned that it included the &quot;Folklands&quot; of Fjärdhundraland, Attundaland, Tiundaland and Roslagen. The Swedish capital of Stockholm is divided between two provinces. The southern half lies in Södermanland and the northern half in Uppland.

=== Dukes and duchess ===

*Prince Waldemar (1310–1318 – also Öland)
**Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway, his wife (1312–1318 – also Öland)
* Prince Gustav (1827–1852)
* Prince Sigvard (1907–1934)

== Religion ==
Uppsala is the seat of the only archbishop of the Lutheran Church of Sweden. Before the Protestant Reformation, the archdiocese and archbishop were within the Roman Catholic Church.

== Culture ==
The archaeological site Birka and the castle of Drottningholm are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==Sports==
Football in the province is administered by Upplands Fotbollförbund. Bandy is also popular, with IK Sirius.

<text>Andrew Kippis (28 March 17258 October 1795) was an English nonconformist clergyman and biographer.

==Life==
The son of Robert Kippis, a silk-hosier, he was born at Nottingham. Having gone to Carre&#x27;s Grammar School in Sleaford, Lincolnshire he passed aged 16 to the Dissenting academy at Northampton, of which Dr Philip Doddridge was then president. In 1746 Kippis became minister of a church at Boston; in 1750 he moved to Dorking, Surrey; and in 1753 he became pastor of a Presbyterian congregation at Westminster, where he remained till his death.

Kippis took a prominent part in the affairs of his church. From 1763 till 1784 he was classical and philological tutor in the Coward Trust&#x27;s academy at Hoxton, and subsequently in the New College at Hackney. In 1778 he was elected a fellow of the Antiquarian Society, and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1779.

==Works==

Kippis was a voluminous writer. He contributed largely to &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; and &quot;The Library&quot;; and he established the &quot;New Annual Register&quot;. He published sermons and pamphlets; and he prefixed a life to Nathaniel Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (1788). He wrote a life prefixed to Philip Doddridge&#x27;s &quot;Exposition of the New Testament&quot; (1792). His major work is his edition of the &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot;; he only lived to publish five volumes (folio, 1778–1793). In this work he had the assistance of Joseph Towers, minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church.

One of the works by Kippis is &quot;Cook&#x27;s Voyages&quot;. This was first published in London in 1788 and includes a letter by Kippis to George III of the United Kingdom dated 13 June 1788. The book has accounts of the three voyages – 1768–1771, 1772–1775, and 1776–1779 – as well as an account of the character of James Cook, the effects of his voyages, and a commentary on his services.

<text>In telecommunications, message switching involves messages routed in their entirety, one hop at a time. It evolved from circuit switching and was the precursor of packet switching.

An example of message switching is email in which the message is sent through different intermediate servers to reach the mail server for storing. Unlike packet switching, the message is not divided into smaller units and sent independently over the network. 

== History ==
Western Union operated a message switching system, Plan 55-A, for processing telegrams in the 1950s. Leonard Kleinrock wrote a doctoral thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962 that analyzed queueing delays in this system. 

Message switching was built by Collins Radio Company, Newport Beach, California, during the period 1959–1963 for sale to large airlines, banks and railroads. 

The original design for the ARPANET was Wesley Clark&#x27;s April 1967 proposal for using Interface Message Processors to create a message switching network. After the seminal meeting at the first ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967, where Roger Scantlebury presented Donald Davies work and referenced the work of Paul Baran, Larry Roberts incorporated packet switching into the design.

The SITA High-Level Network (HLN) became operational in 1969, handling data traffic for airlines in real time via a message-switched network over common carrier leased lines. It was organised to act like a packet-switching network.

Message switching systems are nowadays mostly implemented over packet-switched or circuit-switched data networks. Each message is treated as a separate entity. Each message contains addressing information, and at each switch this information is read and the transfer path to the next switch is decided. Depending on network conditions, a conversation of several messages may not be transferred over the same path. Each message is stored (usually on hard drive due to RAM limitations) before being transmitted to the next switch. Because of this it is also known as a &#x27;store and forward&#x27; network. Email is a common application for message switching. A delay in delivering email is allowed real-time data transfer between two computers.

== Examples ==

Hop-by-hop Telex forwarding and UUCP are examples of message switching systems.

When this form of switching is used, no physical path is established in advance between sender and receiver. Instead, when the sender has a block of data to be sent, it is stored in the first switching office (i.e. router) then forwarded later one hop at a time. Each block is received in its entity form, inspected for errors and then forwarded or re-transmitted.

A form of store-and-forward network. Data is transmitted into the network and stored in a switch. The network transfers the data from switch to switch when it is convenient to do so, as such the data is not transferred in real-time. Blocking can not occur, however, long delays can happen. The source and destination terminal need not be compatible, since conversions are done by the message switching networks.

A message switch is &quot;transactional&quot;. It can store data or change its format and bit rate, then convert the data back to their original form or an entirely different form at the receive end. Message switching multiplexes data from different sources onto a common facility.
A message switch is one of the switching technologies.

==Store and forward delays==
Since message switching stores each message at intermediate nodes in its entirety before forwarding, messages experience an end to end delay which is dependent on the message length, and the number of intermediate nodes. Each additional intermediate node introduces a delay which is at minimum the value of the minimum transmission delay into or out of the node. Note that nodes could have different transmission delays for incoming messages and outgoing messages due to different technology used on the links. The transmission delays are in addition to any propagation delays which will be experienced along the message path.

In a message-switching centre an incoming message is not lost when the required outgoing route is busy. It is stored in a queue with any other messages for the same route and retransmitted when the required circuit becomes free. Message switching is thus an example of a delay system or a queuing system. Message switching is still used for telegraph traffic and a modified form of it, known as packet switching, is used extensively for data communications.

==Advantages==
The advantages to message switching are:
* Data channels are shared among communication devices, improving the use of bandwidth.
* Messages can be stored temporarily at message switches, when network congestion becomes a problem.
* Priorities may be used to manage network traffic.
* Broadcast addressing uses bandwidth more efficiently because messages are delivered to multiple destinations.

<text>Ritten (; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in South Tyrol in northern Italy.

==Territory==

The community is named after the high plateau, elevation , the Ritten or the Renon, on which most of the villages are located. The plateau forms the southeast tip of the Sarntal Alps mountain range and is located between, and on average above the rivers Eisack and Talfer. Ritten lies directly northeast of Bolzano, settled on the &quot;meeting point&quot; of the above rivers.

Ritten borders the following municipalities: Barbian, Bolzano, Kastelruth, Karneid, Völs, Jenesien, Sarntal and Villanders.

As of 31 December 2016, Ritten had a population of 7,847.

There are 17 fraziones (subdivisions, usually consisting of one or a few villages and hamlets). These include the central village Klobenstein (Collalbo), in which the townhall is located, as well as Atzwang (Campodazzo), Gissmann (Madonnina), Lengmoos (Longomoso), Lengstein (Longostagno), Mittelberg (Monte di Mezzo), Oberbozen (Soprabolzano), Oberinn (Auna di Sopra), Rotwand (Pietrarossa), Siffian (Siffiano), Signat (Signato), Sill (Castel Novale), Unterinn (Auna di Sotto), Wangen (Vanga), and Wolfsgruben (Costalovara).

Of these only Atzwang and Sill are not located on the plateau, but on the rivers Eisack and Talfer, respectively.

==History==
The mountain ridge is first mentioned in AD 871–75 as &quot;Mons Ritanus&quot; and then in 1027 as &quot;Mons Rittena&quot;. Already around 1200 a mountain inn was established on the plateau. In 1237 Runkelstein Castle was built on a rocky spur in Ritten territory by the lords of Wangen.

The Tyrolean patriotic hero Peter Mayr (1767–1810), involved in the rebellion against Napoleon&#x27;s forces that occupied Tyrol, was born in the village of Siffian in Ritten.

From the 17th century Ritten has been a popular summer destination for citizens of Bolzano, since the air is considerably cooler on the plateau. Ritten is connected with Bolzano with a provincial road and with a cableway from Oberbozen, one of the longest cableways of the world in one track, about long and 12 minutes to travel. In 1960, this cableway replaced the previous rack railway, built in 1907. The railway is still in function on the mountain side between Maria Himmelfahrt and Klobenstein.

===Coat of arms===

The official community coat of arms consists of gules two chevrons embowed argent; it is the arms of the Lords of &quot;Zwingenstein&quot; who ruled the village from their castle until 1531. The emblem was adopted in 1967.

==Main sights==
*Near Oberbozen and Lengstein are several groups of fairy chimneys (earth pyramids).
*Klobenstein has a high-elevation outdoor artificial ice track, the &quot;Arena Ritten&quot; or Ritten Kunsteisbahn, at which the 2007 and 2011 European Speed Skating Championships and many World Cup events have been held.

==Economy==
The candy company Loacker is based in Ritten.

== Notable people ==
* Frederick von Wangen, bishop of Trento, early 13th century
* Bruno Platter (born 1944) a Roman Catholic priest and the 65th Grand Master of the Teutonic Order

==Society==

===Linguistic distribution===
According to the 2024 census, 94.35% of the population speak German, 5.35% Italian and 0.30% Ladin as first language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkszählung 2024/Censimento della popolazione 2024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Svealand (), or Swealand, is the historical core region of Sweden. It is located in south-central Sweden and is one of the three historical lands of Sweden, bounded to the north by Norrland and to the south by Götaland. Deep forests, Tiveden, Tylöskog, and Kolmården, separated Svealand from Götaland. Historically, its inhabitants were called , from which is derived the English &#x27;Swedes&#x27;.

Svealand consists of the capital region Mälardalen in the east, Roslagen in the north-east, the former mining district Bergslagen in the center, and Dalarna and Värmland in the west. It includes an extensive archipelago of thousands of small islands in Södermanland and Uppland and has lakeshores on the four largest lakes in the country. In the interior, there are several ski resorts in the southern parts of the Scandinavian Mountains. Two large rivers run through Svealand. Klarälven originates in Norway and enters lake Vänern through Värmland, whereas Dalälven runs from Dalarna through the lake of Siljan. The other major river basins in Svealand are Norrström that runs up in Bergslagen through lakes Hjälmaren and Mälaren, along with Nyköpingsån that covers the post-glacial lake district of Södermanland. Svealand generally has a moderate continental climate with a gradual decline of precipitation and increase of temperatures moving eastwards as the elevation descends.

Stockholm, the capital and largest city in Sweden, is Svealand&#x27;s primate city and historical urban centre. The other administrative capitals are Falun, Karlstad, Nyköping, Uppsala, Västerås and Örebro.

The older name of Sweden in Swedish, (modern spelling: ) Realm of the Swedes, &quot;Swea Region&quot;, originally only referred to Svealand. Other forms are (Old Norse/Icelandic ), and . As the domains of the Swedish kings grew, the name Svealand began to be used to separate the original territory from the new.

== Provinces ==
Svealand is made up of the following six provinces:

*Dalarna
*Närke
*Södermanland
*Uppland
*Värmland
*Västmanland

Stockholm, the Swedish capital, is located in both Uppland and Södermanland, and a border stone can be found in the street in Stockholm Old Town ().

== Counties ==

Since 1634, Sweden has been divided into counties instead of provinces (see Län). Although Svealand is defined in terms of the historical provinces and not the counties, it roughly comprises the modern counties of Dalarna, Örebro, Södermanland, Stockholm, Uppsala, Värmland and Västmanland.

== History ==
Svealand was the original Sweden, to which it gave its name. This is supported by linguistics and is based on early medieval sources, such as the sagas. In Old Norse and in Old English, Svealand and Sweden are synonymous, and described as a separate country from Götaland. Svealand and Götaland were also divided by deep forests, which prevented both polities from being controlled effectively.

*In &quot;Sögubrot af Nokkrum&quot; for instance, Kolmården between Svealand and Östergötland is described as the border between Sweden and Östergötland ().
*In &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, king Ingold I rides to Sweden through Östergötland: .
* is mentioned in the travels of Ohthere of Hålogaland around 890.
*The lord Bo Jonsson Grip was probably the one who was best acquainted with the geography of the Swedish kingdom since he owned more than half of it. In 1384, he stated in his will that the kingdom consisted of (Sweden, i.e. Svealand), (i.e. Finland) and (i.e. Götaland).
*The 15th-century Swedish version of the says that was formerly a name for Sweden (Swerige) and Götaland: .

In the Early Middle Ages, the modern province of Gästrikland was part of Tiundaland, one of the three constituent parts of the modern province of Uppland, and therefore counted as a part of Svealand.

For a time in the early 19th century, the province of Värmland belonged to the Court of Appeal for Svealand. Even though Värmland historically belonged to Götaland (from 1815 until a new court, Court of Appeal for Western Sweden, was instituted), it has by custom long been considered part of Svealand.

<doc id="190854" wikidata="Q2665645" url="?curid=190854" title="Óengus II">
<text>Óengus mac Fergusa (Angus MacFergus; Irish &quot;Onuist&quot;, Latinised &quot;Hungus&quot;) was king of the Picts from 820 until 834. In Scottish historiography, he is associated with the veneration of Saint Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland, although this has not been proven.

== Life ==
Óengus succeeded his brother Caustantín to the throne. Previously thought to have been of Dál Riatan origin and descended from Fergus mac Echdach, their family is now assumed to have been that of the first king Óengus mac Fergusa, perhaps originating in Circin (presumed to correspond with the modern Mearns), a Pictish family with ties to the Eóganachta of Munster in Ireland.

Óengus, along with his brother, son Eogán, and nephew Domnall, is included in the &quot;Duan Albanach&quot;, a praise poem from the reign of Máel Coluim (III) mac Donnchada listing Máel Coluim&#x27;s predecessors as kings of Scots, of Alba and of Dál Riata from Fergus Mór and his brothers onwards. The inclusion of Pictish kings from Caustantín to Eogán in the &quot;Duan&quot; led to the supposition that Dál Riata was ruled by Pictish kings, or rather that Dál Riata kings ruled Pictland, leading to supposition that the origins of the Kingdom of Alba lay in a Gaelic conquest of Pictland. However, it is now suggested that their inclusion is due to their importance in the religious communities of Dunkeld and St Andrews, where they were seen as founders and early patrons. However, a modern reconstruction of the later lists of Dál Riata kings presumes that Óengus&#x27;s nephew Domnall was king of Dál Riata during this time (approximately 811–835).

Óengus died in 834, the only event of his reign reported in the Irish annals and was succeeded by his nephew Drest mac Caustantín. Óengus&#x27;s son Eogán was later king and was killed with his brother Bran in a battle against Vikings in 839.

== Association with Saint Andrew ==
Walter Bower in his &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; (1440s) supplies a legend according to which Saint Andrew appears to Óengus II in 832, on the eve of a battle against the Angles. The saint advises the king to watch for the &quot;sign of the Cross of Christ in the air&quot;. Bower&#x27;s account has precedents in earlier chroniclers John of Fordun (IV, xiii-xiv) and Andrew of Wyntoun. A still earlier reference of the 12th century simply states that &quot;King Hungus&quot; won a victory aided by Saint Andrew, in gratitude for which the Picts agreed to venerate the Saint. Skene, in his notes to Fordun IV, xiii-xiv, states that the episode is placed in the 4th century, making the entire tale anachronistic in the extreme. The three kings whom the legend has been tied to are Athelstan of England and Athelstan of East Anglia, as well as Guthrum the Old (whose baptismal name was Athelstan).

The &quot;Cross of Christ&quot; vision in Bower&#x27;s account (itself a reminiscence of the Milvian Bridge episode) is turned into the white on blue Saltire in the narrative by George Buchanan (1506–1582), who has such a saltire appear in the sky in the form of a cloud formation during the battle.

The religious site at St Andrews, originally Cennrígmonaid, long predates this Óengus. Túathalán, first known Abbot of Cennrígmonaid, died in 747, and it is thought likely that the establishment is due to the earlier Óengus (king from 729; died 761) or to Nechtan mac Der-Ilei (king 706–724 and ?728–729; died 732). The St Andrews Sarcophagus is assumed to have been made for the remains of Nechtan or the first Óengus. The later St Andrews tradition recounting the supposed arrival of Saint Regulus (or Saint Rule) at St Andrews, with relics of St Andrew, has him met at Forteviot by three sons of Óengus: Eogán, Nechtan and Finguine.

<text>Causantín or Constantín mac Fergusa () (789–820) was king of the Picts, in modern Scotland, from 789 until 820. He was until the Victorian era sometimes counted as Constantine I of Scotland; the title is now generally given to Causantín mac Cináeda. He is credited with having founded the church at Dunkeld which later received relics of St Columba from Iona.

== Life ==
It had been proposed that Causantín and his brother Óengus were sons of Fergus mac Echdach, King of Dál Riata, but this is no longer widely accepted. Instead, it is thought they were kin to the first king Óengus mac Fergusa, perhaps grandsons or grandnephews. This family may have originated in Circin (presumed to correspond with the modern Mearns) and had ties to the Eóganachta of Munster in Ireland.

Causantín&#x27;s reign falls in a period when Irish annals have relatively few notices of events in Scotland, possibly due to the failing of the annals believed to have been kept in Scotland at Iona and Applecross. Perhaps for that reason, there are only two reports which mention him. Other entries make it clear that the Vikings were active in Ireland and on the western coasts of Scotland at this time, which may also account for the lack of records. Iona was a target, and it may be that Abbot Noah of Kingarth, on the Isle of Bute, was killed by raiders.

The first report, in 789, is the record of a battle in Pictland between Causantín and Conall mac Taidg, in which Causantín was victorious. Conall later reappears in Kintyre, where was killed in 807. It is not known whether Causantín was king before defeating Conall. The king lists give varying lengths for his reign, from 35 to 45 years, and are not to be relied upon without independent confirmation. The second report is that of Causantín&#x27;s death in 820.

The Dupplin Cross was long assumed to commemorate Cináed mac Ailpín&#x27;s final victory over the Picts, as indeed, was Sueno&#x27;s Stone. Recent analysis has revealed a small part of an inscription on the Cross, in which Causantín is named. Accordingly, it is supposed that this monument was commissioned by him, or as a memorial to him. He appears there as , a latinisation derived from the Old Irish version of his name rather than the presumed Pictish form &quot;Castantin filius Uurguist&quot; found in the Poppleton manuscript and similar Pictish king lists.

It has been proposed that the St Andrews Sarcophagus was made for Causantín, but this is a minority view, as is the suggestion that the relics of St Columba, perhaps including the Monymusk Reliquary, may have been translated from Iona to Dunkeld during Causantín&#x27;s reign. The idea that Columba&#x27;s relics may have come to Dunkeld in the time of Causantín, rather than thirty years later in the time of Cináed mac Ailpín is based on an entry in the &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot; for 818.

That Causantín established Dunkeld is stated by later chroniclers such as John of Fordun who are following some variants of the Pictish king lists or other materials now lost. Andrew of Wyntoun dates the foundation to 815, although he states that this was after the deaths of Charlemagne and Pope Leo III, which would date it to 816 or later. It is suggested that Causantín is commemorated by the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;, a product of one of the principal céli dé monasteries of the day. As a patron of the céli dé, and perhaps a collaborator of Abbot Diarmait of Iona, it is thought that Causantín may have been a church reformer, in line with céli dé ideals. Caustantín appears also to have been a patron of the Northumbrian monasteries, as he is commemorated, along with his nephew Eogán, in the &quot;Liber Vitae Dunelmensis&quot;, which contains a list of those for whom prayers were said, dating from around 840.

Causantín was succeeded by his brother Óengus. His son Drest was later king. Causantín&#x27;s son Domnall is believed to have been king of Dál Riata from around 811 until 835. Causantín&#x27;s reputation among the kings who followed him may, perhaps, be demonstrated by the use of his name for three kings in the century and a half following his death when it is not attested as a kingly name in Scotland prior to his reign.

== Family ==
While Causantín&#x27;a parentage is not known with certainty, it is believed that he had two siblings: A brother Óengus, who succeeded him as King of the Picts, and a sister who is said to be his heir and was the mother of Alpín mac Echdach, founder of the Alpín dynasty, from which centuries of Scottish rulers descended.

Causantín is believed to have fathered at least 2 sons:
* Drest IX;
* Domnall.

<text>Fergus mac Echdach was king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland) from about 778 until 781.

He succeeded Áed Find. He is stated to have been a son of Eochaid mac Echdach, and thus a brother of Áed. Some much later sources make him a son of Áed, but this is not credited by modern studies. His death is noticed in 781 by the Annals of Ulster.

The next reported king of Dál Riata is Donncoirce.

<text>Áed Find (Áed the White), or Áed mac Echdach (before 732–778), was king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland and County Antrim, Ireland). Áed was the son of Eochaid mac Echdach, a descendant of Domnall Brecc in the main line of Cenél nGabráin kings.

According to later genealogies, Áed was the great-grandfather of Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín) who is traditionally counted as the first king of Scots. This descent ran through Áed&#x27;s son Eochaid mac Áeda Find and Eochaid&#x27;s son Alpín mac Echdach. The evidence for the existence of Eochaid and Alpín is uncompelling.

The Annals of Ulster in 768 report &quot;Bellum i Fortrinn iter Aedh &amp; Cinaedh&quot;: a battle in Fortriu between Áed and Cináed. This is usually read as meaning Áed Find and the Pictish king Ciniod I, who is called &quot;Cinadhon&quot; in the notice of his death in 775.

Áed&#x27;s death in 778 is noted by the Annals of Ulster. He appears to have been followed as king by his brother Fergus mac Echdach.

The &quot;Laws of Áed Eochaid&#x27;s son&quot; are mentioned by the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba in the reign of Áed&#x27;s supposed great-grandson Donald MacAlpin (Domnall mac Ailpín): &quot;In his time the Gaels with their king made the rights and laws of the kingdom [that are called the laws] of Áed Eochaid&#x27;s son, in Forteviot.&quot; What these laws concerned is not known.

==In fiction==
Áed Find is playable in &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot; (under the regnal name Áed III) in the &quot;Charlemagne&quot; DLC&#x27;s 769 AD start date, and is treated as an independent duke. His son Eochaid and brother Fergus also exist in his court. Without player intervention his realm is usually quickly conquered by neighboring Pictland.

<text>Eógan mac Muiredaig is named in some Scots sources as a king of Dál Riata, probably in the 730s.

Presumed to be the son of Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig, and thus a king of the Cenél Loairn, Eógan is not named in any surviving Irish annals, nor does he appear in the Duan Albanach, which passes from Muiredach to Áed Find. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Dál Riata&quot; names Eógan son of Muiredach as king after Muiredach, and the king-list in the Chronicle of Melrose includes him.

Later genealogies of the Mormaers of Moray trace their descent from the Cenél Loairn through one Ruadrí, a presumed brother of Eógan&#x27;s father.

Eógan&#x27;s reign falls in the period when Dál Riata was invaded and conquered by the Picts under Óengus mac Fergusa. The name of his successor is unknown, and the next king to appear in the record is Áed Find of the Cenél nGabráin, some three decades after Eógan&#x27;s time.

<text>Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig was king of the Cenél Loairn and of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland) from about 733 until 736.

He was the son of Ainbcellach mac Ferchair. His coming to power is reported in 733, and is not obviously associated with the death of Eochaid mac Echdach, the contemporary king of Dál Riata, in the Irish annals. It is not certain who preceded Muiredach as king of the Cenél Loairn, but it may have been his cousin Dúngal mac Selbaig. Muiredach is one of the kings named in the 11th-century praise poem &quot;Duan Albanach&quot;.

It is likely that his reign ended as a result of his defeat at the hands of the Picts of Fortriu, led by Talorgan mac Fergusa, brother of Óengus, at &quot;Cnoc Cairpri in Calathros at Etarlinde&quot;. The battle is recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, but Muiredach&#x27;s death is not.

The independent existence of the kingdom of the Cenél Loairn, and that of Dál Riata, probably ended in 736, after which time it formed part of the kingdom of the Picts, ruled by Óengus mac Fergusa. The next king of Dál Riata reported by the Irish annals is Áed Find, of the Cenél nGabráin, named in 768. Some Scottish sources, including the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;, have Muiredach&#x27;s son Eógan as his successor.

An entry in the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; under the year 771 (corresponding with about 776 AD, but perhaps as late as 778 AD since the death of Áed Find appears in the same year) reports Muiredach&#x27;s death.

<text>Eochaid mac Echdach was king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland) from 726 until 733. He was a son of Eochaid mac Domangairt.

Eochaid came to power as king of Dál Riata in 726, presumably deposing Dúngal mac Selbaig, son of Selbach mac Ferchair. Selbach may have tried to restore his son to power, and fought against Eochaid&#x27;s supporters at &quot;Irros Foichnae&quot; in 727, but without apparent success. The annals vary as to whether the despatch of a fleet from Dál Riata to Ireland to aid Flaithbertach mac Loingsig in his war with Áed Allán should be placed in the reign of Eochaid, or that of his successor.

At his death in 733, Eochaid is named king rather than lord of Dál Riata, which may suggest that after the defeat of Dúngal and Selbach his reign was unchallenged. His son, Áed Find, was later king of Dál Riata.

As Dál Riata certainly maintained a separate existence until 736, Eochaid must have had a successor, or successors. It appears that he was succeeded by Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig, who had replaced Dúngal mac Selbaig as king of the Cenél Loairn.

<text>Dúngal mac Selbaig was king of Dál Riata. His reign can best be placed in the years 723 to 726, beginning with the abdication of his father, Selbach mac Ferchair, who entered a monastery, and ending with the rise of Eochaid mac Echdach of the Cenél nGabráin. The High Medieval praise poem &quot;Duan Albanach&quot; names Dúngal the Impetuous, and claims that he ruled for seven years.

For over a generation before Dúngal&#x27;s reign the Cenél Loairn, to which he belonged, and the Cenél nGabráin had contested for control of Dál Riata. It seems that Dúngal&#x27;s father had finally managed to defeat his rivals shortly before he abdicated. For whatever reason, Dúngal soon lost power to the Cenél nGabráin. His father left the monastery and attempted to restore his son, but failed.

While Dúngal was no longer king of Dál Riata after 726, it may be that he remained ruler of the Cenél Loairn. Certainly he retained some following. In 731, he burned Tairpert Boitir, most probably Tarbert on Loch Fyne which was in the lands of the Cenél nGabráin and possibly a portage site.

In 733 the Annals of Ulster report that Dúngal profaned Tory Island by forcibly removing Bruide, who is presumed to be the son of Óengus mac Fergusa, king of the Picts. This entry is followed by the statement that Dúngal&#x27;s cousin, Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig, became king of the Cenél Loairn, and it seems probable that the rise of Muiredach, and Dúngal&#x27;s epithet, stem from his doings on Tory Island.

In 734 Dúngal fled to Ireland, &quot;to escape the power of Óengus&quot;. Dúngal later returned to Scotland, and was captured in 736, along with his brother Feredach, by Óengus. Their subsequent fates are unknown.

<text>Selbach mac Ferchair (died 730) was king of the Cenél Loairn and of Dál Riata. Selbach&#x27;s existence is well-attested as he is mentioned repeatedly in Irish annals.

==Life==
Selbach mac Ferchair was a son of Ferchar Fota. He ruled as king of the Cenél Loairn from around 698 until his abdication in 723, but it may be that he was undisputed ruler of Dál Riata only in the final years of his reign.

He is known to have had two sons, Dúngal and Feredach. Selbach&#x27;s father, brother, son and nephew are included among the predecessors of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III) of Scotland in the &quot;Duan Albanach&quot; praise poem, but Selbach is not. This may be a form of &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot;.

Although Selbach is first mentioned after the death of Fiannamail ua Dúnchado (died 700), it seems likely that he had deposed his brother Ainbcellach in 698. In 701 he destroyed Dún Olaigh, but whether this was in a war against Ainbcellach, against a king of the rival Cenél nGabráin, or some other enemies, is unknown. A number of battles involving Dál Riada are recorded in the time of Selbach, a defeat in &quot;Glen Lemnae&quot; in 704, and victories over the Britons at &quot;Lorg Ecclet&quot; in 711 and again at &quot;the rock called &quot;Minuirc&quot;&quot; in 717, but Selbach is not named in these reports. In 712 Selbach besieged &quot;Aberte&quot; (Dunaverty, near Southend, Kintyre, in the lands of the Cenél nGabráin) and rebuilt Dún Olaigh in 714.

In September 719 Selbach fought against his brother Ainbcellach at &quot;Finnglen&quot; (perhaps near Loch Fyne). Ainbcellach was killed in the battle. A month later he faced the Cenél nGabráin, led by their king Dúnchad Bec, also called king of &quot;Cenn Tíre&quot; (Kintyre), in a sea battle off &quot;Ard Nesbi&quot;. Selbach was defeated, but Dúnchad Bec died in 721, which may have left Selbach as the unchallenged king of Dál Riata.

In 723 Selbach abdicated and retired to a monastery, at which time one annalist calls him lord of Dál Riada. He was probably succeeded by his son Dungal, who was replaced by Eochaid mac Echdach in 726. Selbach is found in 727 fighting against the supporters of Eochaid at &quot;Irros Foichnae&quot;.

<doc id="190865" wikidata="Q722777" url="?curid=190865" title="Fiannamail ua Dúnchado">
<text>Fiannamail ua Dúnchado was a king of Dál Riata (modern-day western Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the end of the 7th century. Little can be said with certainty other than the recording of his death in 700AD, where he is listed as having been slain alongside Flann mac Cind-fâelad of the Cianachta Glenn Geimin in present-day County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.

His killing is reported, and he is named king of Dál Riata, by the Annals of Ulster. The Annals of Tigernach state that he was king of Dál nAraide, although he is not named in the genealogies of the Dál nAraide in the Book of Leinster. He may be the same person as Fiannamail mac Osseni who is mentioned in 699, and he is certainly the Fiannamail ua Dúnchado (Fiannamail grandson of Dúnchad) who witnessed the Cáin Adomnáin in 696–697, in which Fiachrae Cosalach is named as king of the cruithne of Dál nAraide, which argues strongly that Fiannamail was not a king of Dál nAraide.

The identity of his grandfather, Dúnchad — most commonly assumed to be the son of Conaing son of Áedán mac Gabráin — is not certain. However, many members of this family are thought to appear in the annals, including a brother, or cousin, of Fiannamail named Béc and an uncle named Conall. Dúnchad Bec may also have been a kinsman of Fiannamail.

Fiannamail is said to have had at least two sons, Indrechtach and Conall, who were killed in 741 at the battle of Forboros, perhaps fighting against the Picts led by Óengus mac Fergusa. Indrechtach son of Fiannamail is sometimes presumed to be the same person as the Indrechtach who fathered Tommaltach mac Indrechtaig, king of the Dál nAraide and Ulaid, but this Indrechtach&#x27;s father is named Lethlobar in the Book of Leinster, which poses considerable problems.

<text>Joseph Barber Lightfoot (13 April 1828 – 21 December 1889), known as J. B. Lightfoot, was an English theologian and Bishop of Durham.

==Life==
Lightfoot was born in Liverpool, where his father John Jackson Lightfoot was an accountant. His mother, Ann Matilda Barber, was from a family of Birmingham artists. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, under James Prince Lee. His contemporaries included Brooke Foss Westcott and Edward White Benson. In 1847, Lightfoot went to Trinity College, Cambridge, and read for his degree along with Westcott. He graduated senior classic and 30th wrangler, and was elected a fellow of his college. From 1854 to 1859 he edited the &quot;Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology&quot;. In 1857, he became tutor and his fame as a scholar grew. He was made Hulsean professor in 1861, and shortly afterwards chaplain to the Prince Consort and honorary chaplain in ordinary to Queen Victoria.

In 1866, he was Whitehall preacher, and in 1871 he became canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote after his death that

In 1875, Lightfoot became Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity in succession to William Selwyn. In 1879, he was consecrated bishop of Durham in succession to Charles Baring; he was enthroned at Durham Cathedral on 15 May. He soon surrounded himself with a band of scholarly young men.

Lightfoot was never married. He died at Bournemouth and was succeeded in the episcopate by Westcott, his schoolfellow and lifelong friend. He served as President of the first day of the 1880 Co-operative Congress.

He is buried in Auckland Castle Chapel, with a memorial in Durham Cathedral close to the choir stalls.

==Work==
Lightfoot wrote commentaries on the Epistle to the Galatians (1865), Epistle to Philippians (1868) and Epistle to the Colossians (1875). In 1874, the anonymous publication of &quot;Supernatural Religion&quot;, a skeptical work by Walter Richard Cassels, attracted much attention. In a series of rebuttals published in the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot;, between December 1874 and May 1877, Lightfoot undertook the defense of the New Testament canon. The articles were published in collected form in 1889. About the same time he was engaged in contributions to William Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Christian Biography and Dictionary of the Bible&quot;, and he also joined the committee for revising the translation of the New Testament.
The corpus of Lightfoot&#x27;s writings include essays on biblical and historical subject matter, commentaries on Pauline epistles, and studies on the &quot;Apostolic Fathers&quot;. His sermons were posthumously published in four official volumes, and additionally in the Contemporary Pulpit Library series. At Durham he continued to work at his editions of the &quot;Apostolic Fathers&quot;, and in 1885 published an edition of the &quot;Epistles of Ignatius and Polycarp&quot;, collecting also materials for a second edition of &quot;Clement of Rome&quot;, which was published after his death (1st edition, 1869). He defended the authenticity of the &quot;Epistles of Ignatius&quot;.

Lightfoot had said that he was open to the idea of a diaconate that included women and in 1899 Emily Marshall wrote &quot;A Suggestion for our Times&quot; on this theme. Marshall said she was told by Lightfoot to give her idea of training women in his diocese, to take on this role, &quot;a practical form&quot;. Lightfoot&#x27;s death resulted in her idea being shut down. Marshall created a new religious order within the church based on Lightfoot&#x27;s discussion of the Third Order of Saint Francis who had historically consisted of men and women who did not live in monasteries or wear cowls. Marshall however regretted that diaconate idea had been lost due to his death.

In 2014, it was announced that InterVarsity Press had agreed to publish about 1500 pages of previously unpublished biblical commentaries and essays by Lightfoot found in Durham Cathedral. The first of the three volume set covers the Acts of the Apostles, the second is a commentary on the Gospel of John and the third is on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and the First Epistle of Peter.

==Family==
Lightfoot was the nephew of the artists Joseph Vincent Barber and Charles Vincent Barber and grandson of the artist and founding member of the Birmingham School of Art, Joseph Barber and great-grandson of the founder of Newcastle&#x27;s first library, Joseph Barber whose tomb is in Newcastle Cathedral.

<text>A library catalog (or library catalogue in British English) is a register of all bibliographic items found in a library or group of libraries, such as a network of libraries at several locations. A catalog for a group of libraries is also called a union catalog. A bibliographic item can be any information entity (e.g., books, computer files, graphics, realia, cartographic materials, etc.) that is considered library material (e.g., a single novel in an anthology), or a group of library materials (e.g., a trilogy), or linked from the catalog (e.g., a webpage) as far as it is relevant to the catalog and to the users (patrons) of the library.

The earliest library catalogs were lists, handwritten or enscribed on clay tablets and later scrolls of parchment or paper. As codices (books with pages) replaced scrolls, so to did library catalogs become like handwritten ledgers and, in some cases, printed books. During the late 18th century through mid-19th century, cataloguing on paper slips or cards gradually replaced ledgers and books as the main medium for library catalogs, and in the 20th it was long ubiquitous. The card catalog was a familiar sight to library users for generations. Computerized cataloguing developed gradually from the mid-20th, and by the late 20th and early 21st, it had mostly replaced card catalogs. The advent of the web brought about ubiquitous use of online public access catalogs (OPACs). Some people still informally refer to the online catalog as a &quot;card catalog&quot;. 

The largest international library catalog in the world is the WorldCat union catalog managed by the non-profit library cooperative OCLC. In January 2021, WorldCat had over half a billion catalog records and three billion library holdings.

== Goal ==

Antonio Genesio Maria Panizzi in 1841 and Charles Ammi Cutter in 1876 undertook pioneering work in the definition of early cataloging rule sets formulated according to theoretical models. Cutter made an explicit statement regarding the objectives of a bibliographic system in his &quot;Rules for a Printed Dictionary Catalog&quot;. According to Cutter, those objectives were

1. to enable a person to find a book of which any of the following is known (Identifying objective):
* the author
* the title
* the subject
* the date of publication

2. to show what the library has (Collocating objective)
* by a given author
* on a given subject
* in a given kind of literature

3. to assist in the choice of a book (Evaluating objective)
* as to its edition (bibliographically)
* as to its character (literary or topical)

These objectives can still be recognized in more modern definitions formulated throughout the 20th century.

Other influential pioneers in this area were Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan and Seymour Lubetzky.

Cutter&#x27;s objectives were revised by Lubetzky and the Conference on Cataloging Principles (CCP) in Paris in 1960/1961, resulting in the Paris Principles (PP).

A more recent attempt to describe a library catalog&#x27;s functions was made in 1998 with Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), which defines four user tasks: find, identify, select, and obtain.

A catalog helps to serve as an inventory or bookkeeping of the library&#x27;s contents. If an item is not found in the catalog, the user may continue their search at another library.

== Card ==
A catalog card is an individual entry in a library catalog containing bibliographic information, including the author&#x27;s name, title, and location. Eventually the mechanization of the modern era brought the efficiencies of card catalogs. It was around 1780 that the first card catalog appeared in Vienna. It solved the problems of the structural catalogs in marble and clay from ancient times and the later codex—handwritten and bound—catalogs that were manifestly inflexible and presented high costs in editing to reflect a changing collection. The first cards may have been French playing cards, which in the 1700s were blank on one side.

In November 1789, during the dechristianization of France during the French Revolution, the process of collecting all books from religious houses was initiated. Using these books in a new system of public libraries included an inventory of all books. The backs of the playing cards contained the bibliographic information for each book and this inventory became known as the &quot;French Cataloging Code of 1791&quot;.

English inventor Francis Ronalds began using a catalog of cards to manage his growing book collection around 1815, which has been denoted as the first practical use of the system. In the mid-1800s, Natale Battezzati, an Italian publisher, developed a card system for booksellers in which cards represented authors, titles and subjects. Very shortly afterward, Melvil Dewey and other American librarians began to champion the card catalog because of its great expandability. In some libraries books were cataloged based on the size of the book while other libraries organized based only on the author&#x27;s name. This made finding a book difficult.

The first issue of &quot;Library Journal&quot;, the official publication of the American Library Association (ALA), made clear that the most pressing issues facing libraries were the lack of a standardized catalog and an agency to administer a centralized catalog. Responding to the standardization matter, the ALA formed a committee that quickly recommended the &quot;Harvard College-size&quot; cards as used at Harvard and the Boston Athenaeum. It also suggested that a larger card, approximately , would be preferable. By the end of the nineteenth century, the bigger card won out, mainly to the fact that the card was already the &quot;postal size&quot; used for postcards.

Melvil Dewey saw well beyond the importance of standardized cards and sought to outfit virtually all facets of library operations. To the end he established a Supplies Department as part of the ALA, later to become a stand-alone company renamed the Library Bureau. In one of its early distribution catalogs, the bureau pointed out that &quot;no other business had been organized with the definite purpose of supplying libraries&quot;. With a focus on machine-cut index cards and the trays and cabinets to contain them, the Library Bureau became a veritable furniture store, selling tables, chairs, shelves and display cases, as well as date stamps, newspaper holders, hole punchers, paper weights, and virtually anything else a library could possibly need. With this one-stop shopping service, Dewey left an enduring mark on libraries across the country. Uniformity spread from library to library.

Dewey and others devised a system where books were organized by subject, then alphabetized based on the author&#x27;s name. Each book was assigned a call number which identified the subject and location, with a decimal point dividing different sections of the call number. The call number on the card matched a number written on the spine of each book. In 1860, Ezra Abbot began designing a card catalog that was easily accessible and secure for keeping the cards in order; he managed this by placing the cards on edge between two wooden blocks. He published his findings in the annual report of the library for 1863 and they were adopted by many American libraries.

Work on the catalog began in 1862 and within the first year, 35,762 catalog cards had been created. Catalog cards were ; the Harvard College size. One of the first acts of the newly formed American Library Association in 1908 was to set standards for the size of the cards used in American libraries, thus making their manufacture and the manufacture of cabinets, uniform. For almost a century (1901-1997), the LOC (U.S. Library of Congress) printed and sold copies of its own catalog cards to libraries in the United States, reducing duplication of work in cataloguing across libraries. OCLC, a major supplier of catalog cards, printed the last one in October 2015.

In a physical catalog, the information about each item is on a separate card, which is placed in order in the catalog drawer depending on the type of record. If it was a non-fiction record, Charles A. Cutter&#x27;s classification system would help the patron find the book they wanted in a quick fashion. Cutter&#x27;s classification system is as follows:
* A: encyclopedias, periodicals, society publications
* B–D: philosophy, psychology, religion
* E–G: biography, history, geography, travels
* H–K: social sciences, law
* L–T: science, technology
* X–Z: philology, book arts, bibliography
Some libraries with OPAC access still have card catalogs on site, but these are now strictly a secondary resource and are seldom updated. Many libraries that retain their physical card catalog will post a sign advising the last year that the card catalog was updated. Some libraries have eliminated their card catalog in favor of the OPAC for the purpose of saving space for other use, such as additional shelving. The old cabinets are resold, as many people enjoy owning them for storage of personal effects in the home.

== Types ==
Traditionally, there are the following types of catalog:
* &quot;Author&quot; catalog: a formal catalog, sorted alphabetically according to the names of authors, editors, illustrators, etc.
* Subject catalog: a catalog that sorted based on the Subject.
* &quot;Title&quot; catalog: a formal catalog, sorted alphabetically according to the article of the entries.
* &quot;Dictionary&quot; catalog: a catalog in which all entries (author, title, subject, series) are interfiled in a single alphabetical order. This was a widespread form of card catalog in North American libraries prior to the introduction of the computer-based catalog.
* &quot;Keyword&quot; catalog: a subject catalog, sorted alphabetically according to some system of keywords.
* Mixed alphabetic catalog forms: sometimes, one finds a mixed author / title, or an author / title / keyword catalog.
* &quot;Systematic&quot; catalog: a subject catalog, sorted according to some systematic subdivision of subjects. Also called a &quot;Classified&quot; catalog. 
* &quot;Shelf list&quot; catalog: a formal catalog with entries sorted in the same order as bibliographic items are shelved. This catalog may also serve as the primary inventory for the library.

== History ==

The earliest librarians created rules for how to record the details of the catalog. By 700 BCE the Assyrians followed the rules set down by the Babylonians. The seventh century BCE Babylonian Library of Ashurbanipal was led by the librarian Ibnissaru who prescribed a catalog of clay tablets by subject. Subject catalogs were the rule of the day, and author catalogs were unknown at that time. The frequent use of subject-only catalogs hints that there was a code of practice among early catalog librarians and that they followed some set of rules for subject assignment and the recording of the details of each item. These rules created efficiency through consistency—the catalog librarian knew how to record each item without reinventing the rules each time, and the reader knew what to expect with each visit. The task of recording the contents of libraries is more than an instinct or a compulsive tic exercised by librarians; it began as a way to broadcast to readers what is available among the stacks of materials. The tradition of open stacks of printed books is paradigmatic to modern American library users, but ancient libraries featured stacks of clay or prepaper scrolls that resisted browsing.

As librarian, Gottfried van Swieten introduced the world&#x27;s first card catalog (1780) as the Prefect of the Imperial Library, Austria.

During the early modern period, libraries were organized through the direction of the librarian in charge. There was no universal method, so some books were organized by language or book material, for example, but most scholarly libraries had recognizable categories (like philosophy, saints, mathematics). The first library to list titles alphabetically under each subject was the Sorbonne library in Paris. Library catalogs originated as manuscript lists, arranged by format (folio, quarto, etc.) or in a rough alphabetical arrangement by author. Before printing, librarians had to enter new acquisitions into the margins of the catalog list until a new one was created. Because of the nature of creating texts at this time, most catalogs were not able to keep up with new acquisitions.

When the printing press became well-established, strict cataloging became necessary because of the influx of printed materials. Printed catalogs, sometimes called &quot;dictionary catalogs&quot;, began to be published in the early modern period and enabled scholars outside a library to gain an idea of its contents. Copies of these in the library itself would sometimes be interleaved with blank leaves on which additions could be recorded, or bound as &quot;guardbooks&quot; in which slips of paper were bound in for new entries. Slips could also be kept loose in cardboard or tin boxes, stored on shelves. The first card catalogs appeared in the late 19th century after the standardization of the 5 in. x 3 in. card for personal filing systems, enabling much more flexibility, and toward the end of the 20th century the online public access catalog was developed (see below). These gradually became more common as some libraries progressively abandoned such other catalog formats as paper slips (either loose or in sheaf catalog form), and guardbooks. The beginning of the Library of Congress&#x27;s catalog card service in 1911 led to the use of these cards in the majority of American libraries. An equivalent scheme in the United Kingdom was operated by the British National Bibliography from 1956 and was subscribed to by many public and other libraries.

* c. Seventh century BCE, the royal Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh had 30,000 clay tablets, in several languages, organized according to shape and separated by content. Assurbanipal sent scribes to transcribe works in other libraries within the kingdom.
* c. Third century BCE, Pinakes by Callimachus at the Library of Alexandria was arguably the first library catalog.
* 9th century: Libraries of Carolingian Schools and monasteries employ library catalog system to organize and loan out books.
* : The Persian city of Shiraz&#x27;s library had over 300 rooms and thorough catalogs to help locate texts these were kept in the storage chambers of the library and they covered every topic imaginable.
* : Library at Amiens Cathedral in France uses call numbers associated with the location of books.
* –1605: The Mughul emperor Akbar was a warrior, sportsman, and famous cataloger. He organized a catalog of the Imperial Library&#x27;s 24,000 texts, and he did most of the classifying himself.
* 1595: &quot;Nomenclator&quot; of Leiden University Library appears, the first printed catalog of an institutional library.
* Renaissance Era: In Paris, France The Sorbonne Library was one of the first libraries to list titles alphabetically based on the subject they happened to fall under. This became a new organization method for catalogs.
* Early 1600s: Sir Thomas Bodley divided cataloging into three different categories. History, poesy, and philosophy.
* 1674: Thomas Hyde&#x27;s catalog for the Bodleian Library.
* 1791: The French Cataloging Code of 1791
* 1815: Thomas Jefferson sells his personal library to the US government to reestablish the Library of Congress after British troops burned the first one during the War of 1812. He had organized his library by adapting Francis Bacon&#x27;s organization of knowledge, specifically using Memory, Reason, and Imagination as his three areas, which were then broken down into 44 subdivisions.

More about the early history of library catalogs has been collected in 
1956 by Strout.

== Sorting ==

In a title catalog, one can distinguish two sort orders:
* In the &quot;grammatical&quot; sort order (used mainly in older catalogs), the most important word of the title is the first sort term. The importance of a word is measured by grammatical rules; for example, the first noun may be defined to be the most important word.
* In the &quot;mechanical&quot; sort order, the first word of the title is the first sort term. Most new catalogs use this scheme, but still include a trace of the grammatical sort order: they neglect an article (The, A, etc.) at the beginning of the title.

The grammatical sort order has the advantage that often, the most important word of the title is also a good keyword (question 3), and it is the word most users remember first when their memory is incomplete. To its disadvantage, many elaborate grammatical rules are needed, so many users may only search with help from a librarian.

In some catalogs, persons&#x27; names are standardized (i. e., the name of the person is always cataloged and sorted in a standard form) even if it appears differently in the library material. This standardization is achieved by a process called authority control. Simply put, authority control is defined as the establishment and maintenance of consistent forms of terms – such as names, subjects, and titles – to be used as headings in bibliographic records. An advantage of the authority control is that it is easier to answer question 2 (Which works of some author does the library have?). On the other hand, it may be more difficult to answer question 1 (Does the library have some specific material?) if the material spells the author in a peculiar variant. For the cataloger, it may incur too much work to check whether &quot;Smith, J.&quot; is &quot;Smith, John&quot; or &quot;Smith, Jack&quot;.

For some works, even the title can be standardized. The technical term for this is &quot;uniform title&quot;. For example, translations and re-editions are sometimes sorted under their original title. In many catalogs, parts of the Bible are sorted under the standard name of 
the book(s) they contain. The plays of William Shakespeare are another frequently cited example of the role played by a &quot;uniform title&quot; in the library catalog.

Many complications about alphabetic sorting of entries arise. Some examples:
* Some languages know sorting conventions that differ from the language of the catalog. For example, some Dutch catalogs sort &quot;IJ&quot; as &quot;Y&quot;. Should an English catalog follow this suit? And should a Dutch catalog sort non-Dutch words the same way? There are also pseudo-ligatures which sometimes come at the beginning of a word, such as Œdipus. See also Collation and Locale (computer software).
* Some titles contain numbers, for example &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Should they be sorted as numbers, or spelled out as &quot;Two thousand and one&quot;? (Book-titles that begin with non-numeral-non-alphabetic glyphs such as #1 are similarly very difficult. Books which have diacritics in the first letter are a similar but far-more-common problem; casefolding of the title is standard, but stripping the diacritics off can change the meaning of the words.) 
* &quot;de Balzac, Honoré&quot; or &quot;Balzac, Honoré de&quot;? &quot;Ortega y Gasset, José&quot; or &quot;Gasset, José Ortega y&quot;? (In the first example, &quot;de Balzac&quot; is the legal and cultural last name; splitting it apart would be the equivalent of listing a book about tennis under &quot;-enroe, John Mac-&quot; for instance. In the second example, culturally and legally the lastname is &quot;Ortega y Gasset&quot; which is sometimes shortened to simply &quot;Ortega&quot; as the masculine lastname; again, splitting is culturally incorrect by the standards of the culture of the author, but defies the normal understanding of what a &#x27;last name&#x27; is—i.e. the final word in the ordered list of names that define a person—in cultures where multi-word-lastnames are rare. See also authors such as Sun Tzu, where in the author&#x27;s culture the surname is traditionally printed first, and thus the &#x27;last name&#x27; in terms of order is in fact the person&#x27;s first-name culturally.)

== Classification ==

In a subject catalog, one has to decide on which classification system to use. The cataloger will select appropriate subject headings for the bibliographic item and a unique classification number (sometimes known as a &quot;call number&quot;) which 
is used not only for identification but also for the purposes of shelving, placing items with similar subjects near one another, which aids in browsing by library users, who are thus often able to take advantage of serendipity in their search process.

== Online ==

Online cataloging, through such systems as the Dynix software developed in 1983 and used widely through the late 1990s, has greatly enhanced the usability of catalogs, thanks to the rise of MARC standards (an acronym for MAchine Readable Cataloging) in the 1960s.

Rules governing the creation of MARC catalog records include not only formal cataloging rules such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, second edition (AACR2), Resource Description and Access (RDA) but also rules specific to MARC, available from both the U.S. Library of Congress and from OCLC, which builds and maintains WorldCat.

MARC was originally used to automate the creation of physical catalog cards, but its use evolved into direct access to the MARC computer files during the search process.

OPACs have enhanced usability over traditional card formats because:
# The online catalog does not need to be sorted statically; the user can choose author, title, keyword, or systematic order dynamically.
# Most online catalogs allow searching for any word in a title or other field, increasing the ways to find a record.
# Many online catalogs allow links between several variants of an author&#x27;s name. 
# The elimination of paper cards has made the information more accessible to many people with disabilities, such as the visually impaired, wheelchair users, and those who suffer from mold allergies or other paper- or building-related problems.
# Physical storage space is considerably reduced.
# Updates are significantly more efficient.

<doc id="190873" wikidata="Q3525193" url="?curid=190873" title="Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)">
<text>Thomas Hearne or Hearn (Latin: &quot;Thomas Hearnius&quot;, July 167810 June 1735) was an English diarist and prolific antiquary, particularly remembered for his published editions of many medieval English chronicles and other important historical texts.

==Life==
Hearne was born at Littlefield Green in the parish of White Waltham, Berkshire, the son of George Hearn, the parish clerk. Having received his early education from his father, he showed such taste for study that a wealthy neighbour, Francis Cherry of Shottesbrooke (c. 1665–1713), a celebrated nonjuror, interested himself in the boy, and sent him to the school at Bray &quot;on purpose to learn the Latin tongue&quot;. Soon Cherry took him into his own house, and his education was continued at Bray until Easter 1696 when he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford.

At the university, he attracted the attention of Dr John Mill (1645–1707), the principal of St Edmund Hall, who employed him to compare manuscripts and in other ways. Having taken the degree of B.A. in 1699 he was made assistant keeper of the Bodleian Library, where he worked on the catalogue of books, and in 1712 he was appointed second keeper. In 1715 Hearne was elected Architypographus and Esquire Bedell in civil law in the university, but objection having been made to his holding this office together with that of second librarian, he resigned it in the same year.

A nonjuror himself, he refused to take the oaths of allegiance to King George I, and early in 1716 he was deprived of his librarianship, and &quot;he was, in fact, locked out of the library&quot;. However, he continued to reside in Oxford, and occupied himself in editing the English chroniclers. Hearne refused several important academic positions, including the librarianship of the Bodleian and the Camden professorship of ancient history, rather than take the oaths. He died on 10 June 1735, and was buried in the graveyard of St Peter-in-the-East, now deconsecrated.

The readers of Hearne&#x27;s works were devoted to them because of the depth of scholarship. He corresponded, for example, with Dr Henry Levett, an early English physician and medical doctor at Charterhouse, London. In November 1715, indicating the devotion of Hearne&#x27;s readers, he reminded Dr Levett that &quot;you formerly desired to be a subscriber for every Thing I published. I have accordingly put you down for one copy of Acts of the Ap. in Capitals&quot;.

==Works==
Hearne&#x27;s most important work was done as editor of many of the English chronicles. Until the appearance of the Rolls Series, his editions were in some cases the only ones existent. Some have praised them for being well prepared and sourced.

Among the most important of a long list are:
*Benedict of Peterborough&#x27;s (Benedictus Abbas) &quot;De vita et gestis Henrici II. et Ricardi I.&quot; (1735)
*John of Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; (1722)
*the monk of Evesham&#x27;s &quot;Historia vitae et regni Ricardi II&quot; (1729)
*Robert Mannyng&#x27;s translation of Piers Langtoft&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; (1725)
*the work of Thomas Otterbourne and John Whethamstede as &quot;Duo rerum Anglicarum scriptores veteres&quot; (1732)
*Robert of Gloucester&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; (1724)
*&quot;Thomae Sprotti Chronica&quot; (1719); Hearne&#x27;s title is now thought to be misleading about this work, of the end of the 14th century, too late to be by Thomas Sprott the Benedictine chronicler (fl. 1292).
*the &quot;Vita et gesta Henrici V&quot;, which he wrongly attributed to Thomas Elmham and which now goes under the designation Ps-Elmham (1727)
*the &quot;Vita Henrici V&quot; of Tito Livio Frulovisi (1716)
*Walter of Hemingburgh&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; (1731)
*William of Newburgh&#x27;s &quot;Historia rerum Anglicarum&quot; (1719).

He also edited:
*John Leland&#x27;s &quot;Itinerary&quot; (1710–1712) and the same author&#x27;s &quot;Collectanea&quot; (1715)
*William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Annales rerum Anglicarum et Hibernicarum regnante Elizabetha&quot; (1717)
*Sir John Spelman&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alfred&quot; (1709)
*William Roper&#x27;s &quot;Life of Sir Thomas More&quot; (1716).

He brought out editions of:
*Livy (1708)
*Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Epistolae et panegyricus&quot; (1703)
*&quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; (1715).

Among his other compilations were: 
*&quot;Ductor historicus, a Short System of Universal History&quot; (1698, 1704, 1705, 1714, 1724)
*&quot;A Collection of Curious Discourses by Eminent Antiquaries&quot; (1720)
*&quot;Reliquiae Bodleianae&quot; (1703).

Hearne left his manuscripts to William Bedford, who sold them to Dr Richard Rawlinson, who in his turn bequeathed them to the Bodleian. Two volumes of extracts from his voluminous diary were published by Philip Bliss (Oxford, 1857), and afterwards an enlarged edition in three volumes appeared (London, 1869). A large part of his diary entitled &quot;Remarks and Collections&quot;, 1705–1714, edited by C. E. Doble and D. W. Rannie, has been published by the Oxford Historical Society (1885–1898). &quot;Bibliotheca Hearniana&quot;, excerpts from the catalogue of Hearne&#x27;s library, was edited by Beriah Botfield (1848).

Hearne&#x27;s work in publishing these old manuscripts was not appreciated by all: Alexander Pope dismisses them as unappealing and &quot;monkish&quot; in &quot;An Epistle to Burlington&quot; and satirises Hearne as the pedant Wormius in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, dropping into mock-Old English to do so. This in turn led Hearne in his diary to insult Pope&#x27;s lack of scholarship.

<text>Skåneland (Swedish and Danish) or Skånelandene (Danish) is a region on the southern Scandinavian peninsula. It includes the Swedish provinces of Blekinge, Halland, and Scania. The Danish island of Bornholm is traditionally also included. Skåneland has no official recognition or function and the term is not in common usage. Equivalent terms in English and Latin are &quot;the Scanian Provinces&quot; and &quot;Terrae Scaniae&quot; respectively. The term is mostly used in historical contexts and not in daily speech. In Danish, &quot;Skånelandene&quot; is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a political entity but a cultural region, without officially established administrative borders.

The provinces making up Skåneland were part of Denmark from at least the 9th century, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Eastern Provinces&quot; since a 12th-century civil war, Denmark has been a kingdom with a single king. Blekinge was a part of Sweden until the early 13th century when it became part of Denmark (the Danish Census Book contains the first secure written evidence of Danish control). The provinces were part of the territory ceded to Sweden in 1658 under the Treaty of Roskilde, but after an uprising on Bornholm, that island was returned to Denmark in 1660, under the Treaty of Copenhagen.
In July 1720, a peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark again confirmed the status of Skåneland as part of Sweden.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Skåneland&quot; was first recorded in print (in Swedish) in 1719. It is unclear what area is meant. Later (1751) Carl Linnaeus uses it, meaning the province of Scania. The modern use of the denomination as a short form for &quot;De skånska landskapen&quot; (&quot;The Scanian provinces&quot;), for the combined area of the provinces of Blekinge, Halland and Scania, was launched by the Swedish historian and Scandinavist Martin Weibull (1835-1902) in 
&quot;Samlingar till Skånes historia&quot; (Föreningen för Skånes Fornminnen och Historia&quot;.
published 1868-73 in six volumes) in order to illuminate the common Danish history of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland.

Weibull used the term as a combined term for the four provinces where the Scanian Law had its jurisdiction, as well as the area of the archdiocese of Lund until the Reformation in 1536, later the Danish Lutheran diocese of Lund. This form of Skåneland was then used in the regional historical periodical &quot;Historisk tidskrift för Skåneland&quot;, beginning in 1901, published by Martin&#x27;s son, Lauritz Weibull.

== Administration ==
An earlier administrative and political function of the area was to serve as a core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called hundreds (&quot;herreder&quot; in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted by an increase in royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous administrative units called &quot;syssel&quot;. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.

In the 13th century, a new fiscal system was introduced and the hundreds were gradually included into larger administrative units called &quot;len&quot;, with a castle serving as the administrative center. This new administrative development was a result of the increased power of the aristocracy. In each &quot;len&quot;, a noble man was put in charge, with the title &quot;lensmand&quot;.

Each of the four provinces of Skåneland had representation in the Scanian Thing, which, along with the other two Things of the Danish state (Jutland and Zealand), elected the Danish king.

The four Scanian provinces were joined under the jurisdiction of the Scanian Law, dated 1200–1216, the oldest Nordic provincial law. In the chapter &quot;Constitutional history&quot; in &quot;Danish Medieval History, New Currents&quot;, the three provincial Things are described as being the legal authority that instituted changes suggested by the elected king. The suggestions for changes submitted by the king had to be approved by the three Things before being passed into law in the Danish state.

=== Status today ===
Skåneland is strictly a historic and cultural region. The name has long appeared as a term used in historical contexts in a variety of sources. The southern part of Sweden, including Skåneland, is considered to be included in Götaland, one of three historic &quot;lands of Sweden&quot;. The &quot;land&quot; Götaland bears the same name used for the historic province Götaland (a province referred to as &quot;Gothia&quot; on the 17th-century maps); the inclusion of Skåneland (and Bohuslän) is described as historically inaccurate by the Swedish Nationalencyklopedin. as it is named after the Geats.

As in other cultural regions, regionalism in Scania sometimes has a base in regional nationalism and sometimes in a more general opposition against centralized state nationalism or expansionist nationalism. As noted about regionalism in Norway, Scandinavian regionalism is not necessarily separatist.

=== Modern usage ===
There are a number of minor organisations promoting the use of the term, mainly active online, e.g. &quot;Föreningen Skånelands Framtid&quot; or &quot;Skåneländsk Samling&quot;, the Skåneland Football Federation, and &quot;Stiftelsen Skåneländska Flaggans Dag&quot;.

The private foundation &quot;Stiftelsen Skånsk Framtid&quot; (&quot;foundation for a Scanian future&quot;) was a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) from 1993 to 2011, representing Skåneland under the name of Scania.

== History ==
=== Population and settlements ===
The earliest Danish historians, writing in the 12th and 13th century, believed that the Danish Kingdom had existed since king Dan, in a distant past. Eighth century sources mention the existence of Denmark as a kingdom. According to 9th century Frankish sources, by the early 9th century many of the chieftains in the south of Scandinavia acknowledged Danish kings as their overlords, though kingdom(s) were very loose confederations of lords until the last couple medieval centuries saw some increased centralization. The west and south coast of modern Sweden was so effectively part of the Danish realm that the said area (and not the today Denmark) was known as &quot;Denmark&quot; (literally the frontier of the Daner). Svend Estridsen (King of Denmark 1047 – ca. 1074), who may have been from Scania himself, is often referred to as the king who along with his dynasty established Scania as an integral part of Denmark. Blekinge was a part of Sweden until the early 13th century when it became part of Denmark (the Danish Census Book contains the first secure written evidence of Danish control).

===From 1397 to 1658===
When the Kalmar Union was formed in 1397, the union was administered from Copenhagen. By 1471 Sweden rebelled under Sture family leadership. In 1503, when Sten Sture the Elder died, eastern Sweden&#x27;s independence from Denmark had been established.

In 1600 Denmark controlled virtually all land bordering on Skagerrak, Kattegat, and the Sound. The current Swedish provinces of Skåne, Blekinge and Halland were Danish and the province of Bohuslän was Norwegian. Skåneland became the site of harsh fighting, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, as Denmark and Sweden confronted each other for control of the Baltic.

Sweden intervened in the Danish civil war known as the Count&#x27;s Feud (1534–1536), launching a highly destructive invasion of Skåneland as the ally of later king Christian III, who upon his coronation introduced Protestantism to the provinces. Subsequently, in the period between the breakup of the Kalmar Union and 1814, Denmark and Sweden fought in Skåneland in 11 separate wars and other border provinces: the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War (1563–70), Kalmar War (1611–1613), Torstenson War (1644–1645), Second Northern War (1657–1658 and 1659–1660), Scanian War (1674–1678), Great Northern War (1700 and 1709–1720), Theater War (1788), and the Napoleonic Wars (1808–1809 and 1814).
* During the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, attacks were launched on Sweden from Danish Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to Danish Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.
* During the Torstenson War, a theater of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, extensive combat took place in the Danish provinces of Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge. By the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645) Denmark ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen and agreed Sweden was to occupy the Danish province of Halland for 30 years as a guarantee of the treaty provisions.
* During the Second Northern War (1655–1658), Danish attempts to recover control of Halland ended in a serious defeat administered by Sweden. As a result, in the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), which was largely confirmed by the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), Denmark ceded the provinces of Skåne, Blekinge and Halland (i.e., Skåneland).

Vilhelm Moberg (1898–1973) in &quot;Min Svenska Historia II&quot; (Norstedts. 1971) provides a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by both sides in the struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame people passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24 Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.

===Assimilation with Sweden===
Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 – but in direct contradiction of its terms – the Swedish government in 1683 demanded that the leading social groups of Skåneland accept Swedish customs and laws. Swedish became the only language permitted in Church liturgy and in schools, religious literature in Danish was banned, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be Swedish. However the last Danish bishop, Peder Winstrup (1605–1679) remained in charge of the Diocese of Lund until his death in 1679. To promote further Swedish assimilation, the University of Lund was inaugurated in 1666; the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in Copenhagen University until the 19th century.
The population initially opposed the Swedish reforms, as can be ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the Göinge district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as &quot;snapphanar&quot;, a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits. The punishments included the use of impalement breaking on the wheel, as well as the nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, it could take four to five days before the victim died.

The transformation of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model could not be effected quickly or easily. In the first fifty years of the transition, the treatment of the population was quite harsh. Denmark made several attempts to recapture the territories, the last in 1710, but ultimately conceded the territories as lost.

Before 1658, one of the provinces of Skåneland, Scania proper, had consisted of four counties: the counties of Malmøhus, Landskrone, Helsingborg and Christianstad. When Skåneland was annexed by Sweden, one of the counties of Scania, Kristianstad County, was merged with Blekinge to form one of a total of three Blekinge counties.

===Bornholm rebellion===

In 1658, shortly after the Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Johan Printzensköld (ca. 1615 – 8 December 1658) was sent to Bornholm to start the assimilation process, the population of Bornholm rebelled. Led by Jens Pedersen Kofoed (1628-1691) and Poul Anker (1629-1697) the rebellion formed in the town of Hasle, north of the largest city, Rønne. Before the rebel army reached the Swedish headquarters in Rønne, Printzenskiold was shot by Willum Clausen in the street of Sølvgade, in central Rønne.
The Swedish fled the island as a result of the confusion and fear amongst the conscripts; Jens Kofoed installed an intermediate rule and sent a message to King Frederick III of Denmark that Bornholm had liberated itself, and wished to return to Danish rule. This was confirmed in the 1660 peace settlement between Denmark and Sweden.

===Klågerup riots in 1811===
The last Swedish assault on the civilian population occurred as late as 15 June 1811, when Swedish military killed &quot;around 30&quot; and wounded &quot;around 60&quot; peasants in Klågerup. The Swedish army units also arrested 395 people of which 2 were beheaded at Stortorget square in Malmö at 4 November 1811.
=== Swedish administration ===
Sweden appointed a Governor General, who in addition to having the highest authority of the government, also was the highest military officer. The first to hold the post of Governor General was Gustaf Otto Stenbock, between 1658 and 1664. His residence was in the largest city, Malmö.

The office of Governor General was abandoned in 1669, deemed unnecessary. However, when the Scanian War erupted in 1675, the office was reinstated, and Fabian von Fersen (1626–1677) held the office between 1675 and 1677, when he died in the defence of Malmö.
He was replaced by Rutger von Ascheberg (1621–1693) in 1680 who held it to his death in 1693. It was during Ascheberg&#x27;s time in office that the stricter policy of Swedification was initiated, as a reaction to the threats of war and possible Danish liberation.

Following the death of Ascheberg, the Governor Generalship was dismantled into a separate county governor for each of the Swedish provinces Blekinge, Halland and Scania. However, a Governor Generalship was reinstated in the province of Scania during the Napoleonic War, when Johan Christopher Toll (1743–1817) became the last Governor-General in the region, a post he held 1801–09.

===Recent history===
The complete history of Skåneland was not taught for a long time in schools in Skåneland, especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt. Instead a Swedish-centric history was taught, and the Scanian history before 1658, for instance concerning the list of monarchs, was disregarded as a component of Danish history. In reaction, a movement began in the late 20th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland. The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history.

<text>Benedict, sometimes known as Benedictus Abbas (Latin for &quot;Benedict the Abbot&quot;; died 29 September 1193), was abbot of Peterborough. His name was formerly erroneously associated with the &quot;Gesta Henrici Regis Secundi&quot; and &quot;Gesta Regis Ricardi&quot;, English 12th-century chronicles, which are now attributed to Roger of Howden.

==Life==
Benedict first makes his appearance in 1174, as the chancellor of Archbishop Richard, the successor of Thomas Becket in the primacy. In 1175, Benedict became prior of Holy Trinity, Canterbury; in 1177, he received from Henry II the abbacy of Peterborough, which he held until his death. As abbot he distinguished himself by his activity in building, in administering the finances of his house and in collecting a library. He is described in the &quot;Chronicon Petroburgense&quot; as &quot;blessed both in name and deed&quot;.

==Works==
Benedict belonged to the circle of Becket&#x27;s admirers, and wrote two works dealing with the martyrdom and the miracles of his hero. Fragments of the former work have come down to us in the compilation known as the &quot;Quadrilogus&quot;, which is printed in the fourth volume of James Craigie Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Materials for the Histories of Thomas Becket&quot; (&quot;Rolls&quot; series); the miracles are extant in their entirety, and are printed in the second volume of the same collection.

Benedict was formerly credited with the authorship of the &quot;Gesta&quot; on the ground that his name appears in the title of the oldest manuscript. There is, however, conclusive evidence that Benedict merely caused this work to be transcribed for the Peterborough library. It is only through the force of custom that the work is still occasionally cited under his name. In the 20th century, D. M. Stenton formulated the theory, developed further by David Corner, and now generally accepted, that the true author of the &quot;Gesta&quot; was in fact Roger of Howden. On his return from the Third Crusade, he drew upon them in composing his larger &quot;Chronica&quot;, revising them and adding supplementary material.

In the 19th century, the question of authorship had been discussed by T. D. Hardy, William Stubbs and Felix Liebermann. Stubbs conjecturally identified the first part of the &quot;Gesta&quot; (1170–1177) with the &quot;Liber Tricolumnis&quot;, a register of contemporary events kept by Richard Fitz Neal, the treasurer of Henry II and author of the &quot;Dialogus de Scaccario&quot;; the latter part (1177–1192) was ascribed by Stubbs to Roger of Howden. His theory concerning the &quot;Liber Tricolumnis&quot;, was rejected by Liebermann and other editors of the &quot;Dialogus&quot; (A. Hughes, C. G. Crump and C. Johnson, Oxford, 1902).

<text>Götaland (; also &quot; Gothia&quot;, &quot;Gothland&quot;, &quot;Gothenland&quot; or &quot;Gautland&quot;) is one of three lands of Sweden and comprises ten provinces. Geographically it is located in the south of Sweden, bounded to the north by Svealand, with the deep woods of Tiveden, Tylöskog and Kolmården marking the border.

Götaland once consisted of petty kingdoms, and their inhabitants were called &quot;Gautar&quot; in Old Norse. However, the term mainly referred to the population of modern Västergötland. It is agreed that these were the same as the &quot;Geats&quot;, the people of the hero Beowulf in England&#x27;s national epic, &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

The modern state of Sweden started forming when some provinces of Götaland gradually became more and more politically intertwined with those of Svealand. This process can be traced back to at least the 10th century, and would continue for several hundred years. Other parts of modern Götaland were at that time either Danish or Norwegian. The province of Småland, with the historically important city Kalmar on its coast, was sparsely populated and the status of the Baltic island Gotland varied during the Middle Ages. Bohuslän became Swedish first during the 17th century after being taken from Norway, around the same time as Denmark lost Scania, Halland and Blekinge to Sweden.

== Etymology ==
The earliest possible mentions of the &quot;götar&quot; is by the 2nd-century geographer Ptolemy, who mentions the &quot;Goutai&quot; (Γούται in Greek). Later, the Anglo-Saxon epic &quot;Beowulf&quot; (8th–11th century) is partly set among the &quot;Gēatas&quot;. Norwegian and Icelandic sources sometimes use &quot;Gautar&quot; only for the people of Västergötland, but sometimes as a common ethnic term for the people of both Västergötland and Östergötland. Västergötland appears in medieval Icelandic and Norwegian sources as &quot;Gautland&quot; (Götland), a form which is not etymologically identical to &quot;Götaland&quot;.

The name &quot;Götaland&quot; replaced the old &quot;Götland&quot; in the 15th century, and it was probably to distinguish the wider region it denoted from the traditional heartland in Västergötland. The name Götaland probably originally referred only to Västergötland and Östergötland, but was later extended to adjoining districts. The name &quot;Götaland&quot; is possibly a plural construction and means the &quot;lands of the Geats&quot;, where &quot;Göta-&quot; is the genitive plural of the ethnonym Göt (Geat). The interpretation that the neuter noun -&quot;land&quot; is a plural and not a singular noun is indicated by Bo Jonsson Grip&#x27;s will in 1384, where he stated that he donated property in &quot;Swerige&quot; (Sweden, i.e. Svealand), &quot;Österlandom&quot; (Finland) and in &quot;Göthalandom&quot; to monasteries. Here Götaland appears in the plural form of the dative case.

For the etymology of the element Geat/Gaut/Göt and Goth, see Geat.

== History ==

Västergötland and Östergötland, once rival kingdoms themselves, constitute Götaland proper. The Geatish kings, however, belong to the domain of Norse mythology. Both Västergötland and Östergötland have large agricultural areas where villages and towns were established in the past. The large river Göta Älv drains the third largest lake in Europe, Lake Vänern. At its mouth (where Gothenburg emerged during the earlier part of the 17th century) the population in Västergötland had access to the Kattegat sea. The Göta Älv estuary also formed the border between the Kingdoms of Norway and Denmark until the 13th century.

Geatland is the land in which the medieval hero of the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; is said to have lived.

It was only late in the Middle Ages that Götaland began to be perceived as a part of Sweden. In Old Norse and in Old English sources, Gautland/Geatland is still treated as a separate country from Sweden. In &quot;Sögubrot af Nokkrum&quot; for instance, Kolmården between Svealand and Östergötland is described as the border between Sweden and Ostrogothia (...), and in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, King Ingold I rides to Sweden through Östergötland: &quot;Ingi konungr fór með hirð sína ok sveit nokkura ok hafði lítinn her. Hann reið austr um Smáland ok í eystra Gautland ok svá í Svíþjóð&quot;. In 1384 Bo Jonsson (Grip) stated in his will that the kingdom consisted of &quot;Swerige&quot; (Sweden, i.e. Svealand), &quot;Österland&quot; (i.e. Finland) and &quot;Göthaland&quot; (i.e. Götaland, as of the 1384 borders).

The small countries to the south – Finnveden, Kind, Möre, Njudung, Tjust, Tveta, Värend, and Ydre – were merged into the province of Småland (literally: [the] &quot;small lands&quot;). Off the coast of Småland was the island of Öland, which became a separate province. Dal to the north west became the province of Dalsland.

Småland, Öland and Dalsland were already seen as lands belonging to Götaland during the Scandinavian Middle Ages (12th–15th century).

Småland was full of deep forests, especially in the south, and was of lesser importance to Götaland compared to the agricultural areas in Västergötland and Östergötland. On its Baltic Sea coast lay the important town of Kalmar, where in 1397 the Kalmar Union was proclaimed at Kalmar Castle, a personal union of the three countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway under one ruler.


In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), the kingdom of Denmark-Norway ceded the Danish provinces of Blekinge, Halland, Scania, and Norwegian province of Bohuslän to Sweden. These provinces are since then counted as parts of Götaland.

The island of Gotland shifted allegiance between the Swedes and the Danes several times. Although the island may be perceived to have closer links to Svealand, it is counted as part of Götaland.

Värmland originally belonged to the Göta Court of Appeal, but the province changed to become part of the Court of Appeal for Svealand for a period of time in the early 19th century.

== Provinces and counties ==
Today, Götaland has no administrative function and is thus an unofficial entity, but it is generally considered to be one of three Swedish lands or parts. It is made up of ten provinces, based loosely on the area originally under the jurisdiction of the Göta Court of Appeals (established in 1634), to which the Scanian lands, Gotland and Bohuslän were added in 1658–79:
Administratively, Sweden is not divided into provinces but into counties (see Län). Although Götaland is defined in terms of the historical provinces and not the counties, it roughly comprises the modern counties of Blekinge, Gotland, Halland, Jönköping, Kalmar, Kronoberg, Östergötland, Scania and Västra Götaland.

== Geography ==

Deep forests are found in the Småland province, there is plenty of farmland in Scania, and a little bit of both in Västergötland and Östergötland. Coasts are usually relatively flat and consist of archipelagoes as well as sandy beaches. The two largest islands of Sweden are included in Götaland. The two largest lakes of Sweden are also situated mainly in Götaland. The total area is 87,712 km2 with about 4.4 million inhabitants including the second and third largest urban areas of Sweden.

<doc id="190878" wikidata="Q7806129" url="?curid=190878" title="Timeline of nuclear fusion">
<text>EditThis timeline of nuclear fusion is an incomplete chronological summary of significant events in the study and use of nuclear fusion.

==1920s==
* 1920
** Based on F.W. Aston&#x27;s measurements of the masses of low-mass elements and Einstein&#x27;s discovery that formula_1, Arthur Eddington proposes that large amounts of energy released by fusing small nuclei together provides the energy source that powers the stars.
** Henry Norris Russell notes that the relationship in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram suggests a hot core rather than burning throughout the star. Eddington uses this to calculate that the core would have to be about 40 million Kelvin. This was a matter of some debate at the time, because the value is much higher than what observations suggest, which is about one-third to one-half that value.
* 1928
** George Gamow introduces the mathematical basis for quantum tunnelling.
* 1929
** Atkinson and Houtermans provide the first calculations of the rate of nuclear fusion in stars. Based on Gamow&#x27;s tunnelling, they show fusion can occur at lower energies than previously believed. When used with Eddington&#x27;s calculations of the required fusion rates in stars, their calculations demonstrate this would occur at the lower temperatures that Eddington had calculated.

==1930s==
* 1932
** Ernest Rutherford&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University begins nuclear experiments with a particle accelerator built by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.
** In April, Walton produces the first man-made nuclear disintegration by using protons from the accelerator to split lithium into alpha particles. They discover the intermediary creation of the extremely short-lived beryllium-8 isotope. This could be considered the first artificial fusion.
* 1934
** Using an updated version of the equipment firing deuterium rather than hydrogen, Mark Oliphant discovered helium-3 and tritium, and that heavy hydrogen nuclei could be made to react with each other. This is considered the first artificial fusion.
*1937
**George Gamow and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker suggest proton combination into deuterium may be the source of stellar energy.
* 1938
** In March, Hans Bethe attends the Carnegie Institute and George Washington University&#x27;s fourth annual Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics on Edward Teller&#x27;s insistence. He works with Charles Critchfield to derive stellar nuclear reactions beyond the proton combination into deuterium. They publish two reactions based on the incorrect assumption tritium is more stable, and four reactions based on the correct assumption helium-3 is more stable, thereby discovering the proton–proton chain.
** Kantrowitz and Jacobs of the NACA Langley Research Center built a toroidal magnetic bottle and heat the plasma with a 150 W radio source. Hoping to heat the plasma to millions of degrees, the system fails and they are forced to abandon their Diffusion Inhibitor. This is the first attempt to make a working fusion reactor.
* 1939
** Peter Thonemann develops a detailed plan for a pinch device, but is told to do other work for his thesis.
** Hans Bethe publishes the discovery of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle in higher mass stars. Along with the proton-proton chain, this work results in the 1967 Nobel Prize for Physics.

==1940s==
* 1945
** The Smyth Report, detailing the history of fission research and the Manhattan Project, briefly refers to Bethe&#x27;s discovery of the CNO cycle and the eventual possibility of laboratory fusion, without using the word &quot;fusion&quot;.
* 1946
** George Paget Thomson of Imperial College, London designs the toroidal solenoid, a simple fusion device. With Moses Blackman, he further develops the concept and files for a patent. This becomes the first fusion device to receive a patent. Repeated attempts to get development funding fail.
* 1947
** A meeting at Harwell on the topic of fusion raises new concerns with the concept. On his return to London, Thomson gets graduate students James L. Tuck and Alan Alfred Ware to build a prototype device out of old radar parts.
** Peter Thonemann comes up with a similar idea, but uses a different method of heating the fuel. This seems much more practical and finally gains the mild interest of the UK nuclear establishment. Not aware of who he is talking to, Thonemann describes the concept to Thomson, who adopts the same concept.
** Herbert Skinner begins to write a lengthy report on the entire fusion concept, pointing out several areas of little or no knowledge.
* 1948
** The Ministry of Supply (MoS) asks Thomson about the status of his patent filing, and he describes the problems he has getting funding. The MoS forces Harwell to provide some money, and Thomson releases his rights to the patent. It is granted late that year.
** Skinner publishes his report, calling for some experimental effort to explore the areas of concern. Along with the MoS&#x27;s calls for funding of Thomson, this event marks the beginning of formal fusion research in the UK.

==1950s==
* 1950
** In January, Klaus Fuchs admits to passing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. Almost all nuclear research in the UK, including the fledgling fusion program, is immediately classified. Thomson, until this time working at Imperial University, is moved to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment.
** The tokamak, a type of magnetic confinement fusion device, was proposed by Soviet scientists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm.
* 1951
** Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) develop the Teller-Ulam design for the thermonuclear weapon, allowing for the development of multi-megaton weapons.
** A press release from Argentina claims that their Huemul Project had produced controlled nuclear fusion. This prompted a wave of responses in other countries, especially the U.S.
*** Lyman Spitzer dismisses the Argentinian claims, but while thinking about it comes up with the stellarator concept. Funding is arranged under Project Matterhorn and develops into the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
*** Tuck introduces the British pinch work to LANL. He develops the Perhapsatron under the codename Project Sherwood. The project name is a play on his name via Friar Tuck.
*** Richard F. Post presents his magnetic mirror concept and also receives initial funding, eventually moving to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).
*** In the UK, repeated requests for more funding that had previously been turned down are suddenly approved. Within a short time, three separate efforts are started, one at Harwell and two at Atomic Weapons Establishment (Aldermaston). Early planning for a much larger machine at Harwell begins.
*** Using the Huemul release as leverage, Soviet researchers find their funding proposals rapidly approved. Work on linear pinch machines begins that year.
**On May 9, the American nuclear test Greenhouse George, the first of a boosted fission weapon, yields 255 kilotons from an enriched uranium core and deuterium-tritium gas. This is the artificial thermonuclear fusion, and the first weaponization of fusion energy.
**Experimental research of toroidal magnetic confinement systems starts at the Kurchatov Institute, Moscow, led by a group of Soviet scientists led by Lev Artsimovich. Device chambers are constructed from glass, porcelain, or metal. Their largest device, TMP, uses a porcelain chamber with metal spirals. Data is collected from the first operational toroidal magnetic plasma devices.

* 1952
** On November 1, the United States conducts the Ivy Mike shot of Operation Ivy, the first detonation of a hydrogen bomb, yields 10.4 megatons of TNT out of a fusion fuel of liquid deuterium.
** Cousins and Ware build a larger toroidal pinch device in England and demonstrated that the plasma in pinch devices is inherently unstable.
* 1953
** The first Soviet fusion bomb test, RDS-6s, American codename &quot;Joe 4&quot;, demonstrated the first fission/fusion/fission &quot;layercake&quot; design, limited below the megaton range, with less than 20% of the yield coming directly from fusion. It was quickly superseded by the Teller-Ulam design. This was the first aerial drop of a fusion weapon.
** Linear pinch devices in the US and USSR report detections of neutrons, an indication of fusion reactions. Both are later explained as coming from instabilities in the fuel, and are non-fusion in nature.
** Scientists at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory construct Model A, the first operational stellarator.
* 1954
** Early planning for the large ZETA device at Harwell begins. The name is a take-off on small experimental fission reactors which often had &quot;zero energy&quot; in their name, ZEEP being an example.
** Edward Teller gives a now-famous speech on plasma stability in magnetic bottles at the Princeton Gun Club. His work suggests that most magnetic bottles are inherently unstable, outlining what is today known as the interchange instability.
* 1955
** At the first Atoms for Peace meeting in Geneva, Homi J. Bhabha predicts that fusion will be in commercial use within two decades. This prompts a number of countries to begin fusion research; Japan, France and Sweden all start programs this year or the next.
** Scientists in the Soviet Union achieve the first fusion via a purely chemical explosive-driven implosion, using spherical shock waves to compress a &lt;chem&gt;UD2T&lt;/chem&gt; target.
* 1956
** Construction of ZETA begins at Harwell.
** Igor Kurchatov gives a talk at Harwell on pinch devices, revealing for the first time that the USSR is also working on fusion. He details the problems they are seeing, mirroring those in the US and UK.
** In August, a number of articles on plasma physics appear in various Soviet journals.
** In the wake of the Kurchatov&#x27;s speech, the US and UK begin to consider releasing their own data. Eventually, they settle on a release prior to the 2nd Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in 1958.
** On May 27, the United States conducts the Zuni test of Operation Redwing with a Mk-41 bomb, the first test of a three-stage hydrogen bomb.
* 1957
** In the US, at LANL, Scylla I begins operation using the θ-pinch design.
** ZETA is completed in the summer, it will be the largest fusion machine for a decade.
** In August, initial results on ZETA appear to suggest the machine has successfully reached basic fusion temperatures. UK researchers start pressing for public release, while the US demurs.
** Scientists at the AEI Research laboratory in Harwell reported that the Sceptre III plasma column remained stable for 300 to 400 microseconds, a dramatic improvement on previous efforts. Working backward, the team calculated that the plasma had an electrical resistivity around 100 times that of copper, and was able to carry 200 kA of current for 500 microseconds in total.
* 1958
** In January, the US and UK release large amounts of data, with the ZETA team claiming fusion. Other researchers, notably Artsimovich and Spitzer, are sceptical.
** In May, a series of new tests demonstrate the measurements on ZETA were erroneous, and the claims of fusion have to be retracted.
** American, British and Soviet scientists began to share previously classified controlled fusion research as part of the Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in September. It is the largest international scientific meeting to date. It becomes clear that basic pinch concepts are not successful and that no device has yet created fusion at any level.
** Scylla demonstrates the first controlled thermonuclear fusion in any laboratory, although confirmation came too late to be announced at Geneva. This θ-pinch approach will ultimately be abandoned as calculations show it cannot scale up to produce a reactor.
** The Kurchatov Institute constructs its first toroidal device with an all-metal chamber, T-1, considered to be the first operational tokamak. 

==1960s==
* 1960
** After considering the concept for some time, John Nuckolls publishes the concept of inertial confinement fusion. The laser, introduced the same year, appears to be a suitable &quot;driver&quot;.
* 1961
** The Soviet Union test the Tsar Bomba (50 megatons), the most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever.
* 1964
** Plasma temperatures of approximately 40 million degrees Celsius and a few billion deuteron-deuteron fusion reactions per discharge were achieved at LANL with the Scylla IV device.
* 1965
** At an international meeting at the UK&#x27;s new fusion research centre in Culham, the Soviets release early results showing greatly improved performance in toroidal pinch machines. The announcement is met by scepticism, especially by the UK team who&#x27;s ZETA was largely identical. Spitzer, chairing the meeting, essentially dismisses it out of hand.
** At the same meeting, odd results from the ZETA machine are published. It will be years before the significance of these results are realized.
** By the end of the meeting, it is clear that most fusion efforts have stalled. All of the major designs, including the stellarator, pinch machines and magnetic mirrors are all losing plasma at rates that are simply too high to be useful in a reactor setting. Less-known designs like the levitron and astron are faring no better.
** The 12-beam &quot;4 pi laser&quot; using ruby as the lasing medium is developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) includes a gas-filled target chamber of about 20 centimeters in diameter.
* 1967
** Demonstration of Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor appeared to generate neutrons in a nuclear reaction.
** Hans Bethe wins the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics for his publication on how fusion powers the stars in work of 1939.
* 1968
** Robert L. Hirsch is hired by Amasa Bishop of the Atomic Energy Commission as staff physicist. Hirsch would eventually end up running the fusion program during the 1970s.
** Further results from the T-3 tokamak, similar to the toroidal pinch machine mentioned in 1965, claims temperatures to be over an order of magnitude higher than any other device. The Western scientists remain highly sceptical.
** The Soviets invite a UK team from ZETA to perform independent measurements on T-3.
* 1969
** The UK team, nicknamed &quot;The Culham Five&quot;, confirm the Soviet results early in the year. They publish their results in October&#x27;s edition of &quot;Nature&quot;. This leads to a &quot;veritable stampede&quot; of tokamak construction around the world.
** After learning of the Culham Five&#x27;s results in August, a furious debate breaks out in the US establishment over whether or not to build a tokamak. After initially pooh-poohing the concept, the Princeton group eventually decides to convert their stellarator to a tokamak.
** The Kurchatov Institute detects neutrons from deuterium plasma in their T-3A tokamak, marking the first fusion in a tokamak device.

==1970s==
* 1970
** Princeton&#x27;s conversion of the Model C stellarator to the Symmetrical Tokamak is completed, and tests match and then best the Soviet results. With an apparent solution to the magnetic bottle problem in-hand, plans begin for a larger machine to test the scaling and various methods to heat the plasma.
** Kapchinskii and Teplyakov introduce a particle accelerator for heavy ions that appear suitable as an ICF driver in place of lasers.
* 1972

** Design work on JET, the Joint European Torus, begins.
** The Kurchatov Institute begins development of T-8 and T-9, investing non-circular tokamak cross-sections such as the T-8&#x27;s D-shaped design.
* 1974
** J.B. Taylor re-visited ZETA results of 1958 and explained that the quiet-period was in fact very interesting. This led to the development of reversed field pinch, now generalised as &quot;self-organising plasmas&quot;, an ongoing line of research.
** KMS Fusion, a private-sector company, builds an ICF reactor using laser drivers. Despite limited resources and numerous business problems, KMS successfully compresses fuel in December 1973, and on 1 May 1974 successfully demonstrates the world&#x27;s first laser-induced fusion. Neutron-sensitive nuclear emulsion detectors, developed by Nobel Prize winner Robert Hofstadter, were used to provide evidence of this discovery.
** Beams using mature high-energy accelerator technology are hailed as the elusive &quot;brand-X&quot; driver capable of producing fusion implosions for commercial power. The Livingston Curve, which illustrates the improvement in power of particle accelerators over time, is modified to show the energy needed for fusion to occur. Experiments commence on the single beam LLNL Cyclops laser, testing new optical designs for future ICF lasers.
* 1975
** The Princeton Large Torus (PLT), the follow-on to the Symmetrical Tokamak, begins operation. It soon surpasses the best Soviet machines and sets several temperature records that are above what is needed for a commercial reactor. PLT continues to set records until it is decommissioned.
* 1976
** Workshop, called by the US-ERDA (now DoE) at the Claremont Hotel in Berkeley, CA for an ad-hoc two-week summer study. Fifty senior scientists from the major US ICF programs and accelerator laboratories participated, with program heads and Nobel laureates also attending. In the closing address, Dr. C. Martin Stickley, then Director of US-ERDA&#x27;s Office of Inertial Fusion, announced the conclusion was &quot;no showstoppers&quot; on the road to fusion energy. 
** The two beam Argus laser is completed at LLNL and experiments involving more advanced laser-target interactions commence.
** Based on the continued success of the PLT, the DOE selects a larger Princeton design for further development. Initially designed simply to test a commercial-sized tokamak, the DOE team instead gives them the explicit goal of running on a deuterium-tritium fuel as opposed to test fuels like hydrogen or deuterium. The project is given the name Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR).
** The Kurchatov Institute builds the TO-2, the first tokamak with a divertor, using a toroidal configuration which would soon be superseded by poloidal divertors.
* 1977
** The 20 beam Shiva laser at LLNL is completed, capable of delivering 10.2 kilojoules of infrared energy on target. At a price of $25 million and a size approaching that of a football field, the Shiva laser is the first of the &quot;megalasers&quot; at LLNL and brings the field of ICF research fully within the realm of &quot;big science&quot;.
** The JET project is given the go-ahead by the EC, choosing the UK&#x27;s center at Culham as its site.

* 1978
** As PLT continues to set new records, Princeton is given additional funding to adapt TFTR with the explicit goal of reaching breakeven.
** The Kurchatov Institute builds the T-7, the first full-scale tokamak to use superconducting coils, using an &lt;chem&gt;NbTi&lt;/chem&gt; alloy.
* 1979
** LANL successfully demonstrates the radio frequency quadrupole accelerator (RFQ).
** ANL and Hughes Research Laboratories demonstrate required ion source brightness with xenon beam at 1.5MeV. 
** The Foster Panel report to US-DoE&#x27;s Energy Research and advisory board on ICF concludes that heavy ion fusion (HIF) is the &quot;conservative approach&quot; to ICF. Listing HIF&#x27;s advantages in his report, John Foster remarked: &quot;...now that is kind of exciting.&quot; After DoE Office of Inertial Fusion completed review of programs, Director Gregory Canavan decides to accelerate the HIF effort.

<text>Market Harborough is a market town in the Harborough district of Leicestershire, England, close to the border with Northamptonshire. The population was 24,779 at the 2021 census. It is the administrative headquarters of the Harborough district. 

Market Harborough was part of Rockingham Forest, a royal hunting forest used by medieval monarchs, whose boundaries stretched from Market Harborough to Stamford and included Corby, Kettering, Desborough, Rothwell, Thrapston and Oundle. The town was at a crossroads for both road and rail, but the A6 now bypasses it to the east and the A14 to the south. Market Harborough railway station is served by East Midlands Railway services on the Midland Main Line with direct services north to , , and , and south to London St Pancras. Rail services to and ended in 1966.

The steeple of St Dionysius&#x27; Church rises directly from the street, as there is no churchyard. It was constructed in grey stone in 1300 with the church itself a later building of about 1470. Next to the church stands the Old Grammar School, a small timber building dating from 1614. The ground floor is open, creating a covered market area and there is a single room on the first floor. It has become a symbol of the town. The nearby square is largely pedestrianised and surrounded by buildings of varying styles. The upper end of the High Street is wide and contains mostly unspoilt Georgian buildings.

Market Harborough has two villages within its confines: Great Bowden lies over a hill about a mile from the town centre, and Little Bowden is less than half a mile from the town centre. The three centres have largely coalesced through ribbon development and infill, although Great Bowden continues to retain a strong village identity.

==History==

===Before 1066===
Market Harborough was founded by the Saxons between 410 and 1066. Originally a small village, believed to have been called &quot;Hæfera-beorg&quot; (Harborough), meaning &quot;oat hill&quot;.

===1066–1799===
In 1086 the Domesday Book records Bowden as a Royal Manor organised in 73 manors. The population lived in three villages, Great Bowden, Arden and Little Bowden. The Manor of Harborough is first mentioned in 1199 and 1227 when it was called &quot;Haverberg&quot;. It is likely that Harborough was formed out of the Royal Manor with the intention of making it a place for tradesmen and a market when a new highway between Oxendon and Kibworth was established to help link Northampton and Leicester. A chapel dedicated to St Dionysius was built on the route, whilst St Mary in Arden retained Parish Church status.

A market was established by 1204 and has been held on a Tuesday ever since 1221. Eventually this market led to the modern name of Market Harborough. The tradespeople of Harborough had large tofts or farmyards at the rear of their properties where goods were made and stored. Many of these yards remain but have been subdivided down their length over the years to give frontage to the High Street.

The steeple of Harborough Church was started in 1300 and completed in 1320. It is a broach spire, which rests on the walls of the tower, and are earlier than recessed spires which rise from behind a square tower as at Great Bowden. By 1382 the village of Arden had been abandoned, although the church remained in use for some years. In 1470 the main part of Harborough Church was completed. An open stream ran down the High Street. The Town Estate was created and managed by a body of Feoffees elected by the townspeople, to help manage among other things the open fields surrounding the town, the proceeds from which were used for a variety of purposes. In 1569 the town was briefly in the news as the Privy Council debated whether a local girl, Agnes Bowker, had given birth to a cat. From 1570 the Town Estate owned several properties within the town.

Harborough figured nationally in the English Civil War in June 1645, when it became the headquarters of the King&#x27;s Army. In Harborough, the King decided to confront Parliamentary forces who were camped near Naseby, but the Battle of Naseby proved a decisive victory for Parliament led by Oliver Cromwell. Harborough Chapel became a temporary prison for the captured forces. Cromwell wrote a letter from &quot;Haverbrowe, June 14, 1645&quot; to the Speaker of the House of Commons, William Lenthall, announcing the victory.

An independent church was established in the Harborough area following the Act of Uniformity 1662, and a meeting house was built in Bowden Lane in 1694.

During the 18th century the timber mud and thatch buildings of the town were largely replaced with brick buildings. After roads were turnpiked and regularly repaired (making wheeled traffic easier all year round) Harborough became a staging point for coach travel on the road to London from the northwest and the Midlands. In 1776 the Open Fields of Great Bowden were allotted to individual owners and fenced with hedges planted, followed by those of Little Bowden in 1780.

===1800–1899===
In the 19th century, the increasing level of heavy goods traffic on the turnpike roads led to complaints. A plan for a canal from Leicester to join the London to Birmingham canal was mooted but it eventually bypassed the town and a branch canal was cut from Foxton to Harborough, with wharves at Gallow Hill and Great Bowden. Harborough wharf, to the north of the town, became a distribution centre for coal and corn. A gas company was formed in 1833 to make and distribute gas. John Clarke and Sons of London built a factory for spinning worsted and later making carpets. Other industries developed were a brickworks, brewery, wheelwright/coachworks and the British Glues and Chemicals works by the Canal at Gallow Hill. In the 1830s a union of parishes around Market Harborough was formed to look after the poor and a workhouse was built in 1836 on the site of St Luke&#x27;s Hospital. In 1841 Thomas Cook who was a wood turner and cabinet maker in the town organised the first group travel by rail from Leicester to Loughborough and went on to found the travel agency bearing his name.

Market Harborough became a centre for fox hunting with hounds during the 19th century, when Mr Tailby of Skeffington Hall established a hunt in southeast Leicestershire in 1856. The country between Billesdon and Harborough was considered severe, involving jumping the specially designed ox fences. His hunting diary is recognised as an important document in the history of hunting. The Hunt was renamed the Fernie after a subsequent Master.

The Grand National Hunt Steeple Chase was held to the southwest of the town in 1860, 1861 and 1863. This race and the meeting eventually developed into the Cheltenham Festival and the organisers were part of the founding of organised steeplechasing through the Grand National Hunt Committee.

The building of the Leicester–Rugby railway in 1840 had a catastrophic effect on the coaching traffic through the town. A railway did not serve the town until 1850 with a link to Rugby, but this was quickly followed by links to Leicester and London in 1857, and to Northampton in 1859.

In 1850, William Symington, a grocer in the town established a factory to make pea-flour. His brother James developed a haberdashery and stay making business and in 1876 his sons acquired the old carpet factory to make corsets. They expanded it by three additional floors in 1881 and then built a new factory opposite Church Square in 1884 which still remains today as the Council offices, library and museum. In the 1890s the Harborough Rubber Company and Looms Wooden Heels works were established. A tannery was built on land adjoining the Commons.

In 1898, Walter Haddon opened the Caxton Works type foundry on Lathkill Street. The company later diversified into the manufacture of lead acid batteries, changing its name to Tungstone Products. The factory closed in 2002.

There was a rapid expansion in the town&#x27;s population from 4,400 in 1861 to 7,700 in 1901. This had been at the expense of living conditions, with severe overcrowding in the old town. Rows of cottages had been built in the yards of older houses with shared access to water and waste disposal. The Public Health Act 1875 required local authorities to implement building regulations, or byelaws, which insisted that each house should be self-contained, with its own sanitation and water. In 1883 a new system of sewers was laid, and piped water supplied from wells at Husbands Bosworth. Additional residential areas were developed – the New Harborough estate off Coventry Road and the Northampton Road estate between Nithsdale Avenue and Caxton Street.

===1900–1999===
In 1888 Little Bowden parish was transferred from Northamptonshire to Leicestershire and following the Local Government Act of 1894, an Urban District Council was formed for Market Harborough, covering the town and the parishes of Little and Great Bowden. Various schemes were implemented to improve the town. It acquired the gas company and built a public baths. It acquired land for the construction of Abbey Street in 1901, which removed the multi-occupied yard of the Coach and Horses Inn and enabled the building of a fire station on the new street in 1903. In the same year a new livestock market was opened between Springfield Street and the river on of land, enabling the cattle and sheep markets to be cleared from the streets. In 1905 the council bought land at Great Bowden and Little Bowden for recreation grounds.

In 1919 there were still around 150 dwellings identified as unfit for human habitation mostly in the yards and courts of Harborough and there was an identified need for 300 new houses. Land to the north of the town was selected and a scheme for 98 homes for rent developed as the Bowden Fields Estate. Following the introduction of mortgage subsidy, over 100 private homes were built and a further development of 72 rented homes took place. By 1928 about 400 houses had been built since 1918, 164 by the Council. A major improvement took place from 1930 with the acquisition of land between Northampton Road and Farndon Road. This enabled the construction of Welland Park Road (which enabled east west traffic to bypass the town centre), provision of 100 homes for rent along Welland Park Road and 52 in Walcot Road to rehouse occupants of the old yard houses, plots for private housing, the layout of Welland Park and the construction of Welland Park School.

On 23 October 1936, the town hosted the members and entourage of the Jarrow March.

A covered market hall was opened at the western end of the Cattlemarket in 1938, replacing the market stalls on the Square on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

The post-war period saw another shortage of housing and some 600 people on the waiting list for council housing. The council developed a 100-dwelling extension to the Bowden Fields Estate by 1949 and acquired of land to the southwest of the town to deal with the problem. A new Southern Estate was planned to accommodate 700 dwellings, shopping centre, school and recreation ground. The Council laid initial access roads named after personalities of the Battle of Naseby since these fields were crossed by both armies on 14 June 1645. A plaque now records the events and was unveiled by Mrs H.B. Lenthall on 1 February 1951 to mark the opening of the estate development. Around 150 dwellings were built for rent with the remaining plots available for private building. The final phase of development occurred in the 1980s.

In 1950 the canal basin was the venue for a week-long National Festival of Boats, the first such festival organised by the Inland Waterways Association and marking the beginning of the revival of the canal network for leisure use. The old brewery site was acquired for a bus station in 1951 and in 1958 a main car park was opened at the Commons and further car parks established in the 1960s to deal with the increasing demand. Proposals for development of an industrial estate at Riverside and Rockingham Road were approved in 1962 and the area developed during the 1960s.

Following serious flooding in the town centre on 2 July 1958, a flood relief scheme was begun, and the riverbed was straightened and deepened.

In 1968 the centre of Market Harborough was declared a conservation area. Major developments included the development of headquarters for Golden Wonder crisp makers, and the demolition of the old Symington factory in Adam and Eve Street for redevelopment as Eden Court shops and flats.

During the 1970s, draft proposals were made for an inner relief road to avoid traffic congestion in the town centre. However, it was rejected in favour of a bypass outside the town.

In 1980 the Symington&#x27;s factory at Church Square was redeveloped as the District Council offices, library and museum. Plans for an A6 by-pass were approved by the Department for Transport during the 1980s and the road costing £9.5m was opened in June 1992. In addition, proposals were made for a new east-west link road (A14) between the A1 and M1 and a route was identified south. It was opened in summer 1991. The opening of these roads has reduced considerably the volume of heavy goods vehicles passing through the town centre.

Associated improvements to the town centre took place as part of a &quot;By-pass Demonstration Project&quot; completed in 1994. This involved comprehensive re-paving and new street furniture to make the centre more pedestrian friendly whilst through-traffic with a speed limit.

In 1993 the former cattle market, bus station, indoor market and several properties next to the old post office and the former Peacock Hotel were re-developed to form a new pedestrianised shopping centre called St Mary&#x27;s Place. This included a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket.

===2000 onwards===

A footpath and cycleway alongside the canal to Foxton became part of the National Cycle Network Route 6. The path continues south following the Brampton Valley Way, a long and narrow recreation area on the route of the former railway line to Northampton.

The canal basin was restored as a boating centre called Union Wharf. This consists of workshops, restaurant, studios and flats. There are residential moorings and canal boats can be hired.

A cycle and footway along the river through the town was created called the Millennium Mile and links Welland Park with the railway station. In 2007 Welland Park was awarded Green Flag Award status and in 2008 a large new children&#x27;s play area was opened.

In 2016 Welland Park Academy enrolled GCSE students and Robert Smyth Academy enrolled Year 7&#x27;s.

==Geography==
Market Harborough is in a rural part of southeast Leicestershire, on the River Welland and close to the Northamptonshire border. The town is about south of Leicester via the A6, north of Northampton via the A508 and northwest of Kettering. The town is near the A14 road running from the M1/M6 motorway Catthorpe Interchange to Felixstowe. The M1 is about west via the A4304 road.

The Midland Main Line railway connects to London St Pancras. A branch of the Grand Union Canal terminates in the north part of the town and connects to the main canal near Foxton and the Foxton Locks. (see below)

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Market Harborough, at district and county level: Harborough District Council and Leicestershire County Council. The district council has its offices at the Symington Building, a former corset factory, in the town centre. The town is an unparished area and therefore has no parish council.

===Administrative history===
Market Harborough was historically a chapelry in the parish of Great Bowden. The chapelry became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1879 a local government district was created covering the three parishes of Market Harborough, Great Bowden, and Little Bowden (except the hamlet of Little Oxendon from the latter parish). When elected county councils were established in 1889, local government districts were placed entirely in one county, and so the Little Bowden area of the district was transferred from Northamptonshire to Leicestershire in 1889. Local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894.

In 1946 the urban district council was gifted a large house called Brooklands at 34 Northampton Road by the Symington family, local factory owners. The building was subsequently converted to become the council&#x27;s headquarters.

Market Harborough Urban District was abolished in 1974 to become part of the new Harborough District. No successor parish was created for the former urban district and so it became an unparished area. A new parish of Great Bowden was subsequently created from the unparished area in 1995. Harborough District Council continued to use the old urban district council&#x27;s offices at Brooklands until 1980, when it bought the old Symington&#x27;s corset factory in the town centre and converted it to become its headquarters.

===Constituency===
Market Harborough is represented as part of the Harborough parliamentary constituency, which includes surrounding rural areas, as well as the urban areas of Oadby, Wigston and South Wigston, and southern suburbs of Leicester.

==Landmarks==
===The Old Grammar School===
There is an unusual former grammar school in the town centre which stands on wooden stilts. The school room was built upon posts to allow the butter market to be held on the ground floor. The school was founded in 1607 and built in 1614, through the generosity of Robert Smyth, a poor native of the town who became Comptroller of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Court of the City of London and member of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company.

The subjects taught were Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and many boys were sent to Oxford and Cambridge universities. Amongst them were John Moore, who became Bishop of Norwich in 1691, and Bishop of Ely in 1707 and William Henry Bragg, Nobel Prize winner.

The grammar school has since moved sites and is now the Robert Smyth Academy for 11- to 18-year-olds. The school&#x27;s coat of arms represents the City of London, a Tudor Rose and the grammar school. The school is divided into houses, known as Bragg, Logan, Moseley and Hammond.

===Other landmarks===

*St Dionysius Church
*Market Harborough Town Hall
*The Old Fire Station, Abbey Street
*The Harborough Museum is in part of what was once Symington&#x27;s Corset Factory and shares the building with the council offices and library. The museum opened in 1983 and collects and displays objects and finds of local interest, including the Hallaton Treasure, the largest hoard of British Iron Age coins ever found. 
*St Mary in Arden Church. Established before the 13th century, the existing remains are part of the later 17th century church built on the same site.

===Foxton Locks===
Three miles northwest of the town is Foxton Locks – ten canal locks consisting of two &quot;staircases&quot; each of five locks, on the Leicester line of the Grand Union Canal. It is named after the nearby village of Foxton where there is one of a very few remaining road swing bridges over the canal.

===RAF Market Harborough===

Royal Air Force Station Market Harborough opened in 1943 with its main tenant being the Wellington Bombers of No. 14 Operational Training Unit of RAF Bomber Command. In addition, the station hosted No. 1683 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight from February 1944 operating Hawker Hurricanes and Curtiss Tomahawks. Flying operations ceased on the station on 18 August 1945, following which it was placed on care &amp; maintenance before being transferred to the British Army in 1948, becoming 72 Brigade Vehicle Depot. The army left the station in the late 1950s and today part of the former military site is occupied by HMP Gartree, with the rest given over to agriculture.

===Gartree Prison===

HM Prison Gartree is west of the town near Foxton and the site of a prisoner escape by helicopter in 1987. The prison caters for prisoners on life sentences.

<text>Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy (22 May 1804 – 15 June 1878) was an English archivist and antiquary, who served as Deputy Keeper of the Public Record Office from 1861 to 1878.

==Life==
Hardy was the third son of Major Thomas Bartholomew Price Hardy, from a naval family, and the older brother of William Hardy who had a parallel career as archivist. He was born on 22 May 1804 at Port Royal in Jamaica, and came to England in 1811. He entered the government service on 1 January 1819, obtaining on that date, through the influence of his uncle&#x27;s brother, Samuel Lysons, a junior clerkship in the branch Record Office at the Tower of London; it was, however, from Henry Petrie (who soon after this succeeded Lysons at the Tower) that he received his education as an archivist. On Petrie&#x27;s retirement, the compilation of the &quot;Monumenta Historica,&quot; published in 1848, was entrusted to him, and to this work he wrote the &quot;General Introduction.&quot;
While at the Tower he also edited several publications of the Record Commission: the Close Rolls from 1204 to 1227 (1833–1844); the Patent Rolls for the reign of King John, 1201 to 1216, with an historical preface and itinerary of the king (1835); the Norman Rolls, 1200–1205 and 1417–1418 (1835); the Fine Rolls of the reign of John (1835); the Charter Rolls of the reign of John, with a descriptive introduction (1837); the Liberate Rolls for the same king&#x27;s reign (1844); and the &quot;Modus Tenendi Parliamentum&quot; (1846).
His proficiency in palaeographic knowledge persuaded Lord Langdale, who was Master of the Rolls in 1838 (the date of the Public Record Office Act), to offer him the post of Deputy Keeper (i.e. chief executive officer) at the new Record Office; force of ministerial pressure, however, compelled Lord Langdale ultimately to appoint Sir Francis Palgrave to the post. Hardy succeeded Palgrave as Deputy Keeper on 15 July 1861, and held the appointment to his death. As the head of his department he did much to render the records already in the custody of the Master of the Rolls accessible to the public, and muniments of three palatinates: Durham, Lancaster, and Cheshire were brought up to London and thrown open to inspection during his tenure. The appointment of the Historical Manuscripts Commission in 1869 was also largely due to his influence, and he was one of the first commissioners.
==Honours==
Hardy was knighted in 1869.

==Personal life==
Hardy was married twice: first to Frances, daughter of Captain Charles Andrews; and second to Mary Anne, daughter of Charles MacDowell. His daughter Iza Duffus Hardy (1850–1922) was also a writer. He died on 15 June 1878.

==Publications==
After his appointment as Deputy Keeper of the Record Office in 1861 Hardy edited, for the Rolls Series, &quot;A Descriptive Catalogue of MSS relating to the History of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1862–71), the &quot;Registrum Palatinum Dunelmense&quot; (1873–1878), and a &quot;Syllabus in English of Rymer&#x27;s Foedera&quot; (1869); and he also commenced for the same series &quot;Lestorie des Engles solum Geffrei Gaimar.&quot; Besides these works he made reports on the documents preserved at Venice relating to English history, and on the collection of papers at the Bodleian Library.

Besides his work in connection with the public records, he contributed to the controversy concerning the probable date of the Athanasian Creed. He argued in favour of the antiquity and authenticity of the manuscript of the creed formerly among the Cotton manuscripts and now in Utrecht University. In 1843, he prepared, under the title of &quot;A Catalogue of the Lords Chancellors, Keepers of the Great Seal, &amp;c.,&quot; a useful list of various legal officials in successive periods of history, and in 1852 published the life of his friend and patron, Lord Langdale.

He edited the &quot;Close Rolls, Rotuli litterarum clausarum&quot;, 1204–1227 (2 vols., 1833–1844), with an introduction entitled &quot;A Description of the Close Rolls, with an Account of the early Courts of Law and Equity&quot;; and the &quot;Patent Rolls, Rotuli litterarum patentium&quot;, 1201–1216 (1835), with introduction, &quot;A Description of the Patent Rolls, to which is added an Itinerary of King John.&quot; He also edited the &quot;Rotuli de oblatis etfinibus&quot; (1835), which deal also with the time of King John; the &quot;Rotuli Normanniae&quot;, 1200–1205, and 1417–1418 (1835), containing letters and grants of the English kings concerning the duchy of Normandy; the &quot;Charter Rolls, Rotuli chartarum&quot;, 1199–1216 (1837), giving with this work an account of the structure of charters; the &quot;Liberate Rolls, Rotuli de liberate ac de misis et praestitis regnante Johanne&quot; (1844); and the &quot;Modus Tenendi Parliamentum&quot;, with a translation (1846).

He wrote &quot;A Catalogue of Lords Chancellors, Keepers of the Great Seal, Masters of the Rolls and Officers of the Court of Chancery&quot; (1843); the preface to Henry Petrie&#x27;s &quot;Monumenta historica Britannica&quot; (1848); and &quot;Descriptive Catalogue of Materials relating to the History of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (3 vols., 1862–1871).

He edited William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;De gestis regum anglorum&quot; (2 vols., 1840); he continued and corrected John Le Neve&#x27;s &quot;Fasti ecclesiae Anglicanae&quot; (3 vols., Oxford, 1854); and with Charles Trice Martin he edited and translated &quot;L&#x27;Estorie des Engles&quot; of Geoffrey Gaimar (1888–1889). He wrote &quot;Syllabus in English of Documents in Rymer&#x27;s Foedera&quot; (3 vols., 1869–1885), and gave an account of the history of the public records from 1837 to 1851 in his &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Henry, Lord Langdale&quot; (1852). Hardy took part in the controversy about the date of the Athanasian Creed, writing &quot;The Athanasian Creed in connection with the Utrecht Psalter&quot; (1872); and &quot;Further Report on the Utrecht Psalter&quot; (1874).

<text>Alexander Balloch Grosart (18 June 182716 March 1899) was a Scottish clergyman and literary editor. He is chiefly remembered for reprinting much rare Elizabethan literature, a work which he undertook because of his interest in Puritan theology.

==Life==

The son of a building contractor, he was born at Stirling and educated at the University of Edinburgh. In 1856 he became a minister of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland at Kinross, serving the congregation known as First United Presbyterian Church. In 1865 he went to Liverpool, and three years later to Blackburn.

He resigned from the ministry in 1892, and died at Dublin.

==Editorial work==

Among the first writers whose works he edited were the Puritan writers, Richard Sibbes, Thomas Brooks and Herbert Palmer. Editions of Michael Bruce&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (1865) and Richard Gilpin&#x27;s &quot;Demonologia sacra&quot; (1867) followed. In 1868 he brought out a bibliography of the writings of Richard Baxter, and from that year until 1876 he was occupied in reproducing for private subscribers the “Fuller Worthies Library,” a series of thirty-nine volumes which included the works of Thomas Fuller, Sir John Davies, Fulke Greville, Edward de Vere, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, John Donne and Sir Philip Sidney. The last four volumes of the series were devoted to the works of many little known and otherwise inaccessible authors. He also wrote a biography of the Scottish poet, Robert Fergusson (Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier, 1898)
in the “Famous Scots Series”.

His &quot;Occasional Issues of Unique and Very Rare Books&quot; (1875–1881) included among other things the &quot;Annalia Dubrensia&quot; of Robert Dover. In 1876 still another series, known as the “Chertsey Worthies Library,” was begun. It included editions of the works of Nicholas Breton, Francis Quarles, Dr Joseph Beaumont, Abraham Cowley, Henry More and John Davies of Hereford.

The two last-named series were being produced simultaneously until 1881, and no sooner had they been completed than Grosart began the “Huth Library,” so called from the bibliophile Henry Huth, who possessed the originals of many of the reprints. It included the works of Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, Gabriel Harvey, and the prose tracts of Thomas Dekker. He also edited the complete works of Edmund Spenser and Samuel Daniel. From the Townley Hall collection he reprinted several manuscripts and edited Sir John Eliot&#x27;s works, Sir Richard Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Lismore Papers&quot;, and various publications for the Chetham Society, the Camden Society and the Roxburghe Club.

<text>The lands of Sweden () are three traditional and historical regions of the country, each consisting of several provinces. The division into lands goes back to the foundation of modern Sweden, when &quot;Götaland&quot;, the land of the Geats, merged with &quot;Svealand&quot;, the land of the Swedes, to form the country, while &quot;Norrland&quot; and &quot;Österland&quot; (the latter now Finland) were added later. The lands have no administrative function but are still seen by many Swedes as an important part of their identity.

==Subdivision==
* Götaland (&quot;Gothenland&quot; or &quot;Gothia&quot;, &quot;Land of the Geats&quot;) is the southernmost, most densely populated part, consisting of ten provinces.
* Svealand (&quot;Swealand&quot;, &quot;Land of the Swedes&quot;) is the central, and smallest of the three lands, with six provinces; the administrative centre of Sweden has been situated here at least since the late Middle Ages.
* Norrland (literally &quot;Northland&quot;) is the northernmost, and largest, of the three lands, covering 60 percent of the total land area of Sweden, with nine provinces. The three northernmost provinces are often referred to as &quot;Övre (Upper) Norrland&quot;, while the rest of the provinces are referred to as &quot;Nedre (Lower) Norrland&quot;.

The lands have no administrative functions or coats of arms, but are in common use when referring to different parts of the country, including in all nationwide weather reports in Swedish media.

Areas and populations of the &quot;lands&quot;:

==Historical lands==
Sweden was historically divided into the four lands: Götaland, Svealand, Norrland and Österland. 

* Österland (literally &quot;Eastland&quot;) is an old name for southern Finland. The term has been obsolete since the 15th century and is virtually unknown in Sweden today. In most dictionaries, &quot;österlandet&quot; simply means &quot;the orient&quot;.
* Norrland was the name for the annexed lands to the north on both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia.
* In Sweden&#x27;s prehistoric times, Sweden was largely limited to Svealand and southern Norrland, while Götaland was mentioned as a rival kingdom, and stories of Swedish-Geatish wars survive in the Anglo-Saxon epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Eventually, the two countries were united under one crown, though it is a matter of debate when, as historians have claimed that it happened as early as the 6th century AD and as late as the 13th century AD. 
In the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645) Denmark-Norway ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland and Härjedalen to Sweden. These provinces are part of Norrland. In the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Denmark-Norway ceded Scania, Blekinge and Halland (Skåneland) and Bohuslän to Sweden. These provinces are since then part of Götaland.

After the Finnish War (1808–1809), the eastern part of Sweden was ceded to Russia, thus becoming the Imperial Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, with &quot;Norrland&quot; divided between these two states. The Swedish portion of Norrland still represents more than half of Sweden&#x27;s territory; it remains, however, sparsely populated compared to the south and middle.

<doc id="190884" wikidata="Q319068" url="?curid=190884" title="Khalid Sheikh Mohammed">
<text>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (sometimes also spelled Shaykh; also known by at least 50 pseudonyms; born 14 April 1965), often known by his initials KSM, is a Pakistani terrorist, mechanical engineer, and the former Head of Propaganda for the pan-Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. He is currently held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp under terrorism-related charges. He was named as &quot;the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks&quot; in the 2004 &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;.

Mohammed was a member of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Pan-Islamist terrorist organization al-Qaeda, leading al-Qaeda&#x27;s propaganda operations from around 1999 until late 2001. Mohammed was captured on 1 March 2003, in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi by a combined operation of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Immediately after his capture, Mohammed was extraordinarily rendered to secret CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, then Poland, where he was interrogated by U.S. operatives. By December 2006, he had been transferred to military custody at Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

Mohammed is widely regarded as the chief architect of the 11 September attacks. He also participated in planning the Richard Reid shoe bombing attempt to blow up an airliner; the 2002 Bali bombings in Indonesia; the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; the murder of Daniel Pearl and various foiled attacks as well as numerous other crimes. He was charged in February 2008 with war crimes and murder by a U.S. military commission at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, which could carry the death penalty if convicted. In 2012, a former military prosecutor criticized the proceedings as insupportable due to confessions gained under torture. A 2008 decision by the United States Supreme Court had also drawn into question the legality of the methods used to gain such admissions and the admissibility of such admissions as evidence in a criminal proceeding.

On 30 August 2019, a military judge set a trial date of 11 January 2021, for Mohammed&#x27;s death penalty trial. His trial was further postponed on 18 December 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mohammed&#x27;s trial restarted on 7 September 2021 but was postponed again for years of plea deal negotiations. On 31 July 2024, Mohammed agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence rather than a death-penalty trial. His plea deal was revoked by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin two days later. In November 2024, a military judge ruled that plea deal is &quot;valid and enforceable.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Mohammed was born on 14 April 1965, in Balochistan, West Pakistan or Kuwait. His father, Shaikh Muhammad Ali Dustin al-Baluchi, was a Deobandi imam in Al Ahmadi, who moved with his family from Balochistan to Kuwait in the 1950s. His mother was Halema Mohammed. Mohammed was raised in Badawiya, a neighborhood of the Fahaheel suburb of Kuwait City. Mohammed is the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted on terrorism charges for his part in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Ammar Al Baluchi, who is accused of involvement in multiple terror plots.

According to U.S. federal documents, in 1982 he had heard Abdul Rasul Sayyaf&#x27;s speech in which a call for jihad against the Soviets was declared. At age 16, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood. After graduating from high school in 1983, Mohammed travelled to the United States and enrolled in Chowan University in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. He later transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and received a Bachelor of Science (BS) in mechanical engineering in 1986.

The following year, he went to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he and his brothers, including Zahed, joined the mujahideen forces engaged in the Soviet–Afghan War. He attended the Sada training camp run by Sheikh Abdallah Azzam, and after that he worked for the magazine &quot;al-Bunyan al-Marsous&quot;, produced by Sayyaf&#x27;s rebel group, the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan. In 1992, he received a master&#x27;s degree in Islamic Culture and History through correspondence classes from Punjab University in Pakistan. By 1993, Mohammed had married and moved his family to Qatar, where he took a position as project engineer with the Qatari Ministry of Electricity and Water. He began to travel to different countries from that time onward.

The United States 9/11 Commission Report notes that, &quot;By his own account, KSM&#x27;s animus toward the United States stemmed not from his experiences there as a student, but rather from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel.&quot; However, on August 29, 2009, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported from U.S. intelligence sources that Mohammed&#x27;s time in the U.S. contributed to his radicalization.

&quot;KSM&#x27;s limited and negative experience in the United States—which included a brief jail stay because of unpaid bills—almost certainly helped propel him on his path to becoming a terrorist,&quot; according to this intelligence summary. &quot;He stated that his contact with Americans, while minimal, confirmed his view that the United States was a debauched and racist country.&quot;

===Philippines 1994–1995===
Mohammed was in the Philippines in late 1994 and early 1995; he then identified as a Saudi or a Qatari plywood exporter and used the aliases &quot;Abdul Majid&quot; and &quot;Salem Ali.&quot;

===Qatar, avoiding arrest===
In early 1996, Mohammed returned to Afghanistan to avoid capture by U.S. authorities. In his flight from Qatar, he was sheltered by Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who was the Qatari Minister of Religious Affairs in 1996.

==Alleged terrorist activities==
===Operation Bojinka===

Mohammed traveled to the Philippines in 1994 to work with his nephew Ramzi Yousef on the Bojinka plot, a Manila-based plot to destroy 12 commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The 9/11 Commission Report says that &quot;this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation.&quot;

Bojinka plans included renting or buying a Cessna, packing it with explosives and crash landing it into CIA headquarters, with a backup plan to hijack the twelfth airliner in the air and use that instead. This information was reported in detail to the U.S. at the time.

In December 1994, Yousef had engaged in a test of a bomb on Philippine Airlines Flight 434 using only about ten percent of the explosives that were to be used in each of the bombs to be planted on U.S. airliners. The test resulted in the death of a Japanese national on board a flight from the Philippines to Japan. Mohammed conspired with Yousef in the plot until it was uncovered on 6 January 1995. Yousef was captured 7 February of that same year.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was indicted on terrorism charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in January 1996 for his alleged involvement in Operation Bojinka, and was subsequently on 10 October 2001 listed as one of the FBI&#x27;s 22 Most Wanted Terrorists.

===Relationship with Osama bin Laden===
By the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country&#x27;s Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the U.S. asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there.

Bin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. Mohammed Atef, bin Laden&#x27;s chief of operations and also known at the time as Abu Hafs al-Masri, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in Tora Bora sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings in 2001. Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of al-Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.

In 1997, Mohammed moved his family from Iran to Karachi, Pakistan. That year, he tried unsuccessfully to join mujahideen leader Ibn al-Khattab in Chechnya, another area of special interest to Mohammed. Unable to travel to Chechnya, he returned to Afghanistan. He ultimately accepted bin Laden&#x27;s invitation to move to Kandahar and join al-Qaeda as a full-fledged member. Eventually, he became leader of al-Qaeda&#x27;s media committee.

===Plan for 11 September 2001 attacks===
The first hijack plan that Mohammed presented to the leadership of al-Qaeda called for several airplanes on both US east and west coasts to be hijacked and flown into targets. His plan evolved from an earlier foiled plot known as the Bojinka plot (see above). Bin Laden rejected some potential targets suggested by Mohammed, such as the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, as he wished to simplify the attacks.

In late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to proceed to organize the plot. Meetings in early 1999 took place with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and his military chief, Mohammed Atef. Bin Laden led the plot and provided financial support. He was also involved in selecting the participants, including choosing Mohamed Atta as the lead hijacker. Khalid Sheikh provided operational support, such as selecting targets and helping arrange travel for the hijackers. Atef directed the actions of the hijackers.

After Atta was chosen as the leader of the mission, &quot;he met with Bin Laden to discuss the targets: the World Trade Center, which represented the U.S. economy; the Pentagon, a symbol of the U.S. military; and the U.S. Capitol, the perceived source of U.S. policy in support of Israel. The White House was also on the list, as Bin Laden considered it a political symbol and wanted to attack it as well.&quot; If any pilot could not reach his intended target, he was to crash the plane.

According to testimony by Philip Zelikow, bin Laden was motivated by a desire to punish the US for supporting Israel and wanted to move up the attack date. Mohammed argued for ensuring the teams were prepared.

[Bin Laden] allegedly told KSM it would be sufficient simply to down the planes and not hit specific targets. KSM stood his ground, arguing that the operation would not be successful unless the pilots were fully trained and the hijacking teams were larger.

In a 2002 interview with Al Jazeera journalist Yosri Fouda, Mohammed admitted that he and Ramzi bin al-Shibh were involved in the &quot;Holy Tuesday operation&quot;. (&quot;Holy Tuesday operation&quot; was the terrorists&#x27; code name for the 9/11 attacks, and the attacks actually did take place on a Tuesday.) KSM, however, disputes this claim via his Personal Representative: &quot;I never stated to the Al Jazeera reporter that I was the head of the al-Qaeda military committee.&quot;

In an April 2002 interview with Al Jazeera correspondent Yosri Fouda, KSM, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh described the preparations for 9/11 attacks and said that they first thought of &quot;striking at a couple of nuclear facilities&quot; in the U.S. but then &quot;it was eventually decided to leave out nuclear targets for now.&quot;

===Daniel Pearl murder===

According to a CNN interview with intelligence expert Rohan Gunaratna, &quot;Daniel Pearl was going in search of the al-Qaeda network that was operational in Karachi, and it was at the instruction of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that Daniel Pearl was killed.&quot; On 12 October 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that &quot;KSM confessed under CIA interrogation that he personally committed the murder.&quot; On 15 March 2007, the Pentagon stated that Mohammed had confessed to the murder. The statement quoted Mohammed as saying, &quot;I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew, Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan. For those who would like to confirm, there are pictures of me on the Internet holding his head.&quot; This confession was gained under torture, and Mohammed listed many other crimes at the same time.

According to an investigative report published in January 2011 by Georgetown University, the Federal Bureau of Investigation used vein matching to determine that the perpetrator in the video of the killing of Pearl was most likely Mohammed, notably through identifying a &quot;bulging vein&quot; running across his hand. Concerned that the confession obtained through waterboarding would not hold up in court, federal officials used this forensic evidence to bolster their case.

==Capture, interrogation, and torture==

On 11 September 2002, members of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) claimed to have killed or captured Sheikh Mohammed during a raid in Karachi that resulted in bin al-Shibh&#x27;s capture. This claim was then subsequently proven as baseless.

Mohammed was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan (about 20 kilometres southwest of Islamabad), on 1 March 2003, by the Pakistani ISI, possibly in a joint action with the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives and officers of the American Diplomatic Security Service. He has been in U.S. custody since that time.

Initially, Mohammed was held in the CIA&#x27;s Salt Pit (&quot;Cobalt&quot;) prison in Afghanistan. After just a &quot;few minutes&quot; of questioning at &quot;Cobalt&quot;, he was subject to &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot; He was slapped, grabbed in the face, placed in stress positions, placed in standing sleep deprivation, doused with water, and subjected to rectal rehydration multiple times, without a determination of medical need.

During 2003, Mohammed was held at a secret CIA prison, or black site, in Poland, where the CIA waterboarded him at least 183 times. He was then transferred to another secret CIA prison in Romania.
In September 2006, the U.S. government announced it had moved Mohammed from a secret CIA prison (or black site) to the military custody at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

The Red Cross, Human Rights Watch and Mohammed consider that the harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, which he received from U.S. agents amount to torture. Mohammed was also subject to sleep deprivation for a period of days, during much of which he was forced to stand.

According to later reports, Mohammed initially told American interrogators he would not answer any questions until he was provided with a lawyer, which was refused. He claims to have been kept naked for more than a month during his isolation and interrogations, and said he was &quot;questioned by an unusual number of female handlers&quot;.

A CIA document reveals that Jane Harman (D-CA) and Porter Goss (R-FL) of the House Intelligence Committee were briefed on 13 July 2004, by the CIA Deputy Director for Operations James Pavitt, General Counsel Scott Muller, and CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson on the status of the interrogation process of Mohammed. By this date, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been subjected to 183 applications of waterboarding.

The document states:

A U.S. official has clarified that the &quot;183&quot; number represents the number of times water was poured onto Mohammed&#x27;s face—not the number of times the CIA waterboarded him. According to a 2007 Red Cross report, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was subjected a total of &quot;five sessions of ill-treatment.&quot;

&quot;The water was poured 183 times – there were 183 pours,&quot; the official explained, adding that &quot;each pour was a matter of seconds.&quot;

On 12 October 2004, Human Rights Watch reported that 11 suspects, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, had &quot;disappeared&quot; to a semi-secret prison in Jordan, and may have been tortured there under the direction of the CIA. At the time, Jordanian and American officials denied those allegations.

On 5 February 2008, the CIA Director Michael Hayden told a Senate committee that his agents had used waterboarding on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. A 2005 U.S. Justice Department memo released in April 2009 stated that Mohammed had undergone waterboarding 183 times in March 2003.

In October 2006, Mohammed described his mistreatment and torture in detention, including the waterboarding, to a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Mohammed said that he had provided a lot of false information, which he had supposed the interrogators wanted to hear, in order to stop the mistreatment. In the 2006 interview with the Red Cross, Mohammed claimed to have been waterboarded in five different sessions during the first month of interrogation in his third place of detention. While the Justice Department memos did not explain exactly what the numbers represented, a U.S. official with knowledge of the interrogation programs explained the 183 figure represented the number of times water was applied to the detainee&#x27;s face during the waterboarding sessions, rather than separate sessions.

In March 2007, after four years in captivity, including six months of detention and alleged torture at Guantanamo Bay, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, as it was claimed by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing in Guantanamo Bay, confessed to masterminding the 11 September attacks, the Richard Reid shoe bombing attempt to blow up an airliner over the Atlantic Ocean, the Bali nightclub bombing in Indonesia, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other various foiled attacks. &quot;I was responsible for the 9/11 operation from A to Z,&quot; Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement read Saturday during a Combatant Status Review Tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

According to the &quot;unclassified summary of evidence&quot; presented during the CSRT hearing, a computer hard drive seized during the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed contained the following:
* information about the four airplanes hijacked on 11 September 2001, including code names, airline company, flight number, target, pilot name and background information, and names of the hijackers
* photographs of 19 individuals identified as the 11 September 2001 hijackers
* a document that listed the pilot license fees for Mohamed Atta and biographies for some of the 11 September 2001 hijackers
* images of passports and an image of Mohamed Atta
* transcripts of chat sessions belonging to at least 1 of 11 September 2001 hijackers
* three letters from Osama bin Laden
* spreadsheets that describe financial assistance to families of known al-Qaeda members
* a letter to the United Arab Emirates threatening attack if their government continued to help the United States
* a document that summarized operational procedures and training requirements of an al-Qaeda cell
* a list of killed and wounded al-Qaeda militants.

At the hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said the computer belonged not to him, but to Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, arrested together with him.

In June 2008, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, citing unnamed CIA officers, claimed that Mohammed had been held in a black site or secret facility in Poland near Szymany Airport, about 100 miles north of Warsaw. There he was interrogated under waterboarding before he began to &quot;cooperate&quot;.

In 2009, Mohammed described his actions and motivations in a document publicly released and known as &quot;The Islamic Response to the Government&#x27;s Nine Accusations.&quot;

In April 2011, the British newspaper &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said it received leaked documents regarding the Guantanamo Bay interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The documents cited Mohammed as saying that, if Osama bin Laden is captured or killed by the Coalition of the Willing, an al-Qaeda sleeper cell would detonate a &quot;weapon of mass destruction&quot; in a &quot;secret location&quot; in Europe, and promised it would be &quot;a nuclear hellstorm&quot;.

===Report that interrogators abused his children===
Ali Khan, the father of Majid Khan, another one of the 14 &quot;high-value detainees,&quot; released an unsubstantiated affidavit on 16 April 2006, that reported that interrogators subjected Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s children, aged 6 and 8 years old, to abusive interrogation.

Khan&#x27;s affidavit quoted another of his sons, Mohammed Khan:

===Transfer to Guantanamo and hearing before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal===
On 6 September 2006, American President George W. Bush confirmed, for the first time, that the CIA had held &quot;high-value detainees&quot; for interrogation in secret prisons around the world. He also announced that fourteen senior captives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were being transferred from CIA custody, to military custody, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and that these fourteen captives could now expect to face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

In a 29 September 2006, speech, Bush stated:

In March 2007, Mohammed testified before a closed-door hearing in Guantanamo Bay. According to transcripts of the hearing released by the Pentagon, he said, &quot;I was responsible for the 9/11 operation, from A to Z.&quot; The transcripts also show him confessing to:

* Organizing the 1993 World Trade Center bombing
* The Bali nightclub bombings
* Richard Reid&#x27;s attempted shoe bombing
* Planning the attacks on Heathrow Airport and Big Ben clock tower in London
* Daniel Pearl&#x27;s murder in 2002
* Planned assassination attempts on Pope John Paul II, Pervez Musharraf and Bill Clinton

On 15 March 2007, BBC News reported that &quot;Transcripts of his testimony were translated from Arabic and edited by the U.S. Department of Defense to remove sensitive intelligence material before release. It appeared, from a judge&#x27;s question, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had made allegations of torture in US custody.&quot; In the Defense Department transcript, Mohammed said his statement was not made under duress but Mohammed and human rights advocates have alleged that he was tortured. CIA officials have previously told ABC News that &quot;Mohammed lasted the longest under waterboarding, two and a half minutes, before beginning to talk.&quot; Legal experts say this could taint all his statements. Forensic psychiatrist Michael Welner, M.D., an expert in false confessions, observed from the testimony transcript that his concerns about his family may have been far more influential in soliciting Mohammed&#x27;s cooperation than any earlier reported mistreatment.

One CIA official cautioned that &quot;many of Mohammed&#x27;s claims during interrogation were &#x27;white noise&#x27; designed to send the U.S. on wild goose chases or to get him through the day&#x27;s interrogation session.&quot; For example, according to Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and the top Republican on the terrorism panel of the House Intelligence Committee, he admitted responsibility for the Bali nightclub bombing, but his involvement &quot;could have been as small as arranging a safe house for travel. It could have been arranging finance.&quot; Mohammed also made the admission that he was &quot;responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center Operation,&quot; which killed six and injured more than 1,000 when a bomb was detonated in an underground garage, Mohammed did not plan the attack, but he may have supported it. Michael Welner noted that by offering legitimate information to interrogators, Mohammed had secured the leverage to provide misinformation as well.

In an article discussing the reliability of Khalid&#x27;s confession and the motive for giving misinformation under torture, Ali Soufan, a former FBI special agent with considerable experience interrogating al-Qaeda operatives, pointed out that:

His words are echoed by the U.S. Army Training Manual&#x27;s section on interrogation, which suggests that:

As an example of this the article discloses that although the George W. Bush administration made claims that the water-boarding (simulated drowning) of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed produced vital information that allowed them to break up a plot to attack the U.S. Bank Tower (formerly Library Tower and First Interstate Bank World Center) in Los Angeles in 2002, this has been proven to be untrue. In 2002 Sheikh Mohammed was busy evading capture in Pakistan. Likewise the claim by former George W Bush Attorney General Michael Mukasey and former CIA director of the National Clandestine Service, Jose Rodriguez, that the torture of Khalid Mohammed produced the most significant lead in finding Osama bin Laden, has also been shown to be false. According to U.S. Senator John McCain, &quot;The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times ... not only did the use of &#x27;enhanced interrogation techniques&#x27; on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not provide us with key leads on bin Laden&#x27;s courier, Abu Ahmed; it actually produced false and misleading information.&quot;

====List of confessions====
Mohammed has made at least 31 confessions:
* The February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City
* The 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked commercial airliners
* A failed &quot;shoe bomber&quot; operation
* The October 2002 attack in Kuwait
*The beheading of &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter Daniel Pearl
* The 2002 Bali bombings, Pady&#x27;s and Sari&#x27;s club bombings in Bali, Indonesia
* A plan for a &quot;second wave&quot; of attacks on major U.S. landmarks after the 9/11 attacks, including the Library Tower in Los Angeles, the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago, the Empire State Building in New York City, and what has been reported as the Plaza Bank Building in Seattle, although there is no Plaza Bank Building; there is a Safeco Plaza and Columbia Center, the city&#x27;s tallest skyscraper
* Plots to attack oil tankers and U.S. naval ships in the Straits of Hormuz, the Straits of Gibraltar and in Singapore
* A plan to blow up the Panama Canal
* Plans to assassinate Jimmy Carter
* A plot to blow up suspension bridges in New York City
* A plan to destroy the Sears Tower in Chicago with burning fuel trucks
* Plans to destroy London Heathrow Airport, Canary Wharf and Big Ben in London
* A planned attack on many nightclubs in Thailand
* A plot targeting the New York Stock Exchange and other U.S. financial targets
* A plan to destroy buildings in Eilat, Israel
* Plans to destroy U.S. embassies in Indonesia, Australia and Japan in 2002
* Plots to destroy Israeli embassies in India, Azerbaijan, the Philippines and Australia
* Surveying and financing an attack on an Israeli El-Al flight from Bangkok
* Sending several &quot;mujahideen&quot; into Israel to survey &quot;strategic targets&quot; with the intention of attacking them
* The November 2002 suicide bombing of a hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, and failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli passenger jet leaving Mombasa Airport 
* Plans to attack U.S. targets in South Korea
* Providing financial support for a plan to attack U.S., British and Jewish targets in Turkey
* Surveillance of U.S. nuclear power plants in order to attack them
* A plot to attack NATO&#x27;s headquarters in Europe
* Planning and surveillance in a 1995 plan (the &quot;Bojinka plot&quot;) to bomb 12 American passenger jets
* The planned assassination attempt against then-U.S. President Bill Clinton during a mid-1990s trip to the Philippines
* &quot;Shared responsibility&quot; for a plot to kill Pope John Paul II
* Plans to assassinate Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf
* An attempt to attack a U.S. oil company in Sumatra, Indonesia, &quot;owned by the Jewish former [U.S.] Secretary of State Henry Kissinger&quot;

After Mohammed arrived at Guantanamo, a team of FBI and military interrogators tried to elicit from him the same confessions that the CIA had obtained about the 9/11 plot, but by using only legal means of interrogation. By 2008, the Bush administration believed that this so-called &quot;Clean Team&quot; had compiled sufficient evidence to charge Mohammed and the others with capital murder.

The Department of Defense announced on 9 August 2007, that all fourteen of the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA&#x27;s black sites, had been officially classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only &quot;&quot;illegal&quot; enemy combatants&quot; could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

====Confession used in Sheikh Omar&#x27;s defense====
On 19 March 2007, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh&#x27;s lawyers cited Mohammed&#x27;s confession in defense of their client.

Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, also known as Sheikh Omar, was sentenced to death in a Pakistani court for the murder of Daniel Pearl. Omar&#x27;s lawyers recently announced that they planned to use Mohammed&#x27;s confession in an appeal. They had always acknowledged that Omar played a role in Pearl&#x27;s murder, but argue that Mohammed was the actual murderer.

==Prosecution in France==
In 2009, the French government decided to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed &quot;in absentia&quot; on terrorism charges with respect to the Ghriba synagogue bombing on the Tunisian island of Djerba in 2002, which killed 14 German tourists, five Tunisians and two French nationals. They intended to charge him along with the captured German national Christian Ganczarski and Tunisian Walid Nawar. French judges later decided to separate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s case from those of Ganczarski and Nawar and try him separately at a later date.

== Trial for role in 9/11 attacks ==

On 11 February 2008, the United States Department of Defense charged Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Walid Bin Attash for the 11 September 2001 attacks under the military commission system, as established under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. They have reportedly been charged with the murder of almost 3,000 people, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism and plane hijacking; as well as attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war. The charges against them list 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the 11 September events.

The charges include 2,973 individual counts of murder—one for each person killed in the 9/11 attacks. The prosecution is seeking the death penalty, which would require the unanimous agreement of the commission judges.

Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Center for Constitutional Rights, and U.S. military defense lawyers have criticised the military commissions for lacking due process for a fair trial. Critics generally argue for the trials to be held in a federal district court, with defendants treated as criminal suspects, or by court-martial as a prisoner under the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit civilian trials for prisoners of war. Mohammed could face the death penalty under any of these systems.

The case is progressing through the legal system. In August 2019 the trial date was tentatively set for 11 January 2021, by Judge W. Shane Cohen, but this date was postponed on 18 December 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mohammed&#x27;s trial restarted on 7 September 2021. On July 31, 2024, a guilty plea was reached with U.S. officials, which spared him from the death penalty in exchange for life in prison. However, the plea deal was rescinded by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin two days later.

== Legal rulings affecting him ==
In &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right of access to US federal courts to petition under &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to challenge their detentions, and that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were flawed. A revised Military Commissions Act was passed by Congress in 2009 to address court concerns.

Mohammed, in a letter submitted to the court on 26 July 2019, communicated the willingness to help the 9/11 attack victims and their families in their lawsuit against Saudi Arabia. The mastermind is said to have demanded the elimination of his death sentence in the exchange for his cooperation.

On 16 August 2023, the Pentagon and the FBI told families of the victims of the 11 September terrorist attacks that none of the alleged organizers of the attacks would face the death penalty as part of ongoing plea agreement considerations.

== Release of new images ==
On 9 September 2009, photographs of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ammar al Baluchi were published on the Internet and widely in US and international media. Camp authorities have strict controls over the taking and distribution of images of the Guantanamo captives. Journalists and VIPs visiting Guantanamo are not allowed to take any pictures that show the captives&#x27; faces. Journalists may see &quot;high value&quot; captives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed only when they are in the court room, where cameras are not allowed. But, on 9 September 2009, independent counter-terrorism researchers found new images of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his nephew Ammar al Baluchi on &quot;jihadist websites&quot;. According to Carol Rosenberg, writing in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;: &quot;The pictures were taken in July, said International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Bernard Barrett, under an agreement with prison camp staff that lets Red Cross delegates photograph detainees and send photos to family members.&quot;

In November 2014, a Turkish manufacturer of over-the-counter hair removal cream was found to be using an image of a disheveled Mohammed in adverts for their product.

==Manifesto==
In January 2014, a 36-page &quot;nonviolence manifesto&quot; written by KSM was declassified and released by the US government. The title is &quot;Khalid Sheikh Mohammad&#x27;s Statement to the Crusaders of the Military Commissions in Guantanamo.&quot; The document outlines 3 parts, but appears to be just the first section, describing &quot;the path to happiness.&quot; The subject writes to his captors and appears interested in converting his wider audience to Islam. The notes contain eight books with three Western authors and penciled initials with the date 31 October 2013.

==Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Sulaiman Abu Ghaith==
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has participated as a witness in the trials of two alleged al-Qaeda members, Zacarias Moussaoui and Salim Hamdan. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Richard Serrano wrote:

&quot;In 2006, his interrogation summaries were read aloud in the capital murder trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, and Moussaoui was spared the death penalty. Two years later, different Mohammed statements were read in a military commission trial, or tribunal, that led to the release from Guantanamo Bay of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s chauffeur, Salim Hamdan.&quot;

Stanley Cohen, an attorney for Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, requested to interview Mohammed, who they described as &quot;the most qualified person alive&quot; to assist in Abu Gaith&#x27;s defense. Mohammed, through his attorney David Nevin, agreed to be interviewed, but only &quot;in the absence of government personnel whether physically present or by listening or recording remotely.&quot;

Mohammed instead drafted a 14-page statement response to 451 interrogatories submitted by Cohen. In the response, Mohammed called Abu Ghaith, a &quot;pious man&quot; and &quot;spellbinding speaker&quot; who, to the best of his knowledge, did not play any military role in al-Qaeda operations and had no military training. Mohammed argued that Western foreign policy has been hypocritical in that it allowed for the rise of the Mujahideen in the Soviet War, but that Western media has since branded the Mujahideen &quot;terrorists&quot; or &quot;foreign fighters&quot;. He further claimed that the Taliban&#x27;s strict Islamic rule had restored security to Afghanistan in the 1990s. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled that neither Mohammed&#x27;s statement nor testimony were relevant to Abu Ghaith&#x27;s trial, and thus inadmissible.

== Personal life ==
Mohammed is fluent in Balochi, Urdu, Arabic, and English. He has two sons, aged seven and nine at the time of his arrest in 2002.
