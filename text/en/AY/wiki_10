<doc id="187967" wikidata="Q554810" url="?curid=187967" title="Takashi Nagatsuka">
<text>was a Japanese poet and novelist. According to prominent historian Ann Waswo, Nagatsuka Takashi was born into a landowning family.

Generally, he was born in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. More specifically, his place of birth was 国生村 (Kosshō Village) in 石下町 (Ishige Town), which was merged in 2006 with 水海道市 (Mitsukaido City) to form modern day 常総市 (Joso City).

In 1896, poor health forced him to stop his middle-school education in Mito. In accordance with his duties as eldest son, he assisted his mother Taka in managing their six acres of arable land. He started experimenting in 1905 with different fertilizers, crop-rotation, charcoal-production, and commercial-grade bamboo-production. These are just some of his attempts to save the family&#x27;s finances from the political career of his father Genjiro (who was elected during the late 1880s to the prefectural assembly), since he tended to absorb other people&#x27;s debts.

In Tokyo, he studied poetry with Masaoka Shiki starting 1900 until 1902, the same year Shiki died of tuberculosis.

His only novel &quot;土&quot; (&quot;&quot;Tsuchi&quot;; &quot;The Soil&quot;&quot;) was published in 151-installment series from June–November of1910 in the 東京朝日新聞 (&quot;Tokyo Asahi Shimbun&quot;; &quot;Tokyo Morning-Sun Newspaper&quot;), which eventually became today&#x27;s 朝日新聞 (&quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; ; &quot;Morning-Sun Newspaper&quot;) after a merger with the 大阪朝日新聞 (&quot;Osaka Asahi Shimbun&quot;; &quot;Osaka Morning-Sun Newspaper&quot;). Two years after its newspaper serialization, &quot;土&quot; was published as a complete work in book form in 1912. The novel depicts life in rural Japan and in Kossho Village. The characters are based on actual people although their names are altered. The novel&#x27;s copyright expired in the mid-1960s.

He died of laryngeal tuberculosis on February 8, 1915.

<doc id="187968" wikidata="Q473538" url="?curid=187968" title="Atsushi Nakajima">
<text>was a Japanese author known for his unique style and self-introspective themes. His major works include &quot;The Moon Over the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Light, Wind and Dreams&quot; with the former being published in many Japanese textbooks.

During his life he wrote about 20 works, including unfinished works, typically inspired by Classical Chinese stories and his own life experiences.

== Early life ==
Atsushi Nakajima was born in Yotsuya ward, Tokyo on 5 May 1909, into a family of Confucian scholars with his father, grandfather and three uncles being scholars themselves. Nakajima&#x27;s childhood was filled with turbulent times with his parents divorcing two years into their marriage and less than one year since Nakajima was born. The infant Nakajima was then sent to Saitama Prefecture to be raised by his grandparents. Unfortunately, one year after he was sent to his grandparents, his grandfather died.

In February 1914, he was sent to his father who at this point had remarried. His father worked a teaching job and often transferred to many different locations. In 1918 he moved to Seoul and later on in 1920 he also moved to Manchuria for his father&#x27;s teaching job. Because of this teaching job, the young Nakajima often transferred schools which led to a feeling of isolation. Despite his frequent transfers however, Nakajima was known for being an intelligent student who consistently received good grades.

His family life was equally rough as he was not very close to his father and his stepmother abused him. He also remained as an only child until 1914, where his step-mother gave birth to his half-sister, unfortunately his step-mother died during childbirth. His father then married for the third time in 1924 but his new stepmother was also abusive. Through his childhood, Nakajima had poor health. He developed asthma at the age of 17 which continued for the rest of his life.

Despite his family&#x27;s deep roots in Chinese studies and Nakajima&#x27;s knowledge on the topic, he decided to enroll into the University of Tokyo where he studied Japanese literature. He wrote his graduation thesis on the topic of Aestheticism. The thesis, titled &quot;The Study of Aestheticism&quot; traces the influences of modern Japanese literature to Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde and Charles Baudelaire. The thesis then also proceeds to analyze the works of Tanizaki Jun&#x27;ichirō, Mori Ōgai, Ueda Bin and Nagai Kafū. After graduating, he married Taka Hashimoto. The couple had three children: Takeshi, Masako (died three days after birth), and Kaku.

== Literary career ==
His literary career started very early into his life. After graduating from his school in Seoul, he joined the Tokyo First Higher School&#x27;s (第一高等学校) literary program where he began writing fiction. In 1927 he began publishing in the school&#x27;s literary magazine and by 1929 he became a member of the editorial staff. During this period he began showing his signature style of setting his stories in exotic locations such as China or Korea along with recurring themes of self-doubt, questions on the meaning of life, isolation, fate and the nature of human existence. Some of his later works also display a sense of irony and satire.
Despite his skills as an author, Nakajima barely published any of his works to literary magazines due to him having high literary standards and Nakajima lacking the confidence to publish in these journals.

=== The Moon Over the Mountain ===
One of Nakajima&#x27;s most well-known literary works is sometimes also known as . The story is derived from a story from the Tang dynasty period. The story was first published in the February 1942 issue of &quot;Bungakukai&quot;.

&quot;The Moon Over the Mountain&quot; tells the story of Yuan Can who recently had heard about a man-eating tiger roaming around his area. One day he encountered the tiger and the tiger started speaking to him. Yuan Can discovered that the tiger was his friend named Li Zheng (李徴), Li Zheng was smart and could qualify as a government official but his true ambition was to be a poet. Unfortunately, he failed and started working as a government official. While traveling for official business one day, Li Zheng claims that he went insane and transformed into a tiger. Li Zheng claims that this was because of the &quot;cowardly pride&quot; and &quot;arrogant shame&quot; he harbored within him which caused him to transform into the tiger. Li Zheng laments that as a tiger he could no longer become a famous poet, the two then parted ways.

== Teaching job ==
In 1933, he accepted a teaching position at Yokohama Girls&#x27; Higher School. During his time in the School, Nakajima was exposed to more of western literature, such as the works of Blaise Pascal, Anatole France and Robert Louis Stevenson. During this time he translated works by D. H. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley and Franz Kafka into Japanese, while continuing to write fiction.

== Micronesia and Palau ==
In 1941, he resigned from his teaching job and joined the Japanese government working as an editor for a Japanese language textbook set to be published in Palau. He believed that the warmer climate in Palau would cure his asthma. Nakajima&#x27;s choice to visit the southern seas may have been influenced by Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Vailima Letters&quot;, which described Stevenson&#x27;s stay in Samoa. After some time in Palau, he took a boat to Micronesia on 15 September 1941 for the purpose of inspecting the schools in the region. He returned to Palau in 5 November 1941. During this part of his life, Nakajima kept a diary and recorded topics such as the native culture and practices.

In letters he wrote, Nakajima disagrees with the Japanese exploitation of the island natives. He wished that he could do more for the people of Palau and Micronesia other than teaching them. He wrote that he had not experienced any asthma attacks, but instead felt lethargic due to the tropical heat. The food in Micronesia supplied by the Japanese were also lacking. Because of this, he wished to quit his job as soon as possible. By the end of 1941, Nakajima had requested a transfer and returned to Japan in March 1942.

== Final years ==
In 1942, Nakajima contracted pneumonia after returning from Palau. While bedridden for two months, he published &quot;Light, Wind and Dreams,&quot; a fictionalized biography of Robert Louis Stevenson. The story was critically acclaimed, even becoming a finalist for the Akutagawa Prize.

At this point he resigned from his job at the South Seas Agency and fully devoted himself to being a writer. However, this did not last long. His health greatly declined due to the asthma medication he had taken. He was immediately hospitalized. When he was hospitalized, no one expected him to die. His father, expecting his stay to be short, did not visit him in the hospital. After a night of asthma attacks, Nakajima died on the morning of 4 December 1942.

== In popular culture ==
A character based on Atsushi Nakajima is featured in the manga series &quot;Bungo Stray Dogs&quot;, where major literary figures from Japan and across the world are presented as teenagers and young adults. In the series, Nakajima works for the Armed Detective Agency and has a supernatural ability named after his short story &quot;The Moon Over the Mountain&quot; which allows him to transform into a tiger. 

Nakajima also appears in the online game &quot;Bungo and Alchemist&quot;, an online collectible card game with characters based on literary figures.

<doc id="187969" wikidata="Q1343550" url="?curid=187969" title="Mokutaro Kinoshita">
<text>was the pen-name of a Japanese author, dramaturge, poet, art historian and literary critic, as well as a licensed doctor specializing in dermatology during Taishō and early Shōwa period Japan. His other pen names included Horikason (堀花村), Chikaisshakusei (地下一尺生), Sounan (葱南) and others. As professor of dermatology and a noted leprosy researcher, he served at four universities (South Manchuria Medical College, Aichi Medical College, Tohoku Imperial University, Tokyo Imperial University).

==Biography==
Kinoshita was born in what is now part of Itō, Shizuoka as . He moved to Tokyo at the age of 13 to pursue studies in German, during which time he was exposed to German literature and history. In 1906 entered the Medical School of Tokyo Imperial University to pursue a medical career and to translate literary works and to cultivate contacts in the literary world. In 1907, he met Tekkan Yosano and was invited to become a member of the &quot;Myōjō&quot; literary circle, to which he contributed translations and original works. In 1908 he was one of the founding members of the literary circle, through which he became acquainted with Kafū Nagai, Rokuzan Ogiwara, Kaoru Osanai, Kōtarō Takamura, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Bin Ueda and other noted figures in the Japanese literary and artistic world. In 1909, he assisted Takuboku Ishikawa in the production of the literary magazine &quot;Subaru&quot;.

Bin Ueda introduced Kinoshita to Mori Ōgai, who suggested that he should concentrate on literature, as his reputation was becoming widespread, but that if he should continue to pursue medicine, he should specialize in dermatology. Kinoshita chose both and studied under the respected Keizo Dohi, the first professor of dermatology at Tokyo Imperial University, where he became interested in research on leprosy. He used the pen-name of Kinoshita for writing and his real name of Ota for his medical career. One of his main topics of interest was the history of Japanese Christianity in the 16th century. He wrote a play titled &quot;&quot; which depicted the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; in feudal Japan.

In 1916, at age 31, he was named professor of dermatology at South Manchuria Medical University and earned his Ph.D. based on the culture of &quot;Malassetia furfur&quot;. In 1920 he left Tokyo Imperial University to study mycology at the Sorbonne and Hôpital Saint-Louis and at the University of Lyon in France. He remained in France until 1924 and became fluent in French. He became known for the “Classification of Ota and Langeron”, based on morphology. His observations were very exact and, according to Hideyo Yamaguchi, this classification closely resembled the classification based on genes. In 1924, he was named Professor of Dermatology at Aichi Medical University. In 1926, he went to Tohoku Imperial University.

He attended an international leprosy meeting in Bangkok which revived his interest in the condition. Knowing that Kensuke Mitsuda had studied and described the “Mitsuda reaction” (&quot;Lepromin reaction&quot;), he lobbied for the publication of an international journal. Finally Hayashi Fumio wrote the first article on the Mitsuda reaction in its first issue. He opposed the prevalent practice in Japan of segregating leprosy patients into sanatoriums. In 1937, he returned to Tokyo Imperial University. His interest in leprosy increased and he performed experimental works intended for the inoculation of leprosy which failed. In 1938 he first presented the case which was later named Nevus of Ota in 1939. The Nevus of Ota is a birthmark, mostly seen in Mongoloid people. In 1941, he was awarded the Legion of Honour from the Vichy French government for his work on leprosy in French Indochina. In 1944, he participated in medical conferences held in Shanghai and Nanjing.

In October 1945, he died of gastric cancer. His grave is in Tama Cemetery. The house where he was born is preserved as the Kinoshita Mokutaro Memorial House.

<doc id="187970" wikidata="Q1989968" url="?curid=187970" title="Nankichi Niimi">
<text>was a Japanese author, sometimes known as the Hans Christian Andersen of Japan.

Niimi was born in Yanabe, in the city of Handa, Aichi prefecture, on July 30, 1913. He lost his mother when he was four years old. His literary skill was noticeable at an early age. During his elementary school graduation ceremony, he presented a haiku that impressed most people at the ceremony.

:&quot;The Dandelion&quot;
:&quot;So Many Days Trampled&quot;
:&quot;Today’s Flower&quot;

At age 18, Niimi moved to Tokyo to enter the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. He fell sick with tuberculosis while in Tokyo shortly after graduating, and returned to his hometown. He worked there, first as an elementary school teacher, then as a women&#x27;s high school teacher. He died at age 29.

Although not prolific, he shows great talent in all of his writings. His works are known for their accuracy and lively depictions of humans. He is also often compared to Kenji Miyazawa. There is a &quot;Niimi Nankichi Memorial Museum&quot; in his birthplace, Handa.

<text>James Martin Hannett (31 May 1948 – 18 April 1991) was an English record producer, musician and an original partner/director at Tony Wilson&#x27;s Factory Records. Hannett produced music by artists including Joy Division, the Durutti Column, A Certain Ratio, Magazine, John Cooper Clarke, New Order, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and Happy Mondays. His distinctive production style embraced atmospheric sounds and electronics.

==Early life==
Born in Manchester, England, Hannett grew up in a working class, Catholic family in Miles Platting, Manchester; he attended Corpus Christi school and Xaverian College in Rusholme. In 1967, he went to the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), where he earned a degree in chemistry but chose not to pursue the profession.

==Career==
Hannett&#x27;s uncle was a bass player and gave his nephew a bass guitar when he was 14. Hannett played bass with Spider Mike King and as a member in a band called Paradox, in 1973, alongside Paul Young, later of Sad Café and Mike + The Mechanics.

Hannett&#x27;s production work began with the soundtrack for the animated film &quot;All Kinds of Heroes&quot;, written by future collaborator Steve Hopkins. By this time, he also began to mix live sound at pub gigs. Other early production works included Greasy Bear, Belt &amp; Braces Road Show Band&#x27;s eponymous album in 1975 and five songs from Pete Farrow&#x27;s repertoire recorded at Pennine Studios, Oldham, later included on the compilation album &quot;Who Says There&#x27;s No Beach in Stockport&quot;. Hannett attracted more musical attention in 1977, when, as Martin Zero, he produced the first independent punk record, Buzzcocks&#x27; &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot; EP. Under the same moniker he produced early records by punk poet John Cooper Clarke, whose Salford monotone was complemented by drum machines, simple synthesiser motifs and Hannett&#x27;s bass playing. Jilted John&#x27;s eponymous debut single was Hannett&#x27;s first hit single as a producer.

Soon after, Hannett became closely associated with Joy Division. His production of their albums and singles incorporated looping technology to treat musical notes with an array of filters, echoes and delays. Hannett had a collection of BBD echo devices which he called his &quot;bluetop echo and delay boxes&quot;. The Cargo Recording Studios in Rochdale were used for the recording of the Joy Division songs &quot;Digital&quot;, &quot;Glass&quot;, &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, &quot;Dead Souls&quot; and &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Hannett&#x27;s unorthodox production methods resulted in drum sounds mixed with synthesisers that were complex and highly distinctive. According to Hannett: &quot;There was a lot of space in [Joy Division&#x27;s] sound. They were a gift to a producer, because they didn&#x27;t have a clue. They didn&#x27;t argue. &quot;A Factory Sample&quot; was the first thing I did with them. I think I&#x27;d had the new AMS delay line for about two weeks. It was called &#x27;Digital&#x27;. It was heaven sent.&quot; He went on to produce all of Joy Division&#x27;s studio recorded output, including their two albums &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; and single &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;, which became a hit following the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis.

Hannett produced U2&#x27;s first international single, &quot;11 O&#x27;Clock Tick Tock&quot;, which was released in May 1980. He was set to produce their debut album, &quot;Boy&quot;, but after the suicide of Curtis, Hannett was too distraught to work and backed out. A rift developed with Factory, leading Hannett to sue the label in 1982 over various financial matters. The dispute was eventually settled out of court, and the lawsuit is listed as part of the Factory Records catalogue as FAC61. When Hannett returned to produce Happy Mondays he worked as a freelance producer, and was not reinstated as a Factory director.

==Personal life and death==
After leaving Factory, Hannett&#x27;s career declined due to his heavy use of alcohol and drugs, especially heroin. He later married his new partner Wendy. Hannett died on 18 April 1991 at the age of 42 in Manchester, as a result of heart failure. He was survived by his wife, son and stepdaughter. His headstone at Southern Cemetery, Manchester pays him tribute as being the creator of &quot;The Manchester Sound&quot;.

==Legacy==
Several weeks after his death, Factory Records released the compilation album &quot;Martin: The Work of Martin Hannett&quot; (FACT325) as a tribute, collecting his work as a producer. In 2007, Colin Sharp published &quot;Who Killed Martin Hannett?&quot;, a memoir based on interviews with Hannett&#x27;s friends and collaborators. Sharp had previously been a member of The Durutti Column and was friends with Hannett during his time in the Manchester scene.

Hannett was portrayed by Andy Serkis in the 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, a fictionalised depiction of Tony Wilson&#x27;s career as the co-founder of Factory Records and The Haçienda nightclub. In the DVD commentary for the film, Wilson notes a review that described Hannett as Serkis&#x27; &quot;strangest role&quot; and points out that the actor is best known for his portrayal of Gollum in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Wilson concludes that the reviewer&#x27;s implication is correct, that indeed, Hannett was far stranger than the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; character. Hannett was portrayed by Ben Naylor in Anton Corbijn&#x27;s film 2007 &quot;Control&quot;, a biopic of Ian Curtis.

A film documentary about Hannett&#x27;s life was released on DVD on the 23rd anniversary of his death on 10 April 2014. A book was released on the same day, &quot;Martin Hannett – Pleasures of the Unknown&quot; by Chris Hewitt. Another book by Hewitt, &quot;Martin Hannett, His Equipment and Strawberry Studios&quot;, was published on 26 January 2016 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Strawberry Recording Studios, where Hannett recorded with Joy Division.

<text>Geoffrey Leonard Cheshire, Baron Cheshire, (7 September 1917 – 31 July 1992) was a British Royal Air Force pilot, officer and philanthropist.

Cheshire fought in the Second World War. Among the decorations Cheshire received as a pilot was the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the youngest group captain in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and one of the most highly decorated pilots of the war.

After the war he founded a nursing home that grew into the charity Leonard Cheshire Disability. He became known for his work in conflict resolution. In 1991 he was created a life peer in recognition of his charitable work. He is under consideration for beatification in the Roman Catholic Church.

==Early life==

Geoffrey Leonard Cheshire, known as Leonard, was the son of Geoffrey Chevalier Cheshire, a barrister, academic and influential writer on English law. His mother Primrose Barstow was from a Scottish Army family and named Leonard after her brother, who died fighting in Kūt in early 1917. Leonard had one younger brother, Christopher Cheshire, also a wartime bomber pilot. Cheshire was born in Hoole, Chester, where his paternal grandparents lived, but was brought up at his parents&#x27; home near Oxford. Cheshire was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, Stowe School where he was head of Chatham House, and Merton College, Oxford. 

At Stowe he was taught English by the writer T. H. White, but he was adamant in later years that he never flew with him. At school, Leonard excelled at lawn tennis, becoming Captain and showed an aptitude for languages and an interest in reading and natural history. At the end of his final Easter term 1936, his father arranged for him a stay in Germany with the family of Ludwig von Reuter in Potsdam and while there, witnessed an Adolf Hitler rally. Cheshire caused considerable offence by pointedly refusing to give the Nazi salute. Most of his time was spent with von Reuter&#x27;s three sons, cycling, swimming and visiting Berlin and other cities. An early love of motorcar racing was fostered by trips to the Nürburgring and he entered a local tennis tournament, which he nearly won.

He entered Merton College at the University of Oxford in 1936 and joined Oxford University Air Squadron the following month. His closest university friends were Jack Randle and Peter Higgs who both followed him into war; Jack was awarded the VC posthumously in 1944 for bravery in the battle of Kohima and Peter was the first RAF fighter pilot to be lost in combat during the Battle of Britain.

At university he became a typical student of the time, taking part in pranks and displaying a knack for getting himself in the newspapers, or &quot;creating a sensation&quot; as Leonard called it. On one occasion at Oxford he was bet half a pint of beer with landlord of the Chequers pub Jig Holloway, that he could not walk to Paris with no more than a few pennies in his pocket; he won his bet - getting to Paris on foot by doing odd jobs and hitchhiking, eventually giving a press conference on arrival and earning enough money to travel back in first class. A local newspaper headline &quot;Undergraduate Astonished that His Car Could Do 40 m.p.h.&quot; was the result of a speeding charge earned in Peter Higgs&#x27; car, which in mitigation Cheshire had said was over 2 years old and never known to go above 30. Leonard later said his aims at Oxford were to &quot;drive a Bentley, dress in a Savile Row suit, in short to make pots of money without too many scruples how&quot; yet he had no clear idea how to make money, apart from cultivating celebrity. Fred Astaire was an inspiration; Leonard even took tap dancing lessons in the hope of emulating him and modelled his hair and habit of using a cigarette holder on The Saint. As a young man, his friends later described him as having a personality of many layers, self-sufficient yet full of nervous energy.

Academically he was thought intelligent but not wildly keen on his subject, jurisprudence. His tutor F. H. Lawson said he &quot;kept up quite well ... He wasn&#x27;t the pure intellectual type. I was always satisfied with his work because he was &#x27;a trier&#x27; - without breaking his neck&quot;. During his university years, Cheshire was required to participate in one of the service clubs. He chose the cavalry, but soon found the early hours and physical demands were not to his liking, and he transferred to the Oxford University Air Squadron because it involved sitting down. There he learned his basic piloting skills. Cheshire graduated in 1939 with a second-class degree.

==Military career==
===Early training===
On 16 November 1937 he received his commission as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He joined as a way to get out of his university finals, but his father soon put his foot down and insisted he sit them, then apply for a permanent commission under the RAF&#x27;s direct entry scheme. On 7 October 1939 Cheshire received his permanent commission with the RAF. In selecting his preference Cheshire listed 1) Fighter Command 2) Light Bomber Force and 3) Army Cooperation force. To his disappointment, he was assigned to Bomber Command, and sent for training at RAF Hullavington, and then to RAF Abingdon. It was here that his career in the RAF was nearly ended before it even got started. Cheshire made a loud joking remark at a pub about German troops having arrived in England, which was reported. He was called in to the station commander, and was nearly sent to the infantry, but he apologised and was kept in.

===102 Squadron===

On 7 April 1940 Cheshire was promoted to flying officer and in June he was posted to 102 Squadron, flying the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. 102 Squadron was in 4 Group of Bomber Command, and shared the airfield at RAF Driffield with 77 Squadron. Cheshire remarked that upon arriving at Driffield he was filled with a fear that he would not measure up to what was expected of him, but soon found himself buoyed with the sense of being part of a tradition. He became good friends with a number of pilots there, including Hugh &quot;Lofty&quot; Long and Jimmy Marks.

As a new pilot at Driffield, Cheshire was placed under the tutelage of Long. Cheshire found Long both demanding and encouraging. From the outset Long tested Cheshire on every aspect of the aircraft. He expected Cheshire to know the aircraft inside and out. His goal was to make flying the aircraft so second nature, that when the point of critical action arrived all of Cheshire&#x27;s attention could be focused on the problem, as none of his concentration would be diverted by the task of flying. Long made Cheshire spend every spare minute he had learning the machine. &quot;Lofty kept drumming into my head the fundamental lesson of never thinking that you have mastered your job, of applying your whole heart and mind to the task of perfecting as far as is humanly possible the techniques of operational flying. He made me practice and re-practice, study and re-study, experiment and re-experiment. I had to sit in the cockpit blindfold and go through the different drills, sit in the rear turret, in the navigator&#x27;s and the wireless operator&#x27;s seat, and try and see life from their point of view.&quot;

Long knew every man supporting the aircraft, both in his flight crew and his ground crew, and the concerns and hardships each man faced. Long took Cheshire along when he spoke to his men, and impressed upon him the importance of the commander being aware of their concerns. Cheshire credited him for making him a good captain. Thinking back upon those days, Cheshire noted &quot;I do not think there could have been a single piece of equipment or a single aspect of flying on which he failed to question me... There was the ground crew also, to each of whom Lofty introduced me individually, talking of their problems, and the background from which they came and explaining the importance of building up a personal relationship with them.&quot;

Cheshire&#x27;s first ten missions were flown as second pilot to Long. On those early missions Long placed Cheshire in the pilot&#x27;s seat early and often, giving Cheshire invaluable experience of flying through flak over a target. By June Cheshire was commanding his own aircraft.

====Distinguished Service Order (DSO) mission====

In the spring of 1940 Bomber Command began its campaign against German industry. On the night of 12/13 November 1940, Cheshire was briefed to attack the synthetic oil plant at Wesseling, near Cologne. While en route Cheshire found the target was obscured by bad weather, so decided to attack the railway yards at Cologne instead. Initially in his bombing run there was little flak, but suddenly two anti-aircraft rounds exploded near the aircraft. The two anti-aircraft shells had exploded almost simultaneously near the plane, one right above the cockpit, and the other just under the port wing. The flash from the first blinded Cheshire, and the second rent a huge tear in the fuselage, igniting one of the aircraft&#x27;s flares. The aircraft was falling in a steep dive. Cheshire regained his senses and realised both engines were still working, and pulled the aircraft out at about 5,000 feet. The crew were able to extinguish the fire, though they had to take precautions not to fall out. By the time they did they realised they were flying deeper into Germany. Realizing he still had a functioning aircraft with a bomb load, Cheshire brought the aircraft around and returned to make another bomb run on the target. Arriving over Cologne he now was the sole bomber over the target and faced the concentrated flak of the city&#x27;s defenders. Nevertheless, he made it to the marshalling yard, dropped his bomb load and managed to get the aircraft and crew safely back to base at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire. For bombing the yard in a badly damaged aircraft and still managing to get it back to England he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

Completing his first tour of operations in January 1941, Cheshire immediately volunteered for a second tour.

===35 Squadron===

Cheshire was posted to 35 Squadron in January 1941, where he joined Jimmy Marks, &quot;Willie&quot; Tait and George Holden. The squadron was converting to the new four-engine heavy bomber, the Handley Page Halifax. His time in 35 Squadron included seven raids on Berlin. Cheshire was promoted to acting squadron leader on 1 March 1941, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) later that same month. Losses among Bomber Command continued. Four months after Cheshire completed his DSO mission, &quot;Lofty&quot; Long was killed during a mission on 13 March 1941. It was another close personal loss for Cheshire. &quot;Whatever outward face I may have put on it, his loss affected me very deeply, and the memory of what I owed him and of all that he stood for remained with me throughout the war.&quot;

On 7 April 1941 he was promoted to flight lieutenant, and became commander of a flight.

====Trip to North America====
At the start of May, 35 Squadron&#x27;s Halifaxes were stood down to undergo modifications to address design flaws. Cheshire obtained a posting to the Atlantic Ferry Organisation to fly a Liberator across the Atlantic. On 4 May 1941 Cheshire reported aboard a Norwegian steamer to begin his trip across the Atlantic. The convoy was not intercepted by the German capital ships, but did suffer multiple attacks from German U-boats, and a number of ships were lost. Cheshire came through unscathed.

Cheshire finally arrived in Canada to find the authorities there did not know who he was or what he was there for. He had expected to fly a Liberator or Canadian-built Halifax back to England but he was not allowed to, as he did not have experience in navigation. He and his companion RAF officer decided to take a short trip to New York while things were sorted out. While there he met former stage actress Constance Binney, who was twenty years older. In three weeks the two were married. Jimmy Marks was to witness the wedding, but was required to take an aircraft back to England before the wedding, so Cheshire and his bride had to use strangers as their witnesses. After a three-week wait he was finally allowed to shuttle a Hudson back to England. When he returned he was met by a single crewman, and learned that all the others from his Whitley had been lost on missions over Germany. It was a hard blow to Cheshire.

After his return, Cheshire resumed flying the Halifax in missions over Germany. He completed his second tour early in 1942. By the end of his time at 35 Squadron Cheshire had completed 50 sorties.

===Flight instructor===
After completing his tour at 35 Squadron, Cheshire was posted to a Heavy Conversion Unit (HCU) at RAF Marston Moor. Though in a training unit, he still flew operations when the training units were called upon to join the main force for maximum effort missions. The new commander in chief of Bomber Command, Arthur Harris, had taken over in February 1942. He was a firm believer that bombing German production was a war-winning strategy. The bombing campaign thus far had not been effective, and Harris was trying to hold his force together against competing interests from the other services who had designs on his aeroplanes. At the time he assumed command the bomber force was limited to about 400 aircraft, most of these being two-engine Whitleys and Wellingtons. To demonstrate what could be accomplished, he planned to conduct several thousand-plane raids. The first of these was against Cologne on the night of 30/31 May 1942. Scraping together every aircraft he could, including the training units, he was able to get a thousand aircraft in the air. Cheshire was a part of the force. He twice flew on thousand plane raids while serving as an instructor pilot. While completing his time as a pilot trainer, his younger brother Christopher, flying a Halifax for 76 Squadron, was shot down over Berlin on the night of 8/9 August 1942. Cheshire had flown that mission as well. When he returned from Berlin he learned that his brother had not.

In August 1942 Cheshire was promoted to acting wing commander and assigned as commanding officer of No. 76 Squadron RAF, stationed at RAF Linton-on-Ouse. The squadron was flying the Halifax bomber, and was reforming, having suffered heavy losses and low morale. Cheshire and three crews that transferred in from 102 Squadron made up the core of the unit. The crews billeted at Beningbrough Hall.

As commanding officer, Cheshire was only to fly operations once a month unless absolutely necessary. Cheshire found it absolutely necessary several times a month. He always flew on the most dangerous operations, and never took the less dangerous ops to France. As commanding officer Cheshire had no crew of his own. When he flew along with novice crews he went along as &quot;second pilot&quot; to give them confidence. With more experienced crews he took the pilot&#x27;s seat, and moved the crew&#x27;s regular pilot to the second pilot spot. On one occasion 76 Squadron was ordered to Nuremberg, and were to cross the French coast at 2,000 ft. This was a very dangerous height for light flak, and Cheshire simply refused. With typical Cheshire obstinacy, he stated they would fly at 200 ft or 20,000 ft.

Cheshire tackled the morale problem by ordering changes to the aircraft to improve the performance. He was among the first to notice that it was very rare for a Halifax to return on three engines. There were reports the Halifax was unstable in a &quot;corkscrew&quot;, the manoeuvre used by bomber pilots to escape the attacks of night fighters. Test pilot, Captain Eric Brown, was tasked with determining the cause. He and his flight engineer set to conduct a series of flight tests, when Brown was informed a representative from Bomber Command would fly along. Brown remembers &quot;We couldn&#x27;t believe it, it was Cheshire! We were astonished to say the least. I asked him not to touch the controls, and to his everlasting credit he never commented at all. He just sat in the second pilot&#x27;s seat and raised his eyebrows at what we were doing!&quot;

A part of the problem was that the Halifax could not fly as high as the Lancaster, and so was subject to greater attention from flak and night fighters. To lighten the aircraft, Cheshire had the exhaust covers and part of the mid-upper and nose gun turrets removed. This allowed the bombers to fly higher and faster. Losses soon fell, and morale rose accordingly.

During his time as the commanding officer of 76 Squadron Cheshire took the trouble to recognise and learn the names of every single man on the base. This was a reflection on Long, the pilot whom he had first trained under at 102 Squadron. Cheshire was determined to increase the efficiency of his squadron and improve the chances of survival of its crews. To this end, he frequently lectured the crews during preflight briefings on the skills needed to stay alive. With a new crew he would fly with them and demonstrate how it was done himself. Speaking of those days, Flight Sergeant Tom Gallantry, DFC, offered the following: &quot;He could do anything, and did. We all knew he wasn&#x27;t supposed to go on so many operational trips, but he did. He took new crews and gave them the benefit of his experience. He taught them what predicted flak was, he taught them what a box barrage was, by flying through it. That&#x27;s certainly more than I would have done.&quot; With the ground crews he formed &quot;The Plumbers Club&quot; where they could come together and work out problems they were facing. Their motto was &quot;You bend &#x27;em, we mend &#x27;em.&quot;

===Marston Moor===
With the completion of his third tour Cheshire was officially ineligible for further operational flying. Air Vice-Marshal Roderick Carr, Cheshire&#x27;s former Group Commander when he was at No. 102 Squadron, put much effort into securing Cheshire a promotion to acting group captain, which the Air Ministry finally approved in March. The promotion made Cheshire, at 25, the youngest group captain in the history of the RAF. On 1 April Cheshire returned to Marston Moor, now as the station commander. The airfield was used by the 1652 Heavy Conversion Unit (HCU) to convert pilots from the two-engine Whitley and Wellington bombers to the four-engined Handley Page Halifax bomber. Cheshire was in charge of 30 to 40 aircraft and 1,800 to 2,000 men.

Cheshire&#x27;s posting to Marston Moor was not to his liking. He had been an operational pilot his whole career, and he had limited experience in RAF administrative processes. He found himself frustrated at Marston Moor, not least of all by his adjutant, Bob Dales. Said Cheshire &quot;I found myself promoted very rapidly to a position which I had not been trained to fulfill. To begin with, I had great trouble with the station&#x27;s warrant officer, because he knew King&#x27;s Regulations backwards and forwards, and he was perpetually quoting it at me, and I had no idea if they were right or wrong, and I just felt out of my depth.&quot; Dales countered &quot;Group Captain Leonard Cheshire was the most frustrated senior officer I ever knew. Almost every day he pressed for a return to an operational tour. I believe his father was a barrister, and through his hatch he would try to defeat me on some point of Air Force law, but I was well versed in King&#x27;s Regulations and Air Ministry Orders.&quot;

Cheshire did what he could to convey to the men being trained how what was being taught at the OCU would translate to saving lives once they began flying in earnest. In April he was awarded a bar to his DSO. And yet the time was a personal crisis for Cheshire. He longed to get back to operational flying but could not, as he could not ask Air Vice-Marshal Carr to reverse his promotion to Group Captain, and with such a rank no flying position was available. A possible &#x27;out&#x27; arose when the AOC of the PFF, Don Bennett, arrived at his airfield to tour his station. Cheshire approached Bennett and asked permission to transfer to the Pathfinder Force. Bennett was not receptive. He replied that at present no jobs were available. Regardless, he was not sure if Cheshire would be suitable and a trial would be necessary. Cheshire was not pleased, and said so. It is not known why Bennett did not want Cheshire in the Pathfinder Force. It was not the first time Bennett had passed on Cheshire. Bennett&#x27;s primary recruiting officer, Hamish Mahaddie, found it a mystery. Mahaddie said &quot;Chesh was the only person I selected for training with the Pathfinder Force that Bennett vetoed. I was never able to establish why.&quot; In the end Cheshire viewed the refusal as a blessing in disguise. &quot;He did me a good turn, because I got something better.&quot;

In 1943, Cheshire published an account of his first tour of operations in his book, &quot;Bomber Pilot&quot; which tells of his posting to RAF Driffield and the story of flying his badly damaged bomber (&quot;N for Nuts&quot;) back to base. It became a national best seller.

===617 Squadron===
No. 5 Group Commander Ralph Cochrane provided the avenue for Cheshire&#x27;s escape. Cochrane&#x27;s elite unit, 617 Squadron, was in difficulty. Guy Gibson had been withdrawn from flying and taken on a publicity tour. He was succeeded by Wing Commander George Holden. Soon thereafter the squadron attempted the disastrous raid against the Dortmund Ems Canal, which resulted in the loss of five of the eight Lancasters sent, including that of the new squadron commander. Temporary command of the squadron was passed to H. B. &quot;Mick&quot; Martin, one of the squadron&#x27;s flight commanders. Of the original nineteen pilots that had flown the mission against the Möhne and Edersee Dams in Operation Chastise, only five remained alive. In September Cochrane asked Cheshire if he would be willing to take the job. Returning to squadron commander would require Cheshire giving up his rank of group captain and taking the step down to wing commander. Cheshire agreed without hesitation. Cochrane instructed Cheshire that first off he needed to complete a three-week conversion course on Lancasters at RAF Warboys. 
Cheshire knew the new post would be a challenge for him. Arriving at 617 Squadron he was regarded as an outsider. Though an experienced bomber pilot from the command&#x27;s campaign against Germany, those missions were flown at high altitude and solo. Hundreds of aircraft were on each raid, but in the dark of night they rarely saw each other. Each plane was in isolation from the others, and flew in strict radio silence. 617 Squadron had become Bomber Command&#x27;s masters of low flying at night. Low altitude kept them under German radar, allowing them to approach their targets undetected. For months they had been flying together at low level, at night, in formation, and below tree level. They had learned to avoid obstructions, and to tuck their wings inside the leader&#x27;s, a move that decreased turbulence but was very unnerving to attempt. It was very dangerous flying that no other squadron could perform. Here Cheshire benefited from a friendship that he formed with the man he superseded, confessing later &quot;Everything I know about low-level flying I learned from Mick Martin.&quot; As to Cochrane, he had been warned Cochrane was an uncompromising and strict CO, and that they would not get along. However Cheshire found Cochrane to be very bright, and though strict, it was a strictness in the best possible sense. An example of Cochrane&#x27;s inflexibility arose early on, when Cochrane insisted Cheshire complete the three-week conversion course to Lancasters at Warboys. An experienced pilot on the Halifax, Cheshire felt the training flying somewhat demeaning, but after his second day there he realised Cochrane had been quite right.

It was at 617 Squadron where Cheshire came to real distinction as a remarkable air officer. It was here that his ability to lead, accept risk and think unconventionally resulted in the development of the most successful techniques the RAF developed to deliver extremely large bombs with remarkably deadly accuracy.

====V-3 mission====
The mission Cochrane had recruited Cheshire for was the destruction of the German V-3 long-range guns. As their third and potentially most destructive vengeance weapon, the Germans had constructed a pair of extremely large guns and positioned them in northern France. They were buried deep in underground bunkers near Mimoyecques in the Pas-de-Calais region. Once operational these powerful guns would be able to fire a shell into London every minute, and buried in the earth and protected by 50 feet of reinforced concrete, they were impervious to bombing attack. Such a target was very different from a marshalling yard. Area bombing the region where the guns were located would have no effect upon them.

British scientist and inventor Barnes Wallis had been asked to produce a bomb that could destroy these bunkers. The resulting bomb weighed 12,000 pounds, and if dropped from 20,000 feet would penetrate the earth and cause a small scale earthquake, destroying the target. He called this bomb the Tallboy. To be effective the bombs had to be dropped very accurately. He stated that, for accuracy requirements, one bomb out of fifteen dropped from 20,000 feet needed to land within twelve metres of the target. This was an accuracy unheard of in daytime aerial bombing, let alone bombing at night. Cheshire suggested this was going to be a problem, but got no sympathy from Wallis, who replied &quot;Well, if you&#x27;re going to scatter my bombs all over northern France what&#x27;s the point of my building them?&quot;

In January the need for a new marking technique became clear to Cheshire when 617 Squadron made an attack against a V-1 site in the Pas de Calais region. A Pathfinder aircraft working at altitude dropped a marker flare upon the target. 617 then proceeded to drop all their bombs within 94 yards of the marker, a remarkable feat of accuracy. The problem was the marker was 350 yards from the target, and the mission was a failure.

In February 1944 Harris called a meeting at High Wycombe to discuss the destruction of the V-3 site. The meeting included the AOC of Bomber Command Arthur Harris, the AOC of the Pathfinder Force, Air Vice-Marshal Bennett and 5 Group AOC Cochrane, who brought along with him Cheshire. It was chaired by deputy air officer commanding-in-chief Robert Saundby. Bennett was informed of the accuracy needed to mark the target. He dismissed the idea, stating that it could not be done. Cheshire offered that it could be achieved if attempted with a low-level marker aircraft. Bennett rejected this as well, stating that a low-level flight against a well-defended target would not be survivable. The problem was withdrawn from the Pathfinders, but was given to 5 Group to see if they could work out a solution. This is what Cochrane was hoping for. The operation could not be undertaken at once, as the large bomb that Barnes Wallis proposed to destroy the target at Mimoyecques was still under development. Cheshire and Martin thus had a small window of time to develop a technique by which they could accurately hit within yards of the target. 

The first task to develop was how to mark the target. The Pathfinder technique was to drop a group of markers. A master bomber would then direct the following aircraft to drop their bombs on the markers below, adjusting to the best marker as needed. Cheshire chose to drop a single, very accurate marker, and have the rest of the force bomb that. A barrier existed in that for the sake of air crew safety Cochrane insisted the markers be released at no less than 5,000 feet. Efforts to mark the target from 5,000 feet on the bombing ranges proved frustratingly difficult. Even when the marker was dropped dead on upon the target, the angular momentum of the marker caused it to slide or skip a hundred yards before coming to a rest. At 5,000 feet they never could get closer than 150 to 300 yards from target. Martin tried using a dive-bomb technique, approaching at 5,000 feet and then dropping into a 30-degree dive, releasing the marker at 100 feet before pulling the big Lancaster up. Though the Lancaster was a cumbersome aircraft to attempt it in, the result was accurate.

Cheshire could now mark the target using a method that was not permitted. He next moved on to identifying the target at night. To mark the target, it had to be visible to the marking pilot. For this the area would need to be illuminated. A second aircraft would need to drop an illumination flare before the marking aircraft made its run. Given the release of the illumination flare was timed to the effort to mark the target, the flare could be dropped by parachute from 5,000 feet. To keep the illumination flare over the target area on its descent the weather would have to be fair, with limited wind. Thus the components for precision low-level marking at night came together. With an illuminated target area, he could mark the target with one accurate target indicator flare which the main force could aim for, and thereby destroy the target.

====Limoges raid====

Cheshire and Martin discussed their proposed method with Cochrane, who agreed to allow them to try it. The target would be the Gnome et Rhône aero-engine factory at Limoges in France. The air defences would be lighter, but there were two problems with this target. The first was that the factory was surrounded by the homes of the factory&#x27;s French workers. Secondly, the plant was running around the clock, so French workers would be in the factory when it was attacked at night. As it was a target in France the proposal to bomb it had to be sent to the War Cabinet for approval. The raid was approved, but with the condition that they were forbidden from taking any civilian lives. It would be their one chance to prove low-level marking in combat.

On the night of 8/9 February 1944 the Lancasters of 617 Squadron approached Limoges at 16,000 feet. Below, a Lancaster at 5,000 feet dropped shielded flares over the target. Cheshire and Martin came in at 2,000 feet, and could see as light as day. He identified the roof top of the Gnome-Rhone factory, and proceeded to make a series of low-level passes at 20 feet, hoping the workers inside would take the hint. The 500 workers ran out of the building. Cheshire then dropped a marker flare on the roof top. Approaching at 16,000 feet, the rest of 617 came in one at a time, each aircraft dropping its bomb load directly on the marker. The factory was devastated, and the only civilian casualty was a worker who was injured when she came back to the factory to try to get her bicycle. It was Cheshire&#x27;s first big success with 617.

====Anthéor railway viaduct====

The Anthéor viaduct was a railway link in southern France along the coast between Saint-Raphaël and Nice. The viaduct carried a double railway line that was being used to move supplies to German forces blocking the advance of the Allies in Italy. Though the Marseille–Ventimiglia railway had been attacked and cut in a number of places before, each time the Germans repaired the tracks quickly. The viaduct was 185 feet in the air and spanned a brook that flowed between two coastal hills. If destroyed the line would be disrupted permanently. Attempts on the viaduct had been made twice earlier, but destroying it required a direct hit, and the previous attacks had been unsuccessful.

On the night of 12/13 February 1944, 10 Lancasters from 617 Squadron flew across France to the viaduct. Cheshire and Martin approached to make a low-level marking of the line, but it was soon discovered that since the last attempt the Germans had placed a large number of flak guns on the hills overlooking the viaduct. Cheshire made several attempts to mark it, but could not get close enough to drop his marker on the line. Martin followed, but just as his aircraft was releasing his marker it was hit, badly. Two of the Lancaster&#x27;s engines were knocked out, the bomb aimer had been killed, and several others, including Martin, were wounded. A return trip to England was out of the question, and his aircraft limped south to an airfield on Sardinia. Cheshire made five more attempts on the viaduct, but was unable to get close enough to leave his marker on the railway line. The squadron was called in and dropped their bombs off the nearest marker, but no direct hit was made and the viaduct was not destroyed. Cheshire returned in failure with a badly holed Lancaster. Despite his multiple runs at the target and the damage his aircraft sustained, it was the one mission of his career where he felt he had failed to press home his attack as he should have.

Following his failure at the Anthéor viaduct the low-level technique he would use for the rest of the war came together in Cheshire&#x27;s mind. For the bombing force to be effective he had to wait upon good weather, as good visibility was essential at the target. In addition, the target would need to be illuminated. A marker aircraft would come in first and drop a hooded parachute flare at 5,000 feet. Next, a low-level target-marking aircraft would come in at 4,000 feet, identify the target building and make a 30-degree dive attack on it, releasing the marker flare at 100 feet directly upon the roof of the target. Though he had been doing this with the Lancaster, the heavy bomber was really not well suited to the job. Cheshire believed the low marker aircraft should be fast and more manoeuvrable. The Mosquito seemed an ideal choice. With the target marked, the main bombing force of Lancasters would come in, one by one, dropping their bombs on the marker. Noting how things can change in the course of military operations, the attacking force had to be able to adapt to the conditions faced. This meant communication between the leader and the bombing aircraft he was directing. This sort of ongoing radio communication over enemy territory was a big break from the Bomber Command method, which operated over the continent in strict radio silence.

Regrouping after the viaduct raid, 617 commenced upon a series of attacks marked by astonishing accuracy, destroying an aircraft factory at Albert 2 March, a needle roller bearing factory at Saint-Étienne 4 March, the Michelin plant at Clermont-Ferrand on 16 March, the Tuilieres power station at Bergerac on 18 March, and the power station at Lyon on 25 March. The destruction continued into April when a version of Cheshire&#x27;s low-level marking technique was used in raids against Toulouse on 5 April 1944, Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École (fr) 10 April 1944, and the Juvisy marshalling yards on 18/19 April.

====Second meeting with Harris====

With the string of successes in low-level marking Cochrane took Cheshire to see Harris to discuss their marking technique, request the use of Mosquito aircraft, and ask that 5 Group be allowed to mark for themselves against targets in Germany. Harris heard what they had to say, and though Cheshire&#x27;s squadron had a good track record against lightly defended targets in France, it was likely going to be another story if they were to attempt such a technique against one of the heavily defended targets in Germany. There was a target in Germany that Harris felt he had yet to hit adequately: Munich. Said Harris &quot;Mark me Munich and I will give you the Mosquitos. Miss Munich and you will lose the Mosquitos.&quot; They would be allowed four Mosquito aircraft on loan from PFF. Using these four and the rest of 617 in Lancasters as back up, they were to mark the railway yard at Munich for 5 Group, who were tasked with the yard&#x27;s destruction.

====Munich raid====
Though delighted with the opportunity, Harris had selected about the most difficult target for Cheshire to reach. It was a great distance to fly, and would be at the limit of the Mosquito&#x27;s range. Their course had to be direct, with no flying around well-defended targets. Even so, they would be cutting it pretty thin. With the fuel range limit of the Mosquito they would have 3 minutes time over the target, and 15 minutes of fuel left when they got back. After he explained the mission to the four navigators who would be in the Mosquitos, there was general disbelief. The common belief was if they were lucky enough to survive the mission they would most likely be spending the rest of the war in a Luftwaffe prison camp. The Mosquitos moved forward to RAF Manston, the nearest airfield for the mission. On the night of 24/25 April, four Mosquitos of 617 set out to mark the Munich railway yard for 5 Group.

Cheshire and the three other Mosquitos caught up and got ahead of the Main Force heavies, arriving right on time at Zero minus 5 minutes. Pathfinder Force Lancasters were already above the railway yard, dropping their illumination flares over the target. The target area was well lit, though there was intense flak over the target. Not pausing, Cheshire dived straight for his target building near the railway yard, dropping his marker at rooftop height. He then made a slow, wide circle of the yard to evaluate the effect of the bombing. The heavy bombers came in, dropped their loads on the marker and the railway yard was destroyed. Their raid against Munich was successful, and all four Mosquitos made it back. True to his word, Harris allowed Cheshire to keep them.

====Mailly-le-Camp====

As part of the preparatory effort against the German defences in northern France, the panzer training camp northeast of Paris at Mailly-le-Camp was targeted for destruction. The camp was French, built for their armoured formations, but since the fall of France the Germans had been using it to train replacement crews for units refitting from losses suffered in the east. Cheshire with his four marker Mosquitos from 617 were tasked with marking the target, and 346 Lancasters from 1 Group and 5 Group were tasked with destroying it. On the night of 3/4 May Cheshire approached the target for a typical low-marking technique raid, with Cheshire and Shannon making the initial marking, and Lancasters from 83 Squadron and 97 Squadron serving as back-up marker aircraft. An assembly point marker was dropped 15 miles away from the target, and the aircraft of the two groups of heavy bombers were ordered to orbit it at stacked altitudes of 100 feet separation while awaiting instructions to attack. Unbeknownst to Cheshire, that night the US Armed Services Radio was broadcasting big band swing music on the same frequency Cheshire was using for his raid. Arriving over the target, an illumination flare provided excellent visibility and Cheshire swept in low and marked the target, but when the Main Force Controller called in the waiting Lancasters no one received his message. Meanwhile, Luftwaffe night fighters began to arrive. It was a clear night with a full moon, and soon the night fighters got in among the circling bombers. The air combat over France that night was short, but intense. Crews reported seeing four or five Lancasters falling from the sky at a time. 5 Group lost 14 bombers, while 1 Group making up the second wave lost 28. After a delay of some 15 minutes the Deputy &#x27;Main Force Controller&#x27; took over and ordered the bombers in. The training base at Mailly-le-Camp was hit heavily. 114 barrack buildings, 47 transport sheds, 37 tanks and 65 other vehicles were all destroyed in the attack, while 218 soldiers were killed and 156 more were wounded. However Bomber Command suffered the loss of 42 Lancasters and their crews, with another Lancaster written off after it made it back to base. The training base was destroyed, but Bomber Command suffered a loss rate of 11.6%.

====D-day deception====
To support the D-day landings, 617 Squadron was given an unusual mission. It was tasked with pulling off a &quot;spoof&quot; raid. The squadron was to make a series of low-level approaches to the Pas de Calais, dropping window (chaff) with each pass. If delivered sequentially the window might simulate the approach of an invasion fleet and confuse the enemy about the real D-day landings in Normandy. 617 was disappointed, and felt they should be used in a more conventional manner to destroy real targets, but they did as they were told. In fact, they were the only unit that could pull it off. On the night of 5/6 June 1944, 617 Squadron used precision flying to drop window over the channel at low level in succession, generating the radar appearance of large numbers of approaching ships. This &quot;spoof&quot; raid simulated the approach for an amphibious landing in the Pas de Calais. In retrospect Cheshire felt they may have saved more lives with this mission than in any of the others they did.

====V weapon storage sites====

Following the invasion 617 went back to attacking the buried reinforced concrete V-1 and V-2 storage sites. It flew against and destroyed the sites at Wizernes, and followed with Watten.

On 14 June 1944, 617 squadron made a daylight attack upon the E-boat pens at Le Havre. The pens protected fifteen E-boats, which posed a threat to the invasion fleet. Attacking the pens with Tallboys, the roof was caved in, and all but one of the E-boats were damaged beyond use. In addition, 617 attacked the German ships in Le Havre by dropping Tallboys into the waters of the harbour. The explosions were so strong that ten ships were blown straight out of the water and onto the quayside. Commented Cheshire, &quot;Barnes Wallis had a big bomb.&quot;

On 25 June Cheshire was tasked with a daylight raid against the Siracourt V-1 bunker, a storage bunker and launch site for V-1 flying bombs made of reinforced concrete buried in the earth. Cheshire had lost his Mosquitos, as another squadron asserted a prior claim on them. Desiring a manoeuvrable replacement aircraft to mark the target, he considered a Mustang as ideal, but he knew he would never get the Royal Air Force to give him one. Instead, he turned to the Americans, who had a wealth of aircraft and a favourable opinion of Cheshire. The fighter plane arrived boxed up in its packaging crate on the day he was to fly the mission. Flying the Mustang posed a number of problems for Cheshire, one of which being he had not flown a single-seat aircraft since his training days. However, his major problem was working out a course to the target. He had never flown without a navigator, and now he found himself in the position of having to ask for help. He swallowed his pride and asked the squadron&#x27;s navigators to help him work out his course, while the ground crew put together the Mustang. His crew finished the job by late afternoon, some time after the Lancasters had taken off. With no time for a test flight, off he went to chase down the Lancasters. The machine worked beautifully, with Cheshire arriving over the target just as the high illumination flares were being dropped. He marked the target, and the Lancasters landed three Tallboys on it, destroying it utterly.

====Raid on the V-3 site at Mimoyecques====

On 6 July 1944 the Mimoyecques V-3 site finally was attacked. This was the mission he had been waiting for. In a daylight attack, Cheshire marked the target for the 617 Squadron heavies, which each carried a Tallboy. The caves collapsed, bringing the V-3 threat to an end.

On the night of 7/8 July 617 Squadron flew against the limestone cave at Saint-Leu-d&#x27;Esserent. The cave was being used to store V-1s and V-2s. Cheshire flew as the target marker in his Mustang. It was his 100th mission, and would be his last with Bomber Command. Tallboy strikes caused a partial collapse of the cave, and the tunnels were blocked off. The following day Cochrane took Cheshire off ops. He also stood down Shannon, Munro and McCarthy, the surviving 617 pilots from the Dams raid.

After the completion of his fourth tour of duty in July 1944 Cheshire was awarded the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross is usually bestowed for a particularly marked event of bravery. In Cheshire&#x27;s case, the award was given for his behaviour over the course of his entire operational career. At the investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace, both Cheshire and warrant officer Norman Jackson were to receive the VC from King George VI on that day. Despite the disparity in rank, Cheshire insisted they approach the King together. Upon reaching the King, Jackson recalled Cheshire offering &quot;This chap stuck his neck out more than I did – he should get his VC first.&quot; The King kept to protocol and awarded the Group Captain first, but Jackson later stated he would &quot;never forget what Cheshire said.&quot;

===Nagasaki and discharge from the RAF===
Cheshire and William Penney were official British observers of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki. His vantage point was in the support B-29 Big Stink. He did not witness the event as close up as anticipated due to aircraft commander James Hopkins&#x27; failure to link up with the other B-29s. Hopkins was meant to join with the others over Yakushima but he circled at instead of the agreed height of . He tried to justify this by the need to keep the VIP passengers out of danger but Cheshire thought that Hopkins was &quot;overwrought&quot;. Cheshire later said of the experience &quot;with such utter devastation before our eyes, how imperative to do something to see that it should never happen again.&quot;

By now Cheshire was desperate to return to England, and sent in applications and asked for interviews to quicken the process. Instead, the Air Ministry posted him to the Gulf of Mexico to teach low-level marking to the United States Army Air Forces, but he refused to do it. Finally he got his way and returned, but first had to report on his experiences at Nagasaki to the Prime Minister. He had been asked to do the job by Winston Churchill, but had to report to new Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who was startled by Cheshire&#x27;s insistence that the answer to peace was more research into the development of atomic energy as a means of propulsion into space. Cheshire told Attlee that the race would be won by the efficacy of the means of delivering atom bombs and the means of protecting stockpiles from destruction. He suggested to Attlee that thinking should move away from conventional aircraft and rockets on Earth and to launch into Space. Cheshire noted that Attlee did not seem impressed.

Shortly after this conversation, Cheshire was summoned to his final Medical board and was told he had been diagnosed with psycho-neurosis and needed a year&#x27;s complete rest. He was retired from the RAF with a disability pension on 22 January 1946, retaining his final rank of Group Captain. RAF doctors sent him to St Luke&#x27;s Woodside hospital at Muswell Hill for rest and observation.

===Cheshire as officer===

Cheshire was not a naturally talented pilot, and felt he had to keep flying to keep his skills up. All the same he was a good captain, had a flair, and most importantly he was lucky. It was commonly known among crews that he was lucky, and that is one reason he felt they liked to fly with him. By the end of his operative flying almost all the pilots he had started out with in training were gone. It was his good luck, he believed, that had kept him alive when so many other, better pilots had been killed.

His method for dealing with dangerous situations was to go straight for them. He saw no sense in waiting. He felt worrying about the dangers would only exhaust one&#x27;s mind. Instead, he relied on the natural instinct for self-preservation to help get him out of tight spots. To this was added his ability to close his mind completely to the dangers he was facing. Though a very imaginative thinker, Cheshire possessed the ability to block out of his mind any thought to the risks. He approached each mission with an easy manner.

Cheshire was a great leader of men. In contrast to Guy Gibson, Cheshire was approachable, and made it a point to know the name of every man on base, including the ground crews. He took the time to speak with them, and contrived various methods to reach out to them. Technical questions about his aircraft were an easy point of conversation. Afterwards, he would share a cigarette with the young man, and talk over his personal concerns. He wanted each man to have a sense that he knew them and liked them. Cheshire believed this was critical to the effectiveness of his squadron. He invoked great loyalty in his men, as it was clear he was devoted to their needs and was willing to take practical steps to improve the safety and success of their missions. He made a personal example of what was required, and relied on his example and the crews&#x27; determination not to let him down to lead them through some of the war&#x27;s most difficult raids.

Cheshire was resolute when dealing with any pilot or crew member in his squadron who would not fly missions. Lack of Moral Fibre might show up as a member feigning illness, frequent early returns with technical problems, or flying over the North Sea and dropping bombs into the ocean, then flying about till the time of return was about right. Though a brilliant and sympathetic leader, he later wrote &quot;I was ruthless with LMF. I had to be. We were airmen, not psychiatrists. Of course we had concern for any individual whose internal tensions meant that he could no longer go on, but there was a worry that one really frightened man could affect others around him.&quot; Cheshire would take a crew member with confidence problems aboard his own aircraft till they sorted things out, but pilots he transferred out immediately.

Cheshire was no great respecter of authority. On one mission near the end of his tour with 35 Squadron he looked at the route map to the target and noted there would be a great deal of flak over the chosen flight path. Asked afterward about their flight, Cheshire wryly replied &quot;We took a different route.&quot; Soft-spoken, considerate and thoughtful, he was also unorthodox, independently minded and unconventional in his thinking. He was both the youngest group captain in the service and the most decorated. Historian Max Hastings wrote: &quot;Cheshire was a legend in Bomber Command, a remarkable man with an almost mystical air about him, as if he somehow inhabited a different planet from those about him, but without affectation or pretension.&quot; Said Flight Sergeant Tom Gallantry, DFC, who served under Cheshire in 76 Squadron: &quot;I felt at the time, and I have always felt, that it was an honour to be a member of his squadron. Everyone felt the same way about him. Air crew... ground crew. He was a terrific character.&quot;

==Post War: VIP Colony and Le Court Cheshire Home==

At St Luke&#x27;s hospital, Cheshire was free to come and go and soon had a thriving correspondence with old contacts, trying to find a purpose to replace life in the Air Force. Based on his successful book &quot;Bomber Pilot&quot; and other writing work, he got a job working as a journalist for the &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot;, discharged himself from hospital and temporarily took up residence in the Mayfair Hotel.

By the end of 1946, Cheshire took a house in Kensington Gardens and continued his search for meaning. Bemoaning a lack of the war spirit and unity of purpose, he put out a call in his column to set-up a colony for ex-service men and women as a way of easing the transition between life in the service and as civilians, and was overwhelmed by support. He decided to start a communal living experiment called &#x27;Vade in Pacem&#x27; (in English, &#x27;Go in Peace&#x27;) first at Gumley Hall in Leicestershire, and then at Le Court in Hampshire later that year - a house and estate he had bought from his aunt. His aim in establishing the VIP Colony was to provide an opportunity for ex-servicemen and women and their families to live together, each contributing to the community what they could to help their transition back into civilian life. He hoped that training, prosperity and fulfilment would result from united effort and mutual support. He saw the community as one way of continuing to work towards world peace. The community, however, did not prosper and the project came to an end in 1947.

At the beginning of 1948, Cheshire heard about Arthur Dykes, who had been one of Cheshire&#x27;s original &quot;VIP&quot; community at Le Court, and was dying from cancer. Dykes asked Cheshire to give him some land to park a caravan until he recovered, but Cheshire discovered that Dykes was terminally ill and that this diagnosis was concealed from him. He told Dykes the real position and invited him to stay at Le Court. Cheshire learned nursing skills and was soon approached to take in a second patient, a 94-year-old woman recovering from a stroke. She was followed by others, some coming to stay and others to help. Although Le Court had no financial support, and his situation was financially perilous most of the time, money somehow always seemed to arrive in the nick of time to stave off disaster.

Cheshire had identified a gap in the new National Health Service (NHS) and more were to come to him for help, willing to contribute their National Insurance payments and keen to share a home with others where they could make friends and all chip in together. By the summer of 1949 Le Court had 24 residents with complex needs, illnesses and impairments, and a tuberculosis ward. The local GP and others had misgivings about the project, but as Cheshire pointed out, no matter how basic or unsatisfactory it was from a medical viewpoint, the alternative for most of the people accepted to Le Court was much worse.

As word spread, referrals came from the new NHS hospitals already struggling to cope with waiting lists of people needing urgent care. Disabled people were at the very bottom of the list of priorities, often left to manage on their own, rely on others to help them get through each day or were stuck living in hospital wards. As Le Court became established, and people from different parts of the UK began to rally in response to local need for a similar home for people in their communities, the charity now known as Leonard Cheshire began. Le Court was to become the first &#x27;Cheshire Home&#x27; and remained the flagship home of the charity Leonard Cheshire until its closure in 2007. Cheshire continued to live both at Le Court and after his marriage, at the Sue Ryder home in Cavendish for the rest of his life.

==Humanitarian work==
As a result of his experiences in the Second World War as a whole, Cheshire dedicated his life to peace and justice, defining it as ‘not just the absence of war or armed confrontation...peace is the effect, or consequence, of justice...we move towards peace proportionately as we succeed in removing injustice, particularly the injustice of mass starvation, and deprivation.’

As part of this work, he founded the following charities:

In 1948 his eponymous charity Leonard Cheshire, supporting people with disabilities across the world to live, learn and work as independently as they choose whatever their ability.

In 1953, Cheshire founded the Raphael Pilgrimage to enable sick and disabled Christians to travel to Lourdes on pilgrimage.

In 1959 with wife Sue Ryder, Ryder-Cheshire. This charity was set up for joint projects that did not fall under their respective foundations, and began with the founding of Raphael in Dehra Dun, India. Initially Raphael was for people with leprosy and tuberculosis (TB) and their families and continues today rehabilitating children with learning disabilities and those with TB. The UK branch of Ryder-Cheshire closed in 2010 and remaining funds were used to set up Target Tuberculosis and Enrych (previously Ryder Cheshire Volunteers). Target Tuberculosis concentrated on the eradication of TB in Africa and Asia, and closed in 2016. Enrych continues to work supporting people with disabilities by providing access to leisure and learning opportunities through volunteers. In Australia, Ryder-Cheshire Australia continues to support Raphael in India, a home at Klibur Domin in Timor-Leste also two Australian Homes in Mt. Gambier and Melbourne.

In 1990, towards the end of his life, Cheshire founded the UK charity the World Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief. He was increasingly concerned with remembrance, and the effects of natural and man-made disaster on the lives of disabled people and others experiencing injustice, hence the charity&#x27;s motto ‘for every life lost, a life saved’. To raise money for the charity, concert &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; by former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters was staged in Potsdamer Platz, Berlin. Cheshire opened this concert by blowing a Second World War whistle. 

Cheshire&#x27;s concerns with making Remembrance Day more meaningful for modern times was influential in the concept of the National Memorial Arboretum, founded by Commander David Childs CBE, Director of the World Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief. Childs was involved in the winding up of the Memorial Fund after Cheshire&#x27;s death in 1992; he took each phrase of the fund&#x27;s slogan ‘for every life lost, a life saved’ and created new projects out of remaining funds. For ‘a life saved’ in 1996 Childs and the trustees created The Leonard Cheshire Chair of Conflict Recovery, headed by an army surgeon, which provided advice to devastated post-conflict regions. This Chair was based at University College London at the Leonard Cheshire Research Centre, now called the UCL International Disability Research Centre. To ‘Remember a life lost’ they created the National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield in Staffordshire. The amphitheatre at the Arboretum is dedicated to the memory of Leonard Cheshire, and is surrounded by his favourite tree the Copper Beech. The Millennium Chapel of Peace and Forgiveness contains the Cavendish Cross, carved by Ken Willoughby of the Essex Woodcarvers as a tribute to the life and work of Sue Ryder and Leonard Cheshire.

==Christian faith==

Cheshire&#x27;s adoption of the Roman Catholic faith had nothing to do with the bombing of Nagasaki: &quot;Many assumed that it was Nagasaki which emptied him; as Cheshire kept pointing out, however, it was the war as a whole. Like Britain herself, he had been fighting or training for fighting since 1939&quot;. Cheshire had been brought up a Christian in the Church of England, but had lapsed. In 1945, in the Vanity Fair club in Mayfair, he joined a conversation about religion. &quot;It was absurd,&quot; he said, &quot;to imagine that God existed, except as a convenient figure of speech. Man had invented God to explain the voice of conscience, but it was doubtful whether right or wrong existed outside the human mind. They were words affixed like labels to customs and laws which man had also invented to keep social order.&quot; To Cheshire&#x27;s surprise, as he sat back, &quot;pleased with his worldly wisdom,&quot; he was roundly rebuked for &quot;talking such rot&quot; by a woman friend who &quot;was one of the last persons on earth he would have credited with&quot; religious convictions. This gave him food for thought. 

While he was nursing Arthur Dykes in 1948 the conversation turned to religion. Dykes was a lapsed Roman Catholic refinding his faith, and it was through their late night discussions that Cheshire decided to convert. Dykes died in August 1948 and, after completing the arrangements for his funeral, Cheshire read a book given him by a friend, &quot;One Lord, One Faith&quot; by Vernon Johnson, a High Anglican clergyman who had converted to Catholicism. On Christmas Eve 1948, Cheshire was received into the Catholic Church.

Cheshire married fellow humanitarian Sue Ryder, also a Roman Catholic convert, in a private chapel at Bombay&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cathedral on 5 April 1959.

Cheshire had a particular interest in the Shroud of Turin, about which he lectured and wrote books. In 1954 he embarked upon a pilgrimage to Turin with a young disabled girl and her family, who were seeking a cure from polio. Cheshire arranged with the Turin authorities for her to touch the Shroud, and later the girl and her family attributed this act of faith to her eventual recovery from the disease.

At the time of this pilgrimage, Cheshire was himself recovering from a tuberculosis infection that had destroyed one of his lungs and a few ribs; he attributed his recovery from the serious illness to the life-size replica of the shroud at the foot of his hospital bed. Cheshire lived at King Edward VII TB Hospital in Midhurst from 1952 to 1954 while recovering, and while there set up a &#x27;Mission Bus&#x27; fitted with tape-recorded speeches on Christ&#x27;s life, and a place to view a film on the Holy Shroud. The bus was parked in central London, with publicity stunts to attract visitors.

In 1992, when Cheshire knew he was dying from motor neurone disease, his last thoughts were gathered by his spiritual advisor Father Reginald C. Fuller in a book called &quot;Crossing the Finishing Line&quot;.

In 2017, on the centenary of Leonard Cheshire&#x27;s birth, the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia held a memorial Requiem mass to promote his cause for sainthood.

==Return to Nagasaki==
In 1985, Cheshire featured in a documentary, &quot;Nagasaki – Return Journey&quot;.

==Private life==
On 15 July 1941, Cheshire married the American actress Constance Binney, 21 years his senior. They divorced, childless, in January 1951.

On 5 April 1959, in Bombay&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cathedral, he married Sue Ryder, also a Roman Catholic convert and humanitarian. He and Baroness Ryder were one of the few couples who both held titles in their own right. They had two children, Jeromy and Elizabeth Cheshire, and lived in Cavendish, Suffolk.

Cheshire was a lifelong tennis fan, a member of the All England Club, and a formidable amateur player well into his seventies.

==Death==
After his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, Leonard Cheshire and Sue Ryder made a final trip to the Raphael Centre they had founded in India. This journey was documented by David Puttnam and Anglia TV in the film &quot;Indian Summer&quot;.

Cheshire was determined to be present at the unveiling of Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris&#x27;s memorial on 31 May 1992, and attended against the advice of his doctors. He said &quot;I would have gone even if I had to be carried on a stretcher&quot;. Cheshire died two months later at his home in the Sue Ryder Care Home at Cavendish, Suffolk, on 31 July 1992, aged 74. He is buried in the cemetery in Cavendish. Sue Ryder was interred in the same grave after her death in 2000. They are surrounded by graves of the people they lived with at the Sue Ryder Home, including Holocaust survivors from the Second World War. There is a memorial to both in St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Cavendish.

In his speech, Leonard Cheshire said:
&quot;I also, am very much aware, that although this beautiful and very symbolic award has been made to me personally, I am part of a great number of people of different nationalities and different backgrounds working together, and I am only a part... I accept it on behalf of all those connected with our homes, but also I’d like to feel that - if I may say this - That I’d also accept it on behalf of others (in so many other different ways) who are working among disabled people. On behalf of disabled people themselves, who are making such a contribution in their own way to the development and evolution of our society, because I feel very strongly that what we might for the moment call the &#x27;world of disabled people&#x27;, is a very united world. I feel very privileged to be a small part of that fraternity of people who are contributing, researching, working, and living with the objective of making life more livable for those who have some kind of disability&quot;.

<doc id="187994" wikidata="Q615908" url="?curid=187994" title="Dragon Quest">
<text>previously published as Dragon Warrior in North America until 2005, is a series of role-playing video games created by Japanese game designer Yuji Horii (Armor Project), character designer Akira Toriyama (Bird Studio), and composer Koichi Sugiyama (Sugiyama Kobo) and published by Square Enix (formerly Enix). Since its inception, development of games in the series have been outsourced to a plethora of external companies until the tenth installment, with localized remakes and ports of later installments for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch being published by Nintendo outside of Japan. With its first game published in 1986, there are eleven main-series games, along with numerous spin-off games. In addition, there have been numerous manga, anime and novels published under the franchise, with nearly every game in the main series having a related adaptation.

The series introduced a number of features to the genre and has had a significant impact on the development of other role-playing games. Installments of the series have appeared on various computers, consoles, handheld devices, and mobile phones. Early in the series, the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games were released under the title &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; in North America to avoid trademark conflict with the unrelated tabletop role-playing game &quot;DragonQuest&quot;. Square Enix did not register the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; trademark for use in the United States until 2002.

The basic premise of most &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games is to play a hero (actually named &quot;Hero&quot; in spinoff fiction, but in all games, the player is able to name their hero) who is out to save the land from peril at the hands of a powerful evil enemy, with the hero usually accompanied by a group of party members. Common elements persist throughout the series and its spinoff games: turn-based combat; recurring monsters, including the Slime, which became the series&#x27; mascot; a text-based menu system; and random encounters in most of the main series.

All games in the series as of 2024 involve scenario writer and game designer Yuji Horii, and prior to their deaths, character designer Akira Toriyama and music composer Koichi Sugiyama have handled their respective roles on most games in the series. The original concepts, used since the first game, took elements from the Western role-playing games &quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot;. A core philosophy of the series is to make the gameplay intuitive so that players can easily start playing the games. The series features a number of religious overtones which were heavily censored in the NES versions outside of Japan.

=== Games ===
The first installment of the franchise was released in Japan on May 27, 1986, titled with the name &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; followed by a Roman numeral. Since 1986, the franchise has featured eleven games within the main series, as well as several spin-off games, and also two animated productions.

==== Main series ====

The first four &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; installments were released for the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan and North America, respectively. The first two installments were released in Japan on the Famicom and ported that same year to the MSX; all four games have been remade for newer systems. &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was first released in Japan on May 27, 1986, and in North America as &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; in August 1989. &quot;Dragon Quest II Akuryō no Kamigami&quot; was released in Japan in 1987 and in North America in 1990 as &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot;. &quot;Dragon Quest III Soshite Densetsu e...&quot; was released in Japan in 1989 and North America as &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; in 1992. &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; was released in Japan in 1990 and in North America in 1992 as &quot;Dragon Warrior IV&quot;. A 2001 Japanese PlayStation remake of &quot;Dragon Warrior IV&quot; scheduled for the North American market was never released. The Nintendo DS remake of &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; was released in North America, Europe, and Australia under its original translated title; the European release removed the number from the title.

Two games were released for the Super Famicom: &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; in 1995; both have been re-released on newer systems. &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; was originally scheduled for release in North America but was canceled amid rumors that Enix had given up on the American market. No official reason was ever given. The Nintendo DS remakes were released in North America with &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; also being released in Europe and Australia, the latter without the numbering. One game was released for the PlayStation: &quot;Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshi-tachi&quot; in 2000 in Japan and 2001 in North America under the title &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot;. &quot;Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King&quot; was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004 in Japan, 2005 in North America, and 2006 in Europe and Australia, again without the number in the title for Europe. &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot; was the first game in the series to be released in North America under the title of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and the first European release of a main series game. &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot;, the only game in the series initially released on the Nintendo DS, was originally released in 2009 in Japan, and in 2010 in North America, Europe, and Australia. &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot; was announced for the Wii in December 2008. In September 2011, Square Enix announced that &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot; would also be released on the Wii U, with Nintendo 3DS connectivity. It is the first MMORPG in the series, and the only numbered &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game not released outside Japan. &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot; was released in Japan on July 29, 2017, and worldwide on September 4, 2018.

&quot;Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate&quot; was announced in 2021. According to Horii, the game will have a darker tone, feature more meaningful choices, and overhaul the traditional &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; turn-based combat. &quot;Dragon Quest XII&quot; will also be the first mainline title released after the deaths of series music composer Koichi Sugiyama and character designer Akira Toriyama who had been involved with the series since its inception.

==== Spin-offs ====
The franchise includes several spin-off games, including the &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot; RPG. The series has also inspired arcade games such as the Japanese &quot;Dragon Quest: Monster Battle Road&quot;, where players compete for real-life cards with monster data that the arcade game issues to the players through a slot on its front. The latter is the only spin-off series to have none of its titles released outside Japan. The &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; series use characters and other elements from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, and the Mystery Dungeon series has gone on to spawn its own franchise.

In 1993, Chunsoft developed a SNES game that included Torneko (a.k.a. Torneko Taloon), a character that first appeared in &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;. The roguelike game &quot;Torneko no Daibōken: Fushigi no Dungeon&quot; continues Torneko&#x27;s story from &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; as he attempts to make his store famous, venturing into mysterious dungeons to retrieve items to stock his store with. The game was successful in Japan. In 2000 the direct sequel &quot;&quot; was released in Japan and the United States. The gameplay is similar to the first game, though &quot;Torneko: The Last Hope&quot; is considered easier to play. The game sold enough copies in Japan to allow development of the second direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, &quot;Fushigi no Dungeon 3 Torneko no Daibouken&quot;. The second and third Torneko games have had remakes for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). A later game featured Yangus, a character who first appeared in &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;; &quot;Dragon Quest: Young Yangus and the Mystery Dungeon&quot; follows Yangus on his adventures before he meets up with Hero in the aforementioned game. The success of &quot;Torneko no Daibōken&quot; spawned the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; series that has grown to include franchises beyond &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;.

When Enix took over the &quot;Monopoly&quot;-inspired video game series &quot;Itadaki Street&quot;, the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise became an integral part of the game in its second version, &quot;Itadaki Street 2: Neon Sain wa Bara Iro ni&quot;. The first &quot;Itadaki Street&quot;, released by ASCII, did not contain elements from the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise. The fourth game in the series, &quot;Dragon Quest &amp; Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Special&quot;, included characters from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, and later versions would include characters from &quot;Mario&quot;.

Like the main series, &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot; was originally released under the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; name in the US. The next game, &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters 2&quot;, is the only game to be split into two versions, &quot;Cobi&#x27;s Journey&quot; (&quot;Ruka&#x27;s Journey&quot; in Japan) and &quot;Tara&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (&quot;Iru&#x27;s Adventure in Japan&quot;), named after the main player characters. Each version has slight differences, such as the monster that appear in them. &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart&quot; is a prequel to &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot;, following Keifer who is pulled into Torland and must find the six Orbs of Loto in order to return. The release of &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker&quot; is the first spin-off title to be released in English using the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; name; its sequel &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2&quot; was released in North America on September 19, 2011. There is also an Android title, &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Wanted!&quot;.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; has also produced a number of smaller spin-off titles. In two of them, players use their special controllers as a sword, swinging it to slash enemies and objects. &quot;Kenshin Dragon Quest: Yomigaerishi Densetsu no Ken&quot; is a stand-alone game in which the controller is shaped like a sword, and a toy shield contains the game&#x27;s hardware. &quot;Dragon Quest Swords&quot; for the Wii uses the motion sensing Wii Remote as a sword. Another spin-off title, &quot;Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest&quot;, uses the game&#x27;s popular slime monster as the protagonist, and its sequel, &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&quot;, has been translated into English. There is also a downloadable DSiWare turn-based strategy game, &quot;Dragon Quest Wars&quot; and other titles have been released in Japan for cellphones. &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree&#x27;s Woe and the Blight Below&quot;, a PlayStation 3 and 4 game featuring the gameplay of the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series by Koei Tecmo, was released in Japan on February 26, 2015, and in North America and Europe in October 2015 as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. It later had a sequel that released on May 17, 2016, in Japan, and later came out in North America and Europe in April 2017 to the PlayStation 4 as well as PC. &quot;Dragon Quest Builders&quot; for the PS4 was released in 2016. It later had a sequel release on July 12, 2019, for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. &quot;Theatrhythm Dragon Quest&quot; is a rhythm game developed for the Nintendo 3DS. Like the &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; games before it, the game allows players to play alongside various songs from the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise. In September 2019, &quot;Dragon Quest Walk&quot;, an augmented reality game, was released for Android and iOS mobile phones.

=== Other media ===

==== Novels ====

Beginning in 1988, the media franchise expanded into other media, with a number of anime, manga, and light novel adaptations. Following the success of a &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; light novel, Enix began publishing more volumes starting from the first game in sequential order. Enix published titles from every main series game previously released by March 23, 1995, as well as the first Torneko&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; game.

All of these works have had additional titles published for different games by different authors: Hideo wrote the first four volumes spanning the first three games; Kumi Saori authored ten volumes comprising the next three games; and Hiroyuki Domon wrote three volumes for &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;. Starting with &quot;Shinsho Shousetsu Dragon Quest I&quot; in 2000, a new series by all three authors began publication. The authors wrote new stories for their respective series, three stories for Hideo, nine for Saori, and three for Domon; with the latter&#x27;s works featuring illustrations by Daisuke Torii. Several standalone titles and audiobook titles have also been released.

==== Manga ====
&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; manga began publication in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1989. Based on the world of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Riku Sanjo and Koji Inada&#x27;s was created as a two-chapter short-story entitled &quot;Derupa! Iruiru!&quot;. Its success led to the three-chapter sequel, &quot;Dai Bakuhatsu!!!&quot;, which set the framework for a later serialization spanning 37 volumes.

It focuses on the creation of the series and features series creator Yuji Horii, programmer Koichi Nakamura, composer Koichi Sugiyama, artist Akira Toriyama, and producer Yukinobu Chida.

==== Anime ====
Prior to the debut of any direct &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; adaption for television, elements of the first English-language game in the series, &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, were incorporated into the 1989 DIC Entertainment animated series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, where &quot;Dragonlord&quot; served as a recurring antagonist to both his home-world of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Den&quot; and the greater dimension of &quot;Videoland&quot;.

There are three major television series that were adapted from the games. was produced by Studio Comet and aired from December 2, 1989, to April 5, 1991, 43 episodes were broadcast before the series ended. It was supervised by Horii, with a story loosely based on &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. The first 13 episodes of the series were translated into English by Saban Entertainment under the title &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. Due to its early time slot, it was not renewed. The series was released on DVD in Japan in October 2006, with its nine volumes selling about 90,000 units by February 2007.

A second anime series, &quot;Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai&quot;, based on the manga of the same name, was produced by Toei Animation. It ran for 46 episodes from October 17, 1991, to September 24, 1992. A second anime adaptation of the same manga also produced by Toei Animation aired from October 3, 2020, to October 22, 2022.

On April 20, 1996, a film titled &quot;Dragon Quest Saga – The Crest of Roto&quot; was released. It was produced by Nippon Animation.

A 3DCG movie based on &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest: Your Story&quot;, was released in Japan in August 2019.

==== Virtual reality ====

 (ドラゴンクエストVR) was a virtual reality team-based only arcade-style roleplaying game first released at VR ZONE SHINJUKI in Tokyo&#x27;s Shinjuku district, then later hosted at VR ZONE OSAKA on September 13, 2018, and finally MAZARIA in Sunshine City, Ikebukuro, Tokyo on July 12, 2019, a series of then Bandai Namco-owned virtual reality theme park arcades.

The brief story that&#x27;s loosely based on &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; began with players receiving a request from a king to embark on a journey along with their assistant Ohealia, a Healslime and character exclusive to this title only, who acted as a guide and narrator throughout the experience with the main goal for each team (to which multiple can play at the same time in each of their own sessions, all as a team in one session, or a combination of the between) to fight through a series of battles in increasing difficulty before facing the powerful Zoma, a guest character who is also the main antagonist from the same game and was responsible for terrorizing the land.

Gameplay took place in open arenas (such as forests, caves, and, castles) in-game while players working in teams of four as two warriors, a mage, and a priest stood and moved around in a 65 x 39 foot playing field with each group of players divided into sperate teams. All players were required to wear a set of personal equipment provided by HTC Vive consisting of the headset with headphones and mics all powered by a MSI gaming laptop backpack, and special controllers specially modeled and fitted to represent each class, a small modeled sword and shield for the warriors, and small wands and gloved controllers for the mage and priest. Weapons, armor, skills, and spells were set for each class by default and were determined by each of said class:

*Warriors were the frontline fighters. Players as this class would wielded a sword used for attacking foes in their main hand and a shield used to block incoming attacks in their off-hand. They would engage in melee dealing damage up-close using their strength to overwhelm their foes and could tank damage that would otherwise be directed to their allies. When a warrior was under the &quot;Oomph&quot; spell&#x27;s effect they grow longer in size being able to deal more damage as well as being able to hit more targets with a single swing each attack but also gaining a larger hitbox making them a much easier target for foes to hit.
*Mages used attack spells and a support spell that increased the attack power of allies. Players as this class wielded a staff in their main hand and a special glove controller allowing them to access a spell type selection system in-game on their off-hand. Players as this class would raise their hand forward with the glove to which three magic circles each representing spells will appear in front of them. They would then select one of the spells with their staff, then raising and lowering it to cast the spell in the direction of the target. The spells were the ice spell &quot;Crack&quot;, the fire spell &quot;Frizz&quot;, and &quot;Oomph&quot;, which doubles the target&#x27;s attack power for a certain period of time. Players could charge their spells by keeping their staff raised for a short then lowering it to cast a stronger version such as Crack being cast as &quot;Crackle&quot;, and Frizz as &quot;Kafrizz&quot;.
*Priests healed and revived allies, and used an offensive spell. Players as this class wielded a cane in their main hand while also wearing a similar glove controller in the off-hand. Their spells were cast in the same way as a mage with a different set of spells to choose from, the resurrection spell &quot;Kazing&quot;, a revival spell &quot;Heal&quot;, and the tornado attack spell &quot;Woosh&quot;. Players could also cast Heal on themselves by touch the light at the tip of the staff with their gloved hand, method that was changed from a previous one due to an update (holding their cane up and swinging it down). However, Kazing could not be used in this same manner as they were the only class that could revive downed players. Like the mage, raising the cane for a short time when using Woosh will cause it to become the powerful version &quot;Swoosh&quot;.

Each player given their own class could take only a set amount of damage before going down. If the player was at critical health their screen turned black and white, and if damaged further, they would enter a downed state and would be displayed as a pillar of light on the screen to notify fellow players. The game ended in one of two ways, if all players were defeated to which they appeared in front of the king admonished them for their failure or congratulated them on their success.

Enemies iconic to the series that players faced off against include Slimes, Drackies, Wondering Armors, Chimaera, Dragons, and a large Golem each with their own strengths and weaknesses that players could exploit to win battles efficiently. Each enemy also had their own unique attacks and behaviors.

&quot;Dragon Quest VR&quot; would be discontinued on March 9, 2019, before the closure of VR ZONE SHINJUKI itself on April 1 in the same year, with the experience also ending at VR ZONE OSAKA on October 25, 2020, and MAZARIA on August 31, 2020, on each respective day. Prices for the one-time experience fee was 3,200 yen and a separate facility entrance fee was required. The experience took approximately 15 minutes.

Yuji Horii in an interview with UploadVR has expressed the possibility of future titles based on the franchise being released in or with VR support commercially at a later time and date.
== Common elements ==
=== Gameplay ===

In most &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, players control a character or party of characters that can walk into towns and buy weapons, armor, and items to defeat monsters outside of the towns: on the world map or in a dungeon. However, in the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, there was only one character walking on the map. In most of the games, battles occur through random monster attacks and improving the characters&#x27; levels requires players to grind. The series uses cursed items, difficult dungeons where players need to use their resources wisely to complete them, and difficult boss battles. When the party encounters monsters the view switches perspective and players are presented with several options on a menu; these turn-based menu-driven battles have become a staple of the series. Players use the menus to select weapons, magic, and other items used to attack and defeat the monsters, or can attempt to flee the fight; though characters cannot flee during a boss battle. Once the party defeats the monsters by winning the battle, each party member gains experience points in order to reach new levels. When a character gains a new level, the statistics (stats) of the character are upgraded. Winning battles also rewards players with gold which can be used to purchase items. In addition to the experience points and gold awarded for successfully defeating monsters, occasionally, items will be dropped as well that are added to the player&#x27;s inventory.

In most &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, players must visit a church (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) and talk to a priest or nun to save the games&#x27; progress; in &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, players had to talk to a king to save their progress, though the first two &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles for Famicom use a password save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; features &quot;Puff Puff&quot; – massage girls that the player can hire with text describing their actions in some of the games; it is a pun on a Japanese onomatopoeia for a girl rubbing her breasts in someone&#x27;s face, which can also be used for the general term of a girl jiggling her own breasts. in later games gags were used since breasts could not be displayed. The text descriptions were removed from some North American translations.

In &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot;, several character classes can be chosen for the party members. Each game has its particular set of classes with typical options, including the Cleric, Fighter, Jester, Thief, Warrior, and Mage. All the aforementioned games also include advanced classes such as the Sage. In addition, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; and &quot;VII&quot; include monster classes.

In &quot;Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen&quot;, a new collectible item known as mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed star in the middle, was introduced; they have nothing to do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.

=== Characters ===

==== Monsters ====

The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series features several recurring monsters, including Slimes, Drackies, Skeletons, Shadows, Mummies, Bags o&#x27; Laughs, and Dragons. Many monsters in the series were designed by Akira Toriyama.

Several &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games allow the player to recruit monsters to fight alongside them. In &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;, a Healer monster called &quot;Healie&quot; can be recruited for the first chapter. &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot; monsters can be selected by the player to join the player&#x27;s party and fight in battles. In &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot; players can defeat and recruit monsters to fight in an arena.

The Slime, designed by Toriyama for use in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, has become the official mascot of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. Series designer Yuji Horii cited the monster as an example of Toriyama&#x27;s skills, claiming it took &quot;[artistic] power to take something like a pool of slime and use his imagination to make it a great character.&quot; A Slime is a small blue blob, shaped like a water droplet, with a face. It has appeared in every &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game and it is usually one of the first monsters the players encounter. The Slime&#x27;s popularity has netted it the &quot;Slime&quot; spin-off series on handheld consoles.

==== Erdrick ====
Erdrick, known as in Japanese and in the North American remakes of the Game Boy Color versions of the first three games, is the title given to a legendary hero in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. The first three &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, all connected to the legend of Erdrick, comprise the Erdrick or Loto trilogy. Also known as Arusu, he is known as the hero who freed the Kingdom of Alefgard from the darkness. The chronological order of the first three &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games is: &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;.

In the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game, the hero, the player character, is a descendant of Erdrick who follows in his footsteps to reach the Dragonlord&#x27;s Castle and confront him. In &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, the heroes are also descendants of Erdrick; they explore the expanded world of Torland that includes the continent of Alefgard. Erdrick&#x27;s legend in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series was completed in &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; when the King of Alefgard bestowed the &quot;Order of Erdrick&quot;, the country&#x27;s highest honor, upon the hero at the end of the game. Two of the player character&#x27;s three highest-level armaments are named &quot;Erdrick&#x27;s Sword&quot; and &quot;Erdrick&#x27;s Armor&quot; in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;. Playing &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; with the name &quot;Erdrick&quot; is impossible in the original release, as the game prompts the player to choose a different name for the hero. This is because the status of &quot;III&quot; in the chronological order as a prequel of the first two titles is presented as a plot twist. The Game Boy Color remakes prevent the use of the name &quot;Loto&quot; for the same reason.

In &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot;, the player character is a warrior chosen by the world tree Yggdrasil to save the world of Erdrea from a being of pure evil known as &quot;Calasmos&quot;. After Calasmos is defeated at the end of the game, Yggdrasil bestows him the title of Erdrick.

==== Torneko ====
, known as Torneko Taloon in North American English localizations, is a recurring character who first appears in &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;. A traveling merchant, Torneko&#x27;s usual goal is to expand the inventory of his shop by procuring rare items, often by traversing dungeons and fighting monsters on his own or with his family.

The character&#x27;s popularity with players led to further appearances or easter egg references in subsequent mainline sequels, as well as a starring role in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Torneko no Daibōken: Fushigi no Dungeon&quot;, the inaugural entry of the long-running &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; video game series by Spike Chunsoft. The character&#x27;s other video game appearances include two direct sequels to &quot;Torneko no Daibōken: Fushigi no Dungeon&quot;, the 2016 video game &quot;Dragon Quest Heroes II&quot;, and the &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; series.

==== Zenithia ====
Zenithia, also called Zenith Castle, Zenith, or in Japanese, is a floating castle that first appears in &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;; it is used as a descriptor for several elements in &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;. Its appearance in all three games has led to the games being described as the Zenithia or &quot;Tenkū&quot; trilogy, despite different geographical layouts in each of the three games&#x27; worlds. Horii explained that a trilogy was never the intention: &quot;Each &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; title represents a fresh start and a new story, so it seems too much of a connection between the games in the series. It could be said that the imagination of players has brought the titles together in a certain fashion.&quot;

In &quot;Dragon Quest IV,&quot; Zenithia can be accessed by climbing the tower above the entrance to the world of darkness. In &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; Zenithia has fallen into a lake south of Lofty Peak (Elheaven in the original release), until the Golden Orb is returned leaving the castle able to move freely in the sky. In &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; Zenithia is sealed by Demon Lord Dhuran, and a large hole is left in its place in the &quot;Dream World&quot;. When the Dream World returns to its natural state in &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;, Zenithia is the only part that remains, floating above the &quot;real&quot; world. In addition to the trilogy, a castle in the &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; remakes is also called Zenith, although the layout differs from the castle in the &quot;Tenkū&quot; series.

== Development and history ==
The series&#x27; monsters, characters, and box art were designed by Toriyama. The music for the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series was composed by Koichi Sugiyama. In the past, main &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games have been developed by Chunsoft, Heartbeat, ArtePiazza, Level-5 and starting with &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot;, by Square Enix for the first time. Horii&#x27;s company, Armor Project, is in charge of the script and design of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games that were published by Enix and Square Enix.

=== Origin ===

In 1982, Enix sponsored a video game programming contest in Japan which brought much of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; team together, including creator Yuji Horii. The prize was a trip to the United States and a visit to AppleFest &#x27;83 in San Francisco, where Horii discovered the &quot;Wizardry&quot; video game series. The contest winners Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida, together with Horii, released the Enix NES game &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot;. Music composer Sugiyama, known for composing jingles and pop songs, was impressed with the group&#x27;s work and sent a postcard to Enix praising the game. Enix asked him to compose music for some of its games. The group then decided to make a role-playing video game that combined elements from the western RPGs &quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot;. Horii wanted to introduce the concept of RPGs to the wider Japanese video game audience. He chose the Famicom because, unlike arcade games, players would not have to worry about spending more money if they got a &quot;game over&quot;, and could continue playing from a save point. Horii used the full-screen map of &quot;Ultima&quot; and the battle and statistics-oriented &quot;Wizardry&quot; screens to create the gameplay of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; creator and manga artist Akira Toriyama, who knew of Horii through the manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters to separate the game from other role-playing games of the time. The primary game designs were conceived by Horii before being handed to Toriyama to re-draw under Horii&#x27;s supervision. When Horii first created &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; many people doubted that a fantasy series with swords and dungeons, instead of science fiction elements, would become popular in Japan; however, the series has become very popular there. Since then Horii has been the games&#x27; scenario director. &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was Sugiyama&#x27;s second video game he had composed for, &quot;Wingman 2&quot; being his first. He says it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme. His musical motifs from the first game have remained relatively intact.

The first six &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; stories are divided into two trilogies. The first three games of the series tell the story of the legendary hero known as Roto (Erdrick or Loto in some versions). &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;-&quot;VI&quot; are based around a castle in the sky called Zenithia, referred to as the &quot;Tenku&quot; in Japan, meaning &quot;heaven&quot;. Games in the main series from &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; onwards are stand-alone games.

The early &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games were released under the title &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; in North America to avoid trademark conflict with the pen-and-paper role-playing game &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, which was published by Simulations Publications in the 1980s until the company&#x27;s 1982 bankruptcy and acquisition by TSR, Inc. TSR continued publishing the line as an alternative to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) until 1987. On July 23, 2002, Square Enix registered the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; trademark in the United States for use with manuals, video cassette tapes, and other video game software. On October 8, 2003, Square Enix filed for a more comprehensive &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; trademark, also on August 2, 2016. &quot;Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King&quot; became the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game released outside Japan, all previous games having used the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; title.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was not as successful outside Japan, as it was eclipsed by another RPG series, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Because of Enix&#x27;s closure of its North American branch in the mid-1990s, &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; were not officially released in North America. No games were released in Europe prior to the spin-off &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot;. With the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games were released in numerous markets. In May 2008 Square Enix announced localizations of the Nintendo DS remakes of &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;VI&quot; for North America and the PAL region, commonly referred to as the &quot;Zenithia&quot; or &quot;Tenku trilogy&quot;. With this announcement, all the main &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games at the time had been released outside Japan. The ninth installment was released in Japan for Nintendo DS on July 11, 2009. The North American version was released on July 11, 2010, while the European version came out on July 23, 2010. The tenth installment of the main series was released for the Wii. Nintendo has been a major publisher outside Japan for the main &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, publishing the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game in North America, and published &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot; worldwide outside Japan; the NDS version of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; is published by Nintendo in North America.

=== Creation and design ===

When designing &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Horii play-tests the games to make certain the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, &quot;... little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players&#x27; nerves if the tempo isn&#x27;t right.&quot; He believes players should be able to control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games in such a way that players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles with Horii since &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;, has implemented Horii&#x27;s suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. &quot;[A] lot of the time when he [Horii] points these things out, we cannot see them at first, but eventually you get it.&quot;

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games have an overall upbeat feeling. The typical &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; plot involves the player controlling a party of heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when, and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether they are on the right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced at the beginning of the game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.

While Toriyama would later become more widely known with the success of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in North America, when &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was released he was relatively unknown outside Japan. While the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; hero was drawn in a super deformed manga style, the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; localization had him drawn in the &quot;West&#x27;s template of a medieval hero&quot;. The trend continued through the first four games, although the artwork for weapons and armor began using more of Toriyama&#x27;s original artwork for &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;. However, while the booklets&#x27; artwork was altered, the setting and poses remained virtually identical.

The games always feature a number of religious overtones; after the first &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; game, saving and reviving characters who have died is performed by clergy in churches. Bishops wander around the over-world of &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot; and can heal wounded characters. The final enemy in some of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games is called the Demon Lord; for instance in &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;, the Demon Lord (known as Orgodemir in that particular game) is the final boss, and there is a sidequest to battle against God. The first four &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles were subjected to censorship in their North American localizations, largely in keeping with Nintendo of America&#x27;s content guidelines at the time that placed severe restrictions on religious iconography and mature content. When these games were remade for the Game Boy Color, most censorship was removed. The translated versions of the games have largely followed the originals since &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;.

For English releases, games usually include a number of British dialects, such as Polari and Cockney.

=== Music ===
The majority of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; soundtracks were written and orchestrated by the classically trained composer Koichi Sugiyama. In the mid-1980s, Sugiyama, who was already a well-known composer of television shows, anime, and pop songs at the time, sent a feedback questionnaire from an Enix game to the company, and, upon seeing Sugiyama&#x27;s feedback, producer Yukinobu Chida contacted him to confirm that &quot;he was &quot;the&quot; Sugiyama from television.&quot; Upon confirmation, Chida asked Sugiyama to compose a score for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Sugiyama had previously composed a video game score for &quot;Wingman 2&quot;. Sugiyama stated it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme, and noted the difficulty in adding a personal touch to the short jingles, but that his past experience with creating music for television commercials helped. According to Sugiyama, the composer has between three and five seconds to catch the audience&#x27;s attention through music. The theme and other jingles for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; have continued to be used throughout the series. He went to compose a total of over 500 tracks for the series. Sugiyama was also composing for &quot;Dragon Quest XII&quot; prior to his death in 2021.

The first album of music from the series was released in 1986 and was based on music from the first game, followed by a &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot; album for each game in the main series. The original soundtrack&#x27;s &quot;eight melodies&quot; approach set the template for most RPG soundtracks released since then, hundreds of which have been organized in a similar manner. The original game&#x27;s classical score was considered revolutionary for video game music.

Other compilations of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; music have been released, including &quot;Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1&quot;. The London Philharmonic performed many of the soundtracks, including a compilation entitled &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD-Box&quot;. Some of the soundtracks include a second disc with the original game music, as with the &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; soundtrack. In 2003 SME Visual Works released &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD-Box&quot;, featuring music from the first seven &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games.

== Reception ==
In 2006, readers of the Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; voted on the hundred best video games of all time. &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; was third, &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot; fourth, &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; ninth, &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; eleventh, &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; fourteenth, &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; seventeenth, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; thirtieth, and &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; thirty-fourth. In 2009, Horii received a special award at the Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association Developers Conference for his work on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise.

According to Satoru Iwata, former President of Nintendo, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; widespread appeal is that it is &quot;made so that anyone can play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests.&quot; According to him, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; is designed for anyone to pick up without needing to read the manual in order to understand it. Ryutaro Ichimura, producer at Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world. Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers, while not alienating the more hardcore gamers, is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, but for those who want more there is still content for them to pursue.

Although the series is extremely popular in Japan, the success in Japan was not replicated in North America until the 2005 release of &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;. Despite the first four games to be released in America generally receiving good reviews, Nintendo had to give away copies of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;. However, those four games have been among the most sought-after titles for the NES, especially &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;. It was not until &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; was released that &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; became critically acclaimed in North America, although reception was still mixed. The series gained more universal praise with &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;, and began to sell better outside Japan and &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot; sold over 1 million copies outside Japan.

One of the main aspects of the series that critics point out, either positively or negatively, is that the series &quot;never strays from its classic roots.&quot; Unlike other modern, complex RPGs, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; on the DS retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic. Points of contention are its battle system, comparatively simplistic storylines, general lack of character development, simplistic primitive-looking graphics (in earlier titles), and the overall difficulty of the game. These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various non-player characters the party meets. The stories avoid melodrama and feature relatively more simplistic characters than &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Squall Leonhart or Tidus, a source of contention. There are exceptions, however, such as &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;, which has been praised for its unique, emotional storytelling. Battles are also simple and finish quickly. As for difficulty, Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler. The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included with the intention of adding a sense of tension. Because of this added difficulty, the punishment for the party&#x27;s death was toned down compared to other games by simply going back to where you had last saved, with half of your gold on hand. When asked about criticism of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, Horii says he does not mind, it means the critics played the game and he would rather know their concerns than remain ignorant.

=== Sales ===
As of March 2022, the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series has sold over copies worldwide. &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; set sales records in 1988 by selling game cartridges in Japan within a day and in a week, and it grossed () within a month and by 1991. &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; in 1990 sold out copies within an hour, and &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; sold over cartridges within a day. The series had sold copies by 1990, and units by 1993, with the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; sequels having grossed several hundred million dollars each. As of 2007, all games in the main series, along with three spin-offs, had sold over a million copies each in Japan, with the highest-selling single release (not including remakes) being &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; which sold over four million copies. The remake of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; sold 910,000 copies in Japan in the first four days after its release, an exceptional sales figure for a remake.

== Legacy ==
The original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game is often cited as the first console RPG. &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it the most influential role-playing game of all time, stating that nearly all Japanese RPGs since then have drawn from its gameplay in some shape or form. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said it was &quot;probably the first ever &#x27;Japanese style&#x27; RPG&quot;, and listed the series collectively as number 56 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. They commented, &quot;While never as ambitious as Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, later installments of &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; can&#x27;t be beaten for sheer size (if you only had enough cash to buy you one game that had to last you a month, you bought a &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; title).&quot; In response to a survey, Gamasutra cites Quinton Klabon of Dartmouth College as stating &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; translated the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; experience to video games and set the genre standards. Games such as &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Grandia&quot;, &quot;Lunar&quot;, &quot;Atelier&quot;, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;Rune Factory&quot;, &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;, &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; and &quot;Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom&quot; were inspired by various &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles. &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; class-changing system would shape other RPGs, especially the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and its day-night cycles was also a &quot;major innovation&quot; for console RPGs according to &quot;GameSpot&quot;. &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; &quot;Tactics&quot; system, where the player can set the AI routines for NPCs, is seen as a precursor to &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Gambits&quot; system. &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics that inspired monster-collecting RPGs such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot; and &quot;Dokapon&quot;. &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; was unique in that it made pregnancy, and who the player chose as the mother, a crucial aspect of the plot. The real world and dream world setting of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; is considered an influence on the later Square RPGs &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series was recognized by Guinness World Records, with six world records in the Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition. These records include &quot;Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom&quot;, &quot;Fastest Selling Game in Japan&quot;, and &quot;First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet&quot;.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; is a cultural phenomenon in Japan. According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; has become popular enough that it is used as a common topic for conversation in Japan, and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan&#x27;s national game. William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that &quot;the common wisdom is that if you ask someone from Japan to draw &#x27;Slime,&#x27; he&#x27;ll draw the onion-like shape of the weak enemies from the game.&quot; With the Japanese release of &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot; in January 2009, a new eatery inspired by the series called Luida&#x27;s Bar was opened in Roppongi, a well-known nightlife hotspot in Minato, Tokyo. This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo&#x27;s gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi. The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series: styled in the fashion of a Medieval public house like its virtual counterpart, its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games. It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; also served as the inspiration for a live-action television drama. &quot;Yūsha Yoshihiko&quot; initially aired in July 2011, with a sequel series being produced and released the following year. For its 2012 April Fool&#x27;s Hoax, Google announced a &quot;NES version&quot; of its Google Maps service, which uses graphics and music based on the series.

There is an urban myth that the release of &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; caused a law to be passed in Japan banning the sale of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games or video games in general except on certain days such as weekends or national holidays. When &quot;III&quot; was released in Japan, over 300 schoolchildren were arrested for truancy while waiting in stores for the game to be released. The rumor claims there was a measurable dip in productivity when a &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game was released and although muggings of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles became so widespread that there were hearings in the Japanese Diet, no law was ever passed. However, the Japanese release of every &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; title continued to be on a Saturday until the release of &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot;, which was released on Thursday, August 2, 2012.

&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; music has been influential on various sectors of the performing arts. It was the first video game series to receive live-action ballet adaptations, and musical concerts and audio CDs were produced based on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; universe. Since 1987, the series&#x27; music has been performed annually in concert halls throughout Japan. Early &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; concerts inspired Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s compositions for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. &quot;Lotto&#x27;s Theme&quot; was one of the video game music compositions selected for the opening ceremony of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and was the first to be played.

The series is also represented in the 2018 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; via downloadable content released in July 2019. Unlike most of the game&#x27;s roster, the &quot;Hero&quot; is not a single playable character but rather a character slot shared by four separate, albeit functionally identical, main protagonists from the series: Eleven (also known as The Luminary) from &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot;, Arusu (also known as Erdrick) from &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, Solo from &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;, and Eight from &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot;. Other elements from the series are also featured, such as Slimes and a stage based on Yggdrasil&#x27;s Altar from &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot;.

<doc id="188002" wikidata="Q1131622" url="?curid=188002" title="Lotus Elise">
<text>The Lotus Elise is a sports car conceived in early 1994 and released in September 1996 by the British manufacturer Lotus Cars. A two-seater roadster with a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, the Elise has a fibreglass body shell atop its bonded extruded aluminium chassis that provides a rigid platform for the suspension, while keeping weight and production costs to a minimum. The Elise was named after Elisa Artioli, the granddaughter of Romano Artioli who was chairman of Lotus and Bugatti at the time of the car&#x27;s launch. 

Production of the Elise, Exige and Evora ended in 2021. It was replaced by the Lotus Emira.

==Series 1==
The 1996 Lotus Elise weighed . Because of this low weight, it was able to accelerate 0- in 5.8 seconds despite its relatively low power output of . Braking and fuel consumption are also improved by the car&#x27;s reduced weight. Cornering is helped by a low centre of gravity height of 470 mm (18½&quot;).

Series 1 was designed by Julian Thomson, then head of design at Lotus, and Richard Rackham, Lotus&#x27;s chief engineer.

Besides the standard higher-performance variants listed below, Lotus also released some limited edition models such as Sport 135 (1998/9) with approximately , Sport 160 (2000) with , and Sport 190 (). These were more competent on track with sports suspension, wheels and tyres, seats according to model. There were other special editions such as the 50th Anniversary Edition (green/gold) celebrating 50 years of Lotus cars, the Type 49 (&quot;Gold Leaf&quot; red and white two-tone), and Type 79 (&quot;JPS&quot; black/gold) which refers to its successful Grand Prix car type numbers.

The Series 1 Lotus Elise was assembled from kits on a dedicated assembly line at Proton&#x27;s Shah Alam factory between 1997 and 2003. The drivetrain was imported complete and initially the bodywork was painted in the UK at Hethel prior to export. The Malaysian-assembled Elise sold for double the price of its British-built counterpart due to local vehicle taxes. The Malaysian-assembled Elise was also exported to regional markets, including Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. The Malaysian spec Elises came with a factory hard top, carpets and air con as standard though the air con was unreliable and ineffective. All cars had MMC brakes as that was what was current when the kits were imported in the late 1990s. The Proton-assembled Elises were assigned the code &#x27;B&#x27; in the eleventh VIN position, while the original Hethel-built units were stamped with the code &#x27;H&#x27;.

===111S===
A faster edition called the 111S, named after the Lotus type-number of the Elise (Type 111), was introduced in early 1999 and had the 1.8 Rover K-series engine also used in the Rover MGF. It featured a VVC system providing continuously variable lift and duration on the intake valves only. This technology produced a flatter torque curve from lower down the rev range and a declared , a small but useful improvement over the standard 16 valve Rover 1.8 L K-series inline-four unit. Fitted with a closer ratio manual gearbox and lower ratio final drive, the acceleration was improved. Minor changes include more padding in the seats, headlamp covers, rear spoiler, cross drilled brake discs, alloy window winders and six-spoke wheels. The rear wheels being slightly wider than before necessitated the fitting of &quot;spats&quot; on the back of the rear wheel arches to comply with EU regulations. The 111S was also fitted with a &quot;chipcutter&quot; front grille.

===340R===

In 2000, the 340R limited edition model, based on a Series 1 Elise was introduced. This roofless car was a special edition, limited to only 340 cars being built. The name 340 originally referred to the 340 bhp/tonne (254 kW/tonne) power-to-weight ratio of the original prototype which had while weighing just . However, in production models the 340 refers to the number of cars built. The final production versions weighed and had a power-to-weight ratio of /tonne. A &quot;Track Pack&quot; was created that upped power to and weighed only , thus fulfilling its original power-to-weight ratio promise.

===Exige===

In 2000, Lotus introduced the Exige — a hardtop version of the Elise with the engine from the 340R; as well as different front and rear body &quot;clamshells&quot;, larger wheels, and a rear wing. Many models received an upgrade to with better driveability due to changes to ECU and cam timing.
==Series 2==

The Series 1 could not be produced beyond the 2000 model production year due to new European crash regulations, so Lotus needed a development partner to meet the investment requirement for a Series 2 car. General Motors offered to fund the project, in return for a badged and GM-engined version of the car for their European brands, Opel and Vauxhall.

The Series 2 Elise, project code name &quot;Monza&quot;, announced on 9 October 2000, was a redesigned Series 1 using a slightly modified version of the Series 1 chassis to meet the new regulations, and the same K-series engine with a brand new Lotus-developed ECU. The design of the body paid homage to the earlier M250 concept, and was the first Lotus to be designed on a computer.

Both the Series 2 Elise and the Opel Speedster/Vauxhall VX220 were built on the same production line in a new facility at Hethel. Both cars shared many parts, although they had different drive-trains and power-plants. Contrary to popular belief, the VX220 chassis, later used for the Europa S, is not exactly the same as the Elise S2 chassis, the VX220 having a 30mm longer wheelbase and lower door sills. The VX220 also carried the Lotus internal model identification &quot;Lotus 116,&quot; with the code name &quot;Skipton&quot; for the launch 2.2N/A version and &quot;Tornado&quot; for the 2004 introduced 2.0 L Turbo. Fitted with 17 inch over the Elise&#x27;s 16 inch front wheels, the Vauxhall/Opel version ceased production in late 2005 and was replaced by the Opel GT for February 2007, with no RHD version for the United Kingdom.

Basic S2 models had a naturally aspirated Rover K-series engine without VVC rated at at 5600 rpm and at 3500 rpm of torque.

===111S===
The Series 2 was also available as a 111S model, with the VVC engine Rover technology producing . The 111S Type 25 was built to commemorate the revolutionary race car driven by Jim Clark in F1, painted in Lotus Racing Green with twin metallic yellow stripes running front to back. Unique black Lotus styled six-spoke wheels. The interior includes perforated Ruby red leather seats, door panels and steering wheel centre (echoing the original), and red laurels embroidered onto the headrest of each seat. A Heritage Type 25 ID plate confirms its limited edition status as only 50 of these cars were produced. The UK market was to get 45 and Australia 5. During boat loading one of the 5 was damaged and only 4 sent to Australia. It&#x27;s presumed the damaged car was later sold in the UK. The car is also supplied with hard top maintaining the twin stripes. The 111S models were discontinued in 2005 in favour of the Toyota powerplant.

In 2003 the Type 23 or Heritage Type 23 was built to commemorate the Colin Chapman designed race car which ran from 1962 to 1963. Like the Type 25 the car was based on the 111S and powered by the Rover K Series engine. It was limited to a production run of 50 cars, all of which were fitted with the heritage type 23 ID plate indicating the build number. Externally the car was painted in heritage white with twin parallel Lotus racing Green stripes. Heritage laurels and Union jacks were fitted to each wing, all of which set the car apart. Internally the car was fitted with perforated green leather seats, door panels and steering wheel centre, and green laurels are embroidered onto the headrest of each seat. The car was supplied with a green soft top and hard top maintaining the green stripes.

It is believed that the switch to a Toyota engine was due to federalising issues with the Rover powerplant in the US, however this has been largely unproven with little information released from Lotus as to the exact reasons. As of the time of the switch the Rover engine would still have met the standards required of it for use in America.

Two more track-focused models, the 135R and Sport 190, were available with and respectively. These also came with associated handling upgrades such as Lotus Sport Suspension and wider wheels with Yokohama Advan A048 tyres. In certain markets, the 135R was replaced by the &quot;Sport 111&quot;, which was similar, apart from sporting the VVC engine in place of the tuned K-series.

===111R / Federal Elise===

This Series 2 Elise model comes in a European 111R version or a version sold in North America, referred to as the Federal Elise. It is powered by the all-aluminium alloy DOHC Toyota 2ZZ-GE with a Yamaha designed twin-cam head offering variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust valvetrain and a Toyota C64 6-speed manual transmission. Although the engine was borrowed from Toyota, its tune for the Elise was done in-house by Lotus. Many tests show performance of in approximately 4.9 seconds, or 4.7 seconds with the Sport Package.

The 2005 Lotus Elise was the first to be sold commercially in the United States, in the summer of 2004. Approval for the Elise, however, required intervention by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) which provided a three-year exemption for the car, as it had failed to meet US bumper and headlight regulations. The first-year model suffered from a few flaws, most notably a design flaw in the headlamps that magnified the sun&#x27;s light, allowing the inside of the lamp housings to be melted by the sun.

This model was followed up by the 2006 Model Year Elise 111R and Sports Racer models. Lotus made a limited production (50 in the US) called the Lotus Sport Elise. 2006 models differ from the 2005 models in a few aspects. ProBax seats.

For the 2007 model year Lotus several minor changes were made. The LOTUS decals on the rear of the vehicle, previously flat stickers, were replaced by raised lettering. The headlamp units were sealed. Also, in order to comply with US Federally mandated bumper restrictions, the frontal crash structure was slightly changed and rear bumperettes were added next to the licence plate mount. Approximately 100 2007 model year &quot;launch&quot; cars were shipped to the US without these bumper changes. Also in 2007, the Elise S was released and the 111R renamed Elise R. All Lotus Elise cars manufactured after 1 January 2007 include the new headlights and bumpers, although they are hidden in the front.

The Elise S is the new base model with a Toyota sourced engine replacing the previous models K series Rover engine. The 2ZZ-GE engine produces at 6,200 rpm (a considerable increase over the of the Rover engine). The inclusion of airbags, ABS brakes, electric windows, and carpet in addition to the new heavier engine has increased the base weight to (approximately higher than the previous S model).

===2008 models===
For 2008, there were several additions to the Lotus line-up. There are three versions of the Elise. Lotus continued to provide a naturally aspirated Elise producing . The second version is the Elise SC sporting a non-intercooled supercharger producing . 0– is reduced from 4.9 for the base Elise or 4.7 seconds for the Elise with Sport package to 4.3 seconds for the Elise SC. The NA Elise styling is similar to the prior model years. The Elise SC, however, is distinguishable from the NA version by a rear spoiler identical to the Type 72-D edition spoiler and new wheels. Weight remained a Lotus-claimed ; just more than the previous year. Prior to the release of the 2008 Elise SC, the limited production &quot;California Edition&quot; arrived at dealerships. A total of fifty &quot;California Edition&quot; Elises were produced; 25 in Saffron Yellow and 25 in Ardent Red. The interiors of the &quot;Cali&quot;s were produced in a light two-tone leather (Biscuit) and the exterior modifications included a silver front grille (a nod to vintage-Ferrari), body-coloured shutter grills on the side inlets and engine cover, enhanced 16-spoke wheels, and a large spoiler that covers the upper-rear deck (72-D style). The &quot;Cali&quot;s were intended to appeal to &quot;the lifestyle market.&quot;

In Europe, there are three models available; the Elise S with a , 1.8L Toyota 1ZZ-FE engine and 5 speed manual gearbox (0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.8 seconds, top speed ); the Elise R with a , 1.8 L Toyota 2ZZ-GE engine and 6-speed manual gearbox (0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.9 seconds, top speed ); and the Elise SC with a supercharged non-intercooler 1.8L Toyota 2ZZ-GE engine rated at at 8000 rpm and at 5000 rpm of torque, 6 speed manual gearbox and a spoiler (0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.3 seconds, top speed ).

Several new colour options for 2008 were brought to the marketplace. These include new metallic colours (additional $590) Persian Blue and Liquid Blue; new Lifestyle colour (additional $1200) Isotope Green; new Limited Colour Level (additional $3,300) Candy Red, Ice White, and Burnt Orange; and the new Exclusive Colour Level (additional $5,100) Prism Green and Moonstone Silver. The following colours were discontinued for 2008: Nightfall Blue, Aubergine Purple, Magnetic Blue, Polar Blue, Autumn Gold, Chili Red, and Krypton Green.
== Series 3 ==
In February 2010, Lotus unveiled a facelifted version of the second generation Elise (internal project code name &quot;Anglesey&quot;). The new headlights are now single units; triangular in shape they are somewhat larger than the earlier lights. The cheapest version in Europe had a 1.6 litre 1ZR-FAE engine to comply with Euro 5 emissions, with the same power output as the earlier 1ZZ-FE, . The face lifted model was also available for Model Year 2011 with the 1.8 litre 2ZZ-GE in naturally aspirated form from the Series 2 111R/R and with a Magnuson R900 supercharger making . For the Model Year 2012 the 2ZZ engine was replaced by the supercharged 2ZR-FE power unit that remained until the end of production in 2021. The 1.6 litre version was discontinued in 2018.

===US Model===
The 2011 model was the last offered for street legal sale in the United States when the waiver from the United States Government&#x27;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for Lotus to build and sell cars in the US without smart airbags expired in August 2011. 
It used the Toyota 2ZZ-GE engine

===Elise R &amp; Elise SC===
Two versions of the 2011 model year, similar to the US Elise, were also offered in the rest of world. Both powered by the 2ZZ-GE engine. The Elise R had the 189 hp naturally aspirated unit and the Elise SC was fitted with a supercharged 2ZZ, producing 218 hp.

===Elise S===
For the 2012 model year the naturally aspirated 2ZZ engine was dropped and the supercharged 2ZZ version was replaced by the supercharged 2ZR-FE Elise S. This model remained in production until being replaced in 2015 by the Elise 220 and derivatives.

=== Elise Cup 220 ===
At the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Lotus revealed a high performance version of the Elise called the Cup 220. The Cup 220 is a more track-focused and hardcore version of the standard Elise. It has the following specifications according to a 2015 Top Gear road test:

* Engine: 1.8 litre supercharged Toyota 2ZR-FE Inline-4
* Transmission: 6-speed Toyota EC60 manual with sport ratios
* Power: at 6800 rpm
* Torque: at 4600 rpm
* Acceleration: 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.2 seconds
* Top speed: 
* Weight: (dry weight)
* Downforce: at 

=== Elise Sport, Sport 220 ===
Revealed in November 2015, The Lotus Elise Sport and Sport 220 are set to join the two-seater sports car&#x27;s line-up, with the two models replacing the outgoing Elise and Elise S. The models mark a return for the ‘Sport’ name to a Lotus, with the badge last appearing on the Lotus Esprit. The two cars get a weight reduction of 10 kg, with the Elise Sport now down to 866 kg and the Sport 220 now 914 kg. The reduced weight doesn&#x27;t improve performance but it does bring a marginal boost in claimed economy, with the Sport now managing 45.0 mpg the Sport 220 improving to 37.5 mpg. The changes are marginal enough that the CO2 emissions remain unchanged.

Both cars also come with lightweight sports seats, which are available with optional tartan trim that harks back to the 1970s Esprit S1. Other visual upgrades and options include lightweight silver or black cast wheels, which are 16 inch at the front and 17 inch at the rear. Optional lightweight wheels can reduce another 5 kg from the car&#x27;s weight. A black rear diffuser is standard, along with a choice of 10 colours. Other options include a hard roof, air conditioning, cruise control and an upgraded Clarion stereo system.

The engines remain unchanged. The Sport comes with a 1.6-litre petrol engine with and of torque. It can go 0-62 mph in 6.5 seconds, and has a top speed of 127 mph. The Sport 220&#x27;s 1.8-litre engine can develop and of torque. It can go 0-62 mph in 4.6 seconds and has a 145 mph of top speed. Both come with a six-speed manual transmission.

The pricing has also been trimmed, with the Elise Sport model starting at £29,900 and the Elise Sport 220 priced at £36,500. Both cars will go on sale from December 2015 in Europe and the rest of the world from January 2016.

===Elise Cup 250===

At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Lotus revealed the high performance version of the Elise called the Cup 250. The Cup 250 is a more track focused and hardcore version of the standard Elise. It has the following specifications according to Lotus:

* Engine: 1.8 litre supercharged Toyota 2ZR-FE Inline-4
* Transmission: 6-speed Toyota EC60 manual with sport ratios
* Power: at 7200 rpm
* Torque: at 5500 rpm
* Acceleration: 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.9 seconds
* Top speed: 
* Weight: (dry weight)
* Downforce: at 
===Elise Cup 260===
In October 2017, Lotus unveiled a hardcore version of the Elise called the Elise Cup 260. It is inspired by the two hardcore variants of the Evora and Exige line up, the Sport 380 and the GT430 respectively. It features the double taillight units and rear wing from the Exige Sport 380 and the Lotus 3-Eleven respectively. Power has also been uprated and is now thanks to a revised supercharger. Other changes include increased top speed, acceleration, low weight and high downforce due to added aero elements. The Elise Cup 260 has the following specifications according to Lotus:

* Engine: 1.8 litre supercharged Toyota 2ZR-FE Inline-4
* Transmission: 6-speed Toyota EC60 manual with sport ratios
* Power: at 7200 rpm
* Torque: at 5500 rpm
* Acceleration: 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.8 seconds
* Top speed: 
* Weight: (dry weight)
* Downforce: at 

===Elise Sprint===

In March 2017, Lotus announced the special edition &#x27;Sprint&#x27; models of the Elise. For the Elise Sprint, Lotus used several weight-saving techniques to cut the car&#x27;s weight down to . To achieve the weight saving, some body parts are made in carbon, as well as the seats. The backlight glass is made of polycarbonate, and the lightweight battery is a Lithium-ion model. Wheels are the usual size, but forged instead of cast alloy. The Sprint can be had with either a 1.6-litre naturally aspirated engine, or a 1.8-litre supercharged engine, available for the Sprint 220 version. The former has a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 5.9 seconds, while the Sprint 220 can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.1 seconds. Dampers are uprated, as on the Elise Cup models.

=== Elise Sport 240, Cup 250 Final Edition ===
On 9 February 2021, Lotus unveiled two final editions line-up models of Elise on online platforms.

Opening the range is the Elise Sport 240 Final Edition, which sees the existing Sport 220&#x27;s 1.8-litre supercharged four-cylinder engine uprated to develop and , permitting a zero to 100 km/h time of 4.5 seconds. When fully specified with weight-saving options – namely carbon-fibre sill and engine covers, a lithium-ion starter battery and a polycarbonate rear window – the Sport 240 is the lightest car on offer, tipping the scales in at just 898 kg. A set of 10-spoke forged alloy wheels fill the arches, measuring 16 inches in diameter up front and 17 inches at the rear, wrapped in Yokohama Y105 tyres. Lotus claims the new wheels are 0.5 kg lighter than the examples fitted to the outgoing Sport 220.

The Elise Cup 250 Final Edition features a variant of the Sport 240&#x27;s 1.8-litre four-cylinder, now tuned to produce and . Lotus claims a 4.3-second 0–100 km/h sprint time. This model gets an optimised aerodynamic package allowing for 155 kg of downforce at its top speed of 248 km/h, along with 10-spoke M Sport forged alloy wheels, Yokohama A052 tyres, Bilstein dampers and adjustable anti-roll bars. A lightweight lithium-ion battery and polycarbonate rear window are also fitted as standard for increased weight saving, and, in top spec layout, the car weighs 931 kg.

The last Elise built was a Sport 240, painted gold; it was delivered to Elisa Artioli, the car&#x27;s namesake.

==Elise Concept==

The series 3 Lotus Elise first appeared as a design study alongside the Lotus Esprit concept at the 2010 Paris Motor Show as the &quot;Lotus Elise Concept&quot; in the autumn of that year, and was set to be launched within the next couple of years. The car was heavier than the production model of that time, and had a considerably more powerful 2.0-litre inline-4 engine. The production model was then unveiled with many changes, including the downsizing of the engine to 1.6 litre and 1.8 litre (supercharged) and a different design with little cues taken from the concept.

The Series 2 Exige has been followed by the limited-edition Lotus Sport Exige 240R, incorporating a Lotus-developed supercharger atop the Lotus engine. The US Federalised version with the supercharger fitted is known as the Exige S 240.

===Zytek Lotus Elise===

The Zytek Lotus Elise is an electric sports car that was jointly produced by Lotus and Zytek from 1998 until 2003.

Its extruded aluminium space frame and lightweight composite body shell are factors in its low kerb weight of . 250 nickel-cadmium batteries provide 300 volts (at full charge) to two Zytek oil-cooled brushless DC motors, which deliver a total power of and torque of . These motors are each mated to a single-speed, fixed ratio transmission with an aluminium gear. Its acceleration time from is 5 seconds, and from 0 to is 11.2 seconds. The car is governor-limited to to conserve charge. The range per charge is typically and the car can be re-charged within an hour.

There is an example of the Zytek Elise on display at the Heritage Motor Centre.

<text>WPXN-TV (channel 31) is a television station in New York City, serving as the local Ion Television outlet. Owned and operated by the Ion Media subsidiary of the E.W. Scripps Company, the station maintains offices on Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and transmits from atop One World Trade Center.

==History==
===Municipal ownership (1961–1996)===

The City of New York, which was one of the United States&#x27; first municipalities to enter into broadcasting with the 1924 sign-on of WNYC radio, was granted a construction permit to build a new commercial television station in 1954. Seven years later, on November 5, 1961, WUHF took to the air for the first time. Through the Municipal Broadcasting System, which held the channel 31 license, the city (led by then-mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr.) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) used WUHF as an experiment to determine the viability of UHF broadcasts within an urban environment. Some of the early programming on WUHF included simulcasts of New York&#x27;s existing commercial VHF stations; educational films produced by WNYC&#x27;s Television Film Unit, established in 1949; college-level distance education telecourses; and, reportedly, a nightly rundown of the New York City Police Department&#x27;s &quot;wanted&quot; criminals list. The experiment was carried out through the installation of UHF receivers in several hundred test homes, public schools and businesses, with reception monitored by FCC and City engineers.

After a year of test broadcasting was deemed successful, full control of WUHF was then transferred to the city. The station became a full-time operation on November 5, 1962, with new call letters WNYC-TV to match its sister radio stations WNYC (then at 830 AM and now at 820 AM) and WNYC-FM (93.9 MHz). Though the channel 31 license was classified as commercial, WNYC-TV was operated as a non-commercial educational station. Some of the programming from the experimental period continued, and now included live broadcasts of the United Nations General Assembly meetings. As a municipally-owned station, WNYC-TV also devoted airtime to shows focused on civic affairs, along with other public-interest programs. The station also carried some programming from National Educational Television (NET) and its successor, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), but later increasingly ran more independent educational television programs. For many years, WNYC-TV ran a 15-minute newscast on weekdays, called &quot;News from City Hall&quot; (later called &quot;News City&quot; and expanded to 30 minutes), highlighting the day&#x27;s events in municipal government.

In 1979, Mayor Ed Koch considered selling the WNYC stations to other interests due to a municipal fiscal crisis. Instead, the WNYC Foundation was established as an outlet to raise operating capital for the stations. Though there were twice-yearly fundraising appeals made by the WNYC stations, WNYC-TV did not run on-air pledge drives in a manner similar to other PBS stations, mostly because it was a commercial licensee. It would not, however, have faced any problems had it done so, as WNED-TV in Buffalo, New York operated for decades as a non-commercial broadcaster under a commercial license.

Channel 31 also leased blocks of airtime to foreign-language broadcasters. In the 1980s, among the largest providers of foreign programming were Japan&#x27;s Fujisankei Communications Group, which aired a morning show on weekdays, and RAI, the Italian public broadcaster which programmed two hours on weeknights, and five hours on Sunday mornings, a period which included airings of Italian soccer games.

Also during this era, WNYC-TV joined the music video phenomenonand in the process contributed to the growth of hip hop culture and rap music. In the summer of 1983, channel 31 premiered the hour-long &quot;Video Music Box&quot;, created by station employee Ralph McDaniels. The program started off with an eclectic selection of videos from pop, rock, and rhythm-and-blues artists. Rap music was also included, but eventually the program became exclusive to the rap and R&amp;B genres. &quot;Video Music Box&quot; served as a launching pad for many rap music artists, and was said to have been the basis behind MTV creating &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; several years later. &quot;Video Music Box&quot; would remain prominently on WNYC-TV&#x27;s schedule for the next decade (the show now airs on WNYE-TV, channel 25).

===Transition into private ownership (1996–present)===
Shortly after becoming mayor in 1994, Rudy Giuliani said that he was considering selling the WNYC stations. Giuliani said that broadcasting was no longer essential as a municipal entity, and that any financial compensation would be used to help the City cover budget shortfalls. The final decision was made in March 1995: the WNYC radio stations would be sold to the WNYC Foundation, while the city opted to solicit separate bids for WNYC-TV through a blind auction.
In August 1995, a partnership of Dow Jones and Company and ITT Corporation (licensed as ITT-Dow Jones Television LLC) was declared the winner of the WNYC-TV auction with a bid of $207 million, which at the time was the largest price ever paid for a UHF television station. The sale of channel 31 to commercial interests had many detractors. Foreign broadcasters complained, as they now found themselves without an outlet for their programming, and individual financial contributors criticized the Giuliani administration for selling the station to the highest commercial bidder, rather than to the WNYC Foundation. The foreign producers found new outlets through WNYE-TV, Newton, New Jersey–based WMBC-TV, and the City-owned Crosswalks cable TV network (now NYC Media), and eventually dispersed among the many low power television stations launched in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and currently through various digital subchannels both on full and low-power stations in the Tri-State.

The sale took nearly a year to become official, as licensing troubles with the FCC and the aforementioned complaints from foreign broadcasters would ultimately delay the transaction. Eventually, at midnight, June 30, 1996, WNYC-TV signed off for the final time. Twelve hours later, at noon on July 1, channel 31 reappeared as WBIS (branded as S+), carrying programming from the Classic Sports Network most of the day, and infomercials in overnights. Meanwhile, Dow Jones and ITT worked on their planned permanent format for WBIS, which would offer business news during the day and professional sports news and games at night. The S+ name was designed to mean &quot;sports, stocks, style, and success&quot;, as a nod to the format being worked by both partners. Former WNYW general manager Carolyn Wall was brought on board to supervise the launch of the station in the same capacity. The launch of the new format was beset by many difficulties: initially planned for that fall, it would be ultimately delayed, as business, editorial and creative differences between both partners concerned many station employees.

The new format would ultimately launch on January 21, 1997, at 7 p.m., with a half-hour long introductory program, previewing the station&#x27;s line-up and presenters. It would be followed by an NBA match between the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls, making the first time in 12 years a Knicks game was broadcast on over-the-air television. The launch was accompanied with a big budget ad campaign focusing on the station&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Sports, money, and, oh yeah, life,&quot; developed by Ryan Drossman &amp; Partners (now part of MARC USA), which included outdoor advertising featuring Knicks star Larry Johnson.

The following day, the station&#x27;s business news coverage from Dow Jones debuted. Produced from a street-level, all-digital studio built on the ground floor of 200 Liberty Street in the World Financial Center, business programming ran from 6 am to 6 pm, using the resources of their media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron&#x27;s, Telerate and its London and Singapore-based TV outlets. Programming was tailored to the New York market and featured, alongside frequent breaking news and business updates, as well as weather and traffic reports, heavy emphasis in reporting on consumer advocacy, lifestyle and pursuits. Daily programming was anchored, among others, by New York news veterans Tony Guida and Carol Martin (hired after their controversial sacking from WCBS-TV the year before), as well as future Fox News Channel anchor Martha MacCallum. A half-hour sports-focused business report served as a transition to the daily sports programming, running from 6 pm to 6 am.

ITT, then co-owners of Madison Square Garden (and the teams that played in the venue) with Cablevision, offered team coverage of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, produced by their sister cable outlet MSG Network, who was by then planning a merger with Cablevision-owned SportsChannel New York. WBIS was also slated to carry some games of the New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils, and New Jersey Nets (all of which aired on SportsChannel New York), and in fact did air at least one game from each of the three teams, with production handled by MSG, using both that network&#x27;s and SportsChannel personalities. Some Classic Sports Network programming remained on weekends and on evenings when there was no live sports coverage, and infomercials continued in overnights. There was some talk that WBIS would secure broadcast rights for the New York Yankees, with executives reportedly wanting all 50 broadcast games to boost the station&#x27;s prominence, but that team opted to remain with WPIX (channel 11) for the 1997 season. It also became a &quot;de facto&quot; affiliate of Fox Sports Net after signing a $30 million, five-year, split revenue deal, since at the time FSN didn&#x27;t have an outlet in New York; by fall 1998, Cablevision had converted its SportsChannel networks to FSN, including SportsChannel New York. As a result, WBIS carried FSN programs and events such as Big 12 Conference and Pacific-10 Conference sports, weekly Thursday night baseball games, and &quot;Fox Sports News&quot; three times a day, as well as shows from the then young Outdoor Life Network and Speedvision networks on weekends.

The WBIS hybrid format, though ambitious, was a complete flop as the station failed to attract either viewers or advertising revenue. That spring, the consumer and lifestyle talk show &quot;Money/Style/Power&quot; was canceled due to low ratings, with the station opting for reruns until disappearing altogether from the schedule. In May 1997, ITT sold its share of the station, as well as its half of Madison Square Garden, in an effort to resist a hostile takeover attempt by the Hilton Hotels Corporation, which was already hampering the company&#x27;s fortunes in the run-up to the relaunch of the station (ITT would eventually merge with rival Starwood shortly thereafter). Dow Jones continued to run the station alone, but within weeks decided it could no longer support the losses, as the company was losing money thanks to the decline of its Telerate division, and looked to sell out. After early reports mentioned News Corporation was attempting to buy a stake in the station (making it a &quot;de facto&quot; sister station to WNYW), something that would ultimately not happen, Paxson Communications (currently known as Ion Media), which owned several UHF stations nationwide, eventually would make an offer for WBIS that same May for $225 million, topping the 1995 sale price by $18 million.

The hybrid format was taken off the air in June, though reruns of WBIS&#x27; business programming, some Fox Sports programming, and documentaries from the CBS cable presence &quot;Eye on People&quot; (another network which struggled through its short life) ran in the interim. WBIS would sign-off permanently on June 30, 1997, after airing a video sequence of the station&#x27;s employees saying farewell, accompanied by Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s song &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out for #1.&quot; Paxson took control of the station the following day, renaming it as WPXN-TV, and ran channel 31 under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with a format that featured Bloomberg Business News in daytime and infomercials (from Paxson&#x27;s inTV) and religious programs (from Paxson&#x27;s Worship Network) the rest of the day. The LMA was necessary as Paxson was seeking FCC permission to temporarily keep both WPXN and WHAI-TV (channel 43) in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The FCC eventually granted Paxson a temporary waiver for the purchase of WPXN, which closed on March 6, 1998. A year later, Paxson sold the Bridgeport station to other interests.

On August 31, 1998, WPXN, along with the rest of the Paxson stations, premiered the new Pax television network, with a programming mix of infomercials, off-network reruns labeled as &quot;family entertainment&quot;, and the Worship Network during overnights. NBC purchased a 32 percent stake in Pax in 1999, and as part of the deal NBC encouraged its stations, both owned and affiliated, to enter into joint sales agreements with the local Pax outlet. In New York, WNBC (channel 4) did just that with WPXN, and as a result channel 31 aired rebroadcasts of WNBC&#x27;s evening newscasts. The LMA arrangements ended in July 2005; some time later, NBC sold its stake in Pax TV.

On September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of channel 31, as well as six other New York City television stations and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the World Trade Center towers. When WPXN-TV returned to the air days later, channel 31 was broadcasting at low power from a temporary facility in West Orange, New Jersey. It has since moved its transmitter to the Empire State Building. On May 9, 2017, it was announced that WPXN-TV would return broadcasting from the new One World Trade Center.

In July 2005, Pax TV changed its name to i: Independent Television, and on January 29, 2007, the network became Ion Television. Like most Ion stations, WPXN then ran infomercials until 6 p.m. daily, except for some religious shows on weekday and Sunday mornings, along with some educational shows from qubo on Friday afternoons, and Ion&#x27;s collection of mostly-off-network reruns filling the prime time portion of the schedule plus one public affairs show, &quot;ION New York City&quot;.

====Sale to Scripps====
On September 24, 2020, the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company (which was in the process of selling WPIX to Mission Broadcasting, a partner company of Nexstar Media Group) announced that it would purchase Ion Media, including WPXN-TV&#x27;s license and assets, for $2.65 billion, with financing from Berkshire Hathaway. The purchase subsequently resulted in Scripps divesting 23 Ion-owned stations in 20 other markets to Inyo Broadcast Holdings (which agreed to maintain their existing Ion affiliations as well as carry other Scripps-owned multicast networks), to allow Scripps to fully comply with the FCC local and national ownership regulations; notably, the station portfolios of Ion Media and Scripps collectively would have put the combined entity above the FCC&#x27;s 37% national coverage cap without the divestitures. (Even with the pre-digital-conversion-era &quot;UHF discount&quot; rule – which counts UHF stations toward 50% of their total market reach – factored in, WPXN holds the largest contribution to the national cap under both groups, as New York City has the largest local market share of any U.S. television market, necessitating the spin-offs to keep it as well as the other retained properties.) The sale was completed on January 7, 2021, nearly eight days after Scripps sold WPIX to Mission Broadcasting on December 30, 2020.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPXN-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 31, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 30 to channel 31. WFUT-DT took over the channel 30 allocation as it moved its digital signal from channel 53 as a result of the phaseout of channels 52–69.

===Former repeaters===
WPXU-LD (channel 12) in Amityville, New York, formerly relayed WPXN-TV. This station began operation on or about May 2, 2011. It replaced WPXU-LP, an analog station on channel 38 that went dark some years earlier after its channel was reallocated to the digital signal of WWOR-TV (channel 9). On December 15, 2014, Ion reached a deal to donate WPXU-LD to Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar network.

WPXO-LP (channel 34) in East Orange, New Jersey, relayed WPXN-TV until it was sold in August 2007. It is now a Spanish-language independent station.

<text>The 28th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 25, 1986, at Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles. They recognized accomplishments by musicians from the previous year, 1985. The night&#x27;s big winner was USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot;, which won four awards, including Song of the Year which went to Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. It marked the first time in their respective careers that they received the Song of the Year Award. For Richie, it was his sixth attempt in eight years. The other three awards (including Record of the Year) for the latter single were given to the song&#x27;s producer, Quincy Jones.

Another big winner was Phil Collins, whose &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; LP amassed three wins: Album of the Year (alongside Hugh Padgham), Producer of the Year and Best Pop Vocal (Male). The Manhattan Transfer also won three awards, including two for the song &quot;Another Night in Tunisia&quot; (performed and arranged on the album by guest vocalists Jon Hendricks and Bobby McFerrin).

Stevie Wonder won his first Grammy in nine years for his album &quot;In Square Circle&quot;, after winning fifteen awards in the mid-1970s. While songwriter Jimmy Webb won him his first Grammy in 17 years for his song &quot;Highwayman&quot; (after 1969&#x27;s &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;). Orchestrator and arranger Nelson Riddle, posthumously won for his arrangements on Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s album &quot;Lush Life&quot;. There was one new category, Best Polka Recording. It would run until 2009.

== Controversy ==
There were a number of remarkable wins in the classical field. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s recording of &quot;Berlioz: Requiem&quot; won three awards, while a different recording by the same orchestra won the Best Orchestral Performance award. These four wins were the result of an unusually large number of nominations for the orchestra (12 in total), including four in the Best Classical Album category which normally holds five nominees (the Recording Academy decided to add a number of nominations to this list to lessen the domination of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in this category).

Several sources from the American classical community – including record labels – expressed their dismay with the situation, suggesting that this was the result of many members of the orchestra and other associates joining the Recording Academy in force to be able to vote on nominations and Grammy winners. Despite the controversy, the orchestra&#x27;s conductor Robert Shaw and their album producer (and record label owner) Robert Woods won three Grammys each.

<doc id="188018" wikidata="Q430079" url="?curid=188018" title="Whore of Babylon">
<text>Babylon the Great, commonly known as the Whore of Babylon, refers to both a symbolic female figure and a place of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament. Her full title is stated in Revelation 17:5 as &quot;Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth&quot; (). 

She is further identified as a representation of &quot;the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth&quot; in Revelation 17:18.

== Passages from Revelation ==
The &quot;great whore&quot; of the Book of Revelation is featured in chapter 17:

:: — , King James Version

== Symbolism ==
The Whore is associated with the Beast of Revelation by connection with an equally evil kingdom. The word &quot;Whore&quot; can also be translated metaphorically as &quot;Idolatress&quot;. The Whore&#x27;s apocalyptic downfall is prophesied to take place in the hands of the image of the beast with seven heads and ten horns. There is much speculation within Christian eschatology on what the Whore and Beast symbolize as well as the possible implications for contemporary interpretations.

Caroline Vander Stichele demonstrated that the narrative of the Whore of Babylon follows many of the same patterns of the personification of capital cities as women who commit &quot;prostitution / whoredom&quot; and/or &quot;adultery&quot; in the prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible. These capital cities, representing the states they govern, are alleged to have committed various sins that have rendered them sexually promiscuous, and therefore they will eventually be annihilated through various well-deserved violent punishments sent by the Israelite God Yahweh.
=== Rome ===
First Peter () implies the author is in &quot;Babylon&quot;, which has been held to be a coded reference to Rome. Many Biblical scholars believe that &quot;Babylon&quot; is a metaphor for the pagan Roman Empire at the time it persecuted Christians, before the Edict of Milan in 313. According to Eusebius of Caesarea Babylon would be Rome or the Roman Empire:

Some biblical scholars recognize that &quot;Babylon&quot; is a cipher for Rome or the Roman Empire but believe Babylon is not limited to the Roman city of the first century. Craig Koester says outright that &quot;the whore is Rome, yet more than Rome.&quot;
It &quot;is the Roman imperial world, which in turn represents the world alienated from God.&quot; Some exegetes interpret the passage as a scathing critique of a servant people of Rome who do the Empire&#x27;s bidding, interpreting that the author of Revelation was speaking of the Herodians—a party of Jews friendly to Rome and open to its influence, like the Hellenizers of centuries past—and later, corrupt Hasmoneans, where the ruler of Jerusalem or Roman Judea exercised his power at the pleasure of the Roman emperor, and was dependent on Roman influence, like Herod the Great in the Gospel of Luke.

In 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch and the Sibylline Oracles, &quot;Babylon&quot; is a name for Rome. In Revelation 17:9 it is said that she sits on &quot;seven mountains&quot;, typically understood as the seven hills of Rome. A Roman coin minted under the Emperor Vespasian (ca. 70 AD) depicts Rome as a woman sitting on seven hills.

According to the &quot;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The characteristics ascribed to this Babylon apply to Rome rather than to any other city of that age: (a) as ruling over the kings of the earth (Revelation 17:18); (b) as sitting on seven mountains (Revelation 17:9); (c) as the center of the world&#x27;s merchandise (Revelation 18:3, 11–13); (d) as the corrupter of the nations (Revelation 17:2; 18:3; 19:2); (e) as the persecutor of the saints (Revelation 17:6).&quot;

=== Jerusalem ===

Biblical scholars such as Alan James Beagley, David Chilton, J. Massyngberde Ford, Peter Gaskell, Kenneth Gentry, Edmondo Lupieri, Bruce Malina, Iain Provan, J. Stuart Russell, Milton S. Terry point out that although Rome was the prevailing pagan power in the 1st century, when the Book of Revelation was written, the symbolism of the whore of Babylon refers not to an invading infidel or foreign power. It refers to an apostate false queen, a former &quot;bride&quot; who has been unfaithful and who, even though she has been divorced and cast out because of unfaithfulness, continues to falsely claim to be the &quot;queen&quot; of the spiritual realm. This symbolism did not fit the case of Rome at the time. Proponents of this view suggest that the &quot;seven mountains&quot; in Rev 17:9 are the seven hills on which Jerusalem stands and the &quot;fall of Babylon&quot; in Rev 18 is the fall and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.

Several Old Testament prophets referred to Jerusalem as being a spiritual harlot and a mother of such harlotry (Isaiah 1:21; Jeremiah 2:20; 3:1–11; Ezekiel 16:1–43; 23, as well as Epistle to the Galatians 4:25). Some of these Old Testament prophecies, as well as the warnings in the New Testament concerning Jerusalem, are in fact very close to the text concerning Babylon in Revelation. This suggests that John of Patmos may well have actually been citing those prophecies in his description of Babylon.

For example, in Matthew 23:34–37 and Luke 11:47–51, Jesus himself assigned all of the for the killing of the prophets and of the saints (of all time) to the Pharisees of Jerusalem. In Revelation 17:6 and 18:20,b24, almost identical phrasing is used in charging that very same bloodguilt to Babylon. This is also bolstered by Jesus&#x27; statement that &quot;it&#x27;s not possible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.&quot; (Luke 13:33).

== Historicist and idealistic interpretations ==
=== Catholic view ===
In the most common medieval (Catholic) view, deriving from Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;The City of God&quot; (early 5th century), Babylon and Jerusalem referred to two spiritual cities which were spiritually at war with one another, throughout all of history:Babylon [from Babel] is interpreted confusion, Jerusalem vision of peace. ...They are mingled, and from the very beginning of mankind mingled they run on unto the end of the world. ...Two loves make up these two cities: love of God makes Jerusalem, love of the world makes Babylon.They also represented two principles at war with one another, inside each individual person, even inside seemingly worldly Christian monarchs; thus Augustine could boast approvingly, &quot;...believing [Christian] monarchs of this world came to the city of Rome, as to the head of Babylon: they went not to the temple of the Emperor, but to the tomb of the Fisherman.&quot;

Some sedevacantists believe that the post-concilliar church is the Whore of Babylon.

=== Reformation view ===

Historicist interpreters commonly used the phrase &quot;Whore of Babylon&quot; to refer to the Catholic Church. Reformation writers Martin Luther (1483–1546, author of &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot;), John Calvin (1509–1564), and John Knox (1510–1572, author of &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women&quot;) taught this association.

Most early Protestant Reformers believed, and the modern Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches, that in Bible prophecy a woman represents a church. The connection noted on the seven hills of Rome is argued to locate the church.

Identification of the Pope as the Antichrist was written into Protestant creeds such as the Westminster Confession of 1646. The identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the Whore of Babylon is kept in the &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot; (whose 1917 edition identified &quot;ecclesiastical Babylon&quot; with &quot;apostate Christendom headed by the Papacy&quot;). An image from the 1545 edition of Luther&#x27;s Bible depicts the Whore as wearing the papal tiara.

=== Latter-day Saint view ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) views the Whore of Babylon and its Book of Mormon equivalent, the &quot;great and abominable church&quot;, as having dominion over the entire earth and representing a powerful collection of groups and carnal individuals seeking wealth, sexual immorality, dominion, and the persecution or death of saints. The Whore of Babylon, or the Devil&#x27;s Church, consists of all organisations not associated with the followers of Christ or that are against his followers. Ultimately, the Whore of Babylon&#x27;s fate is to be destroyed in the last days.

=== Seventh-day Adventist view ===
Seventh-day Adventists believe that the whore of Babylon represents the fallen state of traditional Christianity, especially the fallen state of Christianity in the Catholic Church. Other churches (predominantly Protestant) are generally considered either part of the harlot or her daughters. Adventists further hold the view that the persecution of the &quot;saints&quot; in Revelation 17:6 represents the persecution of believers who rejected the doctrines which were introduced by the Roman Catholic Church because they were based on pagan Roman beliefs. The persecution of anyone who opposed the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages, especially by the Inquisition, and the persecution of the Waldensians and the Huguenots are cited as examples of this persecution.

Seventh-day Adventists interpret Revelation 17:18 as a prophecy about the false church, which has power over the kings of the earth. They consider the pope to be in apostasy for allowing pagan rituals, beliefs and ceremonies to come into the church. They consider the Papacy, as a continuation of the Roman Empire, to be a fulfillment of : &quot;For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.&quot;

Ellen G. White&#x27;s &quot;The Great Controversy&quot; (1858) states that &quot;Spiritual Babylon&quot; would have worldwide influence, affecting &quot;all nations&quot;, that the Imperial Roman Empire could not meet the criteria, because she wrote that it only had influence in the Old World. Like many reformation-era Protestant leaders, her writings also describe the Catholic Church as a fallen church, and it plays a nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God&#x27;s true church and that the pope is the Antichrist.

=== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses view ===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, whose early teachings were strongly influenced by Adventism but have since diverged, believe that the Whore of Babylon represents &quot;the world empire of false religion&quot;, referring to all other religious groups including, but not limited to, Christendom. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses literature frequently refers to the &quot;Great Harlot&quot; of Babylon and the subsequent attack on her by the political powers, signaling the beginning of the &quot;great tribulation&quot;. They believe that the empire of false religion has persecuted God&#x27;s people, and that &quot;false religion&quot; has committed &quot;fornication&quot; with the world&#x27;s political and commercial elements, based on their interpretation of .

===View in Thelema===
Babalon (also known as the &quot;Scarlet Woman&quot; or &quot;Mother of Abominations&quot;) is a goddess found in Thelema, a religious system which was established in 1904 with the writing of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; by English writer Aleister Crowley. The spelling of the name as &quot;Babalon&quot; was revealed by Crowley in his &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;. Her name and imagery are featured in Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni&quot;. 

In her most abstract form, Babalon represents the female sexual impulse and the liberated woman. In the creed of the Gnostic Mass she is also identified with Mother Earth, in her most fertile sense. Along with her status as an archetype or goddess, Crowley believed that Babalon had an earthly aspect or avatar; a living woman who occupied the spiritual office of the &#x27;Scarlet Woman&#x27;. This office, first identified in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; is usually described as a counterpart to his own identification as &quot;To Mega Therion&quot; (The Great Beast). The role of the Scarlet Woman was to help manifest the energies of the Aeon of Horus. Crowley believed that several women in his life occupied the office of Scarlet Woman, for which see the list below. 

Babalon&#x27;s consort is Chaos, called the &quot;Father of Life&quot; in the Gnostic Mass, being the male form of the creative principle. Chaos appears in &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot; and later in &quot;Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni&quot;. Separate from her relationship with her consort, Babalon is usually depicted as riding the Beast. She is often referred to as a sacred whore, and her primary symbol is the chalice or graal.

As Crowley wrote in his &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot;, &quot;she rides astride the Beast; in her left hand she holds the reins, representing the passion which unites them. In her right she holds aloft the cup, the Holy Grail aflame with love and death. In this cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the Aeon.&quot;

<text>Hong Pok-wŏn (; 1206–1258) was a Goryeo commander who later served as an administrator of the Mongol Empire. Descended from a northwestern warlord family, Hong Pok-wŏn defected to the Mongols in 1231 and eventually settled around Liaoyang and Shenyang, where he was installed him as an administrator of Goryeo defectors.

Hong Pok-wŏn had seven sons and one daughter. One of his sons, Hong Ta-gu, served in the military of the Yuan dynasty.

==Early life==
Hong Pok-wŏn was born to Hong Tae-sun (), a &quot;toryon&quot; (military commander) under the &quot;Chujingun&quot; system in the region of Inju. He had about 3,000 armed men under his command. &quot;Toryons&quot; were often referred to as &quot;t&#x27;oho&quot; (powerful familities) because they behaved like autonomous warlords.

Hong Pok-wŏn and his father first encountered the Mongols in 1218 when they invaded Goryeo in pursuit of Khitan rebel groups. There is no record of Hong Tae-sun taking orders from the Goryeo court to coordinate an attack on the Mongols. The &quot;t&#x27;ohos&quot; of Northwestern Goryeo were at odds with the central court due to their control over their trade activities with northern nomads.

==Mongol service==
When the Mongols invaded Goryeo in 1231, Hong Pok-wŏn defected to their side with his subordinates numbering 1500 families. He was given the post of &quot;Koryo kunmin manho&quot; (&quot;the commander of ten thousand families of Koryo warriors&quot;). He persuaded 40 Goryeo fortresses to surrender to the Mongols. After the Mongols left, the Goryeo court gave him the title of &quot;rangjang&quot; of Sŏgyŏng, which indirectly acknowledged that they had no real control over him and sought to compromise with the warlord. Hong Pok-wŏn rebelled in Sŏgyŏng in 1233 and killed Chŏng Ŭi, the general assigned to Sŏgyŏng to defend elite interests. The rebellion was defeated and Hong Pok-wŏn escaped to Mongol territory. His father and brother, Hong Paek-su, were captured and taken to Kaesong.

After fleeing, he went to Shenyang where he begged the Mongols to allow him to stay, and they appointed him &quot;kwanryong kuibu koryo kunmin changgwan&quot; (&quot;the Commander of Submitted Koryo Warriors&quot;). He became the leader of Goryeo defectors. In 1234, he was ordered to attack Goryeo. In 1238, about 2,000 Goryeo men under Cho Hyon-seup and Lee Won-ja submitted to the Mongols and were placed under Hong&#x27;s command. In 1250, Hong had a quarrel with Wang Chun, a Goryeo royal hostage sent to the Mongols who stayed in his house. In 1252, Hong assembled his men and received permission to attack Goryeo. The next year, Hong instigated an attack on Goryeo by claiming that the king of Goryeo had no intention of returning the capital to Kaesong. He demanded bribes from the Goryeo court. The court responded the next year with large amounts of silver, gold, and leather. In 1256, Hong took part in the invasion of Goryeo as a commander of Goryeo troops. In 1258 he was executed because of defamation by Wang Chun.

==Death==
Prince Wang Chun of Goryeo married a Mongol princess and started gaining influence among the Mongol elite. He was part of the Goryeo-Mongol reconciliation process that Wonjong of Goryeo successfully utilized to overthrow the military&#x27;s power, and thus threatened Hong Pok-wŏn&#x27;s position as the primary military expert on Goryeo operations. The Mongols were also worried about Hong&#x27;s rise in Shenyang and Liaoyang and hoped to use a divide and conquer strategy to balance Hong&#x27;s influence. The &quot;Goryeosa&quot; provides an account of personal conflict involving Hong, Wang Chun, and his Mongol wife who used her influence to cause the execution of Hong. The &quot;History of Yuan&quot; merely remarks that Hong and Wang Chun struggled for power over the Goryeo warrior defectors and Hong died after losing the contest.

After Hong Pok-wŏn&#x27;s death, the Goryeo people of Liaoyang were left under the control of the Hong clan while Wang Chun was left in control of some 2,000 Goryeo families in Shenyang.

<text>The Arado Ar 196 is a shipboard reconnaissance low-wing monoplane aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Arado. It was the standard observation floatplane of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German Navy) throughout the Second World War, and was the only German seaplane to serve throughout the conflict.

The Ar 196 was designed in response to the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s requirement to replace the Heinkel He 60 biplane after the intended successor, the He 114, had proved to be unsatisfactory. Arado submitted a monoplane design to the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (German Air Ministry, RLM) while all competing bids were for biplanes; the RLM decided to order four prototypes of the Ar 196 in late 1936. Testing of these prototypes during late 1937 revealed their favourable performance characteristics, leading to production being authorised and formal service tests commencing in the opening weeks of 1939. Starting in November 1939, production switched to the heavier land-based Ar 196 A-2 model; it would be followed by several more models until production of the type was terminated during August 1944.

All capital ships of the Kriegsmarine were equipped with Ar 196s. The aircraft was commonly used by numerous coastal squadrons, and as such continued to perform reconnaissance missions and submarine hunts into late 1944 across the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas. Perhaps their most noteworthy engagement was the involvement of two Ar 196s in the detection and capture of . In addition to Germany, the Ar 196 was exported to the Bulgarian Air Force. Numerous examples were captured by the Allies, some of which were operated as late as 1955. Several Ar 196s have survived through to the twenty-first century, preserved for static display; none are known to be in an airworthy condition. 

==Design and development==
===Background===
In 1933, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; looked for a standardized shipboard observation floatplane. After a brief selection period, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (German Air Ministry, RLM) decided on the Heinkel He 60 biplane. This was one of a line of developments of a basic biplane airframe that appeared as a number of floatplanes, trainers, and fighters. Deliveries started in a matter of months.

By early 1935, it was determined that the He 60&#x27;s performance was lacking, thus the RLM requested that Heinkel design a replacement aircraft, resulting in the He 114. The first prototype was powered by the Daimler-Benz DB 600 inline engine, but it was clear that supplies of this engine would be limited and the production versions turned to the BMW 132 radial engine instead. However, the aircraft proved to have only slightly better performance than the He 60 while its sea-handling was deemed to be poor and it did not meet strength requirements for catapult launches. Rushed modifications resulted in a series of nine prototypes in an attempt to solve some of the problems, but they did not help much. The Navy gave up, and the planes were eventually sold off to Romania, Spain and Sweden.

===Submission and selection===
During October 1936, the RLM issued a request for a He 114 replacement; the corresponding specification stipulated that the aircraft would use the BMW 132, and requested prototypes in both twin-float and single-float configurations. Responses were received from Dornier, Gotha, Arado and Focke-Wulf. Heinkel declined to tender, contending that the He 114 could still be made to work. With the exception of the Arado low-wing monoplane design, all submissions received were conventional biplanes. The Ar 196 was a semi-cantilever low-wing aircraft. The design of its fuselage was reminiscent of the Arado Ar 95 maritime patrol biplane. The wings and forward fuselage were metal skinned, while a fabric covering was used for the empennage and rear fuselage. Hydronalium, an alloy known for its resistance to corrosion in maritime environments, was extensively used throughout the aircraft The interior space of the floats was used to house fuel.

Deeming Arado&#x27;s submission to be the most modern and capable aircraft, the RLM placed an initial order for four prototypes. These prototypes included a seaplane configured for catapult launches and stressed to perform diving bombing attacks. The RLM was conservative by nature, thus they also ordered two of the Focke-Wulf Fw 62 designs as a backup measure. It quickly became clear that the Arado was performing effectively, while also being easier to manufacture, as such, only four prototypes of the Fw 62 were built.

===Into flight===
On 1 June 1937, the first prototype, &quot;Ar 196 V1&quot;, performed its maiden flight from the Plauer See. Once its use in the flight test programme had been completed, Arado begun rebuilding V1 with the intention of attempting to set a new air speed record in its category; alterations included the installation of a more powerful BMW 132SA radial engine, a new low-profile canopy, and various aerodynamic refinements to the airframe. However, the RLM learnt of the intention and forbade Arado from proceeding on the grounds of maintaining military secrecy.

All of the prototypes were delivered by the end of summer 1937, V1 and V2 with twin floats as A models, and V3 and V4 on a single float as B models. By the end of the year, all four were participating in flight testing. Testing revealed that, in comparison to the Fw 62, the Ar 196 was the superior aircraft, possessing lighter handling qualities, higher loading, a more rugged design, and better flight characteristics. Both versions demonstrated excellent water handling and there seemed to be little to decide, one over the other. It was noted that the twin-float version exerted greater stress upon the wings, yet, since there was a possibility of the smaller outrigger floats on the B models &quot;digging in&quot;, the twin-float A model was ordered into production. Nevertheless, the two different float arrangements were designed to be interchangeable, along with cushioned ice skis. A single additional prototype, V5, was produced in November 1938 to test final changes.

Ten A-0s were delivered in November and December 1938, permitting service tests to commence in the opening weeks of 1939. These aircraft were provisioned with a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun at the rear seat for defence. Five similarly equipped B-0s were also delivered to land-based squadrons, which were promptly followed by 20 A-1 production models starting in June 1939, which were deemed to be sufficient to equip the surface fleet. While production had fallen behind schedule by mid-1939, the programme was considered to be back on schedule by the end of the year.

===Further development===
Starting in November 1939, production switched to the heavier land-based A-2 model. Intended for the coastal patrol role, it added shackles for the carriage of two 50 kg (110 lb) bombs, two 20 mm MG FF cannon in the wings, and a 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine gun in the cowling. Armament had not been addressed by the original specification for the aircraft, thus early production aircraft had been outfitted largely for aerial reconnaissance missions, particularly for the detection of enemy submarines. The addition of various weapons was a result of operational experiences where the aircraft had encountered enemies and found the absence of such armaments to be less than satisfying.

A small series of fifteen A-4 models commenced production in December 1940. Intended to be exclusively operated from the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s capital ships, changes involved the strengthening of the airframe, the addition of another radio, and substituting propellers to a VDM model. The land-based A-3, which had additional strengthening of the airframe, was produced from the end of 1940 to autumn 1941. The final production version was the A-5 from late 1941, which changed radios and cockpit instruments, switched the rear gun to the much-improved MG 81Z with 2000 rounds of ammunition, retrofitted the existing cannon to the MG FF/M with extended 90 round magazines, added armour protection for the pilot and observer and strengthened the airframe. The A-5 also upgraded engine type to BMW 132W.

To increase the rate of production to meet wartime demands, a license to produce the Ar 196 was arranged for the French aircraft manufacturer SNCASO; by 1942, 30 such aircraft were under construction by the company. However, the quality of these aircraft was less than that of their German-built counterparts, which was believed to be due to the reluctance of SNCASO&#x27;s French workforce. Arado also adjusted their own manufacturing arrangements, intentionally decentralising and dispersing work wherever possible to minimise the impact of strategic bombing. During 1940, Arado proposed an aerodynamically-refined model, referred to as the &quot;Ar 196C&quot;. Changes included the adoption of larger dual floats, which were to offset its greater all-up weight. While testing commenced in Hamburg and production was at one point scheduled to commence in 1942, quantity production of the Ar 196C never occurred.

By the end of production in August 1944, a total of 541 Ar 196s (15 prototypes and 526 production models) had been constructed, about 100 of these being produced at SNCASO and Fokker plants.

==Operational history==
During the war they served under Bordfliegergruppe (Ship Aviation Group) 196 and with seven SAGr (Seeaufklärungsgruppen/Naval Reconnaissance Groups), KG 100 and KG 200, and Küstenfliegergruppe 706, from operational bases in virtually every European, Mediterranean and Balkan theatre of operation. 
All capital ships of the Kriegsmarine were equipped with Ar 196s: 

* The Bismarck-class battleships and each carried four Ar 196s. The &quot;Bismarck&quot; had a very short operational career, the ship was lost during its first operation Rheinübung and did not have a chance to operate its aircraft. During the final stages of the operation, when &quot;Bismarck&quot; was surrounded by British forces close to the Atlantic coast of France, it was tried to launch an Ar 196 to bring the ships war diary and other reports to France. Only then it was discovered that the catapult was out of order because of battle damage sustained in the Battle of the Denmark Strait and thus the aircraft could not be launched. The &quot;Tirpitz&quot; used one of her Ar 196s during Operation Sportpalast with limited success to attack shadowing British scout planes.
* The Scharnhorst-class battleships and initially had two catapults and three Ar 196s. Both ships operated together during the early stages of the war. During Operation Weserübung one of &quot;Scharnhorst&#x27;s&quot; Ar 196s was launched at extreme range to Norway in order to convey reports and orders when the German ships had to keep radio silence at a crucial stage of the operation. Similarly, one of &quot;Gneisenau&#x27;s&quot; Arados brought reports to Norway after a first failed breakthrough attempt during Operation Berlin.
* The Deutschland-class cruisers , and were allocated two aircraft each, but during operations carried only one aircraft which was positioned on the catapult. These ships did not have an aircraft hangar. &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; put its Ar 196 to good use during its raid on merchant shipping in the South Atlantic at the opening stage of the war. The Ar 196 detected on 11 September the British heavy cruiser in time to avoid confrontation, and the airplane scouted successfully for British ships. But the aircraft broke down just before the Battle of the River Plate and was not able to warn &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; of a patrolling British force, which eventually led to her scuttling at Montevideo.
* The Admiral Hipper-class cruisers , and were equipped with one catapult and three Ar 196s.

The Ar 196 was a popular aircraft amongst pilots, who commonly found that it handled well both in the air and on the water. The aircraft became a staple of coastal squadrons, and as such continued to fly reconnaissance missions and submarine hunts into late 1944 across various theatres, including the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas.

The Ar 196 was involved in two particularly notable operations, these being the capture of and the interception of Royal Air Force Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley bombers. Although it was no match for a fighter, the aircraft was considerably better than its Allied counterparts and generally considered the best of its class. Despite this, it was apparent that floatplanes were at a disadvantage to most modern land-based aircraft. Owing to its good handling on water, the Finnish Air Force used Ar 196 A-3s which were later upgraded to A-5s in mid-1944 for reconnaissance as well as supply runs, several troops could fit inside its fuselage.

Two Ar 196s were brought to Penang in Japanese-occupied Malaya. In March 1944, along with a Japanese Aichi E13A, these floatplanes formed the new East Asia Naval Special Service to assist both the German Monsun Gruppe and Japanese naval forces in the area. The aircraft were painted in Japanese livery and were operated by Luftwaffe pilots under the command of Oberleutnant Ulrich Horn. On 18 February 1944, one of these Arados rescued thirtheen survivors of the German submarine &quot;UIT-23&quot;, by transferring them on its floats in several trips.
===Ar 196s in Allied hands===

The first Ar 196 to be captured by the Allies was an example belonging to the German cruiser , which was captured in Lyngstad, Eide, by a Norwegian Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 floatplane of the Trøndelag naval district on 8 April 1940, at the dawn of the Norwegian Campaign. After being towed to Kristiansund by the torpedo boat HNoMS &quot;Sild&quot;, it was used against its former owners, flying with Norwegian markings. At 03:30 on 18 April, the Ar 196 was evacuated to the UK by a Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service pilot. The aircraft was shortly thereafter crashed by a British pilot while on transit to the Helensburgh naval air base for testing. At the end of the conflict, at least one Ar 196 was left at a Norwegian airfield; it was kept in use as a liaison aircraft by the Royal Norwegian Air Force for roughly one year on the west coast.

During 1944–1945, Soviet forces captured many Arados along the Baltic coast of Poland and Germany. At Dassow, a spare parts depot was recovered also. After repairs, thirty-seven Ar 196s were fitted with Soviet radio equipment and were integrated into the aviation element of the Soviet Border Guard. These were operated in the Baltic, Black Sea and Pacific coastal areas, serving until as late as 1955. One Soviet 196 was re-engined with a Shvetsov ASh-62, in case of shortages of the BMW 132, but these shortages did not occur, and no more Ar 196s were re-engined.

;Arado Ar 196 A-2 &quot;Werknummer&quot; 196 0046 or 196 0048
The Aircraft Historical Museum, Sola, Norway, has on display an Ar 196 A-2 fuselage frame raised from the wreck of the German cruiser Blücher in Oslofjord.

Another aircraft is known to lie in the Jonsvatnet, a lake near Trondheim in Norway. A number of wartime German aircraft have been recovered from the lake, but the Ar 196 remains undisturbed as its crew were killed when it crashed there in 1940 and it has the status of a war grave.

A wrecked Ar 196 A-3, believed to be D1 + EH, was snagged by a fishing trawler off the island of Irakleia in 1982 at a depth of 91 meters. It was towed out of the fishing lanes to shallower waters (about 11 meters). The upside-down plane, with fuselage and wings mostly intact, has become a popular spot for scuba diving.

<doc id="188035" wikidata="Q423813" url="?curid=188035" title="Control key">
<text>In computing, a Control key is a modifier key which, when pressed in conjunction with another key, performs a special operation (for example, ). Similarly to the Shift key, the Control key rarely performs any function when pressed by itself. The Control key is located on or near the bottom left side of most keyboards (in accordance with the international standard ISO/IEC 9995-2), with many featuring an additional one at the bottom right.

On keyboards that use English abbreviations for key labeling, it is usually labeled ( or are sometimes used, but it is uncommon). Abbreviations in the language of the keyboard layout also are in use, e.g., the German keyboard layout uses as required by the German standard DIN 2137:2012-06. There is a standardized keyboard symbol (to be used when Latin lettering is not preferred). This symbol is encoded in Unicode as U+2388 , but it is very rarely used.

== History ==

On teletypewriters and computer terminals, holding down the Control key while pressing another key would send an ASCII C0 control character, instead of directly reporting a key press to the system. The control characters were used as non-printing characters that signal the terminal or teletypewriter to perform a special action, such as ringing a bell, ejecting a page or erasing the screen, or controlling where the next character will display.

The first 32 ASCII characters are the control characters, representable by a 5-bit binary number. Because ASCII characters were represented as 7 bits, if a key is pressed while the Control key was held down, teletypewriters and terminals would simply set the first 2 bits of a character to 0, converting the character into a control character. For example, the character &quot;a&quot; has a binary ASCII code of codice_1. This code would be converted to codice_2, corresponding to the ASCII character with id 1 (the SOH Character). The table at shows the ASCII control characters, with the &quot;Caret notation&quot; column showing a caret (^), followed by the character to press while the Control key is held down to generate the character.

If a teletypewriter or terminal is connected to a computer, the software on the computer can interpret control characters it receives however it is written to do so; a given control character can be interpreted differently from how it would be interpreted by a teletypewriter or terminal that receives it. For example, Control-C, received from a teletypewriter or terminal, is interpreted as &quot;interrupt the current program&quot; in some command-line interfaces, and Control-E is interpreted by the Emacs text editor as &quot;move the editor cursor to the end of the line&quot;.

Computer keyboards directly attached to a computer, as is the case for a personal computer or workstation, distinguish each physical key from every other and report all keypresses and releases to the controlling software. This allows the software to interpret Control key combinations as it chooses, including being able to interpret a combination of the Control key, another modifier key, and a letter, number, or symbol key differently from the way it interprets a combination of the Control key and the letter, number, or symbol key without that other modifier key.

== Location ==

The keyboards of many early computer terminals, including the Teletype Model 33 ASR and Lear-Siegler ADM-3A, and early models of the IBM PC, positioned the Control key on the left of the keyboard, whereas caps lock resides in the same position on most modern keyboards. The traditional layout was preserved for later workstation systems and is often associated with Unix workstations. Keyboards from Sun Microsystems came in two layouts; &quot;Unix&quot; and &quot;PC-style&quot;, with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys. The keyboards produced for One Laptop Per Child computers also have the Control key in this location. Other vendors produce keyboards for different computer systems with this placement of the Control key, such as the Happy Hacking Keyboard.

Some users of keyboards with caps lock on the left remap the keys to exchange Control and caps lock, finding the traditional location more ergonomic for using programs benefiting from use of the Control key. Keyboard layout preferences specifically to address this need are available in some operating systems.

Others leave the control key in the lower-left corner of the keyboard, and press it using the side of their palm. The choice of location for the control key often comes down to the typist&#x27;s hand shape and posture.

==Notation==
There are several common notations for pressing the Control key in conjunction with another key. Each notation below means press and hold while pressing the key:

== Table of examples ==
Different application programs, user interfaces, and operating systems use the various control key combinations for different purposes.

In early first-person shooters, the left Ctrl key is often used to fire a weapon. In newer games, the key is often used for crouching instead.

== Similar concepts ==
Generally, the Command key, labeled with the ⌘ symbol on Apple Macintosh computers, performs the equivalent functions in classic Mac OS and macOS applications (for example, copies, while prints; the same holds for saving, cutting, and pasting).

Macintoshes also have a Control key, but it has different functionality. The original Apple mouse design reduced complexity by only offering one button. As the interface developed, contextual menus were offered to access extra options. Another button was needed to access these. On Unix and Windows, the user had other mouse buttons to use. On Classic Mac OS and macOS, the Control key is used to invoke a &quot;right-click&quot;. Apple calls this a &quot;secondary click&quot; as left-handers can choose which side this button is on.

* It is mostly used as a modifier key for key-combinations.
* Pressing Control and clicking the mouse button will invoke a contextual menu. This is a compatibility feature for users with one-button mice; users with two-button mice just use the right mouse-button, with no modifiers.
* It is used in the command line interface with programs made for that interface.
* In Quickbooks, the Control Key is used to validate login credentials during OLSU 1016 and OLSU 1013 errors. Keeping it depressed while sending information to the Quickbooks servers fixes the errors.
* Under macOS, the Control key allows the use of Emacs-style key combinations in most text entry fields. For example, Ctrl-A moves the caret to the start of the paragraph, Ctrl-L vertically centers the current line in the editing field, Ctrl-K cuts text to the end of the line to a kill ring separate from the normal clipboard, etc.

<text>The pnictogens ( or ; from &quot;to choke&quot; and , &quot;generator&quot;) are the chemical elements in group 15 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the nitrogen group or nitrogen family. Group 15 consists of the elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), and moscovium (Mc).

Since 1988, it has been called Group 15 by the IUPAC. Before that, in America it was called Group V, owing to a text by H. C. Deming and the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company, while in Europe it was called Group V, which the IUPAC had recommended in 1970. (Pronounced &quot;group five A&quot; and &quot;group five B&quot;; &quot;V&quot; is the Roman numeral 5). In semiconductor physics, it is still usually called Group V. The &quot;five&quot; (&quot;V&quot;) in the historical names comes from the &quot;pentavalency&quot; of nitrogen, reflected by the stoichiometry of compounds such as N2O5. They have also been called the pentels.

==Characteristics==
===Chemical===
Like other groups, the members of this family manifest similar patterns in electron configuration, notably in their valence shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior.

This group has a defining characteristic whereby each component element has 5 electrons in its valence shell, that is, 2 electrons in the s sub-shell and 3 unpaired electrons in the p sub-shell. They are therefore 3 electrons shy of filling their valence shell in their non-ionized state. The Russell-Saunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is 4S.

The most important elements of this group to life on Earth are nitrogen (N), which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air, and phosphorus (P), which, like nitrogen, is essential to all known forms of life.

====Compounds====

Binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides. Magnetic properties of pnictide compounds span the cases of diamagnetic systems (such as BN or GaN) and magnetically ordered systems (MnSb is paramagnetic at elevated temperatures and ferromagnetic at room temperature); the former compounds are usually transparent and the latter metallic. Other pnictides include the ternary rare-earth (RE) main-group variety of pnictides. These are in the form of , where M is a carbon group or boron group element and Pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen. These compounds are between ionic and covalent compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties.

These elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their tendency to form covalent double bonds and triple bonds. This property of these elements leads to their potential toxicity, most evident in phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of the body, they create strong free radicals that are not easily processed by the liver, where they accumulate. Paradoxically, this same strong bonding causes nitrogen&#x27;s and bismuth&#x27;s reduced toxicity (when in molecules), because these strong bonds with other atoms are difficult to split, creating very unreactive molecules. For example, , the diatomic form of nitrogen, is used as an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be too expensive.

Formation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their five valence electrons, as the octet rule permits a pnictogen to accept three electrons on covalent bonding. As 5  3, it leaves two unused electrons in a lone pair unless there is a positive charge around (like in ). When a pnictogen forms only three single bonds, effects of the lone pair typically results in trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry.

====Oxidation states====
The light pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic) tend to form −3 charges when reduced, completing their octet. When oxidized or ionized, pnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 (by losing all three p-shell electrons in the valence shell) or +5 (by losing all three p-shell and both s-shell electrons in the valence shell). However heavier pnictogens are more likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the s-shell electrons becoming more stabilized.

=====−3 oxidation state=====

Pnictogens can react with hydrogen to form pnictogen hydrides such as ammonia. Going down the group, to phosphane (phosphine), arsane (arsine), stibane (stibine), and finally bismuthane (bismuthine), each pnictogen hydride becomes progressively less stable (more unstable), more toxic, and has a smaller hydrogen-hydrogen angle (from 107.8° in ammonia to 90.48° in bismuthane). (Also, technically, only ammonia and phosphane have the pnictogen in the −3 oxidation state because, for the rest, the pnictogen is less electronegative than hydrogen.)

Crystal solids featuring pnictogens fully reduced include yttrium nitride, calcium phosphide, sodium arsenide, indium antimonide, and even double salts like aluminum gallium indium phosphide. These include III-V semiconductors, including gallium arsenide, the second-most widely used semiconductor after silicon.

=====+3 oxidation state=====

Nitrogen forms a limited number of stable III compounds. Nitrogen(III) oxide can only be isolated at low temperatures, and nitrous acid is unstable. Nitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide, with nitrogen trichloride, nitrogen tribromide, and nitrogen triiodide being explosive—nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a feather detonates it (the last three actually feature nitrogen in the −3 oxidation state). Phosphorus forms a +III oxide which is stable at room temperature, phosphorous acid, and several trihalides, although the triiodide is unstable. Arsenic forms +III compounds with oxygen as arsenites, arsenous acid, and arsenic(III) oxide, and it forms all four trihalides. Antimony forms antimony(III) oxide and antimonite but not oxyacids. Its trihalides, antimony trifluoride, antimony trichloride, antimony tribromide, and antimony triiodide, like all pnictogen trihalides, each have trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry.

The +3 oxidation state is bismuth&#x27;s most common oxidation state because its ability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by relativistic properties on heavier elements, effects that are even more pronounced concerning moscovium. Bismuth(III) forms an oxide, an oxychloride, an oxynitrate, and a sulfide. Moscovium(III) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth(III). Moscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides, of which all but the trifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water. It is also predicted to form an oxychloride and oxybromide in the +III oxidation state.

=====+5 oxidation state=====

For nitrogen, the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5, as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the electrons to be shared almost evenly. Pnictogen compounds with coordination number 5 are hypervalent. Nitrogen(V) fluoride is only theoretical and has not been synthesized. The &quot;true&quot; +5 state is more common for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony, as shown in their oxides, phosphorus(V) oxide, arsenic(V) oxide, and antimony(V) oxide, and their fluorides, phosphorus(V) fluoride, arsenic(V) fluoride, antimony(V) fluoride. They also form related fluoride-anions, hexafluorophosphate, hexafluoroarsenate, hexafluoroantimonate, that function as non-coordinating anions. Phosphorus even forms mixed oxide-halides, known as oxyhalides, like phosphorus oxychloride, and mixed pentahalides, like phosphorus trifluorodichloride. Pentamethylpnictogen(V) compounds exist for arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. However, for bismuth, the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert-pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. This causes bismuth(V) oxide to be unstable and bismuth(V) fluoride to be more reactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides, making it an extremely powerful fluorinating agent. This effect is even more pronounced for moscovium, prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state.

=====Other oxidation states=====
* Nitrogen forms a variety of compounds with oxygen in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states, including +II, +IV, and even some mixed-valence compounds and very unstable +VI oxidation state.
* In hydrazine, diphosphane, and organic derivatives of the two, the nitrogen or phosphorus atoms have the −2 oxidation state. Likewise, diimide, which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other, and its organic derivatives have nitrogen in the oxidation state of −1.
** Similarly, realgar has arsenic–arsenic bonds, so the arsenic&#x27;s oxidation state is +II.
** A corresponding compound for antimony is Sb2(C6H5)4, where the antimony&#x27;s oxidation state is +II.
* Phosphorus has the +1 oxidation state in hypophosphorous acid and the +4 oxidation state in hypophosphoric acid.
* Antimony tetroxide is a mixed-valence compound, where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state.
* It is expected that moscovium will have an inert-pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. This is predicted to cause +I to be a common oxidation state for moscovium, although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen.

===Physical===
The pnictogens exemplify the transition from nonmetal to metal going down the periodic table: a gaseous diatomic nonmetal (N), two elements displaying many allotropes of varying conductivities and structures (P and As), and then at least two elements that only form metallic structures in bulk (Sb and Bi; probably Mc as well). All the elements in the group are solids at room temperature, except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature. Nitrogen and bismuth, despite both being pnictogens, are very different in their physical properties. For instance, at STP nitrogen is a transparent non-metallic gas, while bismuth is a silvery-white metal.

The densities of the pnictogens increase towards the heavier pnictogens. Nitrogen&#x27;s density is 0.001251 g/cm3 at STP. Phosphorus&#x27;s density is 1.82 g/cm3 at STP, arsenic&#x27;s is 5.72 g/cm3, antimony&#x27;s is 6.68 g/cm3, and bismuth&#x27;s is 9.79 g/cm3.

Nitrogen&#x27;s melting point is −210 °C and its boiling point is −196 °C. Phosphorus has a melting point of 44 °C and a boiling point of 280 °C. Arsenic is one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure; it does this at 603 °C. Antimony&#x27;s melting point is 631 °C and its boiling point is 1587 °C. Bismuth&#x27;s melting point is 271 °C and its boiling point is 1564 °C.

Nitrogen&#x27;s crystal structure is hexagonal. Phosphorus&#x27;s crystal structure is cubic. Arsenic, antimony, and bismuth all have rhombohedral crystal structures.

=== Nuclear ===

All pnictogens up to antimony have at least one stable isotope; bismuth has no stable isotopes, but has a primordial radioisotope with a half-life much longer than the age of the universe (209Bi); and all known isotopes of moscovium are synthetic and highly radioactive. In addition to these isotopes, traces of 13N, 32P, and 33P occur in nature, along with various bismuth isotopes (other than 209Bi) in the decay chains of thorium and uranium.

==History==
The nitrogen compound sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) has been known since the time of the Ancient Egyptians. In the 1760s two scientists, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley, isolated nitrogen from air, but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element. It was not until several years later, in 1772, that Daniel Rutherford realized that the gas was indeed nitrogen.

The alchemist Hennig Brandt first discovered phosphorus in Hamburg in 1669. Brandt produced the element by heating evaporated urine and condensing the resulting phosphorus vapor in water. Brandt initially thought that he had discovered the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, but eventually realized that this was not the case.

Arsenic compounds have been known for at least 5000 years, and the ancient Greek Theophrastus recognized the arsenic minerals called realgar and orpiment. Elemental arsenic was discovered in the 13th century by Albertus Magnus.

Antimony was well known to the ancients. A 5000-year-old vase made of nearly pure antimony exists in the Louvre. Antimony compounds were used in dyes in the Babylonian times. The antimony mineral stibnite may have been a component of Greek fire.

Bismuth was first discovered by an alchemist in 1400. Within 80 years of bismuth&#x27;s discovery, it had applications in printing and decorated caskets. The Incas were also using bismuth in knives by 1500. Bismuth was originally thought to be the same as lead, but in 1753, Claude François Geoffroy proved that bismuth was different from lead.

Moscovium was successfully produced in 2003 by bombarding americium-243 atoms with calcium-48 atoms.

===Names and etymology===
The term &quot;pnictogen&quot; (or &quot;pnigogen&quot;) is derived from the ancient Greek word () meaning &quot;to choke&quot;, referring to the choking or stifling property of nitrogen gas. It can also be used as a mnemonic for the two most common members, P and N. The term &quot;pnictogen&quot; was suggested by the Dutch chemist Anton Eduard van Arkel in the early 1950s. It is also spelled &quot;pnicogen&quot; or &quot;pnigogen&quot;. The term &quot;pnicogen&quot; is rarer than the term &quot;pnictogen&quot;, and the ratio of academic research papers using &quot;pnictogen&quot; to those using &quot;pnicogen&quot; is 2.5 to 1. It comes from the Greek root (choke, strangle), and thus the word &quot;pnictogen&quot; is also a reference to the Dutch and German names for nitrogen ( and &quot;,&quot; respectively, &quot;suffocating substance&quot;: i.e., substance in air, unsupportive of breathing). Hence, &quot;pnictogen&quot; could be translated as &quot;suffocation maker&quot;. The word &quot;pnictide&quot; also comes from the same root.

Previously, the name pentels (from Greek , , five) was also used for this group.

==Occurrence==
Nitrogen makes up 25 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, 5 parts per million of soil on average, 100 to 500 parts per trillion of seawater, and 78% of dry air. Most nitrogen on Earth is in nitrogen gas, but some nitrate minerals exist. Nitrogen makes up 2.5% of a typical human by weight.

Phosphorus is 0.1% of the earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 11th most abundant element. Phosphorus comprises 0.65 parts per million of soil and 15 to 60 parts per billion of seawater. There are 200 Mt of accessible phosphates on earth. Phosphorus makes up 1.1% of a typical human by weight. Phosphorus occurs in minerals of the apatite family, which are the main components of the phosphate rocks.

Arsenic constitutes 1.5 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 53rd most abundant element. The soils hold 1 to 10 parts per million of arsenic, and seawater carries 1.6 parts per billion of arsenic. Arsenic comprises 100 parts per billion of a typical human by weight. Some arsenic exists in elemental form, but most arsenic is found in the arsenic minerals orpiment, realgar, arsenopyrite, and enargite.

Antimony makes up 0.2 parts per million of the earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 63rd most abundant element. The soils contain 1 part per million of antimony on average, and seawater contains 300 parts per trillion on average. A typical human has 28 parts per billion of antimony by weight. Some elemental antimony occurs in silver deposits.

Bismuth makes up 48 parts per billion of the earth&#x27;s crust, making it the 70th most abundant element. The soils contain approximately 0.25 parts per million of bismuth, and seawater contains 400 parts per trillion of bismuth. Bismuth most commonly occurs as the mineral bismuthinite, but bismuth also occurs in elemental form or sulfide ores.

Moscovium is a synthetic element which does not occur naturally.
==Production==
===Nitrogen===
Nitrogen can be produced by fractional distillation of air.

===Phosphorus===
The principal method for producing phosphorus is to reduce phosphates with carbon in an electric arc furnace.

===Arsenic===
Most arsenic is prepared by heating the mineral arsenopyrite in the presence of air. This forms As4O6, from which arsenic can be extracted via carbon reduction. However, it is also possible to make metallic arsenic by heating arsenopyrite at 650 to 700 °C without oxygen.

===Antimony===
With sulfide ores, the method by which antimony is produced depends on the amount of antimony in the raw ore. If the ore contains 25% to 45% antimony by weight, then crude antimony is produced by smelting the ore in a blast furnace. If the ore contains 45% to 60% antimony by weight, antimony is obtained by heating the ore, also known as liquidation. Ores with more than 60% antimony by weight are chemically displaced with iron shavings from the molten ore, resulting in impure metal.

If an oxide ore of antimony contains less than 30% antimony by weight, the ore is reduced in a blast furnace. If the ore contains closer to 50% antimony by weight, the ore is instead reduced in a reverberatory furnace.

Antimony ores with mixed sulfides and oxides are smelted in a blast furnace.

===Bismuth===
Bismuth minerals do occur, in particular in the form of sulfides and oxides, but it is more economic to produce bismuth as a by-product of the smelting of lead ores or, as in China, of tungsten and zinc ores.

===Moscovium===
Moscovium is produced a few atoms at a time in particle accelerators by firing a beam of calcium-48 ions at americium-243 until the nuclei fuse.

==Applications==
*Liquid nitrogen is a commonly used cryogenic liquid.
*Nitrogen in the form of ammonia is a nutrient critical to most plants&#x27; survival. Synthesis of ammonia accounts for about 1–2% of the world&#x27;s energy consumption and the majority of reduced nitrogen in food.
*Phosphorus is used in matches and incendiary bombs.
*Phosphate fertilizer helps feed much of the world.
*Arsenic was historically used as a Paris green pigment, which has since been discontinued due to its extreme toxicity.
*Arsenic in the form of organoarsenic compounds is sometimes used in chicken feed.
*Antimony is alloyed with lead to produce some bullets.
*Antimony currency was briefly used in the 1930s in parts of China, but was discontinued as antimony is both soft and toxic.
*Bismuth subsalicylate is the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol.
*Bismuth chalcogenides are being studied in cancerous mice as a candidate for use in improving radiation therapy in human cancer patients.
*Moscovium is too unstable and scarce to have any known practical application.

==Biological role==
Nitrogen is a component of molecules critical to life on earth, such as DNA and amino acids. Nitrates occur in some plants, due to bacteria present in the nodes of the plant. This is seen in leguminous plants such as peas or spinach and lettuce. A typical 70 kg human contains 1.8 kg of nitrogen.

Phosphorus in the form of phosphates occur in compounds important to life, such as DNA and ATP. Humans consume approximately 1 g of phosphorus per day. Phosphorus is found in foods such as fish, liver, turkey, chicken, and eggs. Phosphate deficiency is a problem known as hypophosphatemia. A typical 70 kg human contains 480 g of phosphorus.

Arsenic promotes growth in chickens and rats, and may be essential for humans in small quantities. Arsenic has been shown to be helpful in metabolizing the amino acid arginine. There are 7 mg of arsenic in a typical 70 kg human.

Antimony is not known to have a biological role. Plants take up only trace amounts of antimony. There are approximately 2 mg of antimony in a typical 70 kg human.

Bismuth is not known to have a biological role. Humans ingest on average less than 20 μg of bismuth per day. There is less than 500 μg of bismuth in a typical 70 kg human.

Moscovium is too unstable to occur in nature or have a known biological role. Moscovium does not typically occur in organisms in any meaningful amount.

===Toxicity===
Nitrogen gas is completely non-toxic, but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is deadly, because it causes nitrogen asphyxiation. The build-up of nitrogen bubbles in the blood, such as those that may occur during scuba diving, can cause a condition known as the &quot;bends&quot; (decompression sickness). Many nitrogen compounds such as hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen-based explosives are also highly dangerous.

White phosphorus, an allotrope of phosphorus, is toxic, with 1 mg per kg bodyweight being a lethal dose. White phosphorus usually kills humans within a week of ingestion by attacking the liver. Breathing in phosphorus in its gaseous form can cause an industrial disease called &quot;phossy jaw&quot;, which eats away the jawbone. White phosphorus is also highly flammable. Some organophosphorus compounds can fatally block certain enzymes in the human body.

Elemental arsenic is toxic, as are many of its inorganic compounds; however some of its organic compounds can promote growth in chickens. The lethal dose of arsenic for a typical adult is 200 mg and can cause diarrhea, vomiting, colic, dehydration, and coma. Death from arsenic poisoning typically occurs within a day.

Antimony is mildly toxic. Additionally, wine steeped in antimony containers can induce vomiting. When taken in large doses, antimony causes vomiting in a victim, who then appears to recover before dying several days later. Antimony attaches itself to certain enzymes and is difficult to dislodge. Stibine, or SbH3, is far more toxic than pure antimony.

Bismuth itself is largely non-toxic, although consuming too much of it can damage the liver. Only one person has ever been reported to have died from bismuth poisoning. However, consumption of soluble bismuth salts can turn a person&#x27;s gums black.

Moscovium is too unstable to conduct any toxicity chemistry.

<doc id="188038" wikidata="Q435267" url="?curid=188038" title="Christine Todd Whitman">
<text>Christine Temple Whitman (; born September 26, 1946) is an American politician and author who served as the 50th governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001 and as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003. , Whitman is the only woman to have served as governor of New Jersey.

Born in New York City to a Republican political family, Whitman graduated from Wheaton College in 1968 and began her political career in the Nixon administration&#x27;s Office of Economic Opportunity. After coming within three percentage points of unseating U.S. Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, she ran for governor of New Jersey, defeating Democratic incumbent Jim Florio. A self-described Rockefeller Republican, Whitman defeated Democrat Jim McGreevey to win re-election in 1997. She remained governor until stepping down in 2001 to become Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, where she served until 2003. During her tenure at the EPA, Whitman was noted for having assured the public that the air in lower Manhattan was safe to breathe following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; she apologized in 2016 for having made this statement.

In 2022, Whitman joined former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang to form the Forward Party, a centrist third party.

==Early life, family, and education==
Christine Todd Whitman was born Christine Temple Todd in New York City on September 26, 1946. Her mother was Eleanor Prentice Todd (née Schley) and her father businessman Webster B. Todd. Both the Todds and the Schleys were wealthy and prominent New Jersey political families. The Schleys were among the first New Yorkers to move to the area that later became Far Hills, New Jersey, which became a popular suburb for wealthy, moderate Republicans. Webster B. Todd amassed a fortune as a building contractor on projects including Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. He used his wealth to donate to Republican politicians and became an advisor to Dwight D. Eisenhower and chaired the New Jersey Republican State Committee twice. Eleanor Prentice Todd served as a Republican national committeewoman, led the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women, and served as vice chair of the Republican National Committee. Eleanor Prentice Todd&#x27;s political activity caused a newspaper to speculate that she could be a viable candidate for governor, although she never chose to run for office.

Christine Todd grew up on her family&#x27;s farm, Pontefract, in Oldwick, New Jersey. She had three older siblings, including brothers Webster and Danny. At the age of nine, she attended the 1956 Republican National Convention and met President Eisenhower. As a child, Todd attended Far Hills Country Day School before being sent to boarding school at Foxcroft in Virginia. Todd disliked being so far away from home and after a year, she transferred to the Chapin School in Manhattan, allowing her to return home on the weekends.

After graduating from Wheaton College in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government, Todd worked for Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s presidential campaign.

== Early career ==
Christine Todd married John Whitman in 1974. Christine Todd Whitman worked for the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Republican National Committee.

Whitman served on the board of trustees of Somerset County College (later renamed Raritan Valley Community College). Elected to two terms on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders, she served for five-and-one-half years beginning in 1983. From 1988 to 1990, during the tenure of Gov. Thomas Kean, she served as president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.

In 1990, Whitman ran for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Bill Bradley, losing a close election. She was considered an underdog against the popular Bradley, but performed better than expected despite being outspent 12-to-one. Her performance endeared her to the party base and made her the leading public advocate of the anti-tax cause.

Whitman continued to build her profile by founding a political action committee, the Committee for an Affordable New Jersey, through which she campaigned for Republican candidates in the 1991 midterm elections. Whitman took on a full campaign speaking schedule through October 1992.

In 1993, Whitman helped to found the Committee for Responsible Government, an advocacy group espousing moderate positions in the Republican Party. In 1997, the group renamed itself the Republican Leadership Council.

== Governor of New Jersey ==

===Elections===
====1993====

After winning a Republican primary, Whitman ran against incumbent James Florio for governor of New Jersey in the 1993 general election. Whitman won the election by a plurality, defeating Florio by one percentage point to become the first female governor in New Jersey history. , she is the only woman to have served as governor of New Jersey.

Charges of suppression of minority votes were raised during Whitman&#x27;s 1993 campaign. Two days after the election, Ed Rollins, Whitman&#x27;s campaign manager, bragged about having spent $500,000 to suppress the black vote. Whitman denied Rollins&#x27;s claim and demanded an apology and a retraction. An investigation into Rollins&#x27;s claim found no wrongdoing.

====1997====

Whitman was re-elected in 1997, narrowly defeating Democrat Jim McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge Township. Whitman again prevailed by a one-point margin and received a plurality of the votes. Murray Sabrin, a college professor who ran as a Libertarian candidate, finished third with five percent of the vote.

===Tenure===
During her tenure, Whitman was described as a Rockefeller Republican, as a liberal Republican, and as a moderate Republican. In 1995, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; called Whitman &quot;an East Coast blue blood, a woman who grew up in the horse country of New Jersey and attended some of the nation&#x27;s most exclusive private schools&quot;. The &quot;Post&quot; added, &quot;At a time when the party&#x27;s base has moved to the South, the West, the working class and the religious right, Whitman is a throwback with roots in the patrician Republican politics of three and four decades ago&quot;. Whitman &quot;freely calls herself a pro-choice, Rockefeller Republican&quot;.

Whitman pledged during the 1993 campaign that she would lower state taxes by 10% a year for three years. Once in office, she kept the campaign promise, and lowered income taxes. The decline in the tax burden made it likely that the issue of tax revenue shortfall would be addressed later. Jim Saxton, in a report to the federal congress, argued that New Jersey&#x27;s income tax cuts improved &quot;the well-being of the New Jersey family&quot;, and would not lead to an increase in property taxes.

In 1995, Whitman was criticized for saying that young African-American males sometimes played a game known as &quot;jewels in the crown&quot;, which she claimed had as its intent having as many children as possible out of wedlock. Whitman subsequently apologized and voiced her opposition to attempts by Congressional Republicans to bar unwed teenage mothers from receiving welfare payments.

Also in 1995, the Republican Party selected Whitman to deliver the party&#x27;s State of the Union response. She became the first woman to deliver a State of the Union response by herself; her speech was also the first State of the Union response given to a live audience.

In 1996, Whitman rejected a recommendation from the Governor&#x27;s Council on AIDS to spend tax money on a needle exchange to reduce incidence of HIV infections.

In 1997, Whitman repealed the one percentage-point increase to the state sales tax that her predecessor Governor Florio had imposed, reducing the rate from 7% to 6%, instituted education reforms, and removed excise taxes on professional wrestling, which led the World Wrestling Federation to resume events in New Jersey. As a result, she was made honorary WWF Champion and awarded a replica belt by Gorilla Monsoon at that year&#x27;s SummerSlam pay-per-view.

In 1999, Whitman vetoed a ban on partial birth abortion. Her veto was overridden, but the statute was subsequently declared unconstitutional by the judiciary.

In 1999, Whitman fired Colonel Carl A. Williams, head of the New Jersey State Police, after he was quoted as saying that cocaine and marijuana traffickers were often members of minority groups, while the methamphetamine trade was controlled primarily by white biker gangs.

When Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg announced that he would not seek re-election in 2000, Whitman considered running for U.S. Senate, but ultimately decided against it.

Whitman resigned from office on January 31, 2001, to become administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

=== Cabinet and administration ===
== Vice presidential speculation ==
Whitman was mentioned as a potential Republican vice presidential candidate in 1996.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Whitman &quot;seemed to be on a short list of vice presidential candidates in 2000, right up until July 8, 2000 – days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia – when a four-year-old photograph surfaced showing an oddly smiling Governor Whitman, surrounded by law enforcement agents, frisking a black drug suspect on a street in Camden&quot;. In 1996, Whitman had joined a New Jersey State Police patrol in Camden, New Jersey. During the patrol, the officers stopped a 16-year-old African American male named Sherron Rolax and frisked him. The police did not find any contraband on Rolax&#x27;s person, but Whitman frisked the youth as well. A state trooper photographed the act. In 2000, the image of the smiling governor frisking Rolax was published in newspapers statewide, drawing criticism from civil rights leaders who saw the incident as a violation of Rolax&#x27;s civil rights and an endorsement of racial profiling by Whitman (especially since Rolax was not arrested or charged). Whitman later told the press that she regretted the incident, and pointed to her efforts in 1999 to oppose the New Jersey State Police force&#x27;s racial profiling practices.

Ultimately, then-Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush selected Dick Cheney as his running mate in the 2000 presidential election.

== EPA Administrator ==

Whitman was appointed by President George W. Bush as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, taking office on January 31, 2001.

In the final weeks of the Clinton administration in January 2001, the administration ratified a new drinking water standard of 0.01 mg/L (10 parts per billion, or ppb) of arsenic, to take effect in January 2006. The old drinking water standard of 0.05 mg/L (equal to 50 ppb) arsenic had been in effect since 1942, and the EPA, since the late 1980s, had weighed the pros and cons of lowering the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of arsenic. The incoming Bush administration suspended the midnight regulation, but after months of research, the EPA approved the new 10 ppb arsenic standard to take effect in January 2006 as initially planned.

In 2001, the EPA produced a report detailing the expected effects of global warming in each state in the country. President Bush dismissed the report as the work of &quot;the bureaucracy.&quot;

=== Post 9/11 air quality claims controversy ===

After the September 11 attacks in New York City, she appeared there twice to inform New Yorkers that the toxins released by the attacks posed no threat to their health. On September 18, the EPA released a report in which Whitman said, &quot;Given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink.&quot; She also said, &quot;The concentrations are such that they don&#x27;t pose a health hazard...We&#x27;re going to make sure everybody is safe.&quot;

However, a 2003 report by the EPA&#x27;s Inspector General determined that the assurance was misleading, because the EPA &quot;did not have sufficient data and analyses&quot; to justify it.
A July 2003 report from the EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response provided extensive documentation supporting many of the inspector general&#x27;s conclusions. The report further found that the White House had &quot;convinced EPA to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones&quot; by having the National Security Council control EPA communications after the September 11 attacks. On June 27, 2003, after having several public conflicts with the Bush administration, Whitman resigned.

In December 2006, legal proceedings began on the responsibility of government officials in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Whitman was among the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that Whitman was at fault for saying that the downtown New York air was safe in the aftermath of the attacks.

On April 20, 2007, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Whitman and other EPA officials could not be held liable for saying that the air was safe to breathe. The panel &quot;reasoned that the government&#x27;s interest in returning New York to normalcy following the attacks should protect it from lawsuits alleging that the government made false statements about air quality.&quot;
In an interview in 2007, Whitman stated that Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s insistence on easing air pollution controls, not the personal reasons she cited at the time, led to her resignation. At the time, Cheney pushed the EPA to institute a new rule allowing power plants to make major alterations without installing costly new pollution controls. Whitman stepped down in protest against such demand by the White House, she said. She decided that because she did not agree with the rule, she would not be able to defend it if it were to be challenged in a legal action. The federal court eventually overturned the rule on the ground that it violated the Clean Air Act.

In 2016, Whitman apologized for the first time for her declaration a week after 9/11 that the air in lower Manhattan was safe to breathe.

== Post-government career ==


=== Political activism ===
In early 2005, Whitman released a book entitled &quot;It&#x27;s My Party, Too: Taking Back the Republican Party... And Bringing the Country Together Again&quot; in which she criticized the policies of the George W. Bush administration and its electoral strategy:

The last chapter of that book, entitled &quot;A Time for Radical Moderates&quot;, speaks to radical centrists across the political spectrum. The same year as her book was released, Whitman formed a political action committee called It&#x27;s My Party Too (IMP-PAC), to assist electoral campaigns of moderate Republicans at all levels of government. After the 2006 midterm elections, IMP-PAC was merged into RLC-PAC, the Republican Leadership Council&#x27;s PAC.

Whitman &quot;is co-founder and president of The Whitman Strategy Group, a consulting firm specializing in government relations, and environmental and energy issues&quot;.

In 2011, Whitman was named to the board of Americans Elect.

In February 2013, Whitman supported legal recognition of same-sex marriage in an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court.

As of 2015, Whitman is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. The group, which included 100 other former elected officials advocated for campaign finance reform.

In 2016, Whitman was named the co-chair of the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative.

On February 26, 2016, she endorsed John Kasich in his bid seeking the GOP nomination for presidential candidate. She said that Donald Trump was using &quot;fascist&quot; tactics in his campaign and after Chris Christie&#x27;s endorsement of Trump said that, in the case of a Trump nomination by the GOP, she would vote for Hillary Clinton. In 2018, Whitman wrote an op-ed calling Trump unfit for office and urging other Republicans to pressure him to step down.

In February 2020, Whitman endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld for president in the Republican primaries, in which he was challenging incumbent president Donald Trump. Whitman spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, endorsing Democratic nominee Joe Biden over Republican nominee Donald Trump in the general election.

Whitman co-founded the States United Democracy Center in 2021. and, as of 2022, serves as its co-chair. In her States United capacity, she was among the former state officials who submitted testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol, arguing that the attack was part of &quot;a sustained and coordinated effort by the former president and his anti-democracy allies to suppress voting rights, delegitimize free and fair elections, and subvert the will of the voters by overturning election results deemed undesirable to their movement.&quot; In July 2022, Whitman was among three former Republican governors who submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the court to uphold provisions of the federal Voting Rights Acts of 1965 that protect minority voters from having their voting power diluted.

In 2022, Whitman joined former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang to create the Forward Party, a centrist third party.

=== Corporate activity ===
As of 2008, Whitman served on the board of directors of Texas Instruments and United Technologies. Whitman is also co-chair of the CASEnergy Coalition, and in 2007, voiced support for a stronger future role of nuclear power in the United States. Whitman joined the board of the American Security Project in April 2010; by 2015, she served as chairperson of its board of directors.

== Personal life ==
At a 1973 inaugural ball for Richard Nixon, Christine had her first date with John R. Whitman (1944–2015), an old friend she had met while a student at Chapin. The pair married the next year. Whitman was a businessman and an investment banker; he was also the grandson of early 20th-century Governor of New York Charles S. Whitman.

While governor, Whitman used Pontefract, the family farm on which she was raised, as her primary residence. Whitman had purchased the property in 1991 following the death of her mother.

John Whitman died on July 2, 2015, at age 71 following a June 2015 head injury. With her late husband, Whitman had two children: daughter Kate and son Taylor. Kate Whitman has followed her mother into politics, including an unsuccessful run for the U.S. House of Representatives and having worked as a congressional aide. In 2007, Kate Whitman was named executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, her mother&#x27;s organization which promotes moderate Republicanism. Whitman has seven grandchildren.

Whitman has been a resident of Tewksbury Township, New Jersey.

<text>Alan Civil OBE (13 June 1929 – 19 March 1989) was a British horn player.

Civil began to play the horn at a young age, and joined the famous Royal Artillery Band and Orchestra at Woolwich, while still in his teens. He studied the instrument under Aubrey Brain, father of Dennis Brain in 1943, and later with Willy von Stemm in Hamburg.

Civil was engaged by Thomas Beecham to play second horn to Dennis Brain in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and when Brain left for the Philharmonia, Civil took over leadership of the section. In 1955, Civil joined the Philharmonia himself, becoming principal horn player when Brain died in a car crash in 1957.

In the 1960s, Civil became the first non-German to be approached by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra to become a member. Civil stuck with the Philharmonia however, who were reshaping themselves into the New Philharmonia. In 1966 he became principal horn of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, remaining there until his retirement in 1988.

As a soloist, Civil recorded the horn concertos of Mozart (with the Philharmonia, under Otto Klemperer, 1960), and his recording of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; with Robert Tear is also quite well known. He also played chamber music in the Alan Civil Horn Trio.

As well as his work in classical music, Civil played the horn solo on The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;For No One&quot; from the album &quot;Revolver&quot; and was one of only five session musicians to get a named credit on a Beatles recording.
Civil was also part of the orchestra crescendo in the song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; from the album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.
Civil taught at the Royal College of Music. Among his pupils is Timothy Brown. He was appointed
President of the British Horn Society in 1979, and was awarded an OBE in 1985. 

Civil died of liver and kidney failure on 19 March 1989 at King&#x27;s College Hospital in London. He was 59 years old.

Cartoonist Tom Armstrong debuted the seven-days-weekly comic strip &quot;Marvin&quot; on Sunday, August 1, 1982. Originally distributed by North America Syndicate, it later went through Hearst&#x27;s King Features Syndicate. (There was an earlier strip named &quot;Marvin&quot;, which was created by Pat Moran and syndicated in 1973.) The strip revolves around the life and times of a young baby boy named Marvin, along with his parents, Jeff and Jenny Miller, and their dog Bitsy.

On March 10, 1989, CBS aired a half-hour animated special, &quot;Marvin, Baby of the Year&quot;. It has never been released on home video.

The location is not explicitly defined. In 2012, in honor of the strip&#x27;s 30th anniversary, it spoofed &quot;Back to the Future&quot; where baby Marvin meets himself as a full-grown man. The 30-something Marvin tells his baby self what awaits for him.

A few flashback episodes showed Marvin as an unborn fetus, in imitation of &quot;Eggbert&quot;, a strip by LAF.

===Recurring characters===
Other major characters include Megan, Marvin&#x27;s cousin; Janet, who is Megan&#x27;s mother and Jenny&#x27;s sister; Ming Ming, Janet&#x27;s adopted daughter from China; Bea and Roy, Marvin&#x27;s maternal grandparents; and Doris, Marvin&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Megan&#x27;s father has not been seen (the strip indicates Megan&#x27;s parents are divorced). Minor characters have included Bea and Roy&#x27;s toy schnauzer named Junior; Roy&#x27;s friend Bernie; and Marvin&#x27;s friends Jordan, Warren (who is a genius, with a 174 IQ), Kyle, Gerald and Will, a child prodigy who spelled &quot;prodigy&quot; at five months. Jeff has a macho friend, Ted who in June 2024 dated Janet. Jordan has a girlfriend Shillina. Marvin&#x27;s goldfish are Finn and Gill. As of 2022 Jordan has a baby sister Lici. Marvin&#x27;s paternal grandfather has a cat named Clawfull. As of 2024 Marvin has a classmate named Wayne Johnson who can lift heavy things.

Prior to 2013 the strip&#x27;s name was simply &quot;Marvin&quot;.

==Plot==
===Continuity===
Continuity is similar to that of &quot;Garfield&quot; in that milestone events affect future storylines but dramatic events occurring in one day&#x27;s strip may be ignored in the next: in the strip that ran on October 4, 1982, Marvin shaves his head with his father&#x27;s electric razor, but the next day his hair is back to normal. The strip&#x27;s characters age irregularly, as is common in comics and other media (see soap opera rapid aging syndrome). Marvin is identified as less than 1 year old in the December 16, 1999 strip, where he states it is his first Christmas, but in later strips he states he is two years old. He learned to walk all at once on July 16, 2003.

In earlier strips, the baby characters did not speak, save for occasional crying, but were capable of understanding each other telepathically, an ability seemingly lost by adulthood. Animals shared this power to communicate without spoken words, communicating both with each other and with the babies.

Early strips often featured puns; in later strips, much of the humor comes from the babies&#x27; limited understanding of the world around them. For example, Marvin wonders about an approaching winter by thinking to himself &quot;Why is now the time when people put their clothes on...&quot; then looking out the window at a tree with shedding leaves &quot;...And trees take theirs off&quot;.

===Suspension of disbelief===
Events in &quot;Marvin&quot; are portrayed as real, no matter how fantastic; there is never a story in which a baby&#x27;s dramatic experiences are shown in the end to be ordinary happenings when seen by an adult&#x27;s wiser eyes. These storyline elements include the frequent appearance of Santa Claus around Christmastime along with in-universe parallels of contemporary happenings; for example, one baby made hundreds of millions of dollars operating a website called cryspace around the time that MySpace was most popular among readers of the strip, and his fortune generates plot elements in later strips.

====Fourth-wall breaking====
A few story arcs involve fourth wall breaking, such as appearances by other King Features Syndicate characters, and even those from other strips such as Garfield. On June 24, 2016, Marvin and his best friend Jordan are shown reading Marvin&#x27;s personal blog, and followers of that blog share the names of some of the then-active commenters on the &quot;Marvin&quot; comic&#x27;s website.

===Milestone events===
Some events in the history of the strip are reflected permanently in the future strips.

Bea and Roy Arnold lost their retirement savings in the 2008 recession and had to move in with Jeff and Jenny; Janet did not have enough room. As of 2021 the grandparents are no longer living with the family.

In 2010, the Millers got new neighbors, the Purfects, who are so perfect they make the Millers feel inadequate. Rodney Purfect has a PhD and is a company president, has won the Heisman Trophy and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He is six feet five inches tall and very manly. Barbie Purfect is a blonde housewife who attended cooking school in Paris, was a cheerleader, class president and sorority president. Rodney Purfect II is two and a half years old but reads at a third grade level, performed his piano composition for Queen Elizabeth II and was potty trained at 6 months. He also has blond hair.

In 2005, Marvin guest starred in the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot; for its 75th anniversary.

In 2019, Jeff&#x27;s mother was kicked out of her retirement home and moved in with the family.

<text>A convertible or cabriolet () is a passenger car that can be driven with or without a roof in place. The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary across eras and manufacturers.

A convertible car&#x27;s design allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the side effects of almost completely removing a car&#x27;s roof).

The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk).

==Terminology==

Other terms for convertibles include cabriolet, cabrio, drop top, drophead coupé, open two-seater, open top, rag top, soft top, spider, and spyder, although companies use many of these terms interchangeably. Thus, nomenclatural consistency is rare. The term cabriolet originated from a carriage cabriolet: &quot;a light, two-wheeled, one-horse carriage with a folding top, capable of seating two persons&quot;; however, the term is also used to describe other convertibles.

In the United Kingdom, the historical term for a two-door convertible is drophead coupé, and a four-door convertible was called an all-weather tourer.

== History ==
Most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides. As car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century, folding textile or leather roofs (as had been used on victoria or landau carriages) began to appear on cars. Examples of early cars with roofs include the phaeton (a two-seat car with a temporary roof), the brougham or a coupé de ville, having an enclosed passenger compartment at the rear, while the driver sat in front either in the open, or the landaulet, where the driver has a fixed roof and the passenger compartment has a folding roof. Less expensive cars, such as the runabouts, sporting roadsters, or sturdy touring cars, remained either completely open air or were fitted with a rudimentary folding top and detachable clear side curtains.
In the 1920s, when steel bodies began to be mass-produced, closed cars became available to the average buyer, and fully open cars began to disappear from the mainstream market. By the mid 1930s, the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high-priced luxury models. In 1939, Plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof powered by two vacuum cylinders.

Demand for convertibles increased as a result of American soldiers in France and the United Kingdom during World War II familiarizing themselves with small roadster cars, which were not available in the United States at that time. These roadsters included the MG Midget and Triumph Roadster. The convertible design was incorporated into the mass market unibody by Hudson in 1948. United States automakers manufactured a broad range of convertible models during the 1950s and 1960s – from economical compact-sized models such as the Rambler American and the Studebaker Lark, to the more expensive models, such as the Packard Caribbean, Oldsmobile 98, and Imperial by Chrysler. Automakers often included a convertible body style as an available body style in a model range.

Convertibles in the U.S. market peaked in sales around 1965, and fell in popularity over the next five years. Optional air conditioning was gradually becoming more popular, and the availability of sunroofs and T-tops limited the appeal of the open body style. Noise, leaks, and repairs associated with fabric tops also contributed to issues that many customers had. The popularity of convertibles was reduced by the increased travel speeds on roads (resulting in more wind and noise for occupants) and the emergence of more comprehensive vehicle crash safety standards in the United States.

The market share of convertibles fell to two or three percent of total sales and the U.S. automakers discontinued the body style from their lineups. American Motors stopped making convertibles after the 1968 model year, Chrysler after 1971, Ford after 1973, and most divisions of General Motors after 1975. Cadillac held out until 1976, when they made about 14,000. The last 200 had a red, white, and blue motif and a dashboard plaque. The very last was offered to the Smithsonian Institution, whose trustees turned it down as it was not at that moment a historic artifact, &quot;Though it might well be in three generations ... or at the Tricentennial.&quot; After the last Cadillac Eldorado convertible was made in 1976, the only factory convertibles sold in the United States were imported. Making convertibles on the assembly line was both expensive and time-consuming, thus not worth the problems needed to sell the limited number of cars.

Specialized coachbuilders were contracted to make dealer-available cars such as the Targa top versions of the AMC Concord and Eagle &quot;Sundancer&quot; as well as the Toyota Celica &quot;Sunchaser&quot; as specialty models. American Sunroof Company (ASC), which was responsible for popularizing the sunroof option for regular body styles, converted a Buick Riviera into a full convertible that compelled General Motors to market it as part of the 1982 Buick models. Chrysler Corporation also introduced a convertible body style in its 1982 lines that was based on the K-Car. These models were the LeBaron, produced under Chrysler, and the 400, manufactured under Dodge. Ford reintroduced a convertible Mustang for 1983, while American Motors Corporation (AMC) added a convertible version of the Renault Alliance in 1984.

In 1989, Mazda released the first generation Mazda MX-5 (called &quot;Miata&quot; in North America), which has become the best-selling convertible with over 1 million cars sold. Also in 1989, Toyota released the Toyota Soarer Aerocabin, which uses an electrically operated retractable hardtop roof. A total of 500 were produced.

Models dedicated to the convertible body style include the Mazda MX-5, Porsche Boxster, and Opel Cascada.

== Roof types ==
=== Textile ===
A &quot;soft top&quot; is made from a flexible textile material:
* Early convertibles used cotton canvas woven so tightly that it was waterproof. Automakers had problems in securing raw materials to fulfill orders after World War II, including canvas in various shades for convertible tops, therefore limiting their manufacture.
* A cloth-based material has become more common in recent years.

Other materials are also used in the convertible top. By 1955, the most popular materials were latex and butyl rubber fabrics that each accounted for around 35% of the convertible top&#x27;s weight, with others included vinyl (12%), jute (8%), along with rayon and acrylic fibers (Orlon), amounting to about 1% each in the compositions. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material was used for many convertible tops. The material consists of two layers: a top layer made of PVC, which has a specific structure depending on the vehicle model, and a lower layer made of fabric (usually cotton).

The collapsible textile roof section over an articulated folding frame may include linings such as a sound-deadening layer and/or an interior cosmetic lining, to hide the frame.

The folded convertible mechanism with the top is called the stack. Designs that fold down to a lower stack height offer a smoother silhouette for the car with the top down while concealed side rails allow room for three passengers in the back seat such as on the 1967 Rambler Rebel convertible.

=== Detachable hardtop ===
Rigid removable hardtops, many of which can be stored in a car&#x27;s trunk/boot, have been available at least since the 1950s. These usually provide greater weatherproofing, soundproofing, and durability compared to fabric-based tops; some are available with integrated rear-window defrosters and windscreens. Examples include the Ford Thunderbird (1st-generation and 11th-generation), Mercedes SL (2nd-generation and 3rd-generation), Porsche Boxster, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Mustang Cobra (1995 Only), and Mazda MX-5.

During the 1950s and 1960s, detachable hard-material roofs were offered for various convertible sports cars and roadsters, including the 1955–1957 Ford Thunderbird and Chevrolet Corvette, as well as the 1963–1971 Mercedes-Benz W113 series of two-seaters. Because the convertible top mechanism is itself expensive, the hard roof was customarily offered as an additional, extra-cost option. On early Thunderbirds (and Corvettes through 1967), buyers could choose between a detachable hardtop and a folding canvas top at no additional cost, but paid extra for both.

The metal-framed &quot;Carson top&quot; was a popular addition for the 1930s Ford convertibles or roadsters because it turned these models into an almost instant hardtop. The design mimicked a convertible top, but lacking the bulky folding mechanisms enabled the removable hardtop to have a much lower and more rakish profile.

Improvements in canvas tops have rendered the detachable hard roof less common in part because the top cannot be stored inside the vehicle when not in use, requiring a garage or other storage facility. Some open cars continue to offer it as an option. For example, the Mazda MX-5 has an accessory hardtop, which is compulsory for some auto racing series.

=== Retractable hardtop ===

A retractable hardtop — also known as &quot;coupé convertible&quot; or &quot;coupé cabriolet&quot; — is a car with an automatically operated, self-storing hardtop (as opposed to the textile-based roof used by traditional convertibles).

The benefits of improved climate control and security are traded off against increased mechanical complexity, cost, weight, and often reduced luggage capacity.

== Other design features ==
===Tonneau cover===
Folding textile convertible tops often fail to completely hide their internal mechanism or can expose their vulnerable underside to sun exposure and fading. A tonneau cover provides a solution.

=== Rear window ===

Rear windows are often part of the roof assembly. Traditionally, the rear window in a soft-top was made from plastic; however, more recently some convertibles have used glass for the rear window.

=== Windblocker ===

A windblocker or wind deflector minimizes noise and rushing air reaching the occupants. According to the engineer responsible for the 2008 Chrysler Sebring, its windblocker reduces wind noise by approximately 11 to 12 dB.

Several convertibles are available with a heating duct to the neck area of the seat, which is often called an &quot;Air Scarf&quot;. Examples of cars with this feature include Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class, Mercedes-Benz SL-Class, and Audi A5/S5.

=== Safety ===

Modern safety features specifically for convertibles include:
* rollover protection structures (ROPS) with pyrotechnically charged roll hoops hidden behind the rear seats that deploy under rollover conditions
* heated rear window (for improved visibility)
* boron steel-reinforced A-pillars
* safety cage construction – a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment 
* door-mounted side-impact airbag which inflates upward (instead of downward like the typical curtain airbag) to provide head protection even with an open window

== Variations ==
Convertibles have offered numerous iterations that fall between the first mechanically simple fabric tops to complex retractable roofs made from hard materials:

Roadster: A roadster (also called &quot;spider&quot; or &quot;spyder&quot;) is an open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or character. Initially, an American term for a two-seat car with no weather protection, usage has spread internationally and has evolved to include two-seat convertibles.

Cabrio coach: A cabrio coach (also called &quot;semi-convertible&quot;) has a retractable textile roof, similar to a traditional convertible. The difference is that a convertible often has the B-pillar, C-pillar and other bodywork removed. However, the cabrio-coach retains all bodywork to the top of the door frames and just replaces the roof skin with a retractable fabric panel.

An advantage of a cabrio coach is that retaining more of the car&#x27;s original structure means that structural rigidity is higher (or the vehicle weight is lower) than traditional cabriolets. An example of the cabrio coach is the 2003-10 C3 Pluriel, which has a roof with five possible configurations.


Fixed-profile: In contrast to convertibles where the entire bodywork above the beltline (doors, roof, side pillars, side bodywork) is replaced with a folding or retractable roof, the fixed profile convertible retains portions of fixed bodywork including the doors, side pillars, and side elements of the roof — while a center fabric portion slides back and accordions at the rear. As an example, Citroën&#x27;s 1948 Citroën 2CV featured rigid bodysides and two doors on each side, along with a sunroof that rolled back on itself and extended to the rear bumper in place of a separate trunk lid. Other fixed-profile convertibles include the 1957 Autobianchi Bianchina Trasformabile, 1957 Vespa 400, 1950 Nash Rambler Landau Convertible Coupe, the Nissan Figaro (1991), the Jaguar XJ-SC (1983), the 1957 Fiat 500 and its 2007 Fiat 500 successor, as well as the Microlino Spiaginno (2024). The 1984 Heuliez-designed Citroën Visa &quot;Décapotable&quot; used elements of a fixed-profile convertible.

Four-door: Most convertibles have two doors. However, four-door convertibles have been mass-produced. Examples include the 1940-41 Cadillac Series 62, 1931 Chrysler Imperial Dual Cowl Phaeton and 1961-67 Lincoln Continental. Current production four-door convertibles include the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.

Peugeot presented a concept four-door retractable hardtop convertible, the Peugeot 407 Macarena in 2006. Produced by French coachbuilding specialist Heuliez, the Macarena&#x27;s top can be folded in 60 seconds, with a steel reinforcing beam behind the front seats incorporating LCD screens for the rear passengers into the crossmember.

Off-road: Several off-road vehicles have been produced with removable soft tops. Examples include the Jeep Wrangler, Suzuki Vitara, Suzuki Jimny, Ford Bronco, Land Rover Defender, Mercedes-Benz G-Class as well as early models of the Toyota Land Cruiser and Land Rover Defender. Typically, the soft tops attach to the roll cage or to the installation points on the vehicle&#x27;s body.

Landaulet: A landaulet (also known as &quot;landaulette&quot;) is where the rear passengers are covered by a convertible top. Often the driver is separated from the rear passengers with a partition, as per a limousine.

In the second half of the 20th century, landaulets were used by public figures (such as heads of state) in formal processions. They are now rarely used, for fear of terrorist attacks.

Victoria-Cabriolet: reminiscent of the victoria carriage style, a three-position convertible. No rear side windows and equipped with a soft top that can be raised partway, leaving the area above the front seats folded back. This body style had a short period of popularity, mainly in the 1930s. Other names include Cabriolet/Coupé Milord (or just Milord), Calash (from Calèche), Folding Head DHC, three-position Drop-head Coupé, or &quot;Cabriolet toit de 3 positions&quot;.

<text>The Junkers Ju 188 &quot;Rächer&quot; (&quot;Avenger&quot;) was a German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; high-performance medium bomber built during World War II, the planned follow-up to the Ju 88 with better performance and payload. It was produced only in limited numbers, due both to the presence of improved versions of the Ju 88, as well as the increasingly effective Allied strategic bombing campaign against German industry and the resulting focus on fighter production.

==Background==
In 1936, Junkers submitted proposals for the Ju 85 and Ju 88 into competition for the new standardized &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; high-speed tactical bomber, known as the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; (fast bomber). The two designs were almost identical, differing only in that the Ju 85 used a twin-rudder and the Ju 88 a single fin.

At the same time, they offered modified versions of each as the Ju 85B and Ju 88B, again similar to the original designs but using an &quot;egg shaped&quot; stepless cockpit forward fuselage design that comprised a greenhouse-like, well-framed network of some three dozen compound-curved window panels in total. This was another example of the &quot;bullet-nose&quot; design philosophy that almost all new German bomber designs exhibited, from the time of the Heinkel He 111P onwards. The new nose design for the Ju 88B also tightly integrated the forward end of the undernose &quot;Bola&quot; ventral gondola defensive gun position into the newer nose design, when compared to the &quot;added-on&quot; &quot;Bola&quot; unit pioneered on the Ju 88 V7 prototype. This meant the Ju 88B offered somewhat lower drag and better visibility. At the time, this was considered too radical and the Ju 88A with its simpler, separately-glazed dorsal cockpit &quot;greenhouse&quot; framed canopy, and &quot;beetle&#x27;s eye&quot; framed, multi-flat panel nose glazing comprising a &quot;stepped&quot; cockpit design from the separation of the pair of glazed units by the sheetmetal of the upper fuselage nose winning the initial &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; production contract.

The Reich Air Ministry (RLM) was already in the process of looking for the replacement for the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;, a new design that would be faster, fly higher, and have a larger warload. This emerged as the &quot;Bomber B&quot; program, but this was extensively delayed due to the failure of the large -class engines, like Junkers&#x27; Jumo 222, to become reliable enough for production use. Although Junkers&#x27; Ju 288 was leading the contest, there was no delivery date on the engines.

To address the immediate need, the Ju 88B project was re-submitted as a stop-gap. For this version, they used the latest short-wing Ju 88 A-1 airframe as a baseline with the Ju 88B&#x27;s new stepless cockpit design, with the new Junkers Jumo 213 engine, which had recently started bench testing and was expected to deliver and required a redesigned annular radiator system for engine and oil cooling.

The RLM also stipulated that the aircraft should also be able to accept the BMW 801 radial engine in a &quot;Kraftei&quot; (power-egg) unitized installation, with no modification to the engine nacelles. The RLM was not impressed with the new design, as it offered only small improvements over the Ju 88A model in service but suggested that Junkers continue with the prototype work anyway and that they consider fitting the design with the BMW 139 radial. This engine was cancelled only a few weeks later and all designs based on it moved to the newer and more powerful BMW 801.

==Prototypes, Ju 88 B-0==
The prototype Ju 88B V1, D-AUVS, flew for the first time with the 801A/B engines in early 1940. The fuselage and tail surfaces were identical to the Ju 88 A-1, which presented a problem: with the extra power, , the design could now carry considerably more load than the small bomb bay could fit. An additional external shackle was then added to each wing well outside the engines, although using the rack would seriously hamper performance.

During the summer, a pre-production run of 10 Ju 88 B-0 based on the pre-production Ju 88 A-4 airframes were delivered. The A-4 used a longer wing of span from new rounded wingtips for better altitude performance, when compared to the initial Ju 88A-1&#x27;s shorter span, but attention to streamlining and new pointed wing tips, somewhat resembling those fitted to the British Spitfire Mks.VII and VIII for their own intended high-altitude flight requirements, kept drag to about what it was earlier. The airframe changes moved the center of gravity slightly, so the glazed cockpit area was made slightly longer to re-balance the aircraft, while also offering better visibility for other members of the crew.

Service tests were all successful, and the pilots generally lauded the new cockpit design. However, the RLM still remained unconvinced that the small improvement in performance over the existing A-5&#x27;s and future A-4&#x27;s was worth investing time in. Instead, the pre-production models were modified as long-range reconnaissance aircraft by removing the guns, bombsights, and external bomb shackles, and fitting fuel tanks into the bomb bay.

Several of the airframes were retained by Junkers for further development. One of these was fitted with the slightly updated 801L engines and a small power-operated turret on the extreme top of the cockpit mounting a MG 131 machine gun.

==Variants==
By 1942, it was becoming clear that Junkers&#x27; candidate for the important &quot;Bomber B&quot; program, the Ju 288, was not going to be ready soon and that the Ju 88 was increasingly at the mercy of rapidly improving RAF and Soviet VVS fighters. The RLM finally decided that even the small gains in performance in the Ju 88B were worth considering and asked Junkers for an improved aircraft as the Ju 188.

The sole Ju 88 E-0 was modified with another MG 131 firing rearward just below the turret, one firing forward through the nose and twin MG 81Z machine guns in the integrated ventral &quot;Bola&quot; gondola firing rearward. Two other airframes had their engines and outer wings removed to act as testbeds for water ditching, as it was planned to use the Ju 188 in long overwater flights against British shipping. A second Ju 188 test airframe was built from another Ju 88 A-4, this one including a larger, more trapezoidal vertical tail surface set to provide more directional control at higher altitudes, a feature also used on future Ju 88 models, most importantly on the Ju 88G night fighters. Originally known as Ju 88 V44, this airframe was later named Ju 188 V1, &quot;so the enemy gets the impression it&#x27;s something new&quot;, said Erhard Milch.

In October 1942, the Ju 188 was chosen for production. A second prototype was delivered in January, which moved the outer bomb shackles to a position inboard of the engines. Both started testing the dive bombing system installed in the 88 A-4 in February. The RLM then asked for another change, allowing the aircraft to mount either the BMW 801 or Jumo 213 engines as a complete &quot;Kraftei&quot; or &quot;power egg&quot; common engine installation, that would simply be bolted on and hooked up. Concerns about the Jumo 213, now years overdue, were offset by this engine&#x27;s better altitude performance, so it made sense to delay the aircraft slightly if that meant it could switch to the 213 as soon as they became available. The second Ju 188 prototype was flown in at Rechlin between September and November 1943.

===Ju 188 A &amp; E===
The Ju 188 was designed to be fitted with either the Jumo 213A or BMW 801 G-2 engines without any changes to the airframe, with the exclusion of the re-design for Jumo-powered examples, of the annular radiators from their Jumo 211 layout for the A-series to better match the more powerful 213&#x27;s cooling needs, while using similar broad-chord three-blade propellers as the A-series did. It was intended that both would be known as A models but the naming was later changed: the Ju 188A model powered by the 213 and the Ju 188E by the 801.

The first three production Ju 188 E-1 machines were delivered with BMW engines in February 1943, followed by another seven in March and eight in April. A conversion testing unit was formed up in May and after testing were attached to an operational unit, with the first mission, an attack by three Ju 188E-1s on a factory in Lincoln, Lincolnshire taking place on 18 August 1943. By the end of the year, 283 Ju 188s had been delivered (including Ju 188Fs) and two new factories were added to the production effort. Most operational machines differed from the prototypes only in having a MG 151/20 cannon in the nose and dorsal turrets in place of the MG 131. The MG 131 was intended to be used in the Ju 188 E-1 or the G-2 but the heavy armament in the A and E series was the MG 151/20. The Ju 188 E-2 was built as a torpedo-bomber but was identical to the Ju 188 A-3.
Although the A and E models were to have been delivered at the same time, the Jumo engine was still not ready; the first Jumo powered Ju 188 A-1 versions were shipped only shortly after the BMW versions, albeit at a much slower rate. By the time deliveries were finally picking up in late 1943, the Jumo was available in a new MW 50 methanol-water injection &quot;boosted&quot; version that delivered for takeoff. With this engine, the planes were known as the Ju 188 A-2 and started deliveries in early 1944.
A modified version mounting a small, low-UHF-band FuG 200 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; sea-search radar set under the nose and shackles for a torpedo for naval strike missions was delivered as the Ju 188 E-2, and with the Jumo as the Ju 188 A-3. The only other difference was the removal of the outer pair of wing bomb shackles. For all its good points, the Ju 188 was only a small improvement over the Ju 88. The bombload and bomb bay was no larger than the earlier aircraft; although a larger load could be carried externally, it reduced performance. Even then the performance was rather poor considering all the effort - only or less. The dorsal turret had only one gun, yet the type retained the single-gun flexible position only a few centimeters away from it; various projects finally to provide the 188 with tail armament were abandoned.

Delivery problems of the Jumo 213 were never entirely solved and the only model to be built in large numbers were the E series with the BMW 801. Even then so few were available that they were generally given out to Ju 88 units, who flew them on &quot;special&quot; missions where the longer range or better performance would be helpful. Some 500 Ju 188A and E variants were produced before production ceased in the summer of 1944.

===Ju 188 C===
It was planned all along to skip over a &quot;B model&quot; to avoid confusion with the original Ju 88 B but in the original plan the A and E models would be called As and the Ju 188 C would be the next model. The C series was built to the extent of a single example, by modifying one of the few A-1 machines. A new power-operated, remotely operated FA 15 turret was mounted in the tail and had two MG 131s, aimed with a double-periscope (top and bottom) system mounted in the cockpit. This modification would have greatly improved defensive firepower, always lacking on German designs but reliability was so poor it was decided to abandon the system.

===Ju 188 D &amp; F===
In early 1944, it was decided to focus on reconnaissance versions of the A and E models. The airframe was modified with the removal of the bomb aimer and forward gun and additional fuel cells were added to extend the range to . The Ju 188 D-1 was otherwise similar to the A-1 and the Ju 188 D-2 had nose radar for naval reconnaissance. Similar conversions of the E models were the Ju 188 F-1 and Ju 188 F-2.

===Ju 188 G &amp; H===
One problem with the Ju 88 that carried into the 188 was the lack of internal room for bomb storage. Both carried the majority of their bombload on racks under the wing, where it greatly affected performance. This was to have been addressed in the G and H models, which extended the fuselage downward for more room with the addition of a wooden pannier. The modification also left enough room at the tail to fit a manned turret in place of the C model&#x27;s remote-control one but this system proved to be just as limited as the remote-control FA 15. It was so small that only the smallest men could fit into it and left them with no room to escape in an emergency. The RLM rejected the manned turret and planned on mounting the FA 15 even if it were unreliable. Oddly, the designs still possessed the &quot;Bola&quot; undernose feature for a rear-facing gunner, when this would no longer be needed and its removal would have greatly streamlined the aircraft. With the Jumo 213s now being sent to fighter production, the Ju 188G-2 was to use the BMW 801 only, with the reconnaissance conversion known as the Ju 188 H-2. Neither entered production before the war ended; the Ju 188G remained at the prototype stage. Tail empennages of the few Ju 188G prototypes built were used in construction of the first two Ju 287 prototypes.

===Ju 188 R===
In the summer of 1944, three E models were modified as night fighters with the addition of radar and either four 20 mm MG 151/20s or two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 cannons in the nose. The better visibility of the 188 was not useful in night fighting and because the added drag of the radar washed out any speed difference, the Ju 188 R-0 was not ordered.

==High-altitude versions==
In 1943, it was planned to upgrade all versions with even more wing area and a pressurized cockpit for high-altitude work. A single basic airframe would be offered in three versions, the Ju 188J heavy fighter, Ju 188K bomber, and the Ju 188L reconnaissance version. As with the streamlined Ju 88S, all three late model Ju 188 designs did away with the &quot;Bola&quot; gondola, leading to a cleaner nose profile, and the bomber and reconnaissance versions mounted their loads in a long pannier under the central fuselage instead of the deeper fuselage of the G and H models.

Simpler versions of these with no defensive armament and even longer wings became the Ju 188S fighter and Ju 188T intruder. With Jumo 213E-1 engines at take-off and at , the Ju 188T could reach . Operating at this altitude, the Ju 188S could carry only of bombs.

Before any of these could start production, the entire lineup was renamed the Ju 388, the vastly improved performance warranting a different 8-388 airframe number from the RLM for the design.

==Operators==
* French Air Force (Postwar)
* Aviation Navale operated several captured Ju 188s post war.
* Luftwaffe
* Royal Air Force operated at least two captured machines post war, an A-2 and A-3 (Wrk Nr 190335 of 9./KG 26). The A-3 surrendered to British forces after landing at Fraserburgh on 2 May 1945.

<text>The 8.8 cm KwK 36 () was an tank gun used by the German Army during World War II. This was the primary armament of the PzKpfw VI Tiger I tank. It was developed and built by Krupp.

==Design==
The 8.8 cm KwK 36 was derived from the 8.8 cm Flak 36 anti-aircraft gun by adapting/modifying it to the limited space available in tank turrets. Parts of the KwK 36 were built to practically the same design as the and guns already used in German tanks. The breech ring was square in section and on a side. The breech block was of vertical falling wedge type and operated semi-automatically, meaning that after firing the empty cartridge case was automatically ejected, while the breech cocked itself and remained open, ready to receive the next round.

The &quot;L/56&quot; in the designation is descriptor of barrel length; the ratio of the length of the barrel in proportion to the width of the bore. The designation &quot;L/56&quot; means the barrel is 56 times 88 mm - about . The longer the tube is in relation to its bore, the higher the muzzle velocity it can generate on fixed charge. A longer gun barrel allows the expanding gas from the shell&#x27;s charge to act on the projectile longer than a short barrel, imparting it more velocity and force. For the Tiger II&#x27;s 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71, barrel length is generating a higher velocity.

==Performance==

The KwK 36 was very accurate and high-powered, and its high muzzle velocity produced a very flat trajectory. This allowed its gunners a higher margin of error in estimating range.

In British firing trials during the war, a British gunner scored five successive hits from at a target. Another five rounds were fired at targets moving at , and, although smoke obscured the gunners&#x27; observation, three hits were scored after directions given by the commander. The sighting system resulted in excellent firing accuracy for the 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun on the Tiger I.

===Capability===
The gun&#x27;s performance was highly dependent on distance to target and type of ammunition loaded. For kinetic penetration, the speed of the projectile upon impact is crucial, and the cumulative effect of air resistance decreases the velocity of the shell as the distance to the target increases. The accuracy achieved during controlled test firing to determine the pattern of dispersion gives a greater accuracy than the variation expected during practice firing on a range due to differences between guns, ammunition and gunners; both at precisely known distances.
Due to errors in estimating the range and many other factors, the probability of a first shot hit under battlefield conditions was much lower than at the firing range. Observing the tracer from the first round in battle, the average, calm gunner might achieve the firing range accuracy shown in the second column with the second round fired at the same target.

This gun used the same size 88 x 571R mm cartridge, with the exception of being electrically primed compared to the percussion primed cases employed by the Flak 18/36/37.

<doc id="188050" wikidata="Q157506" url="?curid=188050" title="Ninety-five Theses">
<text>The Ninety-five Theses, also known as the Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences, is a list of propositions for an academic disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, then a professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany. The &quot;Theses&quot; is retrospectively considered to have launched the Protestant Reformation and the birth of Protestantism, despite various proto-Protestant groups having existed previously. It detailed Luther&#x27;s opposition to what he saw as the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s abuse and corruption by Catholic clergy, who were selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates supposed to reduce the temporal punishment in purgatory for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones.

In the &quot;Theses&quot;, Luther claimed that the required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by obtaining an indulgence. These indulgences, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, which he attributed to a belief that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of Pope Leo X, the &quot;Theses&quot; challenge a 14th-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The &quot;Theses&quot; are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther&#x27;s opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the &quot;Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences&quot;.

Luther sent the &quot;Theses&quot; enclosed with a letter to Albert of Brandenburg, Archbishop of Mainz, on 31 October 1517, a date now considered the start of the Reformation and commemorated annually as Reformation Day. Luther may have also posted the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; on the door of All Saints&#x27; Church and other churches in Wittenberg, in accordance with University custom, at some point between 31 October and mid-November. The &quot;Theses&quot; were quickly reprinted and translated, and distributed throughout Germany and Europe. They initiated a pamphlet war with the indulgence preacher Johann Tetzel, which spread Luther&#x27;s fame even further. Luther&#x27;s ecclesiastical superiors had him tried for heresy, which culminated in his excommunication in 1521. Though the &quot;Theses&quot; were the start of the Reformation, Luther did not consider indulgences to be as important as other theological matters which would divide the church, such as justification by faith alone and the bondage of the will. His breakthrough on these issues would come later, and he did not see the writing of the &quot;Theses&quot; as the point at which his beliefs diverged from those of the Roman Catholic Church.

==Background==
Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg and town preacher, wrote the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; against the contemporary practice of the church with respect to indulgences. In the Roman Catholic Church, which was practically the only Christian church in Western Europe at the time, indulgences were part of the economy of salvation. In this system, when Christians sin and confess, they are forgiven and no longer stand to receive eternal punishment in hell, but may still be liable to temporal punishment. This punishment could be satisfied by the penitent&#x27;s performing works of mercy. If the temporal punishment is not satisfied during life, it needs to be satisfied in Purgatory, a place believed by Catholics to exist between Heaven and Hell. By indulgence (which may be understood in the sense of &quot;kindness&quot;), this temporal punishment could be lessened. Under abuses of the system of indulgences, clergy benefited by selling indulgences and the pope gave official sanction in exchange for a fee.

Popes are empowered to grant plenary indulgences, which provide complete satisfaction for any remaining temporal punishment due to sins, and these were purchased on behalf of people believed to be in purgatory. This led to the popular saying, &quot;As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs&quot;. Theologians at the University of Paris criticized this saying late in the 15th century. Earlier critics of indulgences included John Wycliffe, who denied that the pope had jurisdiction over Purgatory. Jan Hus and his followers had advocated a more severe system of penance, in which indulgences were not available. Johannes von Wesel had also attacked indulgences late in the 15th century. Political rulers had an interest in controlling indulgences because local economies suffered when the money for indulgences left a given territory. Rulers often sought to receive a portion of the proceeds or prohibited indulgences altogether, as Duke George did in Luther&#x27;s Electoral Saxony.

In 1515, Pope Leo X granted a plenary indulgence intended to finance the construction of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Roma. It would apply to almost any sin, including adultery and theft. All other indulgence preaching was to cease for the eight years in which it was offered. Indulgence preachers were given strict instructions on how the indulgence was to be preached, and they were much more laudatory of the indulgence than those of earlier indulgences. Johann Tetzel was commissioned to preach and offer the indulgence in 1517, and his campaign in cities near Wittenberg drew many Wittenbergers to travel to these cities and purchase them, since sales had been prohibited in Wittenberg and other Saxon cities.

Luther also had a rather negative experience and idea with the indulgences connected to All Saints&#x27; Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences and the way they cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel&#x27;s indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the penitent had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God&#x27;s righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;. He composed a &quot;Treatise on Indulgences&quot;, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the &quot;Theses&quot; to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.

==Content==
The first thesis states, &quot;When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, &#x27;Repent,&#x27; he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.&quot; In the first few theses Luther develops the idea of repentance as the Christian&#x27;s inner struggle with sin rather than the external system of sacramental confession. Theses 5–7 then state that the pope who Luther called the Vicar of Christ on earth can only release people from the punishments he has administered himself or through the church&#x27;s system of penance, not the guilt of sin. The pope can only announce God&#x27;s forgiveness of the guilt of sin in his name. In theses 14–29, Luther challenged common beliefs about purgatory. Theses 14–16 discuss the idea that the punishment of purgatory can be likened to the fear and despair felt by dying people. In theses 17–24 he asserts that nothing can be definitively said about the spiritual state of people in purgatory. He denies that the pope has any power over people in purgatory in theses 25 and 26. In theses 27–29, he attacks the idea that as soon as payment is made, the payer&#x27;s loved one is released from purgatory. He sees it as encouraging sinful greed, and says it is impossible to be certain because only God has ultimate power in forgiving punishments in purgatory.
Theses 30–34 deal with the false certainty Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads to the conclusion that the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God&#x27;s punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.

In theses 41–47 Luther criticizes indulgences on the basis that they discourage works of mercy by those who purchase them. Here he begins to use the phrase, &quot;Christians are to be taught...&quot; to state how he thinks people should be instructed on the value of indulgences. They should be taught that giving to the poor is incomparably more important than buying indulgences, that buying an indulgence rather than giving to the poor invites God&#x27;s wrath, and that doing good works makes a person better while buying indulgences does not. In theses 48–52 Luther takes the side of the pope, saying that if the pope knew what was being preached in his name he would rather St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica be burned down than &quot;built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep&quot;. Theses 53–55 complain about the restrictions on preaching while the indulgence was being offered.

In theses 56–66, Martin Luther criticizes the doctrine of the treasury of merit on which the doctrine of indulgences is based. He states that everyday Christians do not understand the doctrine and are being misled. For Luther, the true treasure of the church is the gospel of Jesus Christ. This treasure tends to be hated because it makes &quot;the first last&quot;, in the words of Matthew 19:30 and 20:16. Luther uses metaphor and wordplay to describe the treasures of the gospel as nets to catch wealthy people, whereas the treasures of indulgences are nets to catch the wealth of men.
In theses 67–80, Luther discusses further the problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope&#x27;s intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.

Luther lists several criticisms advanced by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing rather than his own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory if it is in his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope&#x27;s financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther&#x27;s positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope&#x27;s position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the &quot;Theses&quot; by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.

==Luther&#x27;s intent==

The &quot;Theses&quot; are written as propositions to be argued in a formal academic disputation, though there is no evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the &quot;Theses&quot;, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as a doctor, and it was not an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther&#x27;s. He posted them on the door of All Saints&#x27; Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;. Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; on the eve of All Saints&#x27; Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints&#x27; Church.

Luther&#x27;s theses were intended to begin a debate among academics, not a popular revolution, but there are indications that he saw his action as prophetic and significant. Around this time, he began using the name &quot;Luther&quot; and sometimes &quot;Eleutherius&quot;, Greek for &quot;free&quot;, rather than &quot;Luder&quot;. This seems to refer to his being free from the scholastic theology which he had argued against earlier that year. Luther later claimed not to have desired the &quot;Theses&quot; to be widely distributed. Elizabeth Eisenstein has argued that his claimed surprise at their success may have involved self-deception and Hans Hillerbrand has claimed that Luther was certainly intending to instigate a large controversy. At times, Luther seems to use the academic nature of the &quot;Theses&quot; as a cover to allow him to attack established beliefs while being able to deny that he intended to attack church teaching. Since writing a set of theses for a disputation does not necessarily commit the author to those views, Luther could deny that he held the most incendiary ideas in the &quot;Theses&quot;.

==Distribution and publication==
On 31 October 1517, Luther sent a letter to the Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose authority the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert&#x27;s name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.
It was customary when proposing a disputation to have the theses printed by the university press and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; have survived, but this is not surprising as Luther was not famous and the importance of the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the &quot;Theses&quot;, only mentioned the door of All Saints&#x27; Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the &quot;Theses&quot; on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther&#x27;s statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the &quot;Theses&quot; to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on the door at all. Regardless, the &quot;Theses&quot; were well known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.

The &quot;Theses&quot; were copied and distributed to interested parties soon after Luther sent the letter to Archbishop Albert. The Latin &quot;Theses&quot; were printed in a four-page pamphlet in Basel, and as placards in Leipzig and Nuremberg. In all, several hundred copies of the Latin &quot;Theses&quot; were printed in Germany in 1517. in Nuremberg translated them into German later that year, and copies of this translation were sent to several interested parties across Germany, but it was not necessarily printed. The invention of the printing press enabled the quick spread of the Ninety-five Theses, facilitating large-scale production of books and pamphlets across Europe. In the early sixteenth century, printing centers in cities like Wittenberg, Basel, and Nuremberg expanded wildly, allowing Luther&#x27;s writings to reach a broad audience in only a few months. Historians have noted that Martin Luther&#x27;s writings played a key role in the Early Reformation. Wittenberg had several printing shops dedicated to just publishing his works.

==Reaction==
Albert seems to have received Luther&#x27;s letter with the &quot;Theses&quot; around the end of November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther&#x27;s religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote &quot;A Dialogue against Martin Luther&#x27;s Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope&quot;, which focused on Luther&#x27;s questioning of the pope&#x27;s authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with &quot;Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences&quot;, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther seems to have recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said he might not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The &quot;Explanations&quot; have been called Luther&#x27;s first Reformation work.
Johann Tetzel responded to the &quot;Theses&quot; by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther&#x27;s work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but students of the university seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand and that he would be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a &quot;Sermon on Indulgences and Grace&quot;, which did not challenge the pope&#x27;s authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther&#x27;s first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was not nearly as popular as Luther&#x27;s. Luther&#x27;s reply to Tetzel&#x27;s pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.

Another prominent opponent of the &quot;Theses&quot; was Johann Eck, Luther&#x27;s friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the Bishop of Eichstätt, entitled the &quot;Obelisks&quot;. This was in reference to the obelisks used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a harsh and unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the &quot;Asterisks&quot;, titled after the asterisk marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther&#x27;s response was angry and he expressed the opinion that Eck did not understand the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.

Luther was summoned by authority of the pope to defend himself against charges of heresy before Thomas Cajetan at Augsburg in October 1518. Cajetan did not allow Luther to argue with him over his alleged heresies, but he did identify two points of controversy. The first was against the 58th thesis, which stated that the pope could not use the treasury of merit to forgive temporal punishment of sin. This contradicted the papal bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; promulgated by Clement VI in 1343. The second point was whether one could be assured that one had been forgiven when one&#x27;s sin had been absolved by a priest. Luther&#x27;s &quot;Explanations&quot; on thesis seven asserted that one could based on God&#x27;s promise, but Cajetan argued that the humble Christian should never presume to be certain of their standing before God. Luther refused to recant and requested that the case be reviewed by university theologians. This request was denied, so Luther appealed to the pope before leaving Augsburg. Luther was finally excommunicated in 1521 after he burned the papal bull threatening him to recant or face excommunication.

==Legacy==

The indulgence controversy set off by the &quot;Theses&quot; was the beginning of the Reformation, a schism in the Roman Catholic Church which initiated profound and lasting social and political change in Europe. Luther later stated that the issue of indulgences was insignificant relative to controversies which he would enter into later, such as his debate with Erasmus over the bondage of the will, nor did he see the controversy as important to his intellectual breakthrough regarding the gospel. Luther later wrote that at the time that he wrote the &quot;Theses&quot;, he remained a &quot;papist&quot;, and he did not seem to think the &quot;Theses&quot; represented a break with established Roman Catholic doctrine. But it was out of the indulgences controversy that the movement which would be called the Reformation began, and the controversy propelled Luther to the leadership position he would hold in that movement. The &quot;Theses&quot; also made evident that Luther believed the church was not preaching properly and that this put the laity in serious danger. Further, the &quot;Theses&quot; contradicted the decree of Pope Clement VI, in 1343, that indulgences are the treasury of the church. This disregard for papal authority presaged later conflicts.

31 October 1517, the day Luther sent the &quot;Theses&quot; to Albert, was commemorated as the beginning of the Reformation as early as 1527, when Luther and his friends raised a glass of beer to commemorate the &quot;trampling out of indulgences&quot;. The posting of the &quot;Theses&quot; was established in the historiography of the Reformation as the beginning of the movement by Philip Melanchthon in his 1548 &quot;Historia de vita et actis Lutheri&quot;. During the 1617 Reformation Jubilee, the centenary of 31 October was celebrated by a procession to the Wittenberg Church where Luther was believed to have posted the &quot;Theses&quot;. An engraving was made showing Luther writing the &quot;Theses&quot; on the door of the church with a gigantic quill. The quill penetrates the head of a lion symbolizing Pope Leo X. In 1668, 31 October was made Reformation Day, an annual holiday in Electoral Saxony, which spread to other Lutheran lands. 31 October 2017, the 500th Anniversary of Reformation Day, was celebrated with a national public holiday throughout Germany.

<text>The Tiger II was a German heavy tank of the Second World War. The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen&quot; Tiger &quot;Ausf&quot;. B, often shortened toTiger B. The ordnance inventory designation was &quot;[[List of Sd.Kfz. designations|Sd.Kfz.]]&quot; 182. (&quot;Sd.Kfz.&quot; 267 and 268 for command vehicles). It was also known informally as the Königstiger&quot; (German for Bengal tiger, ). Contemporaneous Allied soldiers often called it the King Tiger or Royal Tiger.

The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I, combining the latter&#x27;s thick armour with the armour sloping used on the Panther medium tank. It was the costliest German tank to produce at the time. The tank weighed almost 70 tonnes, and was protected by of armour to the front. It was armed with the long barrelled (71 calibres) 8.8 cm KwK 43 anti-tank cannon. The chassis was also the basis for the &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; turretless &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; anti-tank vehicle.

The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. It was first used in combat by 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during the Allied invasion of Normandy on 11 July 1944; on the Eastern Front, the first unit to be outfitted with the Tiger II was the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion. Due to heavy Allied bombing, only 492 were produced.

==Development==

Development started in 1937 with a design contract awarded to Henschel. Another design contract followed in 1939, given to Porsche. Both prototypes used the same turret design from Krupp. The main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.
The Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimetre-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on transverse torsion bars, in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, the wheels were only overlapping &quot;without&quot; being interleaved—the full &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the Tiger I and Panther.

The Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the &quot;Elefant&quot; tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drivetrains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine–electric generator–electric motor–drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been used on the rejected Tiger (P) design, which had been rebuilt as &quot;Elefant&quot;, and in some US designs and was put into production in the French World War I era Saint-Chamond tank and post-World War I Char 2C. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives; Dr. Porsche&#x27;s unorthodox designs gathered little favour.

==Design==
Henschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm. Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the &quot;Porsche&quot; turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their Tiger II prototype; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes. This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret&#x27;s left side to accommodate the commander&#x27;s cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel hulls and used in action. In December 1943 the more common &quot;production&quot; turret, sometimes erroneously called the &quot;Henschel&quot; turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face (which eliminated the shot trap caused by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which avoided the need for a bulge for the commander&#x27;s cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.
The turrets were designed to mount the 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun. Combined with the &quot;Turmzielfernrohr&quot; 9d (German &quot;turret telescopic sight&quot;) monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a high, wide target was 100 percent at , 95–97 percent at and 85–87 percent at , depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000 m, in the 60s at 1,500 m and the 40s at 2,000 m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was at and respectively for the &quot;Panzergranate&quot; 39/43 projectile (PzGr – armour-piercing shell), and for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The &quot;Sprenggranate&quot; 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the &quot;Hohlgranate&quot; or &quot;Hohlgeschoss&quot; 39 (HlGr – HEAT or High-explosive anti-tank warhead) round, which had penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.

Powered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6º/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19º/second – the same as with the Tiger I – with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36º/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3,000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse was controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, whilst a high torque low speed (useful when on slopes) or low torque high speed final gearing could be selected via a control lever near his left arm. This system allowed for very precise control of powered traverse, a light touch on the pedal resulting in a minimum traverse speed of 0.1 deg/sec (360 degrees in 60 min), unlike in most other tanks of the time (e.g. US M4 Sherman or Soviet T-34 medium tanks) this allowed for fine laying of the gun without the gunner needing to use his traverse handwheel. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank; a 20° turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360° the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions.
Like all German tanks, the Tiger II had a petrol engine; in this case the same 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW) V-12 Maybach HL 230 P30 which powered the much lighter Panther and Tiger I tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR OG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks. Late production Tiger Is received the same wheels, which were one of the few interchangeable parts between the two tanks.

Like the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal &quot;battle track&quot; and a narrower &quot;transport&quot; version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76 kg/cm2 (10.8 psi).

===Command variant===
The command variant of the Tiger II was designated &quot;Panzerbefehlswagen&quot; Tiger &quot;Ausf. B&quot;. It had two versions, &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 267 and &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 268. These had reduced ammunition capacity (only 63 rounds of 8.8 cm ammunition) to provide room for the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 267 was to have used &quot;FuG&quot; 8 and &quot;FuG&quot; 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a &quot;Sternantenne D&quot; (&quot;Star antenna D&quot;), mounted on an insulated base (the 105 mm &quot;Antennenfuß Nr. 1&quot;), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 268 used &quot;FuG&quot; 7 and &quot;FuG&quot; 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.

==Production==
The Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 Tiger IIs—slightly more than the 1,347 Tiger I tanks produced—but production was heavily disrupted by Allied bombing raids. Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant. It is estimated that this caused the loss in production of 657 Tiger IIs. Only 492 units were produced: one in 1943, 379 in 1944, and 112 in 1945. Full production ran from mid-1944 to the end of the war. Each Tiger II cost 321 500 Reichsmark. The vehicle was the costliest German tank to produce at the time.

The Tiger II served as the basis for one production variant, the &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; casemated tank destroyer, and a proposed &quot;Grille&quot; 17/21/30/42 self-propelled mount for heavy guns which never reached production.

==Proposed upgrades==
The Maybach HL234, an engine born from attempting to convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power from 700 to at least 800 PS (hp). In January 1945 the &quot;Entwicklungskommission Panzer&quot; unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The ZF AK-7-200 gearbox was also explored as an alternative to the Maybach Olvar-B semi-automatic gearbox, but &quot;Waffenamt&quot; research and development department &quot;Wa Prüf 6&quot; found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There was also a program using the Simmering-Graz-Pauker Sla.16-cylinder diesel engine, but the war&#x27;s constraint on supplies and Germany&#x27;s capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5 cm KwK L/68. &quot;Wa Prüf 6&quot; did not support this as the &quot;Heer&quot; had not accepted the cannon. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Carl Zeiss AG stereoscopic rangefinder, heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure and air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.

==Operational history==

===Organisation===

Apart from research, training, and a five-tank attachment to the Panzer Lehr, the Tiger II was only issued to heavy tank battalions (&quot;schwere Panzer-Abteilungen&quot;) of the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;), or &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

A standard battalion (&quot;Abteilung&quot;) comprised 45 tanks:
Units that used the Tiger II were as follows:
:&quot;Heer: (s.H.Pz.Abt)&quot; 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511
:&quot;SS: (s.SS.Pz.Abt)&quot; 501, 502, 503

===Reliability and mobility===
Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets, an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle, and teething problems with the final drive and steering unit, both of which had been newly designed for the Tiger II. The final drive unit and the double radius steering gear were initially particularly prone to failures.

The new double-link track proved to be vulnerable to sideways stresses when the tank was driving on uneven terrain, as well as causing only every other sprocket tooth to engage with the track, leading to their rapid wear and potentially damaging the final drive. The inspector general of panzer troops, Wolfgang Thomale, said in a briefing on November 4, 1944, &quot;These complaints could be traced back to the new track, which, although a considerable production simplification, on the other hand entails a greater susceptibility of the Tiger.&quot; The engagement of only every second sprocket tooth was causing &quot;sudden jerks in the final drive, which cannot withstand these blows&quot;.
Henschel&#x27;s chief designer, Erwin Aders, wrote, &quot;The failure occurred because the Tiger II went into production without considering the test results.&quot; Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front.

The &quot;Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung&quot; 501 arrived on the Eastern Front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational; these faults were mostly due to final drive failures. The first five Tiger IIs delivered to the Panzer Lehr Division broke down before they could be used in combat, and were destroyed to prevent capture.

Henschel worked closely with crews to solve the problems, and with the introduction of modified seals, gaskets, drive train components and a new track and sprocket wheel design, as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance, the Tiger II could be maintained in a satisfactory operational condition. Statistics from 15 March 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the Tiger, almost equal to the 62 percent of the Panzer IV and better than the 48 percent of the Panther that were operational by this period.

The s.H.Pz.Abt 503 noted in an after-action report during operations in Hungary, November 1944:

Notwithstanding its initial reliability problems, the Tiger II was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle. Contemporary German records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility was as good as or better than most German or Allied tanks.

Lt Col H.A. Shields of the 66th Armored Regiment reported in 1945:

===Combat history===

The first combat use of the Tiger II was by the 1st Company of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion (&quot;s.H.Pz.Abt&quot;. 503) during the Battle of Normandy, opposing the Canadian offensive Operation Atlantic between Troarn and Demouville on 18 July 1944. Two were lost in combat, while the company commander&#x27;s tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during Operation Goodwood.

On the Eastern Front, it was first used on 12 August 1944 by the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion (&quot;s.H.Pz.Abt&quot;. 501) resisting the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive. It attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s. Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions, which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret, reducing capacity to 68. Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 August to ambushes and flank attacks by both Soviet T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks, and ISU-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain. The capture of three operational Tiger IIs allowed the Soviets to conduct tests at Kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses
On 15 October 1944, Tiger IIs of 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion played a crucial role during Operation Panzerfaust, supporting Otto Skorzeny&#x27;s troops in taking the Hungarian capital of Budapest, which ensured that the country remained with the Axis until the end of the war. The 503rd then took part in the Battle of Debrecen. The 503rd remained in the Hungarian theater of operations for 166 days, during which time it accounted for at least 121 Soviet tanks, 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces, five aircraft and a train. This was set against the loss of 25 Tiger IIs; ten were knocked out by Soviet troops and burned out, two were sent back to Vienna for a factory overhaul, while thirteen were blown up by their crews for various reasons, usually to prevent them from falling into enemy hands.

The Tiger II was also used in significant numbers, distributed into four heavy panzer battalions, during the Ardennes Offensive (also known as the &#x27;Battle of the Bulge&#x27;) of December 1944. At least 150 Tiger IIs were present, nearly a third of total production; most were lost over the course of the offensive.

Some Tiger IIs were also present during the Soviet Vistula–Oder and East Prussian Offensives in January 1945, as well as the German Lake Balaton Offensive in Hungary in March 1945, the Battle of the Seelow Heights in April 1945, and the Battle of Berlin at the end of the war.

The 103rd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion (&quot;s.SS Pz.Abt&quot;. 503) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from January to April 1945 on the Eastern Front for the loss of 45 Tiger IIs (most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel).

===Gun and armour performance===
The heavy armour and powerful long-range gun gave the Tiger II an advantage against all opposing Western Allied and Soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on. This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few M26 Pershings in 1945 and the few M4A3E2 Sherman &quot;Jumbo&quot; assault tanks with additional armour that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, as well as a few late Churchill models, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A &quot;Wa Prüf 1&quot; report estimated that the Tiger II&#x27;s frontal aspect was impervious to the Soviet 122 mm D-25T, one of the largest calibre tank guns of the war. Soviet testing found that the frontal glacis could be destroyed only by firing 3–4 shots at the weld joints from the ranges of 500–600m. Weld joints were found to be inferior quality to the Tiger I and Panther. An R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British (76.2 mm) QF 17-pounder gun, using armour-piercing discarding sabot shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II&#x27;s turret and nose (lower front hull) at respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this was presumably at the ideal 90 degrees and in combat the Tiger II was never penetrated frontally by the QF 17-Pounder.

As a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements. Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.

===Soviet wartime testing===

During August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near Sandomierz, and were soon moved to the testing grounds at Kubinka. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from mechanical breakdowns. The cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, causing overheated engines and gearbox failure. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10–15 km. The 8.8 cm KwK 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122 mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its &quot;colleague&quot;, a Tiger Ausf B&#x27;s turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152 mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate was inferior quality to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found the plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.

The expanded firing test states that the АР projectiles from the 100 mm BS-3 and 122 mm A-19 gun penetrated a Tiger Ausf B&#x27;s turret at ranges of 1000–1500 metres. However, the firing test against the turret front was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet, and penetrations were close to openings such as vision slits and the gun location. The penetrations to the right gun opening occurred after previous 100 mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage. The 100 mm BS-3 and 122 mm A-19 could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500–600 metres after 3–4 shots.

==Surviving vehicles==
The only working example is displayed at the &quot;Musée des Blindés&quot;, Saumur, France. It has the production turret and is accessible to the public. This tank belonged to the 1st Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. It was believed to have been abandoned by its crew on 23 August 1944, due to engine problems, at Brueil-en-Vexin, near Mantes-la-Jolie. It was salvaged by the French Army in September 1944 and then stored in a factory in Satory before being transferred to the museum in 1975. It was believed to have had turret number 123, but Colonel Michel Aubry, the founder of the museum, decided to put 233 on the turret in honour of the Tiger II that destroyed his Sherman tank at the end of the war. Unlike other captured German vehicles, this Tiger II was never used by the French Army.
Other survivors include:
* The Tank Museum, Dorset, UK: Tiger II with early production turret is on display. This vehicle was the second soft steel prototype made and did not see active service.
* Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, UK: Tiger II (production turret). This vehicle was from &quot;s.SS Pz.Abt. 501&quot;, with hull number 280093, turret number 104, and has a comprehensive coating of Zimmerit. It was claimed by Sergeant Roberts of A Squadron, 23rd Hussars, 11th Armoured Division in a Sherman tank near Beauvais, although it had already been disabled and abandoned by its crew following damage to its tracks and final drive. This vehicle is currently on display at The Tank Museum, in Dorset, UK.
* The Wheatcroft Collection, Leicestershire, UK. A private collector, Kevin Wheatcroft, is about to start a restoration/rebuild of a complete Tiger II. The project will include parts from many individual Tiger IIs, but many parts will be of new manufacture. Wheatcroft has stated that he has 70–80% of the original parts needed for a reconstruction and more parts are sourced continuously. Known and shown parts are a complete front glacis plate, 8.8 cm KwK 43 main armament, engine deck plates, approx. 1/3 hull (rear) in one part, a set of tracks, and approx. 2/3 of the left-side hull plate in two parts. The aim of the project is a complete Tiger II in running order.

* Deutsches Panzermuseum, Munster, Germany: Tiger II (production turret), hull number 280101. Originally bearing turret number 121 from s.SS.Pz.Abt 501, it was restored with a different number for unknown reasons.
* Mantes-la-Jolie, France. A more or less complete, but wrecked, Tiger II (production turret) is buried under regional road 913. Parts of the turret were recovered in a limited exploratory excavation in 2001. Further excavation halted for financial reasons. There are plans to fully excavate and restore this Tiger II for a Vexin battle memorial.

* Kubinka Tank Museum, Russia: Tiger II (production turret) with turret number 002 (502) captured at Oględów by the Red Army. 

* December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium: A cosmetically restored Tiger II (production turret), hull number 280273, built in October 1944. Turret number 213 from &quot;s.SS Pz.Abt 501&quot;. Displayed at the entrance to December 44 Museum Collections, a museum devoted entirely to the Battle of the Bulge. This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.
* U.S. Army Armor &amp; Cavalry Collection, Fort Moore, Georgia, United States: Tiger II (production turret), hull number 280243, built in September 1944. Turret number 332 from &quot;s.SS Pz.Abt. 501&quot;. Captured during the Battle of the Bulge by Sgt. Glenn D. George of the 740th Tank Battalion of the 1st US Army on December 24, 1944. The left side was cut open for educational purposes at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in the late 1940s. Was on display at the former &quot;Patton Museum of Cavalry &amp; Armor, Fort Knox KY, then under BRAC transferred to Fort Benning as Fort Moore was then known.
* Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full, Switzerland. This Tiger II (production turret) was previously displayed in the Thun Tank Museum, and was loaned to the Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full in September 2006). This tank was given to Switzerland by France after the war. Hull number 280215 from &quot;s.H.Pz.Abt 506&quot;. As of 2021, it is in the process of being restored to working order.
