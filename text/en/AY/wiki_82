<text>Loveless (stylized in lowercase) is the second studio album by the Irish-English rock band My Bloody Valentine. It was released on 4 November 1991 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and in the United States by Sire Records. The album was recorded between February 1989 and September 1991, with vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields leading sessions and experimenting with guitar vibrato, non-standard tunings, digital sampling, and meticulous production methods. The band recorded at nineteen different studios and hired several engineers during the album&#x27;s prolonged recording, with its final production cost rumoured to have reached £250,000 (equivalent to £560,000 in 2024).

Preceded by the EPs &quot;Glider&quot; (1990) and &quot;Tremolo&quot; (1991), &quot;Loveless&quot; reached number 24 on the UK Albums Chart and was widely praised by critics for its sonic innovations and Shields&#x27; &quot;virtual reinvention of the guitar&quot;. However, after its release, Creation owner Alan McGee dropped the band from the label as he found Shields too difficult to work with, a factor alleged to have contributed to the label&#x27;s eventual bankruptcy. My Bloody Valentine struggled to record a follow-up to the album and broke up in 1997, making &quot;Loveless&quot; their last full-length release until their eventual reunited effort &quot;m b v&quot; in 2013.

Since its release, &quot;Loveless&quot; has been widely cited by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time, a landmark work of the shoegaze subgenre, and as a significant influence on various subsequent artists. In 2012, it was reissued as a two-CD set, including remastered tracks and a previously unreleased half-inch analogue tape version, and peaked on several international charts. In 2013, &quot;Loveless&quot; was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

==Recording==

My Bloody Valentine were scheduled to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London for February 1989, and intended to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Guitarist Kevin Shields said their label Creation Records believed the album could be recorded in five days. According to Shields, &quot;when it became clear that wasn&#x27;t going to happen, they freaked&quot;. After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant in Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that Robbins &quot;was just there to press the buttons&quot;. Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon&#x27;s main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. According to Shields, the session tapes were &quot;confiscated&quot; by the studio &quot;three or four times&quot; due to lack of payment.

Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the &quot;Glider&quot; EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the &quot;Glider&quot; song &quot;Soon&quot; at Trident2 studio in Victoria; the song later appeared as the closing track on &quot;Loveless&quot;. Shields said of Moulder, &quot;As soon as we worked with him we realized we&#x27;d love to some more!&quot; When the group returned to work on the album, Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted to perform tasks such as micing the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told &quot;We&#x27;re so on top of this you don&#x27;t even have to come to work.&quot; Shields said that &quot;these engineerswith the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Duttwere all just the people who came with the studio... everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them.&quot; The band gave credit on the album sleeve to all present during the recordings, &quot;even if all they did was fix tea&quot;, according to Shields.
During the spring of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left to work with the bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt assisted in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending a single day at a studio before deciding it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP titled &quot;Tremolo&quot;. Like &quot;Glider&quot;, &quot;Tremolo&quot; contained a song&quot;To Here Knows When&quot;that later appeared on &quot;Loveless&quot;. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 to tour in support of the release of &quot;Glider&quot;. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point, Creation was concerned by how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the Jesus and Mary Chain. In an interview with &quot;Select&quot;, Shields explained the stop-start nature of his recording, using &quot;When You Sleep&quot; as an example:
The vocals were taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991, the first time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was involved in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and communicated with the engineers only when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, &quot;We weren&#x27;t allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You&#x27;d have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top.&quot; On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: &quot;Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung&quot;.

In July 1991, Creation agreed to relocate the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records was unable to pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band&#x27;s equipment. Dutt recalled, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out.&quot; Shields&#x27; unpredictable behavior, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect on Creation&#x27;s finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later said she had been desperate to leave the project, while Creation&#x27;s second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown. Green recalled, &quot;It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going &#x27;You have to deliver me this record.&#x27;&quot;

Shields and Butcher became afflicted with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for further weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows, which Shields dismissed as &quot;ill-informed hysteria&quot;. Although Alan McGee was still positive about his investment, the 29-year-old Green, who by this time was opening the label&#x27;s morning post &quot;shaking with fear&quot;, became a concern to his co-workers. Publicist Laurence Verfaillie, aware of the label&#x27;s inability to cover further studio bills, recalled Green&#x27;s hair turning grey overnight, which she attributed to the album.

With the vocal tracks completed, a final mix of the album was undertaken with engineers Dick Meaney (the Jesus and Mary Chain) and Darren Allison (Spiritualized) at the Church in Crouch End, the nineteenth studio in which &quot;Loveless&quot; had been worked on. The album was edited on an aged machine that had been used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s; its computer threw the entire album out of phase. Shields was able to put it back together from memory, but took thirteen days to master the album rather than the usual one, to Creation&#x27;s dismay.

As the previously prolific band were unusually quiet, the British music press began to speculate. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; calculated that the total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that the estimated cost and Creation&#x27;s near-bankruptcy were a myth exaggerated by McGee. According to Shields, &quot;the amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. £160,000 was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent&quot;. In Green&#x27;s opinion, the estimate made by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was understated by £20,000, and that &quot;once you&#x27;d even got it recorded and mixed, the very act of compiling, EQ-ing, et cetera took weeks on its own&quot;. In December 1991, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply &quot;money to live on&quot; over three years, with the album itself costing only &quot;a few thousand&quot;. He also claimed that the album represented only four months&#x27; work over two years. He said that most of the money spent came from the band&#x27;s own funds, while &quot;Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it, and that&#x27;s it. They never showed us any accounts, and then they got bought out by Sony&quot;.

==Music==

While Butcher contributed about a third of its lyrics, most of the music on &quot;Loveless&quot; was written and performed by Shields; according to Shields, he is the only musician on the album apart from &quot;Touched&quot;. Shields assumed Butcher&#x27;s guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher said she had not minded because she felt she &quot;was never a great guitarist&quot;. Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit. Googe said, &quot;At the beginning I used to go down [to the studio] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less.&quot; Butcher explained, &quot;for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process.&quot; Moulder said &quot;It wasn&#x27;t collaborative at all... Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it.&quot;

Most of the album was heavily influenced by Neil Young, though &quot;What You Want&quot; was Shields&#x27; homage to the Cure song &quot;Just like Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Loveless&quot; was largely recorded in mono sound, as Shields felt it important that the album&#x27;s sound consisted of &quot;the guitar smack bang in the middle and no chorus, no modulation effect&quot;. Shields wavers his guitar&#x27;s tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes to the band&#x27;s distinctive sound. This techniquenicknamed &quot;glide guitar&quot;bends the guitar strings slightly in and out of tune. Shields said, &quot;People were thinking it&#x27;s hundreds of guitars, when it&#x27;s actually got less guitar tracks than most people&#x27;s demo tapes have.&quot; Unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals; Shields said, &quot;No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm.&quot;

Shields aimed to use &quot;very simple minimal effects&quot;, which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, &quot;The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way you can get away with a lot more when you mess around with the contents.&quot; In a 1992 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on &quot;I Only Said&quot; by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. Asked if he could have achieved the effect more easily using a wah-wah pedal, Shields said, &quot;In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach.&quot;

All but two of the drum tracks were built from samples of tracks performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig. Because Ó Cíosóig was suffering from physical ailments during the recording, he recorded samples of various drum patterns he was able to perform. According to Shields, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s exactly what Colm would have done, it just took longer to do.&quot; Ó Cíosóig recovered enough to actively participate in the recording of three songs: &quot;Touched&quot; (which was composed and programmed entirely by him), and recording live drums on &quot;Only Shallow&quot; and &quot;Come in Alone.&quot; Shields believes that listeners are unable to tell the difference between Ó Cíosóig&#x27;s live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously &quot;sampled&quot; sound, such as the dance-oriented &quot;Soon&quot;. The album makes extensive use of samples; according to Shields, &quot;Most of the samples are feedback. We learnt from guitar feedback, with lots of distortion, that you can make &quot;any&quot; instrument, any one that you can imagine.&quot; In an interview with Sound on Sound, Shields said his approach to drum sampling was informed, in part, by hip hop artists like The Bomb Squad and their production for Public Enemy. &quot;I was hearing really cool music made by hip-hop groups that were sampling stuff... [T]he whole thing about sampling back in those days is that people really started to mess with the key... I was hearing a lot of music that you just didn’t really know what was creating that sound.&quot;

The vocals, equally provided by Shields and Butcher, are kept relatively low in the mix. They are for the most part highly pitched, although at times Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album&#x27;s vocals, he &quot;couldn&#x27;t tolerate really clear vocals, where you just hear one voice&quot;, thus &quot;it had to be more like a &quot;sound&quot;.&quot; Butcher said of her &quot;dreamy, sensual&quot; style vocals: &quot;Often when we do vocals, it&#x27;s 7:30 in the morning; I&#x27;ve usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing.&quot; To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig sampled Butcher&#x27;s voice and reused it as instrumentation. The layered vocals on &quot;When You Sleep&quot; were born out of frustration with trying to get the right take. Shields commented that &quot;The vocals sound like that because it became boring and too destructive trying to get the right vocal. So I decided to put all the vocals in. &quot;(It had been sung 12 or 13 times)&quot;.&quot; He explained:
The lyrics are deliberately obscure; Shields joked that he considered rating various attempts to decipher the words on the band&#x27;s website according to accuracy. He claims that he and Butcher &quot;spent way more time on the lyrics than ever on the music&quot;. The words were often written in late-night eight- to ten-hour-long sessions before the pair were due to record the vocals. They worked diligently to ensure the lyrics were not lacklustre, but made few changes; Shields said, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing worse than bad lyrics.&quot; Nonetheless, pressed by &quot;Select&quot;″s David Cavanagh to reveal just the first line of &quot;Loomer&quot;, Butcher refused, and Shields claimed to have &quot;absolutely no idea&quot; what she was singing.

==Tour==

After the album&#x27;s release, My Bloody Valentine toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a &quot;unique chapter in live music&quot;. To recreate the higher tones from &quot;Loveless&quot;, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According to a friend of the band, &quot;She had a little skirt on, black tights... she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock.&quot;

The tour became infamous for its volume. &quot;NME&quot; editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as &quot;more like torture than entertainment... I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling&quot;. During the following US tour, Shields and Butcher tested their audiences&#x27; ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. According to critic Mark Kemp; &quot;After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what&#x27;s going on. After another minute it&#x27;s total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over.&quot; The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme white noise played during &quot;You Made Me Realise&quot;. In December 2000, &quot;Mojo&quot; rated the tour the second loudest in history.

==Aftermath==

Despite expectations for the band to break through in the wake of the critical success of &quot;Loveless&quot;, they fell apart soon after and recorded only sporadically in the following two decades. Unable to deliver a third album, Shields isolated himself and &quot;went crazy,&quot; drawing comparisons in the music press to the behavior of musicians such as Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd. The other band members went their own ways; Butcher contributed vocals to Collapsed Lung&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;Board Game&quot; and two tracks (&quot;Ballad Night&quot; and &quot;Casino Kisschase&quot;) from the band&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Cooler&quot;. Googe was sighted working as a cab driver in London and formed the supergroup Snowpony in 1996. Ó Cíosóig joined Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions, while Shields collaborated with Yo La Tengo, Primal Scream and Dinosaur Jr.

Shields recorded new music in his home studio, but abandoned it. According to sources, some of the music was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields said, &quot;We did an album&#x27;s worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn&#x27;t got that spirit, that life in it.&quot; He said later, &quot;I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. &#x27;Why&#x27;d you do that?&#x27; The answer is, it wasn&#x27;t as good [as &quot;Loveless&quot;]. And I always promised myself I&#x27;d never do that, put out a worse record.&quot; He told &quot;Magnet&quot; of his certainty in recording another My Bloody Valentine album, and attributed the sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, &quot;m b v&quot;, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after &quot;Loveless&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Although Shields feared a critical panning, &quot;Loveless&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;An album without parallel&quot;, wrote Andrew Perry in &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;Its creative inspiration defies belief. Though &#x27;To Here Knows When&#x27; is pretty well the weirdest track of the eleven, that glorious distortion gives a fair signal of what to expectthe unexpected. Everything you hear confounds your idea of how a pop song should be played, arranged and produced.&quot; Martin Aston in &quot;Q&quot; wrote that &quot;The instrumental &#x27;Touched&#x27; is especially startling, like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, &quot;Loveless&quot; amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; reviewer Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the &quot;blueprint&quot; for the shoegaze genre, and wrote: &quot;with &quot;Loveless&quot; you could&#x27;ve expected the Irish / English partnership to succumb to self-parody or mimic The Scene That&#x27;s Delighted To Eat Quiche [...] But no, &quot;Loveless&quot; fires a silver-coated bullet into the future, daring all-comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods, feelings, emotion, styles and, yes, innovations.&quot; While Fadele expressed some disappointment that the group seemed to disassociate themselves from dance music and reggae basslines, he concluded: &quot;&quot;Loveless&quot; ups the ante, and, however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities, My Bloody Valentine, failings and all, deserve more than your respect.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; writer Simon Reynolds praised the album, and wrote that &quot;Loveless&quot; &quot;[reaffirms] how unique, how peerless MBV are.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Along with Mercury Rev&#x27;s &quot;Yerself is Steam&quot;, &#x27;Loveless&#x27; is the outermost, innermost, uttermost rock record of 1991.&quot; Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that &quot;while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined what they already were, they&#x27;ve failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond.&quot;

In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ira Robbins wrote that &quot;despite the record&#x27;s intense ability to disorientthis is real do-not-adjust-your-set stuffthe effect is strangely uplifting. &quot;Loveless&quot; oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly pulverizes the frantic stress of life.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot wrote that the band had &quot;written a new vocabulary for the guitar, and perhaps given it another 10 years of life as rock&#x27;s central instrument&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; gave &quot;Loveless&quot; a mixed review; writer Jim Greer felt it was &quot;standard-ish and dull... The warped music is a cool idea and I recommend the albumbut not on the basis of the singing or the songs.&quot;

While Creation were pleased with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon realised that although, in the words of plugger James Kyllo, &quot;it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn&#x27;t sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it.&quot; Alan McGee liked the record, but said, &quot;It was quite clear that we couldn&#x27;t bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [Shields] wouldn&#x27;t do exactly the same again. That&#x27;s enough. Lets step back&quot;. Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of &quot;Loveless&quot; difficultthere would be no singles, and the band&#x27;s name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, &quot;I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I&#x27;ve stolen my father&#x27;s money. And they were so... not understanding of anybody else&#x27;s position.&quot; Alan McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album&#x27;s release because he could not bear working with Shields again; &quot;It was either him or me,&quot; he told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2004. &quot;Loveless&quot; peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; estimated that &quot;Loveless&quot; had sold 225,000 copies.

===Accolades===

&quot;Loveless&quot; has been a consistent critical favourite. It came in at number 14 in the 1991 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. In 1999, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Loveless&quot; the best album of the 1990s. However, in its 2003 revision of the list, the album was moved to number two, swapping places with Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;. A 2022 listing restored it to the top spot. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also named &quot;Loveless&quot; the greatest shoegaze album of all time. In 2000, the album was voted number 63 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 219 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 221 in a 2012 revised list and 73 in another revised list published in 2020. In 2004, &quot;The Observer&quot; ranked it at number 20 in its &quot;100 Greatest British Albums&quot; list, declaring it &quot;the last great extreme rock album.&quot;

The album was ranked at number 22 on &quot;Spin&#x27;s&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Albums 1985–2005,&quot; with Chuck Klosterman writing that &quot;whenever anyone uses the phrase &quot;swirling guitars&quot;, this record is why. A testament to studio production and single-minded perfectionism, &quot;Loveless&quot; has a layered, inverted thickness that makes harsh sounds soft and fragile moments vast.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Loveless&quot; topped &quot;The Irish Times&quot;″ &quot;Top 40 Irish Albums of All Time&quot; critics&#x27; list, and in 2013, it placed third in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;″s &quot;Top 30 Irish Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 2014, it placed ninth on the Alternative Nation site&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Underrated 90&#x27;s Alternative Rock Albums&quot; list. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 18 on its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Paste&quot; named it the eighth-best album of the 1990s and the second-best dream pop album of all time.

==Legacy==

&quot;Loveless&quot; has been influential on a large number of genres and artists. &quot;Clash&quot; called the album &quot;the magnum opus of the shoegazing genre... it raised the bar so high that it subsequently collapsed under its own weight,&quot; leading to the dissipation of the style. Critic Jim DeRogatis wrote that &quot;the forward-looking sounds of this unique disc have positioned the band as one of the most influential and inspiring bands since the Velvet Underground.&quot; Authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell wrote that the album &quot;might be so progressive that nothing else will ever match it.&quot; &quot;Metro Times&quot; called the album &quot;the high-water mark of shoegaze,&quot; writing that its &quot;dense production and hypnotic atmosphere drugged listeners with its sound&#x27;s lovely oxymoron: at once hard and soft, up-tempo and languid, lascivious and frigid.&quot; Paul Lester of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; of UK avant-rock.&quot;

Musician Brian Eno said that &quot;Soon&quot; &quot;set a new standard for pop. It&#x27;s the vaguest music ever to have been a hit.&quot; Robert Smith of the Cure discovered &quot;Loveless&quot; after a period of almost exclusively listening to disco and/or Irish bands such as the Dubliners as a means of avoiding his contemporaries and said, &quot;[My Bloody Valentine] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album &quot;Loveless&quot; is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It&#x27;s the sound of someone [Shields] who is so driven that they&#x27;re demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent.&quot; Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins told &quot;Spin&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s rare in guitar-based music that somebody does something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, &#x27;How the fuck are they doing this?&#x27; And, of course, it&#x27;s way simpler than anybody would imagine.&quot; Greg Puciato of the Dillinger Escape Plan named &quot;Loveless&quot; one of the albums that changed his life, recalling: &quot;When I was younger, I only listened to riffs and vocals and a more traditional style of composition. So when I heard this My Bloody Valentine record it was so abstract and strange in artistic terms that it ended up taking me on other musical paths.&quot;

The band Japancakes recorded a cover album of &quot;Loveless&quot; which includes every song from the original in the same sequence. The cover album was released on Darla Records in 2007.

In 2013, Kenny Feinstein of the bluegrass band Water Tower released a solo cover album of &quot;Loveless&quot; entitled &quot;Loveless: Hurts to Love&quot; (Fluff &amp; Gravy). The album is mostly acoustic and features a wide assortment of instruments including guitar, piano, mandolin, violin, bass, cello, harmonium, and dobro. Feinstein plays most of the instruments on the album himself and provides lead vocals. Also appearing on the album are musician Jeff Kazor of The Crooked Jades and engineer Bruce Kaphan who helped Feinstein create an &quot;acoustic wall of sound&quot; that emulates the original album&#x27;s distorted layers.

<text>Zara Anne Elizabeth Tindall (; born 15 May 1981) is a British equestrian, Olympian, socialite and member of the British royal family. She is the daughter of Anne, Princess Royal, and Captain Mark Phillips, and the eldest niece of King Charles III. She was born sixth in the line of succession to the British throne during the reign of her maternal grandmother Elizabeth II, becoming 22nd in line as of 2025.

Tindall won the Eventing World Championship in Aachen in 2006. That same year, she was voted 2006 BBC Sports Personality of the Year by the public. In 2012, she carried the Olympic flame at Cheltenham Racecourse on her horse Toytown. As a member of the Great Britain Eventing Team, she won a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, presented to her by her mother. She married rugby union player Mike Tindall in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Zara Anne Elizabeth Phillips was born on 15 May 1981 in the Lindo Wing of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. She was baptised on 27 July 1981, at Windsor Castle. Her first name was suggested by her uncle, Charles, the then Prince of Wales. Her godparents are her maternal uncle, the Duke of York; the Countess of Lichfield; Helen, Lady Stewart, the wife of Sir Jackie Stewart; Andrew Parker Bowles; and Hugh Thomas. She has an elder brother, Peter, and two younger half-sisters, Felicity Wade (née Tonkin; from her father&#x27;s affair with Heather Tonkin) and Stephanie Phillips, from her father&#x27;s second marriage to Sandy Pflueger.

Phillips attended Beaudesert Park School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and Port Regis School in Shaftesbury, Dorset, before following other members of the royal family in attending Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland. During her schooldays, Phillips excelled at many sporting activities, representing her schools in hockey, athletics, and gymnastics. She later studied at the University of Exeter and qualified as a physiotherapist.

==Equestrianism==
After university, Phillips began to pursue an equestrian career, in the footsteps of her parents. In June 2003, she announced that she had secured a sponsorship deal with Cantor Index, a leading company in spread betting, to help cover the costs of her equestrian career. She finished as runner-up at Burghley Horse Trials in 2003 in her first four-star event. Tindall missed the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens after her horse suffered an injury during training.

Riding her horse Toytown, Tindall collected individual and team gold medals at the 2005 European Eventing Championship in Blenheim, and individual gold and team silver medals at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games in Aachen, Germany, making her the Eventing World Champion until 2010. The same year, after her win in Germany, she was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year by the British viewing public, an award her mother had won in 1971. She was also appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours for her services to equestrianism. She won team gold at the 2007 European Eventing Championships in Italy, but did not defend her individual title in the show-jumping phase of the competition.

The British Olympic Association announced that Tindall would ride Toytown for the British equestrian team at the Beijing Olympic Games 2008 in Hong Kong; however, Toytown was injured during training and she was forced to withdraw from the team.

On 25 October 2008, Tindall fell from her horse, Tsunami II, at the 15th fence of a cross-country event at Pau, France, and broke her right collarbone. The horse broke her neck after she tipped over the hedge and was put down. In July 2010 a range of equestrian clothing Tindall designed for Musto Outdoor Clothing, named ZP176 after Tindall&#x27;s team number when she first represented her country, was launched.
She competed in the 2012 London Olympic Games on High Kingdom, and won a silver medal in the team event. Tindall finished second at Luhmühlen Horse Trials 2013, on her top horse High Kingdom. At the World Equestrian Games in 2014, Tindall and High Kingdom were part of the British team that won team silver.
Tindall stopped using her maiden name, Phillips, in March 2016. She competed for the first time as Zara Tindall during her unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. In 2017, she won the third place at the Kentucky Three-Day Event on High Kingdom, before High Kingdom retired from the sport in 2018. In January 2020 she became a non-executive director of the Cheltenham Racecourse. In August 2020, Tindall was selected for her first appearance on the British Team competing at the FEI Nations Cup in Le Pin au Haras, France. In October 2021, Tindall competed in Maryland 5 Star at Fair Hill and finished at 11th place with score 30.4, riding Gleadhill House Stud&#x27;s 12-year-old horse Class Affair. In May 2022, Tindall won the advanced class at the Chatsworth Horse Trials, riding Class Affair.

==Charity work==
Tindall frequently supports and attends events for various charitable causes, mainly revolving around spinal injuries, equestrianism, and children&#x27;s causes. In 2005, she auctioned one of her evening gowns, worn at the London premiere of the film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, to raise money for tsunami relief. She also undertook a visit to New Zealand in her role as patron of The Catwalk Trust. From 1998 to 2005, she served as the president of Club 16–24, a group which encourages young people to take an interest in horse racing. She is associated with Inspire, a Salisbury-based medical research charity which helps to improve the quality of life of people with spinal cord injuries. She is patron of Lucy Air Ambulance for Children, which is the UK&#x27;s first dedicated air transfer service to fly critically ill infants and children to hospitals for urgent care.

Tindall has appeared at events for The Caudwell Charitable Trust, which targets children with special needs, disabilities and serious illnesses. In 2006, she took part in a special charity day for Cantor Index, 658 of whose staff were killed in the 11 September 2001 attacks. In 2007, she became patron of the Mark Davies Injured Riders Fund. To help with Sport Relief 2008 she posed for a portrait by artist Jack Vettriano. In 2009, she attended a celebrity poker tournament in Monaco in aid of Darfur, Sudan. In October 2010, she attended a celebrity poker tournament in London, in aid of Cancer Research UK, of which she is patron. In 2011, she auctioned another evening gown in aide of the Christchurch earthquake appeal, raising £22,000. In 2013, she visited the Stroud Maternity Ward to celebrate their 60th anniversary. In 2014, Tindall lent her support to the #bringbackourgirls campaign. In April 2020, Tindall participated in an Equestrian Relief initiative to provide increased personal protective equipment for National Health Service workers.

==Other activities==
In June 2015, Tindall launched an equestrian-themed jewellery collection, named &quot;Zara Phillips Collection&quot;, in collaboration with Australian designer John Calleija.
On 17 September 2022, during the period of official mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, Tindall joined her brother and six cousins to mount a 15-minute vigil around the coffin of the Queen, as it lay in state at Westminster Hall. On 19 September, with her husband Mike and daughter Mia, she joined other family members at the state funeral.

==Personal life==

Zara Phillips met rugby union player Mike Tindall, who was playing for the England national team, during their Rugby World Cup-winning campaign in Australia in 2003. They became engaged in 2010. As was at that time required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the Queen gave her consent to the marriage in a meeting of the Privy Council on 10 May 2011. The couple held a celebration on the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; prior to the wedding.

They married on 30 July 2011 at the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland, with 400 guests in attendance. Her off-the-rack ivory silk dress designed by Stewart Parvin featured &quot;a chevron-pleated bodice, a dropped waist, and a &#x27;cathedral-length&#x27; train&quot;. The Meander Tiara was lent to her and secured the veil. A reception was held at Holyrood Palace following the service.

The Tindalls lived in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, before moving to Aston Farm, a seven-bedroom farmhouse next to the Princess Royal&#x27;s Gatcombe Park estate. Tindall gave birth to a daughter, Mia Grace on 17 January 2014 at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, who was born 16th, later 23rd in the line of succession. Tindall&#x27;s next two pregnancies ended in miscarriage. Their second daughter, Lena Elizabeth was born on 18 June 2018 at the Stroud Maternity Hospital, and was born 19th, later 24th in the line of succession. Their third child, son Lucas Philip, was born on 21 March 2021 at the family home in Gatcombe Park, and was born 22nd, later 25th in the line of succession. Tindall is godmother to Prince George of Wales, the son of her cousin William, Prince of Wales.

In December 2000, Tindall was involved in a serious car crash near Bourton-on-the-Water, escaping serious injury after overturning her Land Rover. In January 2020, she was banned from driving for six months after accumulating 12 points on her driving licence. It was also announced that the court was fining her &quot;£666 plus costs and a victim surcharge of £151&quot;.

<doc id="196343" wikidata="Q268474" url="?curid=196343" title="John Owen (theologian)">
<text>John Owen (161624 August 1683) was an English Puritan Nonconformist church leader, theologian, and vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford. One of the most prominent theologians in England during his lifetime, Owen was a prolific author who wrote articles, treatises, Biblical commentaries, poetry, children&#x27;s catechisms, and other works. Many of Owen&#x27;s works reflect his Calvinist interpretation of Scripture. Owen is still widely read by Calvinists today, and is known particularly for his writings on sin and human depravity. 

He was briefly a member of parliament for the university&#x27;s constituency, sitting in the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654 to 1655. Owen&#x27;s support for the parliamentarians during the English Civil War resulted in him preaching a sermon before parliament on the day following the execution of Charles I, and later serving as an aide and chaplain to Oliver Cromwell.

==Early life==
Of Welsh descent, Owen was born at Stadhampton in Oxfordshire, and was educated at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford (B.A. 1632, M.A. 1635); at the time the college was noted, according to Thomas Fuller, for its metaphysicians. A Puritan by upbringing, in 1637 Owen was driven from Oxford by Laud&#x27;s new statutes, and became chaplain and tutor in the family of Sir Robert Dormer and then in that of Lord Lovelace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War he sided with the parliament, and thus lost both his place and the prospects of succeeding to his Welsh Royalist uncle&#x27;s fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, troubled by religious questions. His doubts were removed by a sermon preached by a stranger in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury where he had gone intending to hear Edmund Calamy the Elder. Owen&#x27;s first publication, &quot;The Display of Arminianism&quot; (synergism) (1642), was a spirited defence of Calvinism (monergism). It was dedicated to the committee of religion, and gained him the living of Fordham in Essex, from which a &quot;scandalous minister&quot; had been ejected. At Fordham he remained engrossed in the work of his parish and writing only &quot;The Duty of Pastors&quot; and &quot;People Distinguished&quot; until 1646, when, the old incumbent dying, the presentation lapsed to the patron, who gave it to someone else.

In 1644, Owen married Mary Rooke (d. 1675). The couple had 11 children, ten of whom died in infancy. One daughter survived to adulthood, married, and shortly thereafter died of consumption. Eighteen months after his first wife&#x27;s death, he married Dorothy D&#x27;Oyley, the wealthy widow of Thomas D&#x27;Oyley, a member of the landlords&#x27; family at Stadhampton.

==Career==
On 29 April he preached before the Long Parliament. In this sermon, and in his &quot;Country Essay for the Practice of Church Government&quot;, which he appended to it, his tendency to break away from Presbyterianism to the Independent or Congregational system is seen. Like John Milton, he saw little to choose between &quot;new presbyter&quot; and &quot;old priest.&quot;

He became pastor at Coggeshall in Essex, with a large influx of Flemish tradesmen. His adoption of Congregational principles did not affect his theological position, and in 1647 he again argued against Arminianism in &quot;The Death of Death in the Death of Christ&quot;, which drew him into long debate with Richard Baxter. He made the friendship of Fairfax while the latter was besieging Colchester, and addressed the army there against religious persecution. He was chosen to preach to parliament on the day after the execution of King Charles I, and succeeded in fulfilling his task without directly mentioning that event.

Another sermon preached on 29 April, a plea for sincerity of religion in high places, won not only the thanks of parliament but the friendship of Oliver Cromwell, who took Owen to Ireland as his chaplain, that he might regulate the affairs of Trinity College, Dublin. He pleaded with the House of Commons for the religious needs of Ireland as some years earlier he had pleaded for those of Wales. In 1650 he accompanied Cromwell on his Scottish campaign. In March 1651, Cromwell, as Chancellor of Oxford University, gave him the deanery of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and made him Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in September 1652; in both offices he succeeded the Presbyterian, Edward Reynolds.

During his eight years of official Oxford life Owen showed himself a firm disciplinarian, thorough in his methods, though, as John Locke testifies, the Aristotelian traditions in education underwent no change. With Philip Nye he unmasked the popular astrologer, William Lilly, and in spite of his share in condemning two Quakeresses to be whipped for disturbing the peace, his rule was not intolerant. Anglican services were conducted here and there, and at Christ Church itself the Anglican chaplain remained in the college. While little encouragement was given to a spirit of free inquiry, Puritanism at Oxford was not simply an attempt to force education and culture into &quot;the leaden moulds of Calvinistic theology.&quot; Owen, unlike many of his contemporaries, was more interested in the New Testament than in the Old. During his Oxford years he wrote &quot;Justitia Divina&quot; (1653), an exposition of the dogma that God cannot forgive sin without an atonement; &quot;Communion with God&quot; (1657), &quot;Doctrine of the Saints&#x27; Perseverance&quot; (1654), his final attack on Arminianism; &quot;Vindiciae Evangelicae&quot; (1655), a treatise written by order of the Council of State against Socinianism as expounded by John Biddle; &quot;On the Mortification of Sin in Believers&quot; (1656), an introspective and analytic work; &quot;Schism&quot; (1657), one of the most readable of all his writings; &quot;Of Temptation&quot; (1658), an attempt to recall Puritanism to its cardinal spiritual attitude from the jarring anarchy of sectarianism and the pharisaism which had followed on popularity and threatened to destroy the early simplicity.
==Political life==
Besides his academic and literary concerns, Owen was continually involved in affairs of state. In 1651, on 24 October (after Worcester), he preached the thanksgiving sermon before parliament. In 1652 he sat on a council to consider the condition of Protestantism in Ireland. In October 1653 he was one of several ministers whom Cromwell summoned to a consultation as to church union. In December, the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by Oxford University. In the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654 he sat, for a short time, as the sole member of parliament for Oxford University, and, with Baxter, was placed on the committee for settling the &quot;fundamentals&quot; necessary for the toleration promised in the Instrument of Government. In the same year he was chairman of a committee on Scottish Church affairs. He was, too, one of the Triers, and appears to have behaved with kindness and moderation in that capacity. As vice-chancellor he acted with readiness and spirit when a Royalist rising in Wiltshire broke out in 1655; his adherence to Cromwell, however, was by no means slavish, for he drew up, at the request of Desborough and Pride, a petition against his receiving the kingship. Thus, when Richard Cromwell succeeded his father as chancellor, Owen lost his vice-chancellorship. In 1658 he took a leading part in the conference of Independents which drew up the Savoy Declaration (the doctrinal standard of Congregationalism which was based upon the Westminster Confession of Faith).

On Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658, Owen joined the Wallingford House party, and though he denied any share in the deposition of Richard Cromwell, he preferred the idea of a simple republic to that of a protectorate. He assisted in the restoration of the Rump Parliament, and, when George Monck began his march into England, Owen, in the name of the Independent churches, to which Monck was supposed to belong, and who were anxious about his intentions, wrote to dissuade him. In March 1660, the Presbyterian party being uppermost, Owen was deprived of his deanery, which was given back to Reynolds. He retired to Stadham, where he wrote various controversial and theological works, in particular his laborious &quot;Theologoumena Pantodapa&quot;, a history of the rise and progress of theology. The respect in which many of the authorities held his intellectual eminence won him an immunity denied to other Nonconformists. In 1661 the celebrated &quot;Fiat Lux&quot;, a work by the Franciscan friar John Vincent Cane, was published; in it, the oneness and beauty of Roman Catholicism are contrasted with the confusion and multiplicity of Protestant sects. At Clarendon&#x27;s request Owen answered this in 1662 in his &quot;Animadversions&quot;; and so great was the success of that work that he was offered preferment if he would conform. Owen&#x27;s condition was liberty to all who disagreed in doctrine with the Church of England; nothing therefore came of the negotiation.

In 1663, Owen was invited by the Congregational churches in Boston, Massachusetts, to become their minister, but declined. The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts drove him to London; and in 1666, after the Great Fire, he, like other leading Nonconformist ministers, set up a room for public service and gathered a congregation, composed chiefly of the old Commonwealth officers. An 1862 source says &quot;this congregation was distinguished more for the rank and worth of its members than for its numbers&quot; and gives as examples John Desborough, the soldier who married Cromwell&#x27;s sister; James Berry (Major-General), another soldier; Charles Fleetwood, the soldier who married Cromwell&#x27;s daughter; Bridget Bendish, Fleetwood&#x27;s stepdaughter; Sir John Hartopp and his wife, Fleetwood&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth; Mary, Lady Abney of Abney Park, next door neighbour to the Fleetwoods; and Lady Haversham.

Meanwhile, Owen was incessantly writing; and in 1667 he published his &quot;Catechism&quot;, which led to a proposal, &quot;more acute than diplomatic&quot;, from Baxter for union. Various papers passed, and after a year the attempt was closed by the following laconical note from Owen: &quot;I am still a well-wisher to these mathematics.&quot; It was now, too, that he published the first part of his vast work upon the Epistle to the Hebrews, together with his &quot;Practical Exposition upon Psalm 130&quot; (1668) and his searching book on &quot;Indwelling Sin&quot;, which Alexander Whyte described as &quot;one of the greatest works of the Puritan period.&quot;

In 1669, Owen wrote a spirited remonstrance to the Congregationalists in New England, who, under the influence of Presbyterianism, had shown themselves persecutors. At home, too, he was busy in the same cause. In 1669 Samuel Parker&#x27;s &quot;Discourse of Ecclesiastical Politie&quot; attacked the Nonconformists with clumsy intolerance. Owen answered him (&quot;Truth and Innocence Vindicated&quot;, 1669); Parker replied offensively in his &quot;Defence and Continuation of the Ecclesiastical Politie&quot; (1671). Then Andrew Marvell finally disposed of Parker with banter and satire in &quot;The Rehearsal Transpros&#x27;d&quot; (1672 and 1673). Owen himself produced a tract &quot;On the Trinity&quot; (1669), and &quot;Christian Love and Peace&quot; (1672).

On the revival of the Conventicle Acts in 1670, Owen was appointed to draw up a paper of reasons which was submitted to the House of Lords in protest. In this or the following year Harvard College invited him to become its president; he received similar invitations from some of the Dutch universities. When King Charles II issued his Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, Owen drew up an address of thanks; Owen was one of the first preachers at the weekly lectures which the Independents and Presbyterians jointly held at Princes&#x27; Hall in Broad Street. He was respected by many of the nobility, and during 1674 both King Charles II and his brother King James II assured him of their good wishes to the dissenters. Charles gave him 1000 guineas to relieve those on whom the severe laws had pressed, and he was able to procure the release of John Bunyan, whose preaching he admired. In 1674 Owen was attacked by William Sherlock, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. From this time until 1680, he was engaged on his ministry and writing. He had Alexander Shields as his amanuensis for a while.

==Later life==
The chief of his later writings were &quot;On Apostasy&quot; (1676), a sad account of religion under the Restoration; &quot;On the Holy Spirit&quot; (1677–78) and &quot;The Doctrine of Justification&quot; (1677). In 1680, however, Stillingfleet having on 11 May preached his sermon on &quot;The Mischief of Separation,&quot; Owen defended the Nonconformists from the charge of schism in his &quot;Brief Vindication&quot;. Baxter and Howe also answered Stillingfleet, who replied in &quot;The Unreasonableness of Separation&quot;. Owen again answered this, and then left the controversy to a swarm of eager combatants. From this time to his death he was occupied with continual writing, disturbed only by suffering from kidney stones and asthma, and by the absurd charge of being concerned in the Rye House Plot. His most important work was his Treatise on Evangelical Churches, in which were contained his latest views regarding church government. He died at Ealing, just twenty-one years after he had gone out with so many others on St Bartholomew&#x27;s day in 1662, and was buried on 4 September 1683 in Bunhill Fields.

The theology of justification as taught by John Owen was used by the Dutch minister Alexander Comrie (1706–74) of Woubrugge in his own polemics against what he saw as Dutch neonomians. Just as Owen, Comrie stresses the point that before God gives faith to the sinner, He looks to the merits of Christ. It is because of the merits of Christ that the sinner receives the gift of faith to believe in Christ for salvation. For Comrie, Owen was a theological authority who he could well use for his own theology of justification by faith.

<text>Tigerlily is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant, released on June 20, 1995, following her departure from the alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs.

&quot;Tigerlily&quot; peaked at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2001. It contained three singles that charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Carnival&quot; (No. 10), &quot;Wonder&quot; (No. 20), and &quot;Jealousy&quot; (No. 23).

== Re-releases ==
&quot;Tigerlily&quot; was re-released in 1996 as a 2-CD set, with the second CD containing a remix of the song &quot;Jealousy&quot; and live performances from her tour.

In 2015, to commemorate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Merchant rerecorded the songs from the album and released them as &quot;Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings&quot;.

==Background==
The song &quot;River&quot; is a tribute to River Phoenix.

Aileen Wuornos requested that Merchant&#x27;s song &quot;Carnival&quot; be played at her funeral, and the song later appeared in the credits of the 2003 documentary &quot;&quot;. Merchant later commented:

==Reception==
Among positive reviews, J. D. Considine commented in &quot;Musician&quot; that &quot;Tigerlily&quot; shows &quot;a far greater stylistic range than the Maniacs&quot; and &quot;Merchant conveys more passion and personality than in the past&quot;, while Mark Cooper of &quot;Mojo&quot; highlighted &quot;her flair for narrative songwriting and that habitual chafing between the sober and the sensual, sense and sensibility.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Jean Rosenbluth wrote that &quot;Tigerlily&quot; &quot;presents Merchant as considerably more mature and womanly than the Maniacs gave her room to be&quot; and &quot;marks positive progress for a talent that is still in bloom.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan opined that Merchant had surpassed her work in 10,000 Maniacs with an album of &quot;11 moving lyrics, sung with great grace&quot;, singling out &quot;Beloved Wife&quot; as possibly &quot;the most touching thing committed to disc this year.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne observed that, &quot;with its unadorned, keyboard-based arrangements, &quot;Tigerlily&quot; is more sparely produced than anything Merchant did with 10,000 Maniacs, yet the starkness works in her favor... The hooks on this album are subtler, and ultimately Merchant sounds both more natural and affecting.&quot; While Browne expressed a desire for Merchant to &quot;lighten up,&quot; he also praised her &quot;uncompromising vision.&quot; Brad Webber of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt that Merchant&#x27;s &quot;characteristic trills and unique vocal stylism paint &quot;Tigerlily&quot; with bravura and make amends for some tepid songwriting.&quot;

Al Weisel, however, said in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Merchant&#x27;s voice had &quot;nearly deteriorated into self-parody&quot;, adding, &quot;With its surfeit of blindly self-obsessed lyrics and lulling lite-rock arrangements, the bulk of &quot;Tigerlily&quot; provides a perfect soundtrack for the Prozac nation.&quot; Elysa Gardner panned it in &quot;Spin&quot; as a &quot;predictably &quot;tasteful&quot; effort&quot; that &quot;makes 10,000 Maniacs actually sound like ten thousand maniacs&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot;″s Phil Sutcliffe found it lacking in &quot;conviction or soul&quot;, and &quot;NME&quot;″s Mark Sutherland deemed it &quot;nice&quot; yet mostly &quot;routine reflection&quot;. Critic Robert Christgau left no comment beyond an indifferent grade of &quot;neither&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine concluded that &quot;the added emphasis on rhythmic texture works, creating an intimate but not exclusive atmosphere that holds throughout the record, even when her occasionally sophomoric, sentimental poetry threatens to sink the album in the weight of its own preciousness&quot;. Tom Moon, in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, compared the songs on &quot;Tigerlily&quot; to the &quot;ambitious, unconventional material&quot; Merchant wrote as a member of 10,000 Maniacs, &quot;which made good use of her porcelain voice and exotic lyrical imagery.&quot;

<doc id="196347" wikidata="Q25432" url="?curid=196347" title="Common pheasant">
<text>The common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), ring-necked pheasant, or blue-headed pheasant, a bird in the pheasant family (Phasianidae). The genus name comes from Latin &quot;phasianus&quot; &#x27;pheasant&#x27;. The species name &quot;colchicus&quot; is Latin for &#x27;of Colchis&#x27; (modern day Georgia), a country on the Black Sea where pheasants became known to Europeans. Although &quot;Phasianus&quot; was previously thought to be closely related to the genus &quot;Gallus&quot;, the genus of junglefowl and domesticated chickens, recent studies show that they are in different subfamilies, having diverged over 20 million years ago.

It is native to Asia, where it is widespread, and also the extreme southeast of Europe in the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. It has been widely introduced elsewhere as a game bird. In parts of its range, mainly in places where none of its relatives occur such as in Europe, where it is naturalised, it is simply known as the &quot;pheasant&quot;. Ring-necked pheasant is both the collective name for a number of subspecies and their intergrades that have white neck rings, and the name used for the species as a whole in North America.

It is a well-known gamebird, among those of more than regional importance perhaps the most widespread and ancient one in the whole world. The common pheasant is one of the world&#x27;s most hunted birds; it has been introduced for that purpose to many regions, and is also common on game farms where it is commercially bred. The ring-necked subspecies group in particular are commonly bred and were introduced to many parts of the world; the game farm stock, though no distinct breeds have been developed yet, can be considered semi-domesticated. The ring-necked pheasant is the state bird of South Dakota, one of only two US state birds that is not a species native to the United States.

The green pheasant (&quot;P. versicolor&quot;) of Japan is sometimes considered a subspecies of the common pheasant. Though the species produce fertile hybrids wherever they coexist, this is simply a typical feature among fowl (Galloanseres), in which postzygotic isolating mechanisms are slight compared to most other birds. The species apparently have somewhat different ecological requirements and at least in its typical habitat, the green pheasant outcompetes the common pheasant. The introduction of the latter to Japan has therefore largely failed.

==Description==

There are many colour forms of the male common pheasant, ranging in colour from nearly white to almost black in some melanistic examples. These are due to captive breeding and hybridisation between subspecies and with the green pheasant, reinforced by continual releases of stock from varying sources to the wild. For example, the &quot;ring-necked pheasants&quot; common in Europe, North America and Australia do not pertain to any specific taxon, they rather represent a stereotyped hybrid swarm. Body weight can range from , with males averaging and females averaging . Wingspan ranges from .

The adult male common pheasant of the nominate subspecies &quot;Phasianus colchicus colchicus&quot; is in length with a long brown streaked black tail, accounting for almost of the total length. The body plumage is barred bright gold or fiery copper-red and chestnut-brown plumage with iridescent sheen of green and purple; but rump uniform is sometimes blue. The wing coverage is white or cream and black-barred markings are common on the tail. The head is bottle green with a small crest and distinctive red wattle. &quot;P. c. colchicus&quot; and some other races lack a white neck ring. Behind the face are two ear-tufts, that make the pheasant appear more alert.

The female (hen) and juveniles are much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage all over and measuring long including a tail of around . Juvenile birds have the appearance of the female with a shorter tail until young males begin to grow characteristic bright feathers on the breast, head and back at about 10 weeks after hatching.

The green pheasant (&quot;P. versicolor&quot;) is very similar, and hybridisation often makes the identity of individual farmed birds difficult to determine. Green pheasant males on average have a shorter tail than the common pheasant and have darker plumage that is uniformly bottle-green on the breast and belly; they always lack a neck ring. Green pheasant females are darker, with many black dots on the breast and belly.

In addition, various colour mutations are commonly encountered, mainly melanistic (black) and flavistic (isabelline or fawn) specimens. The former are rather commonly released in some areas and are named &quot;tenebrosus pheasant&quot; or simply &quot;melanistic mutant&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

This species was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name. The common pheasant is distinct enough from any other species known to Linnaeus for a laconic &quot;[Phasianus] rufus, capîte caeruleo&quot;, &quot;a red pheasant with blue head&quot;, to serve as entirely sufficient description. The bird had been extensively discussed before Linnaeus established binomial nomenclature so was already well-known. His sources are the &quot;Ornithologia&quot; of Ulisse Aldrovandi, Giovanni Pietro Olina&#x27;s &quot;Uccelliera&quot;, John Ray&#x27;s &quot;Synopsis methodica Avium &amp; Piscium&quot;, and &quot;A Natural History of the Birds&quot; by Eleazar Albin. Therein—essentially the bulk of the ornithology textbooks of his day—the species is simply named &quot;the pheasant&quot; in the books&#x27; respective languages. Whereas in most other species, Linnaeus felt it warranted to cite plumage details from his sources, in the common pheasant&#x27;s case he simply referred to the reason of the bird&#x27;s fame: &quot;principum mensis dicatur&quot;. The type locality is given simply as &quot;Africa, Asia&quot;.

However, the bird does not occur in Africa, except perhaps in Linnaeus&#x27;s time in Mediterranean coastal areas where they might have been introduced during the Roman Empire. The type locality was later fixed to the Rioni River in western Georgia, known as &quot;Phasis&quot; to the Ancient Greeks. These birds, until the modern era, constituted the bulk of the introduced stock in parts of Europe that was not already present; the birds described by Linnaeus&#x27;s sources, though typically belonging to such early introductions, would certainly have more alleles in common with the transcaucasian population than with others. The scientific name is Latin for &quot;pheasant from Colchis&quot;, &quot;colchicus&quot; referring to the west of modern-day Georgia; the Ancient Greek term corresponding to the English &quot;pheasant&quot; is Phasianos ornis (Φασιανὸς ὂρνις), &quot;bird of the river Phasis&quot;. Although Linnaeus included many Galliformes in his genus &quot;Phasianius&quot; such as the domestic chicken and its wild ancestor the red junglefowl, nowadays &quot;Gallus gallus&quot;, today only the common and the green pheasant are placed in this genus. As the latter was not known to Linnaeus in 1758, the common pheasant is treated as the type species of &quot;Phasianus&quot;.

In the US, common pheasants are widely known as &quot;ring-necked pheasants&quot;. More colloquial North American names include &quot;chinks&quot; or, in Montana, &quot;phezzens&quot;. In China, meanwhile, the species is properly called zhi ji (雉鸡), &quot;pheasant-fowl&quot;, essentially implying the same as the English name &quot;common pheasant&quot;. As elsewhere, &quot;P. colchicus&quot; is such a familiar bird in China that it is usually just referred to as shan ji (山雞), &quot;mountain chicken&quot;, a Chinese term for pheasants in general.

As of 2005, it had the smallest known genome of all living amniotes, only 0.97 pg (970 million base pairs), roughly one-third of the human genome&#x27;s size; however, the black-chinned hummingbird is the current holder of the smallest known amniote genome.

===Subspecies===

There are about 30 subspecies in five to eight groups. These can be identified by the male plumage, namely presence or absence of a white neck-ring and/or a white superciliary stripe, the colour of the uppertail (rump) and wing coverts, and the colour of crown, chest, upper back, and flank feathers. As noted above, introduced populations have mixed the alleles of various races by various amounts, differing according to the original stock used for introductions and what natural selection according to climate and habitat has made of that.

An investigation into the genetic relationships of subspecies suggested that the common pheasant originated from the forests of southeastern China. Initial divergence is thought to have occurred around 3.4 Mya. The lack of agreement between morphology-based subspecies delimitation and their genetic relationships is thought to be attributed to past isolation followed by more recent population mixing as the pheasant has expanded its range across the Palaearctic.

Sometimes this species is split into the Central Asian common and the East Asian ring-necked pheasants, roughly separated by the arid and high mountainous regions of Turkestan. However, while the western and eastern populations probably were entirely separate during the Zyryanka glaciation when deserts were more extensive, this separation was not long enough for actual speciation to occur. Today, the largest variety of colour patterns is found where the western and eastern populations mix, as is to be expected. Females usually cannot be identified even to subspecies group with certainty.

Many subspecies are in danger of disappearing due to hybridisation with introduced birds. The last black-necked pheasant (&quot;P. c. colchicus&quot;) population in Europe survives in Greece in the delta of the river Nestos, where in 2012 the population was estimated 100–250 individuals.

The subspecies groups, going from west to east, and some notable subspecies are:

Within a maximum clade credibility mDNA gene tree, the most basal group is the &quot;P. c. elegans&quot;-group of the Eastern Clade, diverging from the green pheasant during the Calabrian, and diversifying in Middle Pleistocene around 0.7 million years ago, with the groups of the Western Clade splitting off from those of the Eastern Clade about 0.59 million years ago. While the subspecies of the Western Clade are well geographically separated from each other, the subspecies of the Eastern Clade often show clinal variation and large areas of intergradation. For example, clines connect &quot;P. c. pallasi-karpowi-torquatus-takatsukasae&quot; within the &quot;P. c. torquatus&quot; group and &quot;P. c. kiangsuensis-alaschanicus-sohokhotensis-strauchi&quot; within the &quot;P. c. strauchi-vlangalii&quot; group, with the degree of expression of white collar and superciliary stripe in both cases decreasing from north to south. The isolated form &quot;P. c. hagenbecki&quot; is very close to &quot;P. c. pallasi&quot; in phenotype, and has been traditionally treated within the &quot;P. c. torquatus&quot; group until recently, when it was assigned in one study to the &quot;P. c. strauchi / P. c. vlangalii&quot; group. However, the origin of the corresponding feather samples as listed in GenBank is far away from the known distribution of subspecies &quot;P. c. hagenbecki&quot;, and the issue needs further clarification.
==Ecology==
Common pheasants are native to Asia and parts of Europe, their original range extending from the eastern Black Sea and the Caspian Sea to Manchuria, Siberia, Korea, Mainland China, and Taiwan. The birds are found in woodland, farmland, scrub, and wetlands. In its natural habitat the common pheasant lives in grassland near water with small copses of trees. Extensively cleared farmland is marginal habitat that cannot maintain self-sustaining populations for long.

Common pheasants are gregarious birds and outside the breeding season form loose flocks. However, captive bred common pheasants can show strong sexual segregation, in space and time, with sex differences in the use of feeding stations throughout the day. Wherever they are hunted they are always timid once they associate humans with danger, and will quickly retreat for safety after hearing the arrival of hunting parties in the area.

While common pheasants are able short-distance fliers, they prefer to run. If startled however, they can suddenly burst upwards at great speed, with a distinctive &quot;whirring&quot; wing sound and often giving &quot;kok kok kok&quot; calls to alert conspecifics. Their flight speed is only when cruising but when chased they can fly up to .

===Nesting===
Common pheasants nest solely on the ground in scrapes, lined with some grass and leaves, frequently under dense cover or a hedge. Occasionally they will nest in a haystack, or old nest left by other bird. They roost in sheltered trees at night. The males are polygynous as is typical for many Phasianidae, and are often accompanied by a harem of several females. Common pheasants produce a clutch of around 8–15 eggs, sometimes as many as 18, but usually 10 to 12; they are pale olive in colour, and laid over a 2–3 week period in April to June in the Northern Hemisphere. The incubation period is about 22–27 days. The chicks stay near the hen for several weeks, yet leave the nest when only a few hours old. After hatching they grow quickly, flying after 12–14 days, resembling adults by only 15 weeks of age.

They eat a wide variety of animal and vegetable type-food, like fruit, seeds, grain, mast, berries and leaves as well as a wide range of invertebrates, such as leatherjackets, ant eggs, wireworms, caterpillars, grasshoppers and other insects; with small vertebrates like lizards, field voles, small mammals and small birds occasionally taken.

===European native===
Southern Caucasian pheasants (&quot;P. c. colchicus&quot;) were common in Greece during the classical period and it is a widespread myth that the Greeks took pheasants to the Balkans when they colonised Colchis in the Caucasus. This colonization happened during the 6th century BC, but pheasant archaeological remains in the Balkans are much older dating to 6th millennium BC. This fact indicates that probably pheasants reached the area naturally. Additionally it seems that they had a continuous range in Turkey from the Sea of Marmara on the edge of the Balkans, across the northern shore of the country till Caucasus. The last remnants of the Balkan population survive in the Kotza-Orman riparian forest of Nestos, in Greece with an estimated population of 100–200 adult birds. In Bulgaria they were lost in the 1970s because they hybridised with introduced eastern subspecies.

Besides the Balkans the species lives in Europe in the area north of Caucasus where the local subspecies &quot;P.c.septentrionalis&quot; survives pure around the lower reaches of the Samur River. Reintroduction efforts in the rest of the north Caucasian range may include hybrid birds.

===As an introduced species===


Common pheasants can now be found across the globe due to their readiness to breed in captivity and the fact they can naturalise in many climates, but were known to be introduced in Europe, North America, Japan and New Zealand. Pheasants were hunted in their natural range by Stone Age humans just like the grouse, partridges, junglefowls and perhaps peafowls that inhabited Europe at that time. At least since the Roman Empire, the bird was extensively introduced in many places and has become a naturalized member at least of the European fauna. Introductions in the Southern Hemisphere have mostly failed, except where local Galliformes or their ecological equivalents are rare or absent.

The bird was naturalized in Great Britain around AD 1059, but may have been introduced by the Romano-British centuries earlier. It was the Caucasian subspecies mistakenly known as the &#x27;Old English pheasant&#x27; rather than the Chinese ring-necked pheasants (&quot;torquatus&quot;) that were introduced to Britain. But it became extirpated from most of the isles in the early 17th century. There were further re-introductions of the &#x27;white neck-ringed&#x27; variety in the 18th century. It was rediscovered as a game bird in the 1830s after being ignored for many years in an amalgam of forms. Since then it has been reared extensively by gamekeepers and was shot in season from 1 October to 31 January. Pheasants are well adapted to the British climate and breed naturally in the wild without human supervision in copses, heaths and commons.

By 1950 pheasants bred throughout the British Isles, although they were scarce in Ireland. Because around 30,000,000 pheasants are released each year on shooting estates, mainly in the Midlands and South of England, it is widespread in distribution, although most released birds survive less than a year in the wild. The Bohemian was most likely seen in North Norfolk. The Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust is researching the breeding success of reared pheasants and trying to find ways to improve this breeding success to reduce the demand to release as many reared pheasants and increase the wild population. As the original Caucasian stock all but disappeared during the Early Modern era, most &#x27;dark-winged ringless&#x27; birds in the UK are actually descended from &#x27;Chinese ring-necked&#x27; and &#x27;green pheasant&#x27; hybrids, which were commonly used for rewilding.
===North America===
Common pheasants were introduced in North America in 1773, and have become well established throughout much of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, etc.), the Midwest, the Plains states, as well as Canada and Mexico. In the southwest, they can even be seen south of the Rockies in Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is now most common on the Great Plains. Common pheasants have also been introduced to much of northwest Europe, the Hawaiian Islands, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia including the island state of Tasmania and small offshore islands such as Rottnest Island off Western Australia.

Most common pheasants bagged in the United States are wild-born feral pheasants. In some states captive-reared and released birds make up much of the population.

Pheasant hunting is very popular in much of the US, especially in the Great Plains states, where a mix of farmland and native grasslands provides ideal habitat. South Dakota alone has an annual harvest of over 1 million birds a year by over 200,000 hunters.

==== Negative impacts on other birds ====
There are a number of negative effects of common pheasants on other game birds, including: nest parasitism, disease, aggression, and competition for resources.  Nest parasitism, or brood parasitism, is common in pheasants because of their propensity to nest near other birds and the fact that nesting requirements are similar to those of other prairie birds and waterfowl that inhabit the same areas.  This phenomenon has been observed in grey partridges; prairie chickens; several types of duck, rail, grouse, turkeys, and others.  Effects of nest parasitism may include abandonment of nests with a high proportion of foreign eggs, lower hatching rates, and lower numbers of eggs laid by the host species. Pheasant eggs also have a shorter incubation time than many of their nestmates, which may result in the individual watching over the nest to abandon her own eggs after the pheasants hatch, thinking that the remaining eggs are not viable.  Pheasants raised in other species&#x27; nests often imprint on their caretaker, which may result in them adopting atypical behaviour for their species. This is sometimes the cause of hybridisation of species as pheasants adopt the mating behaviour of their nest&#x27;s host species.

Pheasants often compete with other native birds for resources. Studies have shown that they can lead to decreased populations of bobwhites and partridges due to habitat and food competition. Insects are a valuable food source for both pheasants and partridges and competition may lead to decreased populations of partridges. Pheasants may also introduce disease, such as blackhead, to native populations. While pheasants tolerate the infection well, other birds such as ruffed grouse, chukar, and grey partridge are highly susceptible. Pheasants also have a tendency to harass or kill other birds. One study noted that in pheasant vs. prairie chicken interactions, the pheasants were victorious 78% of the time.

==== Management strategies ====
A variety of management strategies have been suggested for areas that are home to species that are particularly threatened by pheasants, such as the prairie chickens and grey partridge. These strategies include mowing grass to decrease the nesting cover preferred by pheasants, decreasing pheasant roosting habitat, shooting pheasants in organised hunts, trapping and removing them from areas where there are high concentrations of birds of threatened species, and others.

==== Population change ====
While pheasant populations are not in any danger, they have been decreasing in the United States over the last 30 years, largely in agricultural areas. This is likely due to changes in farming practices, application of pesticides, habitat fragmentation, and increased predation due to changes in crops grown.  Many crops beneficial for pheasants (such as barley) are not being farmed as much in favour of using the land for more lucrative crops, such as nut trees.  Many of these new crops are detrimental to pheasant survival. Pheasants prefer to nest in areas of significant herbaceous cover, such as perennial grasses, so many agricultural areas are not conducive to nesting anymore. Pheasant hens also experience higher levels of predation in areas without patches of grassland.

In the United Kingdom, about 50 million pheasants reared in captivity are now released each summer, a number which has significantly increased since the 1980s. Most of these birds are shot during the open season (1 October to 1 February), and few survive for a year. The result is a wildly fluctuating population, from 50 million in July to less than 5 million in June.

==As gamebirds==

Common pheasants are bred to be hunted and are shot in great numbers in Europe, especially the UK, where they are shot on the traditional formal &quot;driven shoot&quot; principles, whereby paying guns have birds driven over them by beaters, and on smaller &quot;rough shoots&quot;. The open season in the UK is 1 October – 1 February, under the Game Act 1831 (1 &amp; 2 Will. 4. c. 32). Generally they are shot by hunters employing gun dogs to help find, flush and retrieve shot birds. Retrievers, spaniels and pointing breeds are used to hunt pheasants.

The doggerel &quot;Up gets a guinea, bang goes a penny-halfpenny, and down comes a half a crown&quot; reflects the expensive sport of 19th century driven shoots in Britain, when pheasants were often shot for sport, rather than as food. It was a popular royal pastime in Britain to shoot common pheasants. King George V shot over 1,000 pheasants out of a total bag of 3,937 over a six-day period in December 1913 during a competition with a friend; however, he did not do enough to beat him.

Common pheasants are traditionally a target of small game poachers in the UK. The Roald Dahl novel &quot;Danny the Champion of the World&quot; featured a poacher (and his son) who lived in the UK and illegally hunted common pheasants.

Pheasant farming is a common practice and is frequently done intensively, with serious adverse impacts on native species. Birds are supplied both to hunting preserves/estates and restaurants, with smaller numbers being available for home cooks.

The carcasses were often hung for a time to improve the meat by slight decomposition, as with most other game. Modern cookery generally uses moist roasting and farm-raised female birds. In the UK and US, game was making somewhat of a comeback in popular cooking and more pheasants than ever were being sold in supermarkets there in 2011. A major reason for this is consumer attitude shift from consumption of red meat to white meat.

<text>Nazz is the debut album by American rock group Nazz. It was released in 1968. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;, with the latter reaching number 66 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; failed to chart but came to be regarded as a psychedelic rock classic, appearing on several compilations of the genre. &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot; became a hit when Nazz guitarist Todd Rundgren re-recorded it for his 1972 solo album &quot;Something/Anything?&quot;.

The track &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; was accompanied by a promo video, directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. &quot;Nazz&quot; peaked at number 118 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums chart.

The album was remastered and rereleased in 2006 with bonus tracks by Sanctuary Records Group.

==Background and recording==
Following a showcase at the Boston Tea Party in January 1968, The Nazz were signed by Screen Gems-Columbia. In April 1968 the band entered the eight-track recording studio I. D. Sound Studios in Hollywood, California. By this time the band had all the songs they needed for their first album written, most of which favored a guitar-oriented sound, since lead vocalist/keyboardist Stewkey enjoyed being front man much more than being a keyboardist.

The song &quot;If That&#x27;s the Way you Feel&quot; was heavily inspired by the work of Jimmy Webb. Guitarist Todd Rundgren said writing the song was &quot;Really laborious for me, I didn&#x27;t really know how to write music. Shorty Rogers did the arrangement and had to do a lot of corrections.&quot;

After considering and then discarding the idea of having Felix Pappalardi produce the album, the Nazz picked Bill Traut instead. According to Rundgren, &quot;[Bill Traut] didn&#x27;t really do anything except read the trade papers. He didn&#x27;t have any music suggestions. We should have got someone like Glyn Johns.&quot; Rundgren was dissatisfied with Traut&#x27;s final mix of the album, so the Nazz went to a studio in New York to do overdubs and remixing for two tracks, &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;. The Nazz wanted a flanging effect for &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; but the studio engineers did not know how to create it; Rundgren discovered how to do it accidentally while playing with a two-track tape machine.

<doc id="196359" wikidata="Q5339361" url="?curid=196359" title="Edmund Calamy the Elder">
<text>Edmund Calamy (February 160029 October 1666) was an English Presbyterian church leader and divine. Known as &quot;the elder&quot;, he was the first of four generations of nonconformist ministers bearing the same name.

==Early life==
The Calamy family claimed to be of Huguenot descent. Edmund Calamy was born in the parish of St Thomas the Apostle, London, and educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and then Pembroke College, Cambridge, where his opposition to Arminianism excluded him from a fellowship. Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely, nevertheless made him his chaplain, and gave him the living of St Mary, Swaffham Prior in East Cambridgeshire, which he held till 1626.

He then moved to Bury St Edmunds, where he lectured for ten years; the later Congregationalist Jeremiah Burroughs was another preacher in the town. He retired when his bishop Matthew Wren insisted on the observance of certain ceremonial articles: Calamy refused to read out the &quot;Book of Sports&quot; in his church. In 1636 he was appointed rector (or perhaps only lecturer) of Rochford in Essex, but had to leave for the sake of his health. In 1639 he was elected to the perpetual curacy of St Mary Aldermanbury in London, where he had a large following.

==Presbyterian activist==
At the opening of the Long Parliament he distinguished himself in defence of the Presbyterian polity, in contributing to the joint conciliatory work known as &quot;Smectymnuus&quot;. It argued against Bishop Joseph Hall&#x27;s presentation of episcopacy, while articulating the Presbyterian positions. The initials of the names of the contributors formed the name under which it was published, viz., Stephen Marshall (SM), Edmund Calamy (EC), Thomas Young (TY), Matthew Newcomen (MN), and William Spurstow (WS, then often written VVS equivalent to UUS). These were clerical leaders of the Presbyterian movement within the Church of England. At the same period Calamy was an influential evangelical preacher, calling in December 1641 for a preaching ministry throughout England.

Calamy was an active member in the Westminster Assembly of divines, set up in 1643. In that year he edited the &quot;Souldier&#x27;s Pocket Bible&quot;, a popular Biblical anthology designed for the Parliamentarian military forces.

The Smectymnuans were against religious tolerance and Calamy strongly advocated checking independent religious thinkers in 1644, attracting allies such as Lazarus Seaman. Refusing to advance to Congregationalism, he found within Presbyterianism a middle course which best suited his views of theology and church government. Calamy belonged to the hypothetical universalist group in the Assembly, those influenced by John Davenant or his reading of the Synod of Dort. Richard Baxter reported that Calamy, Lazarus, Richard Vines and John Arrowsmith were not hostile to universal redemption.

In 1647 he worked on the Assembly&#x27;s Catechism. In 1648 he was preaching at St Benet Fink, to find an adversarial atmosphere in which the Baptist Edward Barber had been invited to contradict him.

He opposed the execution of King Charles I, and lived quietly under the Commonwealth. Asked for advice by Oliver Cromwell on the dissolution of the Rump Parliament and the establishment of a Protectorate, he replied that nine out of ten would oppose it.

==After the Restoration==
He was assiduous in promoting the return of Charles II of England, travelling to the Netherlands as one of the negotiators. After the Restoration in 1660 he was offered the bishopric of Coventry and Lichfield, but declined it. Presbyterians had warned him that his reputation and honour would suffer if he accepted, and he tried to co-ordinate a refusal with Richard Baxter, in the same position.

He was made one of Charles&#x27;s chaplains, and vainly tried to secure the legal ratification of Charles&#x27;s declaration of 25 October 1660. He was ejected for Nonconformity in the Great Ejection of 1662, and was so affected by the sight of the devastation caused by the Great Fire of London that he died shortly afterwards. He was buried in the ruins of his church, near the place where the pulpit had stood.

==Works==
His publications are almost entirely sermons.

*&quot;The Art of Divine Meditation&quot; (London: for Tho. Parkhurst, 1634) – not sermons.
*&quot;An Answer to a Book entitled, An Humble Remonstrance&quot; (1641) as a member of &quot;Smectymnuus&quot;
*&quot;Gods Free Mercy to England&quot; (1642)
*&quot;Englands Looking-glasse&quot; (1642)
*&quot;Souldier&#x27;s Pocket Bible&quot; (1643), editor (1895 reprint)
*&quot;Jus Divinum Ministerii Evangelici&quot; (1654)
*&quot;The Godly Man&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1658)

==Calamy the Younger==

His eldest son was also called Edmund Calamy, known as &quot;the Younger&quot;. Calamy the Younger followed a religious path similar to his father&#x27;s, and lost the rectory of Moreton, Essex in the Great Ejection of 1662. He was of a retiring disposition and moderate views, and died in 1685. He was the father of the historian Edmund Calamy.

<doc id="196364" wikidata="Q540943" url="?curid=196364" title="Rage Against the Machine (album)">
<text>Rage Against the Machine is the debut studio album by American rock band Rage Against the Machine. It was released on November 6, 1992, by Epic Records, four days after the release of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;. The album was based largely on the band&#x27;s first commercial demo tape of the same name, completed 11 months prior to the album&#x27;s release. The tape contained earlier recordings of seven of the ten songs.

With politically themed, revolutionary lyrical content, the album artwork was notable for its graphic photograph of Vietnamese monk Thích Quảng Đức performing self-immolation in June 1963.

The album was a critical success upon release, with several critics noting the album&#x27;s politically motivated agenda and praising frontman Zack de la Rocha&#x27;s strong vocal delivery. Ranked number 24 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, the album peaked at number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart and number 45 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has gone on to achieve a triple platinum sales certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the US. Multiple publications have ranked it as one of the best albums of the 1990s. In 2020, it was ranked 221 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s updated list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Music==
The album contains politically-charged lyrical content and stylistically blends funk and heavy metal musical styles, similar to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

The cover features a crop of one of Malcolm Browne&#x27;s famous photographs of the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, in Saigon in 1963.

The songs on &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; all feature political messages. Activists such as Provisional IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands and Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton are listed in the &quot;Thanks For Inspiration&quot; section. Also thanked were Ian and Alec MacKaye.

The lyrics for each song were printed in the album booklet with the exception of those for &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, which were omitted; the booklet reads &quot;2. KILLING IN THE NAME&quot;, skips the lyrics and continues with the next song.

The statement &quot;no samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this record&quot; can be found at the end of the sleeve notes. Similar statements were made in the band&#x27;s subsequent albums. The band also refer to themselves as &quot;Guilty Parties&quot; for each album.

==Touring and promotion==
The album was supported by the Rage Against the Machine Tour, which commenced on January 15, 1993, in Chicago and concluded on December 31, 1993, in Detroit. Rage Against The Machine was accompanied by opening acts in certain concerts, such as hip hop groups House of Pain and Cypress Hill.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; received critical acclaim. In a contemporary review, &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;what makes RATM more than just another bunch of prodigiously capable genre-benders is their total lack of pretension or contrivance ... the results burn with an undeniable conviction.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine deemed it &quot;a record of real attitude and energy&quot;, while &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn hailed it as &quot;a striking, politically conscious debut&quot; and de la Rocha &quot;a bona fide star who combines on stage a Bob Marley-like charisma and a Chuck D.-style rap command -- and the music itself is as tough and relentless as his raps.&quot;

Robert Christgau was somewhat less impressed in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, summing it up as &quot;metal for rap-lovers—and opera-haters&quot; while naming &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; and &quot;Wake Up&quot; as highlights. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia wrote in a retrospective review, &quot;it was the first album to successfully merge the seemingly disparate sounds of rap and heavy metal&quot;, he also praised the album&#x27;s &quot;meaningful rhymes and emotionally charged conviction&quot; calling it &quot;essential&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time. The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, climbing to number 365 in the 2012 revision and shooting up to number 221 in the 2020 reboot of the list. It was ranked number 24 on the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

In December 2008, BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe included &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; as one of 28 albums in his &#x27;Masterpieces&#x27; series. In October 2011, &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; was ranked number five on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.

<text>Edward Livingston (May 28, 1764May 23, 1836) was an American jurist, statesman and slaveholder. He was an influential figure in the drafting of the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825, a civil code based largely on the Napoleonic Code. Livingston represented both New York and then Louisiana in Congress and served as the U.S. Secretary of State from 1831 to 1833 and Minister to France from 1833 to 1835 under President Andrew Jackson. He was also the 46th mayor of New York City.

== Early life ==
Edward Livingston was born in Clermont, colonial Albany County, Province of New York (since 4 April 1786 within Columbia County, New York). He was the youngest son of Judge Robert Livingston and Margaret (née Beekman) Livingston, and was a member of the prestigious Livingston family. His father was a member of the New York Provincial Assembly and a Judge of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, and his mother was heir to immense tracts of land in Dutchess and Ulster counties. Among his many siblings were Chancellor of New York Robert R. Livingston; Janet Livingston, who married Gen. Richard Montgomery; Margaret Livingston, who married New York Secretary of State Thomas Tillotson; Henry Beekman Livingston; Catharine Livingston, who married Freeborn Garrettson; merchant John R. Livingston; Gertrude Livingston, who married Gov. Morgan Lewis; Joanna Livingston, who married Peter R. Livingston, acting Lieutenant Governor of New York; and Alida Livingston, who married John Armstrong, Jr., a U.S. Senator, U.S. Secretary of War, and U.S. Minister to France who was the son of Gen. John Armstrong, Sr.

His maternal grandparents were Henry Beekman, a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman, and Janet (née Livingston) Beekman, a Livingston cousin. Their children included: His father was the only child of Robert Livingston, known as &quot;Robert of Clermont&quot; (himself a son of Robert Livingston the Elder, the first Lord of Livingston Manor, and Alida (née Schuyler) Van Rensselaer Livingston) and Margaret (née Howarden) Livingston.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1781.

==Career==
Livingston was admitted to the bar in 1785, and began to practice law in New York City along with James Kent, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, rapidly rising to distinction. From 1795 to 1801, Livingston was a Democratic-Republican U.S. Representative in the United States Congress from the state of New York, where he was one of the leaders of the opposition to Jay&#x27;s Treaty, and introduced the resolution calling upon President George Washington to furnish Congress with the details of the negotiations of the peace treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain, which the President refused to share. At the close of Washington&#x27;s administration, he voted with Andrew Jackson and other radicals against the address to the president.

Livingston was a prominent opponent of the Alien and Sedition Laws, introduced legislation on behalf of American seamen, and in 1800 attacked the president for permitting the extradition to the British government of Jonathan Robbins, who had committed murder on an English frigate and then escaped to South Carolina and falsely claimed to be an American citizen. In the debate on this question Livingston was opposed by John Marshall, the Chief Justice of the United States.

In 1801, Livingston was appointed United States Attorney for the district of New York, and while retaining that position was in the same year appointed Mayor of New York City. When, in the summer of 1803, the city was visited with yellow fever, Livingston displayed courage and energy in his endeavors to prevent the spread of the disease and relieve distress. He suffered a violent attack of fever, during which the people gave many proofs of their attachment to him.

Upon his recovery he found his private affairs in some confusion, and he was at the same time deeply indebted to the government for public funds which had been lost through the mismanagement or dishonesty of a confidential clerk, and for which he was responsible as US attorney. He at once surrendered all his property, resigned his two offices in 1803, and moved early in 1804 to New Orleans in what would shortly become the Territory of Orleans (1804–1812). His older brother, Robert R. Livingston, had negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, in 1803. Edward Livingston soon built a large law practice in New Orleans, and in 1826 he repaid the Federal government in full, including the interest, which by that time amounted to more than the original principal.

=== Louisiana ===
Almost immediately upon his arrival in Louisiana, where the legal system had previously been based on Roman, French, and Spanish law, and where trial by jury and other particularities of English common law were now first introduced, he was appointed by the legislature to prepare a provisional code of judicial procedure, which (in the form of an act passed in April 1805) was continued in force from 1805 to 1825.

In 1807, after conducting a successful suit on behalf of a client&#x27;s title to a part of the batture or alluvial land near New Orleans, Livingston attempted to improve part of this land (which he had received as his fee) in the Batture Ste. Marie. Great popular excitement was aroused against him; his workmen were mobbed; and territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne, when appealed to for protection, referred the question to the Federal government.
It has been alleged that Livingston&#x27;s case was damaged by then-President Thomas Jefferson, who believed that Livingston had favored Aaron Burr in the Presidential election of 1800, and that he had afterwards been a party to Burr&#x27;s schemes. Jefferson made it impossible for Livingston to secure his property title, since by asserting the claim that such battures were the property of the Federal government, Livingston&#x27;s title obtained from the Territorial Court was invalid. In response, Livingston filed a civil lawsuit against Jefferson in 1810. After the case was dismissed on December 5, 1811, by Chief Justice John Marshall due to lack of jurisdiction, Jefferson, nonetheless, in 1812 published a pamphlet originally intended &quot;for the use of counsel&quot; in the case against Livingston, to which Livingston published a reply.

Louisiana became a U.S. state just one and a half months before the U.S. Congress declared war upon Great Britain. During the War of 1812, Edward Livingston was active in rousing the ethnically mixed population of New Orleans to resistance against the threat of British invasion. He used his influence to secure amnesty for Jean Lafitte and his followers when they offered to help defend the city, and in 1814–15 acted as adviser and one of several aides-de-camp to Major General Andrew Jackson, who was his personal friend.

===Livingston Code===
In 1821, by appointment of the Louisiana State Legislature, of which he had become a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives in the preceding year, Livingston began the preparation of a new code of criminal law and procedure, afterwards known in Europe and America as the &quot;Livingston Code.&quot; It was prepared in both French and English, as was required by the necessities of practice in Louisiana, and actually consisted of four sections: crimes and punishments, procedure, evidence in criminal cases, and reform and prison discipline. Though substantially completed in 1824, when it was accidentally burned, and again in 1826, the criminal code was not printed in its entirety until 1833. It was never adopted by the state.

The Livingston Code was at once reprinted in England, France, and Germany, attracting wide praise by its remarkable simplicity and vigor, and especially by reason of its philanthropic provisions in the code of reform and prison discipline, which noticeably influenced the penal legislation of various countries. In referring to this code, Sir Henry Maine spoke of Livingston as &quot;the first legal genius of modern times.&quot; The spirit of Livingston&#x27;s code was remedial rather than vindictive; it provided for the abolition of capital punishment and the making of penitentiary labor not a punishment forced on the prisoner, but a matter of his choice and a reward for good behavior, bringing with it better accommodations. His Code of Reform and Prison Discipline was adopted by the government of the short-lived Federal Republic of Central America under liberal president Francisco Morazán.

Livingston was the leading member of a commission appointed to prepare a new civil code for Louisiana, which for the most part the legislature adopted in 1825; and the most important chapters of which, including all those on contracts, were prepared by Edward Livingston alone. Livingston became again a U.S. Representative, this time as the first person to serve Louisiana&#x27;s 1st congressional district. The preliminary work for the preparation of a new civil code was completed by James Brown and Louis Moreau-Lislet, who in 1808 reported a &quot;Digest of the Civil Laws now in force in the Territory of Orleans with Alterations and Amendments adapted to the present Form of Government&quot;.

=== Later career===

Livingston served as a U.S. Representative from Louisiana from 1823 to 1829, a U.S. Senator from 1829 to 1831, and for two years (1831–1833) United States Secretary of State under President Jackson. In this last position he was one of Jackson&#x27;s most trusted advisers. Livingston prepared a number of state papers for President Jackson, the most important being the famous anti-nullification proclamation of December 10, 1832.

From 1833 to 1835, Livingston was minister plenipotentiary to France, charged with procuring the fulfillment by the French government of the treaty negotiated by W. C. Rives in 1831, by which France had bound herself to pay an indemnity of twenty-five millions of francs for French spoliations of American shipping chiefly under the Berlin and Milan decrees, and the United States in turn agreed to pay to France 1,500,000 francs in satisfaction of French claims. Livingston&#x27;s negotiations were conducted with excellent judgment, but the French Chamber of Deputies refused to make an appropriation to pay the first installment due under the treaty in 1833, relations between the two governments became strained, and Livingston was finally instructed to close the legation and return to America.

==Personal life==
Livingston was married twice. His first wife, Mary McEvers, whom he wed on April 10, 1788, later died of scarlet fever. She was the daughter of Charles McEvers and Mary (née Bache) McEvers and her sister, Eliza McEvers, was the second wife of Edwards older brother, the merchant John R. Livingston. Before her death on March 13, 1801, they were the parents of three children:

* Charles Edward Livingston (born 1790)
* Julia Livingston (1794–1814)
* Lewis Livingston (1798–1822)

In June 1805, he married Madame Marie Louise Magdaleine Valentine &quot;Louise&quot; (née d&#x27;Avezac) de Castera Moreau de Lassy (1785–1860), a widow who was then only 19 years of age, and a refugee in New Orleans from the Haitian Revolution. She was the daughter of a wealthy landowner and the sister of Auguste Davezac, a politician and diplomat who served twice as U.S. Minister to the Netherlands. She was a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellect: &quot;the lady name is short, but she is said to be majestic in her person and elegant in manners with a long purse&quot;. She is said to have greatly influenced her husband&#x27;s public career. Together, Louise and Edward were the parents of two children, only one of whom lived to adulthood:

* Coralie Livingston (1806–1873), who married Thomas Pennant Barton (1803–1869), the son of noted physician Benjamin Smith Barton, in April 1833.

Livingston died on May 23, 1836, five days before his 72nd birthday at Montgomery Place in Red Hook, New York, an estate left him by his sister, to which he had removed in 1831.

===Legacy and honors===
The town of Livingston, Guatemala, is named after Edward Livingston, in commemoration of the Livingston Code.

Edward Livingston is the namesake of counties in Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri, and a parish in Louisiana with its seat of Livingston. Also named for him is a town in Tennessee, a town in Livingston, Alabama, a Sumter County, Alabama, and by extension, the town of Livingston, Texas, Lake Livingston in Texas, and the Livingston Dam.

Edward Livingston High School (formerly a middle school) in New Orleans was named for him. Fort Livingston, a 19th-century coastal fortification, was named after Edward Livingston, along with today&#x27;s Fort Livingston State Commemorative Area in south Louisiana.

Livingston was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1825 and the American Antiquarian Society in 1833.

<text>Matthew Newcomen (c. 1610 – 1 September 1669) was an English nonconformist churchman.

His exact date of birth is unknown. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (M.A. 1633). In 1636 he became lecturer at Dedham in Essex, and led the church reform party in that county. He assisted Edmund Calamy the Elder in writing &quot;Smectymnuus&quot; (1641), and preached before parliament in 1643. He was multi-talented, excelling in preaching and debate, and was offered several lucrative positions.

He protested against the extreme democratic proposals called &quot;The Agreement of the People&quot; (1647), and was one of the commissioners at the Savoy Synod of 1658. When the Act of Uniformity was passed in 1662, Newcomen lost his living, but was soon invited to the pastorate at Leiden, where he was held in high esteem not only by his own people but by the university professors. He died of plague in 1669.

<text>SimPy stands for “Simulation in Python”, is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. It enables users to model active components such as customers, vehicles, or agents as simple Python generator functions. SimPy is released as open source software under the MIT License. The first version was released in December 2002.

== Overview ==
Its event dispatcher is based on Python&#x27;s generators and can be used for asynchronous networking or to implement multi-agent systems (with both, simulated and real communication). Simulations can be performed “as fast as possible”, in real time (wall clock time) or by manually stepping through the events. Though it is theoretically possible to do continuous simulations with SimPy, it lacks features to support them. However, for simulations with a fixed step size where processes don&#x27;t interact with each other or with shared resources, a simple codice_1 loop is sufficient.

Additionally, SimPy provides different types of shared resources to simulate congestion points that have limited capacity, such as servers, checkout counters, and tunnels. In version 3.1 and above, SimPy offers monitoring capabilities to assist in collecting statistics about processes and resources.

SimPy 3.0 requires Python 3., while SimPy 4.0 requires Python 3.6+. SimPy distribution contains tutorials, documentation, and examples.

== Example ==

The following is a SimPy simulation showing a clock process that prints the current simulation time at each step:

»&gt; import simpy
»&gt; def clock(env, name, tick):
... while True:
... print(name, env.now)
... yield env.timeout(tick)
»&gt; env = simpy.Environment()
»&gt; env.process(clock(env, &#x27;fast&#x27;, 0.5))
&lt;Process(clock) object at 0x...&gt;
»&gt; env.process(clock(env, &#x27;slow&#x27;, 1))
&lt;Process(clock) object at 0x...&gt;
»&gt; env.run(until=2)
fast 0
slow 0 
fast 0.5 
slow 1 
fast 1.0 
fast 1.5

<doc id="196374" wikidata="Q426028" url="?curid=196374" title="...And Out Come the Wolves">
<text>...And Out Come the Wolves is the third studio album by American punk rock band Rancid. It was released on August 22, 1995, through Epitaph Records. Rancid&#x27;s popularity and catchy songs made them the subject of a major label bidding war (hence the title, &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; taken from a poem in Jim Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;) that ended with the band staying on Epitaph. With a sound heavily influenced by ska, which called to mind Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman&#x27;s past in Operation Ivy, Rancid became one of the few bands of the mid-to-late 1990s punk rock boom to retain much of its original fan base. In terms of record sales and certifications, &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; is a popular album in the United States. It produced three hit singles: &quot;Roots Radicals&quot;, &quot;Time Bomb&quot; and &quot;Ruby Soho&quot;, that earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. All the singles charted on Modern Rock Tracks. &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on January 22, 1996. It was certified platinum on September 23, 2004.

Along with Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot; and The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot;, &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; helped revive mainstream interest in punk rock in the mid-1990s, signaled the initial rise of mainstream punk rock, and proved to be successful for the band. To coincide with its 20th anniversary, Rancid performed the album live in its entirety on their 2015–2016 &quot;Honor Is All We Know&quot; world tour.

== Background ==
Rancid formed in Albany, California, in 1991. They signed to Epitaph Records (founded by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz) in 1992 and released their eponymous debut album, &quot;Rancid&quot;, a year later to rave reviews. While Rancid was already writing another album, Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong, one of the band&#x27;s friends, joined them to co-write the song &quot;Radio&quot;. This led to him playing a live show with the band, and Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong eventually asked him to become a member of the band, but he decided to continue playing in Green Day. Armstrong had previously asked Lars Frederiksen to be Rancid&#x27;s second guitarist, but he turned down the request. After Billie Joe declined, Frederiksen changed his mind and decided to join the band. Rancid&#x27;s second album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, was released in 1994 to unexpected success and acclaim. After the release of Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot; and The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot; later that year, Rancid was pursued by several major labels, including Madonna&#x27;s Maverick Records, but eventually turned them down. They decided to stay on Epitaph and soon began recording a follow-up album.

== Recording and production ==
&quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; was recorded mainly between February and May 1995. The recording took place at not only Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California (where &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; was recorded), but also at the famous Electric Lady Studios (built by Jimi Hendrix) in New York City. This was the first time Rancid recorded an album at more than one studio.

Rather than having the band&#x27;s previous producer Brett Gurewitz, Jerry Finn was appointed to produce the album. Gurewitz would eventually start working with the band again, beginning with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Rancid&quot;.

== Release, reception and legacy ==

&quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; was released on August 22, 1995, and peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Five months after its release, the album was certified gold and in 2004 it was certified platinum.

The album received positive reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as having &quot;classic moments of revivalist punk&quot;. Erlewine praised the music and claims the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t mark an isolationist retreat into didactic, defiantly underground punk rock&quot;. The album received a rating of four and a half out of five stars, while &quot;Time Bomb,&quot; &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; and &quot;Roots Radicals&quot; earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. In 2005, &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; was ranked number 368 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. BuzzFeed included the album at number 14 on their &quot;36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die&quot; list. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; at number 21 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs.

On May 21, 2021, it was announced that Lavasock Records is releasing a tribute album titled &quot;...And Out Come the Lawsuits&quot; featuring Link 80, Sarchasm, Omnigone, Flying Raccoon Suit, Little Debbie &amp; The Crusaders and Stay Wild.

Professional wrestler Dori Prange came up with her in-ring name, Ruby Riott, from the song &quot;Ruby Soho&quot;. Prange lost the rights to the name after her release from the WWE in June 2021 however thanks to Lars Frederiksen, who hosts a wrestling podcast, she now wrestles under the name of Ruby Soho.

== Artwork ==
The cover art is a tribute to Minor Threat, a landmark hardcore punk band, that originally used the image of Alec MacKaye (brother of the band&#x27;s lead singer Ian MacKaye) with his head on his knees on steps of the Wilson Center steps on their eponymous debut EP.

<text>Stephen Marshall ( – 1655) was an English Nonconformist churchman. His sermons, especially that on the death of John Pym in 1643, reveal eloquence and fervour. The only &quot;systematic&quot; work he published was &quot;A Defence of Infant Baptism&quot;, against John Tombes (1646).

==Early life==
He was born at Godmanchester in Huntingdonshire, and was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (M.A. 1622, B.D. 1629). After holding the living of Wethersfield in Essex, he became vicar of Finchingfield. In 1636 he was reported for &quot;want of conformity.&quot;

==Civil War years==
Marshall was a powerful preacher: Robert Baillie noted that he was reckoned the best in England. He also influenced the elections for the Short Parliament of 1640: Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon considered his influence on the parliamentary side to be greater than that of William Laud on the royalist. In 1642 Marshall was appointed lecturer at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and delivered a series of addresses to the Commons in which he advocated episcopal and liturgical reform.

He had a share in writing &quot;Smectymnuus&quot;, was appointed chaplain to the Earl of Essex&#x27;s regiment in 1642, and a member of the Westminster Assembly in 1643. He represented the English Parliament in Scotland in 1643, and attended the parliamentary commissions at the Uxbridge Conference in 1645. He was with Archbishop Laud before the latter&#x27;s execution, and was chaplain to King Charles I at Holmby House and at Carisbrooke Castle.

==Later life==
A moderate Presbyterian, he contributed to the Westminster Shorter Catechism in 1647, and was one of the &quot;Triers&quot; in 1654. He died in November 1655 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, but his body was exhumed and maltreated at the Restoration.

<text>A velomobile (); velomobiel, velo, or bicycle car is a human-powered vehicle (HPV) enclosed for aerodynamic advantage and/or protection from weather and collisions. Velomobiles are similar to recumbent bicycles, pedal go-karts and tricycles, but with a full fairing (aerodynamic or weather protective shell) and are not to be confused with purpose-built mobiles for speed records. Fully faired vehicles with two wheels, generally called Streamliners. Streamliners have set many speed and distance records. 

Though fast in their own right, velomobiles are considered much more suitable for the street than two-wheeled streamliners. Using three or more wheels can have advantages for everyday use, including the ability to stop and start unaided, better stability, cross-wind handling, etc., though there are arguments made that the multiple track machines (three or more wheels) have aerodynamic disadvantages due to the drag of the extra wheels and the surface contact points. In practice though, velomobiles continue to be close to their two-wheel cousins in performance.

There are few velomobile manufacturers; some are home-built. Some models have the operator&#x27;s head exposed; this has the advantage of giving the operator unobstructed vision, hearing, and some cooling, with the disadvantage of being potentially more exposed to weather and less aerodynamic. Fully enclosed machines can suffer from heat or humidity issues as well as potential noise issues. 

The typical drive train of a velomobile is not unlike a bicycle or recumbent. It will consist of a front bottom bracket with one or more chainrings, and a rear derailleur. Depending on the configuration of the velomobile there may be any number of idler pulleys, and chaintubes along the drive train to manage and protect the chain. One of the defining characteristics of most velomobiles is that the chain and drivetrain components are protected from weather and the road.

== History ==

Before World War II, built a small four-wheeled &#x27;bike&#x27;-car for his son. Mochet built many models of small vehicles called &quot;Velocar&quot;. Some models had two seats, most were pedal powered, but as the years went by, many were fitted with small engines. Mochet Velocars use a thin wood/plywood body on a steel frame.

Some other early velomobiles use a fabric body or &quot;skin&quot; sewn to fit loosely on closely spaced wires or tubes, then painted or &quot;doped&quot; with a liquid that dries and shrinks the fabric to a tight fit on the wire/tube supports. The approach was used widely on early airplanes, and has the advantage of light weight with relatively low-technology materials. It is sometimes called &quot;bird cage&quot; construction because the support looks similar to closely spaced wires used in construction of bird cages, and because the wire/tube support outline shows through once the fabric is tight. Some disadvantages of this approach are the cost of construction, due to the many interconnected supports; and that the shape is that of many flat panels, which limits smoothness of the skin and thus limits the aerodynamics.
In the 1970s, the People Powered Vehicle was produced. It was a two-seat, &quot;sociable&quot; tandem with a steel sub frame and molded plastic body. It was well designed and weighed something over 50 kg (110 lb); a recently restored version weighs 59 kg or 130 lb. However, it had flaws in the execution that doomed it as a practical, everyday vehicle. Positive features, such as easily adjustable and comfortable seats, independent pedalling for both passenger and driver, adequate cargo space and relatively good weather protection, could not overcome the negative features, such as a complex, heavy and badly spaced three-speed gear box, ineffective brakes, and pedals that slid on sleeve bearings on steel shafts, which made it difficult to use as an everyday vehicle.
In Sweden, a two-seat design called Fantom was sold as blueprints and became very popular; over 100,000 copies of the blueprints were sold, but few were actually completed. The downfall of these early &#x27;bicycle&#x27; cars came when the economy improved and people chose automobiles.

==Modern/contemporary velomobiles==

Builders continued to make &quot;one-off&quot; velomobiles, but for a time none were available commercially. In the 1970s, Carl-Georg Rasmussen
rediscovered &quot;Fantomen&quot;; he redesigned it and in 1983 started selling a production version called Leitra. Leitra velomobiles have been in continuous production since then (as of 2017), with current models evolved/improved from the originals.

There are many ways to build a velomobile. One modern design is &quot;body-on-frame&quot;, in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body. A standard cycle may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with special fittings to mount the body; the use of special fittings tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight. Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it does not need to be self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames. Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used. However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.
Another modern design is the , using aluminum sheet formed and riveted to make the fairing and the structure in one piece. This approach is sometimes called monocoque or &quot;unit&quot; construction; it was used in airplanes before 1920. Labor costs to build an Alleweder are significant due to the many rivets and rivet holes. Also, the choices of aerodynamic shapes are limited by the formability of the aluminum sheet. That said, aluminum is relatively inexpensive, and as of 2017 Alleweders can be often be bought for less than other designs; they can also be bought as kits, to reduce out-of-pocket cost. Aluminum can also be repaired relatively easily, and aluminum, which is homogeneous, can be recycled more easily than many composite materials.


Another common modern design is a monocoque shell, often made of fiber-reinforced plastic or &quot;FRP&quot;, plus sub-frames of welded aluminum tubes. FRP can be used to produce a wide range of shapes, and thus can improve aerodynamics over approaches such as &quot;birdcage&quot; and aluminum-sheet monocoque. FRP can also use fibers with high strength-to-weight ratio that in velomobiles can save several kilograms compared to other designs. A wide range of fibers may be used, but those which reduce weight while retaining strength and toughness often increase the price significantly—e.g., a premium of 1000 Euros to save 3 kg. In addition, it is often hard to segregate and recycle the FRP materials. But despite the cost and other issues, the aerodynamic and weight advantages mean that (as of 2017) monocoque FRP is a common way to build velomobiles.

As of 2017, most velomobiles are tricycles with two front wheels. A tricycle has the advantage over a bicycle that it does not fall over when stopped. In addition, when a cross-wind hits a fairing, it makes a big force; faired tricycles are less likely to get blown over than faired bicycles. Although three wheels have practical advantages, they also have more aerodynamic drag than two wheels, so land speed record cycles are often bicycles. Although four wheels were used as far back as the Velocar, they are not today common. As of 2017, there is at least one 4-wheel production model, the QuattroVelo. Four wheels tends to further hurt aerodynamics and weight compared to three; but for a given width, four wheels is much more laterally stable than three wheels. Also, four wheels can be placed in a way that increases luggage capacity a lot compared to three-wheel designs.

Most velomobiles drive the rear wheel(s). This approach is simple and can often use many standard bicycle parts. Velomobiles with two rear wheels may drive just one wheel, or may drive both. Driving a single wheel is the simplest and lightest approach. Driving both wheels can improve traction but also increases complexity, cost, and weight. A solid axle may be used, but increases friction/drag in corners and thus can slow down the vehicle. One alternative is a differential, which is the approach used in most cars. A second alternative is to use a pair of ratchets, where the slower wheel is driven and the faster wheel coasts. Rear drive often uses &quot;idler&quot; pulleys to route the chain; front-wheel drive can eliminate idlers, so offers less friction and also less weight. It can also increase luggage capacity. However, front drive with two front wheels uses some non-standard components, and as of 2017 is used only rarely.

As with other cycles, a velomobile may use suspension. Suspension tends to improve rider comfort, and can also improve speed—it takes energy to &quot;bounce&quot; the velomobile and rider, so a suspension can reduce the energy lost to bouncing. However, suspension adds cost, weight, and maintenance. Common velomobile designs include no suspension, front-only suspension, and front+rear suspension.

As of 2017, there are several commercial makers of velomobiles. At the same time, there are still many &quot;one-off&quot; makers. Individual designs (both one-off and production) emphasize specific features. For example, some emphasize aerodynamics and light weight to improve average speed, even if cost, ease of entry/exit, comfort, and other &quot;practical vehicle&quot; attributes are reduced. By analogy, many automobile makers make performance cars with limited seating and cargo and worse emissions and fuel economy. In contrast, other velomobile designs sacrifice performance features in order to improve cost, entry/exit, comfort, carrying capacity, and so on. By analogy, many automobile makers offer cargo vans. As of 2017, individual makers sometimes offer models spanning a range of features—for example, there are Milan models used in racing but also a Milan &quot;cargo&quot; model with enough luggage volume to carry a (not-pedaling) human passenger and other bulky items.

All current (2017) velomobiles are produced in low volume, with &quot;big&quot; makers producing one or a few velomobiles per week. Velomobiles use some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles, and thus made in low volume. The use of &quot;more parts&quot; (e.g., 3 wheels instead of 2) and &quot;more low-volume&quot; parts makes velomobiles more expensive. The only attempt at a mass-produced velomobile, which was in the mid-1980s, flopped. This was the Sinclair C5. The C5 was a delta trike (one front, two rear wheels) with electric assist designed to be mass-produced and sold for a low price. The C5 was poorly designed; it was heavy, had only one gear and had no adjustment for the distance between the pedals and the seat, which is important to get a comfortable pedalling position.

A concept and a potential assessment concerning low-cost velomobiles for daily short trips as well as strategies for reaching a critical lot size for mass production was the subject of a research project called RegInnoMobil.

Racing

Velomobiles have also been used in Australian HPV Super Series since 1985, and more recently, other events in Australia like the RACV Energy Breakthrough, the Fraser Coast Technology Challenge, and the Victorian HPV Series.

In 2018, Dave Lewis set a new race record at the Sebring 24 hour race using a DF velomobile made by Intercitybike.nl. Velomobiles also competed in the ultra endurance Trans Am Bike race and came in 1st (setting a new record) and 4th places. 1st place was Marcel Graber and 4th Dave Lewis.

== World records ==
In 2010 the Milan SL was used by Christian von Ascheberg, to set a record in the 24 hours (1219 km) and 1000 km (19h27m) category.

In 2015 Petra von Fintel set a 24 hours world record at 1012km in a Milan SL 

In 2022 Nicola Walde set the current 24 hours world record at 1130km 

In summer 2023 Matthias König set a new 6 hour world record in a Snoek (388km) 
while Ruben Schütz set a new 24 hours record (1256 km) in a Milan SL Mk7 at the Record Weekend in Aldehoven. 

== Comparison to other cycle types ==
=== Aerodynamic fairing ===
The velomobile fairing adds weight compared to standard upright cycles or unfaired recumbent cycles. For a given terrain, the added weight demands lower gearing and makes the velomobile slower climbing hills than its unfaired counterpart.

Some velomobile fairings are mainly for weather protection. However, if the velomobile fairing is substantially streamlined, then improved aerodynamics means the speeds on flats and down hills may be substantially higher than its unfaired counterpart, and often enough faster to make up for the slower climbing due to weight.

An aerodynamic fairing must be well-shaped, but minimizing the frontal area of the velomobile is also important to reduced drag: a fairing with half the frontal area may approach half the air drag. In turn, aerodynamic velomobiles use a laid-back or recumbent riding position, with the rider&#x27;s head much lower than on regular bicycles. In turn, velomobile is much easier to accidentally &quot;hide&quot; behind a car or road-side shrubbery, fences, etc.

The fairing on a velomobile sometimes makes it more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle. The effect of cross-winds is complicated because the force of the wind can act as a steering force, as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle. &quot;Wind steer&quot; can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line. Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall. For example, it is common for time-trial bicycles to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind. Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design. For example, a longer &quot;tail&quot; on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on the steered wheels and so an improve stability in side winds. A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more skin drag), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.

==== Weather protection ====
Velomobiles with fairings that are mainly for weather protection can use a more upright seating position. This tends to improve both the ability to see and be seen. However, to retain stability against tipping (both cornering and cross-winds), the wheel track needs to be wider than a comparable velomobile with a low seating position. In turn, this may make the velomobile quite a bit wider than a conventional cycle.

&quot;Weather&quot; protection includes cold and wet, but also shading from sun. Since the rider is doing work, it is typically desirable to have at least some cooling. Many velomobiles have vents and ducts which allow cooling while keeping out water; and the ducts/vents may be closed or covered in cold weather so the rider can stay comfortable even without a secondary heat source. In warm and hot weather, the fairing provides sun protection, but blocks the rider from cooling air, and so may be much warmer for a given level of effort. In some situations, a rider&#x27;s power output (for any type of cycle) is limited by body temperature, and the worse cooling of a velomobile can limit the rider&#x27;s power output more than on an unfaired cycle. With an aerodynamic fairing, the velomobile rider at reduced power output may still be faster than an unfaired cycle, due to the lower aerodynamic drag.

A velomobile&#x27;s fairing shields the drivetrain from weather, as well as the rider. Drivetrain maintenance is often reduced compared to other cycles, especially unfaired bicycles, where the front wheel kicks up grit-containing dust, mud, and dirty water that lands directly on the chain and increases the rate of abrasive wear on the drivetrain—including chain and sprockets, but sometimes also derailleurs. The fairing of a velomobile tends to limit both the amount and the kinds of grit landing on the drivetrain. Some cycles use tooth-belt drive, which is less affected by grit, is quieter than a chain, and may be lighter. However, belts are only available in pre-selected sizes. Many recumbent cycles, including most velomobiles, have a long drivetrain for which no suitable tooth belts are available.

Velomobile bodies are typically light enough that the center of mass is similar to the center of mass on an unfaired recumbent cycle. This makes cornering stability similar to similar unfaired cycles. However, minimizing velomobile width also contributes to reduced frontal area and thus drag; so there is an additional incentive to make the velomobile narrow. The narrowest velomobiles are only slightly wider than the rider&#x27;s shoulders, and so the width approaches that of an upright bicycle. However, an upright bicycle still has a significantly narrower &quot;useful&quot; width, as the road contact is in the center and so the rider&#x27;s hands/elbows/etc. might overhang the edge of the roadway or path without causing problems. In contrast, the wheel track of a velomobile is very nearly as wide as the vehicle itself, and so cannot overhang the edge.

The steered wheels on a velomobile will hit the fairing if steered sharply enough. Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for aerodynamics and width. Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse turning circle than an equivalent unfaired cycle. In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle. Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, but it is hard to build a stable vehicle using only rear-wheel steering. The Velayo uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it is produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles steered all wheels; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels. However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.

=== Wheel configurations ===
As of 2017, most velomobiles use a tadpole recumbent tricycle configuration — mainly to reduce component weight and improve wheel aerodynamics. However, some use a four-wheel or quadracycle configuration. The extra wheel significantly improves cornering stability and can also improve luggage capacity. As of 2017 there are not many four-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings, but there are a few, and some riders report speeds are close to three-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings.

Two-wheel &quot;streamliner&quot; configurations can have much less aerodynamic drag: wheels are hard to make aerodynamic; each wheel entry/exit to the fairing adds drag; and velomobiles with two front wheels are necessarily wider or longer than the rider, while two-wheel streamliners can be barely wider than the rider. A common way to describe aerodynamic drag is &quot;CdA&quot;; in one comparison of racing cycles, there were several two-wheel streamliners with less than half the CdA drag of the best three-wheeler. Air drag is most significant for high-speed events; as of 2016, the world record for a 200-metre sprint on near-level ground is about 145 km/h for a two-wheel streamliner and about 120 km/h for any vehicle with more than two wheels, meaning the two-wheel vehicle was about 20% faster. Aerodynamic power is roughly cubic in speed, so at lower speeds the difference is much less pronounced. At the same time, two-wheel streamliners require a way to stay upright when stopped and at very low speed, and are more sensitive to blowing over in cross-winds. These factors limit the use of streamliners, despite their aerodynamic advantage.

Velomobiles for cargo use often have heavy frames to carry load, plus the weight of the cargo itself. In turn, the weight of the fairing may be relatively less important. Also, bulky loads often have poor aerodynamics, and so the quality of aerodynamics of the fairing is less important. This may enable use of a fairing which in hot weather can be converted to a canopy. A canopy provides no aerodynamic benefits, but improves cooling compared to a faired configuration, while also reducing sun exposure compared to riding without a canopy. Thus, a &quot;high speed&quot; velomobile may benefit most from better aerodynamics, even when aerodynamics hurts rider cooling; while at the same time a &quot;high load&quot; velomobile may benefit most from improved cooling (to maximize power output) even if that hurts aerodynamics.

Velomobiles are significantly bulkier than conventional cycles. Further, the bodywork typically cannot be disassembled much, whereas conventional cycles often can be disassembled to fit in a box or bag of dimensions similar to the frame. In turn, this makes velomobiles more difficult to transport.

Velomobiles are often built using some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles or even specific to a particular make or model. In addition, the bodywork is large and may be around half the weight of a velomobile. Thus, to reduce weight, the body is often made of lighter but more expensive materials. Also, production volumes are low, so for both parts and labor there are not benefits of mass production—, many velomobile makers have yearly production on the order of tens or maybe a few hundred velomobiles. Taken together, these factors mean velomobiles are often much more expensive than other cycle types.

As an example of prices and price/weight tradeoffs, as of April 2017 the maker Trisled offers their &quot;Rotovelo&quot; model either with a rotational molded plastic fairing or with a carbon fiber fairing (as well as some other weight-saving changes). The body shapes and underlying framework are similar; the rotational-molded version weighs 33 kilograms and has a list price of Au$6500, while the carbon fiber version weighs 20 kilograms and has a list price of Au$10900.

Much of the cycle-related infrastructure design is based on the typical configuration of an upright bicycle. For example, multi-modal transportation such as bike/train/bike routes often use bicycle racks in the train, and the dimensions of racks and also the train ingress/egress assume a conventional cycle. Similarly, cycle paths often have bollards or S-bend paths to prevent motor vehicle entry, and the entry is often spaced for upright bicycles, but may be too narrow or require too sharp of a turn to allow through some velomobiles.

== Electric assisted velomobiles ==
Some velomobiles have been converted to provide electric assist. Electric assist means that a small battery-operated electric-propulsion system is provided to assist the driver&#x27;s leg muscle effort. Most electric-assist propulsion motors are of the in-wheel design in the rear wheel, such as geared hub motors (like eZee, Heinzmann, Bafang, BMC, etc.) and direct-drive hub motors (like Crystalyte, BionX, 9Continent, etc.) but mid-drive units (like Sunstar, Cyclone, Ecospeed, etc.) are used as well due to design constraints in velomobile models with one-sided rear wheel mounting like the Quest, Strada and Mango or front wheel drive in the Velayo, or better efficiency by using the multiple speeds of the chain drive or internal geared hubs (e.g. Rohloff 14 speed hub).

While an electric-assist unit does add extra weight to the velomobile, it is somewhat offset by the flexibility it also provides, especially during hill climbs and stop-and-go traffic. Due to vastly better aerodynamics of velomobiles the range of a similar electric assist unit and similar battery in a velomobile can be about 50% to 100% higher compared to upright bicycles or unfaired recumbents.

In events like the RACV Energy Breakthrough and the Fraser Coast Technology Challenge, there are entire categories dedicated to electric and other hybrid powered velomobiles.

The legal definition of &quot;bicycle&quot; often includes velomobiles, but laws covering cycles with electric assist vary widely across countries and often within a country and even between cities in a region. For example, a specific vehicle may be a &quot;bicycle&quot; in one area, a &quot;low-speed pedal-assisted cycle&quot; in another area, and a &quot;moped&quot; in yet a third. Similarly, going from 3 wheels to 4 wheels can change the category of an otherwise identical vehicle. One reason for the varying treatment is that many laws are older than widespread use of power-assisted velomobiles and so the laws were not written to consider such vehicles. In some areas, laws are being rewritten to include power-assist velomobiles and to harmonize treatment with nearby laws.

The Veemo, now produced by ENVO Drive Systems, is a semi-enclosed, pedal-electric velomobile designed to offer a practical and eco-friendly alternative for urban commuting. Originally developed by VeloMetro Mobility, Veemo was acquired by ENVO in 2023. As of January 2025, ENVO has shipped pre-release Veemo products to customers across North America and Europe, with plans to ship the first production batch of Veemo vehicles in mid 2025. The Veemo differs from many other velomobiles by focusing on comfort for city commuting, rather than minimizing drag for racing purposes, instead relying on the electric assist drivetrain to compensate for the added weight of the enclosed vehicle compared to a typical bicycle.

==DIY (do it yourself) velomobiles==
With a growing DIY-community and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly &quot;green energy&quot;, some hobbyists have endeavored to build their own velomobiles from kits, sourced components, or from scratch. When compared to similar sized commercial velomobiles, the DIY velomobiles from kits tend to be less expensive. 

Probably the most built velomobile kits were the various models of the Alleweder made from prefabricated aluminium sheet metal due to its affordable price. Due to low demand, the Alleweder A4 kit was discontinued in 2020. As of 2024, no major velomobile manufacturer offers velomobile kits.

==Velomobile and recumbent Internet communities==
Many amateur velomobile builders are also recumbent bike riders. In more recent years many online velomobile groups, some of them focusing on specific regions, have appeared, on Facebook and on other platforms.

<doc id="196379" wikidata="Q1821334" url="?curid=196379" title="Let's Go (Rancid album)">
<text>Let&#x27;s Go is the second studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid. It was released on June 21, 1994, through Epitaph Records and was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Lars Frederiksen on guitar and vocals. The album initially achieved little mainstream success, though it appealed to the band&#x27;s fanbase. However, the surprise success of punk rock bands such as The Offspring, Green Day and Bad Religion in the mid-1990s brought forth more mainstream interest in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, and it peaked at number 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Salvation&quot; was released to alternative radio on February 3, 1995.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; is the first Rancid album to be produced by Brett Gurewitz. He would go on to engineer the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; (1995) and returned as the band&#x27;s permanent producer in 2000, starting with their fifth album.

==Writing and production==

After Rancid hired second guitarist Lars Frederiksen, they returned to the studio in October 1993 with producer Brett Gurewitz to begin work on its second studio album. It took the band just six days to record the twenty-three songs selected for the album. &quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Dope Sick Girl&quot;, two songs previously included on a 7&quot; vinyl for Fat Wreck Chords, were altered for inclusion on &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; was released through Epitaph Records in June 1994. They toured the US that month, before taking the following month off. They played two local shows, as well as five shows with Sick of It All. In September, they embarked on a tour of Canada, and an east coast US tour.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as &quot;sheer energy&quot;. He praised the music as a &quot;less-serious, party-ready version of The Clash&quot;. The album received a rating of four out of five stars, while &quot;Salvation&quot; earned Rancid its first moderate success.

===Commercial performance and accolades===
&quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; peaked at number 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on July 7, 2000.

In November 2011 &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; was ranked number eight on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1994.

In April 2014 Rolling Stone placed the album at No. 24 on its &quot;1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative&#x27;s Greatest Year&quot; list.

<doc id="196382" wikidata="Q175032" url="?curid=196382" title="12 Songs (Randy Newman album)">
<text>12 Songs is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Randy Newman, released in April 1970 by Reprise Records. It features a swampy style of roots music with introspective, satirical songwriting. &quot;Have You Seen My Baby?&quot;, the album&#x27;s only single, was released in May.

When &quot;12 Songs&quot; was first released, it was well received and has since garnered retrospective acclaim from critics such as Robert Christgau and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, both of whom cite it as one of the best albums of all time.

== Music and lyrics ==
According to &quot;Q&quot; magazine, &quot;12 Songs&quot; demonstrated Newman&#x27;s eccentric mix of traditional pop song structures and his sardonic, satirical humor. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming said although his sense of humor seemed more caustic than on his self-titled debut album, Newman&#x27;s &quot;most mordant character studies&quot; on &quot;12 Songs&quot; &quot;boast a recognizable humanity, which often make his subjects both pitiable and all the more loathsome.&quot; In the opinion of Robert Christgau, American songwriting in general is often &quot;banal, prolix, and virtually solipsistic when it wants to be honest, merely banal when it doesn&#x27;t&quot;, but Newman&#x27;s truisms on the album are &quot;always concise, never confessional&quot;, and unique:

As with all of Newman&#x27;s early albums, several of its songs had been previously recorded by other artists. In this case, &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot; had originally been recorded in 1967 by Eric Burdon, and that same year the Beau Brummels released their version of &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. Three other songs originally appeared in versions by other artists just a few months prior to the LP release of &quot;12 Songs&quot;: &quot;Yellow Man&quot; by Harry Nilsson on his February 1970 album &quot;Nilsson Sings Newman&quot;; &quot;Have You Seen My Baby&quot; by Fats Domino (as a 1969 single); and &quot;Let&#x27;s Burn Down the Cornfield&quot; by Lou Rawls (the B-side to his 1970 R&amp;B hit &quot;You&#x27;ve Made Me So Very Happy&quot;).

== Critical reception ==

&quot;12 Songs&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary critics. According to Keith Phipps from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Newman &quot;began to gather a following beyond critics and fellow songwriters&quot; with the album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Bruce Grimes gave it a rave review when it was released, hailing the album as &quot;the full emergence of a leading innovator in rock and roll&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Christgau called it the best record of 1970, finding the songwriting, production, and performances superior and &quot;more accessible than the great-but-weird album that preceded it&quot;.

Years later in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau called &quot;12 Songs&quot; &quot;a perfect album&quot;. Deming later said it was Newman&#x27;s &quot;first great album, and ... still one of his finest moments on record.&quot; Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Dave DiMartino observed some of Newman&#x27;s &quot;best-known earlier material&quot; on the album, which he felt featured &quot;a stellar trio of guitarists, including Ry Cooder, Clarence White and (The Beau Brummels) Ron Elliott.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; commended Newman for replacing &quot;the orchestra with an Americana rock rhythm section&quot;, while writing that &quot;the more conventional presentation found Newman a college audience attuned to his wry singularity&quot;.

In 2000 it was voted number 691 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;12 Songs&quot; was ranked number 354 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at 356 in a 2012 revised list. Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), cited it as the moment &quot;where Newman got loose as a rock &amp; roller, ditching the complex orchestrations for a bluesy, easy-swinging satire of America&quot;.

<text>Out of the Cellar is the debut studio album by the American heavy metal band Ratt, released in 1984 by Atlantic Records. The album was an immediate success, with wide airplay on radio and heavy rotation on MTV of its singles, especially the hit &quot;Round and Round&quot;. The album is certified as triple platinum by the RIAA. The album brought Ratt to the top of the glam metal scene in Los Angeles. &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; would prove to be the band&#x27;s most successful album.

==Production and composition==

Produced by Beau Hill, &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; features Ratt&#x27;s best-known hit, &quot;Round and Round&quot;. It also contains other popular songs such as &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, &quot;Lack of Communication&quot;, and a re-recorded version of &quot;Back for More&quot;. The latter song originally appeared on the EP &quot;Ratt&quot;. &quot;In Your Direction&quot; was a song that Pearcy wrote when the band was still called Mickey Ratt. &quot;I&#x27;m Insane&quot; and &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; were songs Crosby had co-written and performed with his pre-Ratt band, Mac Meda, featuring future Riverdogs vocalist Rob Lamothe. &quot;Wanted Man&quot; was co-written by bassist Joey Cristofanilli, who had briefly substituted for Juan Croucier. Original lyrics for &quot;She Wants Money&quot; and &quot;Lack of Communication&quot; have been posted on Croucier&#x27;s website.

According to interviews with Hill that were shot for the film &quot;Hair I Go Again&quot;, Tom Allom was originally slated to produce the record before he was recruited to do it.

==Cover art==
The model on the album cover is actress Tawny Kitaen, better known for her appearances in Whitesnake music videos. The long-time girlfriend of Ratt guitarist Robbin Crosby at the time, Kitaen also appeared in the &quot;Back for More&quot; music video.

<text>Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the fifth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on September 24, 1991, by Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, its musical style differed notably from the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; (1989), reducing the use of heavy metal guitar riffs and accentuating the melodic songwriting contributions of guitarist John Frusciante. The album&#x27;s subject matter incorporates sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death, as well as themes of lust and exuberance.

&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; peaked at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and produced hit singles &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Give It Away&quot;, &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; and &quot;If You Have to Ask&quot;. The album received widespread critical acclaim and propelled the band into worldwide popularity. Heavily uncomfortable with fame, Frusciante quit the band during its 1992 tour; he rejoined in 1998.

&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; is widely recognized as an influential and seminal release of the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s, with Steve Huey of AllMusic calling it &quot;probably the best album the Chili Peppers will ever make.&quot; Flea shared the same sentiment in 2023, calling it his favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers album. The album has sold over 14 million units making it the band&#x27;s second best-selling album behind &quot;Californication&quot;.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s previous album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, was the band&#x27;s second album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 52, at the time the biggest of their career. Although the album was somewhat successful, the band felt unsatisfied with producer Michael Beinhorn. He convinced Frusciante to play with a heavier guitar tone, and instructed Anthony Kiedis to write lyrics that would be more radio-friendly, causing the band to feel restricted creatively.

As the band&#x27;s contract with EMI came to an end, they began looking for a new record label. The group reached a consensus to go with Epic, with the proviso that they buy out their last album from EMI. Though the label promised it would take only a few days, the process stretched out into several months. Although a deal had been made with Epic, Mo Ostin of Warner Bros. Records called Kiedis to congratulate him on the successful deal, and complimented the rival record label. Kiedis recalled of the situation: &quot;The coolest, most real person we had met during all these negotiations had just personally called to encourage me to make a great record for a rival company. That was the kind of guy I&#x27;d want to be working for.&quot; The group pursued the idea, and eventually dropped the contract with Epic in favor of a deal with Warner Bros. Ostin called an old friend at EMI, who immediately allowed for the label transfer.

==Recording and production==
Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who died of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers&#x27; previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.

The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini allegedly once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said &quot;There are definitely ghosts in the house,&quot; but he felt they were &quot;very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.&quot;

Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he&#x27;d written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea&#x27;s brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album&#x27;s recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled &quot;Funky Monks&quot;.
==Music==
&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was written at a more rapid pace than the band&#x27;s previous album. Before the Chili Peppers relocated into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other&#x27;s homes, in order to arrange song structures and guitar riffs. Then they presented ideas to Flea and Smith; as a whole, they decided on what they would use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.

Kiedis focused lyrically on sexual references and innuendos, as they were frequently on his mind. Songs such as &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;, &quot;If You Have to Ask&quot;, &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy&quot;, &quot;Give It Away&quot; and &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; all contained sexual links, with lyrics like &quot;A state of sexual light / Kissing her virginity / My affinity&quot; and &quot;Glorious euphoria / Is my must / Erotic shock / Is a function of lust.&quot; The concept behind &quot;The Greeting Song&quot; was a request Rubin had made. Rubin asked Kiedis to write a song solely about girls and cars. Although Kiedis disliked the concept, he wrote the song as Rubin requested and ended up disliking almost every one of the lyrics&#x27; aspects. Kiedis also began writing songs about anguish, and the self-mutilating thoughts he experienced thanks to his addiction to both heroin and cocaine; he believed his life had come to its lowest point under a bridge in downtown Los Angeles. Over a month later, Rubin stumbled upon a poem that eventually became the lyrics to &quot;Under the Bridge.&quot; Also, he suggested Kiedis show it to the other band members. However, Kiedis was apprehensive because he thought the lyrics were &quot;too soft&quot; and different from the band&#x27;s style. After singing the verse to Frusciante and Smith, the band started working on the song&#x27;s structure the next day. Both Rubin and Kiedis worked several hours on arranging the song&#x27;s chords and melodies until they both accepted it as complete. Frusciante ultimately chose the chords he played in the intro so it could balance out the song&#x27;s depressing atmosphere: &quot;my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier.&quot; &quot;Naked in the Rain&quot; was among the first songs that the band wrote for the album. The Red Hot Chili Peppers even played it once at the end of the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk Tour&quot; in 1990, while the intros for &quot;The Greeting Song&quot; and &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy&quot; were also teased during the end of that tour; however, neither song was completed or had lyrics.

&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; integrated the band&#x27;s typical punk and funk style, but moved away from that with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like &quot;The Righteous and the Wicked&quot;, &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, &quot;Give It Away&quot; and &quot;Funky Monks&quot; still incorporated the use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but they differed from &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; since they contained less distortion. Flea reduced his use of the slapping technique emphasized on earlier albums, instead favoring more traditional and melodic bass lines. He even adopted a minimalist, &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy, saying, &quot;I was trying to play simply on &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; because I&#x27;d been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, &#x27;I&#x27;ve really got to chill out and play half as many notes&#x27;. When you play less, it&#x27;s more exciting—there&#x27;s more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good.&quot; Kiedis thought that the album had expanded the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; musical horizons and served as a departure from their previous material. One of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;&#x27;s more melodic tracks, &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot;, was written about Kiedis&#x27; constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father&#x27;s footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: &quot;As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, at the end of the day, that shit is lonely and you&#x27;re left with nothing.&quot; The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.

Although jams had always served as an integral aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; saw songs containing more structure. One specific jam caused the breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea, and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when &quot;Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad cracked up and played along ... I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my mind. I (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out &#x27;Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now.&quot; The philosophy behind the lyrics came from a conversation that Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. This was the inspiration to the song &quot;Give It Away&quot;. He also reminisced about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing &quot;My Lovely Man&quot; in his memory. Kiedis wrote &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy&quot; as an over-zealous and exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. &quot;The Power of Equality&quot; confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice, and sexism. Kiedis wrote &quot;I Could Have Lied&quot; to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

==Outtakes==
Around 25 songs were written and recorded during the &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; sessions, with 17 of those making the album&#x27;s final cut. The album&#x27;s singles contained four outtakes from the album sessions as B-sides. Among those were the instrumental &quot;Fela&#x27;s Cock&quot;, a cover of The Stooges&#x27; &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and &quot;Sikamikanico&quot; (which would also appear on the &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; soundtrack in 1992). On Oct. 3, 2019, &quot;Sikamikanico&quot; was performed for the first time ever at the request of guitarist Josh Klinghoffer for his 40th birthday. The most notable outtake was &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot;, a song that would eventually become a hit single in 1993 when it was released on the &quot;Coneheads&quot; soundtrack and was also included on the band&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

&quot;Little Miss Lover&quot; and &quot;Castles Made of Sand&quot; (a song the band had been performing live for a few years), two Jimi Hendrix cover songs, would eventually be released in 2006 as iTunes bonus tracks. An unknown song appeared in the VH1 &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; documentary, &quot;Ultimate Albums&quot;. A rough mix of the album surfaced on the Internet and contains some alternate versions of the songs recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions.

==Artwork==

All photography, paintings and art direction for &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; were credited to filmmaker Gus Van Sant, with the exception of the &quot;tongue illustration&quot;, which, according to the album booklet, is credited to Hanky Panky (Henk Schiffmacher). The cover of the album features the four band members&#x27; faces positioned around a rose, with thorny vines in black and white coming out of their open mouths and converging on the rose. The lyrics are printed in white lettering across a black background, hand written by Kiedis. The booklet also contains a collage of photos assembled to showcase the band members&#x27; various tattoos, which feature faces of Native American tribal leaders, animals and sea creatures, as well as various symbols and phrases. Photographs of each band member alone, and two photographs of the band as a whole are also included.

Singles released to coincide with the album share little with &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;&#x27;s artwork. The cover of &quot;Give It Away&quot; was a painting of a Chinese infant, surrounded by fish, vegetables, fruits and sushi; &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; is a photograph of a bridge in the city of Los Angeles; &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; had a black and white photograph of the band, with Kiedis and Flea holding a large fish; &quot;If You Have to Ask&quot; is an illustration of an avocado next to a girl&#x27;s large buttocks in a yellow bikini; and &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; featured a painting of a human being covered in magma.

==Dedication==
&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was dedicated to musician Mike Watt of the bands Minutemen and fIREHOSE, in thanks for his friendship and musical inspiration to the band.

==Promotion and release==
&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Nevermind&quot;. It was certified gold on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Originally, &quot;Give It Away&quot; did not fare well in the mainstream; one of Warner Bros.&#x27; target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to &quot;come back to us when you have a melody in your song&quot;. KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, &quot;was the beginning of the infusion of &#x27;Give It Away&#x27; into mass consciousness.&quot; The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.

Due to the success of &quot;Give It Away&quot;, the band did not foresee &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers&#x27; concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially &quot;mortified that I&#x27;d fucked up in front of Warner&#x27;s people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said &#x27;Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that&#x27;s our next single. &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; was, therefore, selected as &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;&#x27;s second single. By January 1992, &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip. However, it proved difficult for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: &quot;He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album that I think he really didn&#x27;t know how to live life in tandem with that creativity.&quot; It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, and he decided to return home when he and Kiedis reached London.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Tom Moon credited Rick Rubin for the change in style; Rubin &quot;[gave] the Chilis&#x27; dynamic&quot;. He went on to praise the overall sound, which &quot;displayed a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Steven Wells found that Rubin&#x27;s &quot;cold precision&quot; was evident on what Wells deemed &quot;a babbling, rambling 17-track bastard classic&quot; featuring &quot;a clinical but writhing state-of-the-art fusion of funk, rap and metal scrapings&quot;.

Steve Huey of AllMusic said the album was &quot;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; best album ... John Frusciante&#x27;s guitar is less overpoweringly noisy, leaving room for differing textures and clearer lines, while the band overall is more focused and less indulgent.&quot; He considered &quot;Blood Sugar&quot; to be &quot;varying ... it expands the group&#x27;s musical and emotional range.&quot; &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine credited Frusciante with the Chili Peppers&#x27; drastic change in style: &quot;by blending acid-rock, soul-funk, early art-rock, and blues style with a raw, unprocessed Strat-and-Marshall tone, [Frusciante] hit on an explosive formula that has yet to be duplicated&quot;.

Devon Powers of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that &quot;in one funked-out, fucked up, diabolical swoop, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; reconfigured my relationship to music, to myself, to my culture and identity, to my race and class&quot;. In an article published in &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, editor Philip Booth praised the record as &quot;an ambitious effort that amounts to a culmination and blossoming of the musical forces that have been brewing in the band&#x27;s sound since Kiedis and Flea birthed the band in 1983&quot;. Robert Christgau gave it an honorable mention in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; consumer guide, naming &quot;Give It Away&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; as highlights while writing &quot;they&#x27;ve grown up, they&#x27;ve learned to write, they&#x27;ve got a right to be sex mystiks.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Michael Corcoran was more reserved in his praise, deeming the record &quot;great&quot; only on occasion while finding the length of the album excessive. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; is considered to be an influential album, throughout the nineties, by establishing itself as a fundamental foundation for alternative rock. It has also been referred to as &quot;the cornerstone album of funk rock&quot; by FasterLouder.

&quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, which became a breakout song for the band, was considered to be a highlight of the album by several critics. AllMusic reviewed the song individually and called it a &quot;poignant sentiment ... it is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo&quot;, and ultimately &quot;has become an integral part of the 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the rough-hewn and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers&#x27; own oeuvre.&quot; However, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized the seriousness that the Red Hot Chili Peppers explored as being &quot;disapproving of the band&#x27;s usual Red Hot antics&quot;, and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; had &quot;fancy-shmancy touches&quot;. The song ended up peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 1992.

&quot;Give It Away&quot; was also praised, though as &quot;... a free-associative mixture of positive vibes, tributes to musical heroes, and free love&quot;, with Frusciante &quot;adding the song&#x27;s two most unpredictable change-ups: a sudden contrast to Kiedis&#x27; hyperactivity in the form of a languid solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track, and a hard-rocking riff which is not introduced until the song&#x27;s outro&quot;.

Tracks such as &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy&quot;, however, were criticized for being overly explicit. Devon Powters of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that &quot;Eight minutes of &#x27;Sir Psycho Sexy&#x27; will turn RHCP&#x27;s young listeners into quivering masses of hormonal jello. Oversexed lines sneak their way into &#x27;Apache Rose Peacock&#x27;; &#x27;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&#x27;, simply, sounds like fucking. Even the purest virgin comes away from &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; with a degree of sexual maturity; even the slickest playa can learn a couple of new moves.&quot;

In contrast, &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;, according to Amy Hanson of AllMusic, &quot;completely flew in the face of the established pecking order of alternative rock.&quot; With the song, the Chili Peppers &quot;fully allied themselves with the very few genre-bending bands that were able to make a radical impact on the sonic landscape that was dominated, it seemed, from every minute angle by grunge.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Tour and Frusciante&#x27;s departure==
Before the &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; tour began, Kiedis saw the music video for the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; on MTV. He called the band&#x27;s manager and asked him to accommodate the Smashing Pumpkins for the tour. Several days after the Pumpkins confirmed they would accompany the Chili Peppers, former Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons called and asked the band to allow his friend&#x27;s new group, Pearl Jam, to open for them on the forthcoming tour.

The first show following the release of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was at the Oscar Mayer Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which was met with positive reactions from the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot;: &quot;the audience was a swirling mass of airborne cups, ice cubes, shoes, shirts, pogo dancers, body-passers and stage divers. And it wasn&#x27;t purely a boy&#x27;s club in the moshpit—many females bought into the mayhem, stripping down to their bras and flinging themselves about madly as the band tore through &#x27;Higher Ground&#x27;, &#x27;Suck My Kiss&#x27;, and &#x27;Give it Away&#x27;, which was Goth-ed up by Frusciante when he added a riff from Black Sabbath&#x27;s &#x27;Sweet Leaf&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; began receiving heavy radio play and massive sales in the middle of their U.S. tour. Frusciante, who wanted the Chili Peppers to remain in the underground music scene, entered a state of denial and depression. According to Kiedis, &quot;He began to lose all of the manic, happy-go-lucky, fun aspects of his personality. Even onstage, there was a much more serious energy around him.&quot; Frusciante began to form grudges against his bandmates. He saw the band&#x27;s newfound popularity as shameful.

Onstage tension began to grow between Kiedis and Frusciante. Kiedis recalled an argument after a show in New Orleans: &quot;We had a sold-out house and John just stood in the corner, barely playing his guitar. We came offstage and John and I got into it.&quot; With the Peppers now playing shows at arenas rather than theaters, the promoters decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act. Kiedis contacted Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, who accepted an offer for Nirvana to replace Pearl Jam. The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; Billy Corgan, however, refused to play with Nirvana as he had once dated frontman Kurt Cobain&#x27;s wife Courtney Love. The Pumpkins were, therefore, replaced with Pearl Jam. The upshot for the tour (albeit not by design) then, was the Smashing Pumpkins being replaced by Nirvana while Pearl Jam maintained their &quot;status quo&quot;.

Their first show with Nirvana was at the L.A Sports Arena. Kiedis described Nirvana&#x27;s act as &quot;raw energy; their musicality, their song selection, they were like a chain saw cutting through the night&quot;. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished touring with Nirvana, they traveled to Europe, where Frusciante, in need of someone to connect to, brought along his girlfriend Toni Oswald. Kiedis said that &quot;John had broken our unwritten rule of no spouses or girlfriends on the road&quot;. Briefly interrupting the European tour, the Chili Peppers flew to New York City and performed on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. They played &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; as the second song; a performance that Kiedis felt was sabotaged by Frusciante:

The band took a two-week hiatus between the European and Japanese legs of the tour, which began in May 1992. Minutes before the Chili Peppers were scheduled to perform in Tokyo, Frusciante refused to go on stage, saying he had quit. After half an hour of coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he said it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: &quot;It was the most horrible show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, knowing that we were no longer a band. I kept looking over at John and seeing this dead statue of disdain ... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; The band hired guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the tour, which included Lollapolooza and several European and South American festivals. He was fired at the end of the tour.

== Live performances ==
To date, songs from the album remain the most performed out of any album from the band&#x27;s catalog. &quot;Give it Away&quot; and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; are the two most performed songs ever by the band with &quot;Give it Away&quot; being performed over 1000 times and at every show since 1991. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, &quot;I Could Have Lied&quot;, &quot;If You Have to Ask&quot;, &quot;Sir Pyscho Sexy&quot;, &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re Red Hot&quot; are also frequently performed. The only songs to never have been performed from the album in full are &quot;Mellowship Slinky in B Major&quot; and &quot;The Righteous &amp; the Wicked&quot;. &quot;Apache Rose Peacock&quot; has been partially performed 3 times while &quot;The Greeting Song&quot; has also been partially performed or teased a few times. &quot;Funky Monks&quot; was first performed in 1991 and not again until 2006 when they performed it twice. &quot;Naked in the Rain&quot; was one of the earliest songs from the album to be performed live. It was only performed on December 31, 1990, and once more in November 1991. Despite being one of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; has only been performed 22 times with its last performance coming in 2019 with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer; It was only performed a total of 10 times with John Frusciante. &quot;My Lovely Man&quot; was performed many times between 1991 and 2004.

<doc id="196397" wikidata="Q604819" url="?curid=196397" title="Tribes of Galway">
<text>The Tribes of Galway () were 14 merchant families who dominated the political, commercial and social life of the city of Galway in western Ireland between the mid-13th and late 19th centuries. They were the families of Athy, Blake, Bodkin, Browne, Darcy/D’Arcy, Deane, Font, French, Joyce, Kirwan, Lynch, Martin, Morris and Skerritt. Of the 14 families, 12 were of Anglo Norman origin, while two—the Darcy () and Kirwan () families—were Normanised Irish Gaels.

==History==

The Tribes were merchant families who prospered from trade with continental Europe. They dominated Galway&#x27;s municipal government during the medieval and early modern eras.

The Tribes distinguished themselves from the Gaelic peoples who lived in the hinterland of the city. Many of these families spoke Irish as a second or even first language. However, the feared suppression of their common faith joined both groups together as Irish Catholics after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653), Galway took the side of the Confederate Catholics. Following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the English government punished the Tribes. Galway was besieged and after it surrendered in April 1652, the Tribes had to face the confiscation of their property by the New Model Army.

The Tribes lost much of their power within Galway city after English Parliamentarians took over the Galway Corporation in 1654. Cromwell&#x27;s forces referred to them by the derogatory name, &quot;The Tribes of Galway&quot;, which the families later adopted as a mark of defiance.

Galway&#x27;s urban elite gained a restoration of some of their power during the reign of the King Charles II (1660–1685) and his successor James II. However, Jacobite defeat in the War of the Two Kings (1689–91), marked the end of the Tribes&#x27; once overwhelming political influence on the life of the city. Power passed to the small Protestant population. Garrison members of the Tribes who owned land in Galway and Mayo were protected by the advantageous surrender provisions that were signed on 22 July 1691.

==Modern use==
Similar to the nicknames used for other Irish counties, Galway city and county and its people are known as &quot;the tribesmen&quot;. This nickname is derived from this term.

The tribes also lend their names to 14 of the roundabouts in or around the boundaries of Galway city. The roundabouts are signposted on navy blue signs containing the tribe&#x27;s name in the Irish language.

<text>Claude Fournier L&#x27;Héritier (21 December 1745 – 1825) was a French personality of the Revolution, nicknamed &quot;l&#x27;Américain&quot; (&quot;the American&quot;).

==Life==

===Early activities===
He was born at Auzon (Haute-Loire), the son of a poor weaver, and went to the French West Indies to seek his fortune. On the island of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), he began the manufacture of tafia (an inferior quality of rum), but lost everything in a fire.

===Revolution===
Returning to France, he joined the Revolution with enthusiasm, and distinguished himself by organizing a popular armed force which became involved in all major insurrections of the capital including the Women&#x27;s March on Versailles (1789), Champ de Mars Massacre (1791), the storming of the Tuileries Palace (1792) and the 9 September massacres.

He was on bad terms with the majority of the politicians (particularly with Jean-Paul Marat) and spent much of his time in prison, all governments regarding him as an agitator and accusing him of inciting to insurrection. Arrested for the first time for trying to force an entrance into the club of the Cordeliers, from which he had been expelled, he was released, but was in prison from 12 December 1793, to 21 September 1794, and again from 9 March to 26 October 1795.

===Consulate, Empire, Restoration===
After the attempt on the First Consul in the Rue Sainte-Nicaise he was deported to French Guiana, but was allowed to return to the French Empire in 1809. In 1811, while under surveillance at Auxerre, he was accused of having provoked a riot against indirect taxes known as the &quot;droits réunis&quot; (afterwards called &quot;contributions indirectes&quot;), and was imprisoned in the Château d&#x27;If, where he remained until 1814.

On the second Bourbon Restoration, Fournier was confined for about nine months in La Force Prison. After 1816 he turned Royalist, and passed his last years in importuning the Restoration government for compensation for his lost property in Saint-Domingue. He died in obscurity.

<text>Californication is a portmanteau of California and fornication, appearing in &quot;Time&quot; on May 6, 1966 and written about on August 21, 1972, additionally seen on bumper stickers in the U.S. states of Idaho, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Oklahoma, and Texas.

It was a term popular in the 1970s and referring primarily to the &quot;haphazard, mindless development [of land] that has already gobbled up most of Southern California&quot;, which some attributed to an influx of Californians to other states in the Western United States.

==As a popular concept==
One of the most well-known uses of the word occurs in the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27;s album &quot;Californication&quot; (1999), which has a song by the same name. The song refers to a Hollywood-driven exportation of culture, with further references to plastic surgery, war, population control, and natural disasters.

The concept is also familiar within the social sciences, and is understood as American cultural imperialism emanating from California. This Californication is a particular ethos packaged as a cultural commodity and broadcast throughout the world in order to penetrate into other cultures.

== Causes ==
Steven Malanga, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, said he believes that domestic migration from California is mainly driven by high housing costs and taxation rates in the state, citing polls with California residents on their desire to leave. Malanga suggested that migrants from California are likely to trend politically conservative, whereas liberals are less likely to want to leave the state.

== By state ==

=== Colorado ===
On November 7, 1972, in a statewide referendum, Colorado voters rejected a bond issue to fund the hosting of the 1976 Winter Olympics. The venue for the games would have been spread over and was widely viewed as a license for unbridled development. As part of the opposition to the bond, the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Californicate Colorado&quot; was coined, appearing on bumper stickers and placards across the state. This rejection by Colorado voters followed a trend in the western states to blame California-style &quot;mindless development&quot; for the urban growth problems experienced in states like Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Oregon.

=== Idaho ===
Idaho was the fastest-growing state in the 2010s as the city of Boise experienced significant migration from California. Of the roughly 80,000 new Idaho residents in 2016, 17,000 arrived from California. Increased house purchases by out-of-state migrants, especially retirees, led to significant increases in real estate prices in and around Boise. Idaho&#x27;s appeal to Californians has been attributed to its low cost of living and high quality of life.

===Oregon===
&quot;Californication&quot; as a pejorative was a culmination of sentiments known in the 1940s, typified by Stewart Holbrook, author and &quot;Oregonian&quot; columnist, who campaigned through the fictitious James G. Blaine Society against development and unchecked population growth.
Similar groups—such as The Miller Society—jokingly promoted measures like building a tall fence all along Interstate 5 to prevent exiting between California and Washington, expelling non-native Oregon-born residents, and instituting a $5000 immigration fee.

In 1965, Eugene&#x27;s first planning commission began to question decades of promotion by chambers of commerce and developers. It referred to a 1959 pro-growth development plan and rampant road building as &quot;All the way to San Jose&quot;—an allusion to freeways&#x27; decreasing neighborhood livability. Interstate 5 from California was completed the year before. Previously, the main route into Oregon from California was through twisty, two-lane U.S. Route 99.

Governor Tom McCall was interviewed by Terry Drinkwater and appeared on national television January 12, 1971, for his acclaimed conservation experience. Extemporaneously he said, &quot;Come visit us again and again. But for heaven&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t come here to live.&quot; Soon, bumper stickers that discouraged migration to Oregon were widely seen: &quot;The famous radioactive vapors of the Columbia River will get you!&quot;, and &quot;Oregonians don&#x27;t tan; they rust&quot;. The banner &quot;Don&#x27;t Californicate Oregon&quot; became the symbol of James Cloutier&#x27;s line of &quot;Oregon Ungreeting Cards&quot;, which carried sentiments such as &quot;Tom Lawson McCall, governor, on behalf of the citizens of the great state of Oregon, cordially invites you to visit... Washington or California or Idaho or Nevada or Afghanistan&quot;. 

===Washington===
&quot;Seattle Times&quot; columnist Emmett Watson remarked in a 1989 piece on Lesser Seattle that the &quot;invasion of California nitwits to the Northwest&quot; had reached &quot;epidemic&quot; proportions.

<doc id="196402" wikidata="Q17098449" url="?curid=196402" title="Legendre function">
<text>In physical science and mathematics, the Legendre functions , and associated Legendre functions , , and Legendre functions of the second kind, , are all solutions of Legendre&#x27;s differential equation. The Legendre polynomials and the associated Legendre polynomials are also solutions of the differential equation in special cases, which, by virtue of being polynomials, have a large number of additional properties, mathematical structure, and applications. For these polynomial solutions, see the separate Wikipedia articles.

== Legendre&#x27;s differential equation ==
The general Legendre equation reads
formula_1
where the numbers and may be complex, and are called the degree and order of the relevant function, respectively. The polynomial solutions when is an integer (denoted ), and are the Legendre polynomials ; and when 
 is an integer (denoted ), and is also an integer with are the associated Legendre polynomials. All other cases of and can be discussed as one, and the solutions are written , . If , the superscript is omitted, and one writes just , . However, the solution when is an integer is often discussed separately as Legendre&#x27;s function of the second kind, and denoted .

This is a second order linear equation with three regular singular points (at , , and ). Like all such equations, it can be converted into a hypergeometric differential equation by a change of variable, and its solutions can be expressed using hypergeometric functions.

== Solutions of the differential equation ==
Since the differential equation is linear, homogeneous (the right hand side =zero) and of second order, it has two linearly independent solutions, which can both be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function, formula_2. With formula_3 being the gamma function, the first solution is
formula_4
and the second is
formula_5

These are generally known as Legendre functions of the first and second kind of noninteger degree, with the additional qualifier &#x27;associated&#x27; if is non-zero. A useful relation between the and solutions is Whipple&#x27;s formula.

===Positive integer order ===
For positive integer formula_6 the evaluation of formula_7 above involves cancellation of singular terms. We can find the limit valid for formula_8 as

formula_9

with formula_10 the (rising) Pochhammer symbol.

==Legendre functions of the second kind ()==

The nonpolynomial solution for the special case of integer degree formula_11, and formula_12, is often discussed separately. 
It is given by
formula_13

This solution is necessarily singular when formula_14.

The Legendre functions of the second kind can also be defined recursively via Bonnet&#x27;s recursion formula
formula_15

== Associated Legendre functions of the second kind ==
The nonpolynomial solution for the special case of integer degree formula_11, and formula_17 is given by
formula_18

==Integral representations==
The Legendre functions can be written as contour integrals. For example,
formula_19
where the contour winds around the points and in the positive direction and does not wind around .
For real , we have
formula_20

==Legendre function as characters==
The real integral representation of formula_21 are very useful in the study of harmonic analysis on formula_22 where formula_23 is the double coset space of formula_24 (see Zonal spherical function). Actually the Fourier transform on formula_22 is given by
formula_26
where
formula_27

==Singularities of Legendre functions of the first kind () as a consequence of symmetry ==
Legendre functions of non-integer degree are unbounded at the interval [-1, 1] . In applications in physics, this often provides a selection criterion. Indeed, because Legendre functions of the second kind are always unbounded, in order to have a bounded solution of Legendre&#x27;s equation at all, the degree &quot;must&quot; be integer valued: &quot;only&quot; for integer degree, Legendre functions of the first kind reduce to Legendre polynomials, which are bounded on [-1, 1] . It can be shown that the singularity of the Legendre functions for non-integer degree is a consequence of the mirror symmetry of Legendre&#x27;s equation. Thus there is a symmetry under the selection rule just mentioned.

<doc id="196404" wikidata="Q724817" url="?curid=196404" title="Richard Scarry">
<text>Richard McClure Scarry (; June 5, 1919 – April 30, 1994) was an American children&#x27;s author and illustrator who published over 300 books with total sales of over 100 million worldwide. He is best known for his &quot;Best Ever&quot; book series that take place primarily in the fictional town of Busytown, &quot;which is populated by friendly and helpful resident [animals...such as] Mr. Frumble, Huckle Cat, Mr. Fixit, Lowly Worm, and others...&quot; The series spawned a media franchise.

==Early life and education==
Scarry was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Mary McClure and John Scarry Sr., who were of Irish-American ancestry and ran a small department store chain. Scarry had four siblings: older brother John Jr., younger sister Barbara, and younger brothers Edward and Leo. The family enjoyed a comfortable life at their 32 Melville Avenue home in the Dorchester neighborhood, even during the Great Depression.

Following high school, Scarry enrolled in Boston Business School, but dropped out in 1938. He then studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Archipenko Art School in Woodstock, New York, and the Eliot O&#x27;Hara Watercolor School in Goose Rocks, Kennebunkport, Maine, before being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942.

== Career==
After entering the Army, Scarry was assigned to the military&#x27;s radio repair school. After a small success in that trade, he was chosen to paint a large sign and then was made an art director after receiving a medical dispensation &quot;from strenuous physical activity&quot;. Later he became &quot;Editor and Writer of Publications for the Information and Morale Services Section of the Allied Force Headquarters&quot;, served in North Africa, and was discharged from the Army in 1946. After the war, Scarry worked in magazine and advertising in New York City, including a very brief stint at &quot;Vogue&quot;. In 1949, he made a career breakthrough with Little Golden Books.

Scarry&#x27;s most famous series of books was about Busytown and revolved around anthropomorphic animals. While his books are largely populated by common animal species, he proved to be quite adept at giving human characteristics to a seemingly endless number of creatures, machines, and creations. Many of his later illustrations feature characters in traditional Swiss clothing and show architecturally correct drawings of half-timber houses.

Scarry was a disciplined worker. Scarry was closely associated with mass-market children&#x27;s publisher Ole Risom. They worked together on dozens of books, including &quot;I Am a Bunny&quot;, which Risom wrote and Scarry illustrated. First published in 1963, it remained in print into the 2000s. Risom and Walter Retan also co-wrote an illustrated biography, &quot;The Busy, Busy World of Richard Scarry&quot;. In the 1980s and 1990s, many of Scarry&#x27;s &quot;Best Ever&quot; books were produced as animated videos and aired during TLC&#x27;s now-defunct &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; block. The Busytown books were also adapted into an animated series, &quot;The Busy World of Richard Scarry&quot;, which was produced by Canada-based CINAR (now WildBrain) and Paramount Television and aired on the pay-TV channel Showtime from 1993 to 1997. It reran in the late 1990s on Nickelodeon and its sister channel Noggin (now the Nick Jr. Channel). A further animated series, &quot;Busytown Mysteries&quot;, was commissioned by CBC from the Cookie Jar Group (the successor to CINAR) in 2007, and it aired on the Kids&#x27; CBC morning program block.

Busytown was featured at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh from June 13 to September 8, 2002, in an interactive exhibit, &quot;Richard Scarry&#x27;s Busytown&quot;. His books were popular with children throughout the world, with over 100 million copies sold.

Scarry&#x27;s papers and drawings are collected in the University of Connecticut archives.

==Personal life and family==
While working as a freelance illustrator, Scarry met Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Murphy, a writer of children&#x27;s textbooks, when they collaborated on one such book, and they married in 1948. She is credited with writing many of the stories in his subsequent children&#x27;s books, such as &quot;Good Night, Little Bear&quot;, &quot;The Bunny Book&quot;, and &quot;The Fishing Cat&quot;. Before moving to Europe, the family lived on a farm in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

In 1972, Scarry and his wife moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, and in 1974 bought a chalet in nearby Gstaad, where Scarry enjoyed spending time with his adult son, Richard Scarry Jr., skiing, coin collecting, and sailing.

Scarry&#x27;s son is also an illustrator, who sometimes works under the name Huck Scarry in his father&#x27;s style. He moved to Vienna, Austria, and has four children.

==Death==
On April 30, 1994, in Gstaad, Switzerland, Scarry died of a heart attack, caused by complications from esophageal cancer, at age 74.

== Bibliography ==
Scarry began his book career in 1949 as an illustrator of books by other people, specifically Kathryn &amp; Byron Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Mouse&#x27;s House&quot;. He continued as only or primarily an illustrator through 1955, then began turning out original books.

<doc id="196406" wikidata="Q16996749" url="?curid=196406" title="In My Tribe">
<text>In My Tribe is the third studio album from the American alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs. Released on July 27, 1987, by Elektra Records, it was their second major-label album and their first to achieve large-scale success. John Lombardo, Natalie Merchant&#x27;s songwriting partner on previous albums, had left the band in 1986, and &quot;In My Tribe&quot; saw Merchant begin to collaborate with the other members of the band, most notably with Rob Buck.

==Artwork==
The front cover designed by Kosh of the CD edition is a black-and-white photograph of children with bows and arrows in an archery class, a theme used by record and cassette editions with different covers.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s J. D. Considine wrote that &quot;with &quot;In My Tribe&quot;, the group has finally come into maturity. It isn&#x27;t simply that the songs are richer and more resonant this time around; the band itself seems to have grown.&quot; In 1989, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number sixty-five on their list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s, summing it up as &quot;a poetic, heartfelt message about social concerns such as alcoholism, child abuse and illiteracy.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; largely praised the album, in particular Peter Asher&#x27;s production, which he felt made the band &quot;more forceful and accessible&quot; and brought Merchant&#x27;s vocals to the foreground. While he also felt the band were recycling musical ideas from departed guitarist John Lombardo, he stated that &quot;the advances in Merchant&#x27;s singing and lyrics—both are more intimate and assured—help offset the problems of over-familiarity.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was critical of Merchant&#x27;s &quot;nasal art-folk drawl&quot;, but added that &quot;by deprivatizing her metaphors, she actually says something about illiteracy, today&#x27;s army, and cruelty to children.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic reviewer Chris Woodstra wrote that &quot;the album proves powerful not for the ideas [...] but rather for the graceful execution and pure listenability.&quot; 

==&quot;Peace Train&quot; controversy==
In 1989, the band&#x27;s recording of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Peace Train&quot; was removed from the U.S. CD and cassette versions of the album, after comments made by Stevens (by then a Muslim convert, known as Yusuf Islam) that were perceived to be supportive of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie. The song remained on copies released outside the United States. It was later included on the band&#x27;s 2-CD compilation &quot;Campfire Songs: The Popular, Obscure and Unknown Recordings&quot;, released on January 24, 2004 by Elektra/Asylum/Rhino Records.

<text>Justo Rufino Barrios Auyón (19 July 1835 – 2 April 1885) was a Guatemalan politician and military general who served as President of Guatemala from 1873 to his death in 1885. He was known for his liberal reforms and his attempts to reunite Central America.

== Early life ==

Barrios was known from his youth for his intellect and energy, went to Guatemala City to study law, and became a lawyer in 1862.

== Rise to power ==

In 1867, revolt broke out in western Guatemala, which many residents wished to return to its former status of an independent state as Los Altos. Barrios joined with the rebels in Quetzaltenango, and soon proved himself a capable military leader, and in time gained the rank of general in the rebel army.

In July 1871, Barrios, together with other generals and dissidents, issued the &quot;Plan for the Fatherland&quot; proposing to overthrow Guatemala&#x27;s long entrenched &quot;Conservadora&quot; (conservative) administration; soon after, they succeeded in doing so, and General García Granados was declared president and Barrios commander of the armed forces. While Barrios was back in Quetzaltenago, García Granados was seen as weak by his own party members and was asked to call for elections, as the general consent was that Barrios would make a better president. Barrios was elected president in 1873.

== Government ==

The Conservative government in Honduras gave military backing to a group of Guatemalan Conservatives wishing to take back the government, so Barrios declared war on the Honduran government. At the same time, Barrios, together with President Luis Bogran of Honduras, declared an intention to reunify the old United Provinces of Central America.

During his time in office, Barrios continued with the liberal reforms initiated by Miguel García Granados, but he was more aggressive in implementing them. A summary of his reforms is:

* Definitive separation between church and state: he expelled the regular clergy such as Morazán had done in 1829 and confiscated their properties.

* Forbid mandatory tithing to weaken secular clergy members and the archbishop.
* Established civil marriage as the only official one in the country
* Secular cemeteries
* Civil records superseded religious ones
* Established secular education across the country
* Established free and mandatory elementary schools
* Closed the Pontifical University of San Carlos and in its place created the secular National University.

Barrios had a National Congress totally pledged to his will, and therefore was able to enact a new constitution in 1879, which allowed him to be reelected as president for another six-year term.

He also was intolerant with his political opponents, forcing many to flee the country and building the infamous Guatemalan Central penitentiary where he had numerous people incarcerated and tortured.

=== Guatemalan administrative structure during Barrios’ tenure ===

Appleton&#x27;s guide for México and Guatemala from 1884, shows the twenty departments in which Guatemala was divided during Barrios&#x27; time in office:

Barrios oversaw substantial cleaning and reconstruction of Guatemala City, and set up a new accountable police force. He brought the first telegraph lines and railroads to the republic. He established a system of public schools in the country.

=== Economy ===


During Barrios&#x27; tenure, the &quot;Indian land&quot; that the conservative regime of Rafael Carrera had so strongly defended was confiscated and distributed among those officers who had helped him during the Liberal Revolution in 1871. Decree # 170 (a.k.a. Census redemption decree) made it easy to confiscate those lands in favor of the army officers and the German settlers in Verapaz, as it allowed to publicly sell those common Indian lots. Therefore, the fundamental characteristic of the productive system during Barrios&#x27; regime was the accumulation of large swaths of land among few owners and a sort of &quot;farmland servitude,&quot; based on the exploitation of the native day laborers.

In order to ensure a steady supply of day laborers for the coffee plantations, which required many, Barrios&#x27; government decreed the &quot;Day Laborer regulations&quot;, labor legislation that placed the entire native population at the disposition of the new and traditional Guatemalan landlords, except the regular clergy, who were eventually expelled form the country and saw their properties confiscated. This decree set the following for the native Guatemalans:

# forced by law to work on farms when the owners of the farms required them, without regard for where the native towns were located.
# under control of local authorities, who were charged with ensuring that day laborers were sent to all the farms that required them.
# subject to &quot;habilitation:&quot; a type of forced advanced pay, which buried the day laborer in debt and then made it legal for the landlords to keep them on their land for as long as they wanted.
# Created the day laborer booklet: a document that proved that a day laborer had no debts to his employer. Without this document, any day laborer was at the mercy of the local authorities and the landlords.

=== Second term ===

In 1879, a constitution was ratified for Guatemala. This was the Republic&#x27;s first as an independent nation, as the old Conservador regime had ruled by decree. In 1880, Barrios was reelected President for a six-year term. Barrios unsuccessfully attempted to get the United States of America to mediate the disputed boundary between Guatemala and Mexico.

== Central American Union ==

Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras agreed to re-form the Central American Union, but the then Salvadoran President Rafael Zaldivar decided to withdraw, and sent envoys to Mexico to join in an alliance to overthrow Barrios. Mexican President Porfirio Díaz feared Barrios&#x27; liberal reforms and the potential of a strong Central America as a neighbor if Barrios&#x27; plans bore fruit. Díaz sent Mexican troops to seize the disputed land of Soconusco.

== Death ==


Justo Rufino Barrios died during the Battle of Chalchuapa in El Salvador, as did his son, General Venancio Barrios, on 2 April 1885. The official liberal version is that Barrios was killed in action, alongside officer Adolfo V. Hall. However, some versions insist that a Guatemalan soldier missed a shot and killed president Barrios from behind or that there might have been a murder plot.

Upon learning about his death, the Guatemalan Army panicked; officer José María Reyna Barrios, president Barrios&#x27; nephew, picked up the lifeless body of Venancio Barrios and organized the withdrawal of the Guatemalan battalions, while preparing the defense against a possible Salvadorian attack. Reyna Barrios, signing as &quot;Rosario Yerjabens&quot;, told the story of what he saw, which does not match the official account: &quot;The general in Chief, Justo Rufino Barrios, decided, about 8 a.m., to personally command the attack on the northeast side of &quot;Casa Blanca&quot;; and in order to accomplish that, he sent the Jirón Brigade, whose soldiers were all Jalapas. These soldiers behaved in the most cowardly and disgraceful way. It is believed that they had been indoctrinated by some miserable traitor, one of those men without heart or conscience, one of those ungrateful people that was licking their benefactor&#x27;s hand and abusing both his good heart and fortune. Unfortunately, a moment after the attack began, an enemy bullet wounded him mortally and he had to be taken off the battlefield. This sad occurrence was enough for some coward Jalapa soldiers who saw general Barrios dead, to leave their post and spread the sad news.&quot;

On 4 April the defeated Guatemalan forces arrived in Guatemala City, where Reyna Barrios was promoted to general for his valiant battle services.

Today, his portrait is on the five quetzal bill in Guatemala, and the city and port of Puerto Barrios, capital of Izabal, bears his name.

<text>Aue-Schwarzenberg is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the Czech Republic and the districts of Vogtlandkreis, Zwickauer Land, Stollberg and Annaberg.

== History ==
The Ore Mountains were virtually unsettled in the early Middle Ages. There was an isolated monastery as early as the 12th century. Most of the towns in the mountains were founded in the 16th century, after the discovery of deposits of silver and tin. At this time the region was purchased by the aspiring state of Saxony (1533).

The districts of Aue and Schwarzenberg were established in 1873. In 1994 both districts were merged in order to form a new district, which was called Westerzgebirgskreis and was one year later renamed to the present name (Aue-Schwarzenberg). On 1 August 2008 it was merged into the new district Erzgebirgskreis.

== Geography ==
The district was located in the western part of the Ore Mountains. The crest of this mountain range forms the southern border of the district, which is also the German-Czech border. The highest peak in the district is the Auersberg (1019 m), second highest mountain of Saxony after the Fichtelberg.

The source of the Zwickauer Mulde is located in the district. From here it runs northwards to Zwickau.

<doc id="196418" wikidata="Q321917" url="?curid=196418" title="Spalding Gray">
<text>Spalding Gray (June 5, 1941 – ) was an American actor, novelist, playwright, screenwriter and performance artist. He is best known for the autobiographical monologues that he wrote and performed for the theater in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as for his film adaptations of these works, beginning in 1987. He wrote and starred in several, working with different directors.

Theater critics John Willis and Ben Hodges called Gray&#x27;s monologues &quot;trenchant, personal narratives delivered on sparse, unadorned sets with a dry, WASP, quiet mania.&quot; Gray achieved renown for his monologue &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;, which he adapted as a 1987 film in which he starred; it was directed by Jonathan Demme. Other of his monologues that he adapted for film were &quot;Monster in a Box&quot; (1991), directed by Nick Broomfield, and &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (1996), directed by Steven Soderbergh.

Gray died by suicide at the age of 62 after jumping into New York Harbor on January 11, 2004. He had been struggling with depression and severe injuries following a car accident. Soderbergh made a documentary film about Gray&#x27;s life, &quot;And Everything Is Going Fine&quot; (2010). An unfinished monologue and a selection from his journals were published in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

==Early life==
Spalding Rockwell Gray was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Rockwell Gray Sr., the treasurer of Brown &amp; Sharpe, and Margaret Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; ( Horton) Gray. He was the second of three sons; his brothers were Rockwell Jr. and Channing. They were raised in their mother&#x27;s Christian Science faith. Gray and his brothers grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island, spending summers at their grandmother&#x27;s house in Newport, Rhode Island. Rockwell became a literature professor at Washington University in St. Louis, and Channing a journalist in Rhode Island. After graduating from Fryeburg Academy in Fryeburg, Maine, Gray enrolled at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, as a poetry major. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1963. In 1965, Gray moved to San Francisco, California, where he became a speaker and teacher of poetry at the Esalen Institute. In 1967, while Gray was vacationing in Mexico City, his mother committed suicide at age 52. She had suffered from depression. After his mother&#x27;s death, Gray returned to the East Coast and settled permanently in New York City. Gray&#x27;s books &quot;Impossible Vacation&quot; and &quot;Sex and Death to the Age 14&quot; are largely based on his childhood and early adulthood.

==Career==
Gray began his theater career in New York in the late 1960s. In 1970, he joined Richard Schechner&#x27;s experimental troupe The Performance Group. With actors from The Performance Group, including Willem Dafoe and Elizabeth LeCompte, Gray co-founded the theater company The Wooster Group. He worked with it from 1975 to 1980, before leaving the company to focus on his monologue work. During this time, he also appeared in adult films, having a featured role in &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1976) and appearing in Radley Metzger&#x27;s &quot;Maraschino Cherry&quot; (1978). He first attained prominence in the United States with the film version of his monologue &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;. He had performed this monologue in New York City and published it as a book in 1985. He adapted it as a film in 1987, directed by Jonathan Demme. It was based on Gray&#x27;s experience in Thailand filming a small role in &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984) about the war in Cambodia.

In 1987, he traveled to Nicaragua with Office of the Americas. He wrote an unproduced screenplay based on the experience. Some of his experiences there were documented in &quot;Monster in a Box&quot;. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship and the National Book Award in 1985 for this work. He continued to write and perform monologues until his death. Through 1993, these works often incorporated his relationship to his girlfriend Renée Shafransky. They married and she became his collaborator. He later married Kathleen Russo.

Gray&#x27;s success with his monologues brought him various supporting movie roles. He also played the lead role of the Stage Manager in a high-profile 1988 revival of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play &quot;Our Town&quot; at the Lincoln Center Theater. In 1992, Gray published his only novel, &quot;Impossible Vacation.&quot; The novel reflects elements of his life, including his mother&#x27;s Christian Scientist beliefs, his WASP background, and his mother&#x27;s suicide. Gray wrote a subsequent monologue, &quot;Monster in a Box&quot;, about his experiences in writing and promoting &quot;Impossible Vacation&quot;.

During an interview in 1997 with film critic Edward Vilga, Gray was asked whether the movie industry was &quot;confused&quot; by his writings and roles. He responded:
::I would say that my major problem with Hollywood is this—I sometimes paraphrase Bob Dylan—Bob Dylan says &quot;I may look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.&quot; I say, &quot;I may look like a gynecologist, an American ambassador&#x27;s aide, or a lawyer, but I feel like Woody Allen.&quot; ... My insides are not what my outsides are. I&#x27;m not who I appear to be. I appear to be a Wasp Brahmin, but I&#x27;m really a sort of neurotic, perverse New York Jew. When I was performing one year ago at this time in Israel, a review came out in Hebrew about &quot;Monster in a Box,&quot; and it read, &quot;Spalding Gray is funny, sometimes hilarious, wonderfully neurotic for a non-Jew.&quot; Only the Jews can say something like &quot;wonderfully neurotic.&quot;

Gray&#x27;s performance style relied upon an impressionistic use of memories rather than a recounting of chronological facts. Gray said his style of monologue resulted from a sort of &quot;poetic journalism.&quot;

==Health problems and death==
In June 2001, Gray was severely injured in a car crash while on vacation in Ireland. In the crash, he suffered a broken hip, which left his right leg almost immobilized, and a fracture in his skull. During surgery on his skull, a titanium plate was placed over the break after surgeons removed dozens of bone fragments from his frontal cortex, leaving a jagged scar on his forehead. He struggled to recover from his injuries and a severe depression set in some time after the accident. He had already struggled intermittently with depression. Suffering both from physical impairment and ongoing depression, Gray struggled for months and was treated with a variety of different therapies.

Gray sought treatment from neurologist Oliver Sacks, who began treating him in August 2003 and continued to do so almost until Gray died. Sacks later said Gray perceived the taking of his own life as part of what he had to say, with the monologuist having &quot;talked about what he called &#x27;a creative suicide.&#x27; On one occasion, when he was being interviewed, he thought that the interview might be culminated with a &#x27;dramatic and creative suicide.&#x27; I was at pains to say that he would be much more creative alive than dead.&quot;

On January 9, 2004, Gray had an interview with Theresa Smalec, the subject of which was Ron Vawter, a deceased friend and colleague whom he had met in the winter of 1972–73. Gray and Vawter had worked closely together throughout the 1970s, first with The Performance Group, then as core members of The Wooster Group. The edited transcript of &quot;Spalding Gray&#x27;s Last Interview&quot; was published in 2008 by the &quot;New England Theatre Journal&quot;.

On January 11, 2004, Gray was declared missing. The night before, he had taken his children to see Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Big Fish.&quot; It ends with the line, &quot;A man tells a story over and over so many times he becomes the story. In that way, he is immortal.&quot; Gray&#x27;s widow, Kathie Russo, said after he disappeared, &quot;You know, Spalding cried after he saw that movie. I just think it gave him permission. I think it gave him permission to die.&quot;

When Gray was first reported missing, his profile was featured on the Fox Network television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted.&quot;

In early March, Gray&#x27;s body was found in the East River. It is believed that he jumped off the Staten Island Ferry. He had previously attempted suicide in 2002. Gray was reported to have been working on a new monologue at the time of his death. There was speculation that his revisiting the material of the car crash in Ireland and his subsequent attempts to recover from his injuries might have triggered a final bout of depression.

Gray was buried at Oakland Cemetery in Sag Harbor, New York. He was survived by his wife Kathie Russo, stepdaughter Marissa, sons Forrest Dylan and Theo Spalding Gray, and brothers Rockwell and Channing Gray.

===Legacy===
Theater historian Don Wilmeth noted Gray&#x27;s contribution to a unique style of writing and acting: 
Describing the play-film monologue, theatre director Mark Russell wrote: 
Journalist and author Roger Rosenblatt described Gray as 
Director Jonathan Demme said of Gray, &quot;Spalding&#x27;s unfailing ability to ignite universal emotions and laughter in all of us while gloriously wallowing in his own exquisite uniqueness will remain forever one of the great joys of American performance and literature&quot;.

&quot;He took the anarchy and illogic of life and molded it into something we could grab a hold of,&quot; said actor and novelist Eric Bogosian. &quot;It took courage to do what Spalding did, courage to make theatre so naked and unadorned, to expose himself in this way and to fight his demons in public.&quot;

Theater critic Mel Gussow wrote of Gray&#x27;s &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot; and &quot;Terrors of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Through a look or a comment, he offers intelligent analysis. Though the narrative is entirely centered around Mr. Gray himself, it never suffers from self-pity or self-indulgence. He remains the antihero in his own fascinating life story, the never ending tale of EverySpalding.&quot;

In 2005, Gray&#x27;s unfinished final monologue was published in a hardcover edition titled &quot;Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue.&quot; The monologue, which Gray had performed in one of his last public appearances, is augmented by two additional pieces he performed at the time, a short remembrance called &quot;The Anniversary&quot; and an open letter to New York City written in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Also included in the book is an extensive collection of remembrances and tributes from fellow performers and friends.

The 2007 play &quot;Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell,&quot; produced at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, is based on his monologues and journals. Kathleen Russo, his widow, developed the concept for the play. The show has a cast of four actors as well as a rotating guest artist; all five read from selected portions of his work.

In January 2010, Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s documentary &quot;And Everything Is Going Fine&quot; was released at Utah&#x27;s Slamdance Film Festival. The film was compiled from film and video clips of Gray&#x27;s early life and career. Russo said that Soderbergh &quot;wanted Spalding to tell the story, as if it was his last monologue, and I think he accomplished that&quot;.

In 2011 a selection from his journals was published as &quot;The Journals of Spalding Gray,&quot; edited by Nell Casey, who had worked with Russo on the project. Dwight Garner found this material less interesting than Gray&#x27;s monologues. He said they have value as a &quot;portrait of a theatrical coming of age&quot; as Gray determined how to make his art. Garner wrote, &quot;His art, these journals make clear, is what kept him alive.&quot;

The 2016 season of the Independent Film Channel&#x27;s mockumentary television series &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; includes the episode &quot;Parker Gail&#x27;s Location is Everything,&quot; a parody of Gray&#x27;s &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;. In it, Bill Hader delivers a monologue expressing his dismay at having to find a new loft apartment in New York City upon learning that his current residence will be converted into an electronics store.

<text>Stanislav Zimprich (3 March 1916 – 12 April 1942) was a Czech pilot who flew with the RAF in the Battle of Britain.

==Biography==
Stanislav Zimprich was born on 3 March 1916 at Havlíčkův Brod in Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic). He joined the Military Aviation Academy at Prostějov for pilot training, and was posted to the Academy at Hranice where he graduated in 1937. He was then posted to the 5th Air Regiment. When Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Zimprich was demobilised with all the other members of the Air Force, but on 29 May, he and five Air Force colleagues escaped to Poland. They travelled at first by train, and then walking across the Ostravia region and over the border into Poland. After being briefly interned by the Polish authorities, the six Czech personnel were transferred to Kraków and reported to the Czechoslovak Consulate. On 17 June, Zimprich and forty-one other Czech airmen sailed from Gdynia on the &quot;Sobieski&quot;, arriving at Boulogne on 18 June 1939.

The Czechoslovak airmen were required to join the French Foreign Legion for a five year period, with the agreement that, should war be declared, they would be transferred to French military units. Zimprich was placed in the Legion barracks at Nanterre, near Paris, and then transferred to the training base at Sidi-bel-Abbes, Algeria. When war broke out he was transferred to l&#x27;Armée de l&#x27;Air and was posted to its Paris airbase. On 1 December 1940 he was posted to CIC Chartres for training on French equipment. He completed this training on 18 May 1940 and was assigned to GC I/8, based at Chantilly-les-Aigles, north of Paris. The rapidity of the German advance in May 1940 caused GCI/8 to move frequently as it retreated westward. By mid-June it was at Corme-Ecluse, near Royan, in south west France. When France collapsed, the Czech airmen of GCI/8 were released from l’Armee de l’Air service, and they travelled to the port of Bayonne. On 22 June they boarded the &quot;Konig Emma&quot; which landed them in England at Plymouth two days later.

Zimprich was at 4 Recruit Centre until 1 July when he went to the RAF Czechoslovak Depot at Cosford. He was commissioned in the RAFVR on 12 July and he joined 310 Squadron at Duxford. He made his first operational flight on 18 August. Zimprich probably destroyed two Bf 110&#x27;s on 7 September, destroyed a Do 17 and damaged a Bf 110 on 9 December, and probably destroyed a Do 17 on 18 December.

Still with 310 Squadron as a Flight Lieutenant, 26 year-old Zimprich died on 12 April 1942 during a combat training exercise using on-board cine cameras with six other 310 Squadron Spitfires near Perranporth airfield in Cornwall. He was flying Spitfire BL497, and appeared to make a mock attack, coming from the port side rear of Spitfire AD420 flown by Sergeant Stanislav Halama. He clipped the tail of Halama’s aircraft causing it to go into a vertical dive and crash into Gear Sands, killing the pilot. Zimprich’s Spitfire was seen to be flying very low from the sandhills towards the beach, its undercarriage up, but with its flaps down and the engine cut. Zimprich overshot the beach and landed in the sea, close to the shore. For some minutes, shore observers saw the tail of the Spitfire sticking out from the sea and a dark object, wearing a life jacket, floating away from it. An attempt was made to form a human chain to reach the aircraft but the people were beaten back by the sea. Zimprich’s body was washed up near Combe Martin on 20 July.

Flight Lieutenant Stanislav Zimprich was buried in St Augustine’s Churchyard, Heanton Punchardon, North Devon, on 22 July 1942.

He is credited with one confirmed and four probable kills. He mainly flew in a Hawker Hurricane. He was featured on a Czechoslovak postage stamp in 1945.

<text>The olfactory nerve, also known as the first cranial nerve, cranial nerve I, or simply CN I, is a cranial nerve that contains sensory nerve fibers relating to the sense of smell.

The afferent nerve fibers of the olfactory receptor neurons transmit nerve impulses about odors to the central nervous system (olfaction). Derived from the embryonic nasal placode, the olfactory nerve is somewhat unusual among cranial nerves because it is capable of some regeneration if damaged. The olfactory nerve is sensory in nature and originates on the olfactory mucosa in the upper part of the nasal cavity. From the olfactory mucosa, the nerve (actually many small nerve fascicles) travels up through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to reach the surface of the brain. Here the fascicles enter the olfactory bulb and synapse there; from the bulbs (one on each side) the olfactory information is transmitted into the brain via the olfactory tract. The fascicles of the olfactory nerve are not visible on a cadaver brain because they are severed upon removal. 

== Structure ==
The specialized olfactory receptor neurons of the olfactory nerve are located in the olfactory mucosa of the upper parts of the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerves consist of a collection of many sensory nerve fibers that extend from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, passing through the many openings of the cribriform plate, a sieve-like structure of the ethmoid bone.

The sense of smell arises from the stimulation of receptors by small molecules in inspired air of varying spatial, chemical, and electrical properties that reach the nasal epithelium in the nasal cavity during inhalation. These stimulants are transduced into electrical activity in the olfactory neurons, which then transmit these impulses to the olfactory bulb and from there they reach the olfactory areas of the brain via the olfactory tract.

The olfactory nerve is the shortest of the twelve cranial nerves and, similar to the optic nerve, does not emanate from the brainstem.

== Function ==
The olfaction system works to ensure that people can successfully identify an extensive range of odorants and distinguish odors from one another. Odorants interact with the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) at the periphery and transmit olfactory information to the central nervous system via axons at the basal surface. These axons aggregate, forming the olfactory nerve. Therefore, the olfactory nerve works to transduce sensory stimuli in the form of odorants and encode them into electrical signals, which are relayed to higher-order centers through synaptic transmission.

=== Odor Transduction ===
Odorants bind to specific odorant receptor proteins contained to the outer surface of olfactory cilia within the olfactory epithelium. Odorant binding to the cilia of an ORN evokes an electrical response, kickstarting odor transduction. An individual ORN contains several microvilli, olfactory cilia, which protrude from a knoblike structure at the apical surface involved in dendritic processes. The olfactory cilia lack the cytoskeletal features of motile cilia and are, therefore, more similar to microvilli like that found in the lungs or gut. Olfactory cilia are actin-rich protrusions supported by scaffolding proteins which help to localize odorant receptors and provide an increased cellular surface for odorant binding.

Homologous to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), olfactory receptor molecules consist of seven trans-membrane, hydrophobic domains and a cytoplasmic domain with a carboxyl terminal region that interacts with G-proteins and odorants. Once an odorant is bound to an odor receptor protein, the alpha subunit of an olfactory-specific heterotrimeric G-protein, Golf, dissociates and activates olfactory-specific adenylate cyclase, adenylyl cyclase III (ACIII). Activation of ACIII leads to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP), which depolarizes the neuron due to an influx of Na+ and Ca2+ by opening cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. The neuron is further depolarized by a Ca2+-activated Cl- current travelling from the cilia, where the depolarization first occurred, to the axon hillock of the ORN. At the axon hillock, voltage-gated Na+ channels open and generate an action potential that is transmitted to the olfactory bulb. After transmission, the ORN membrane is repolarized by calcium/calmodulin kinase II-mediated mechanisms that work to extrude Ca2+ and transport Na+ via an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, diminish cAMP levels by activating phosphodiesterases, and restore heterotrimeric Golf.

ORN axons are responsible for relaying odorant information to CNS through action potentials. The ORN axons leave the olfactory epithelium and travel ipsilaterally to the olfactory bulb where the ORN axons coalesce into multiple clusters, called glomeruli, which together form the olfactory nerve. The ORN axons of each glomerulus synapse with apical dendrites of mitral cells, the primary projection neurons of the olfactory bulb, which create and send action potentials further into the CNS.

=== Regeneration of Olfactory Nerves ===
ORNs directly interact with odorants inhaled into the olfactory epithelium which can also subject the ORNs to damage through continuous exposure to harmful substances such as airborne pollutants, microorganisms, and allergens. Therefore, ORNs maintain a normal cycle of degeneration and regeneration. The olfactory epithelium consists of three main cell types: supporting cells, mature ORNs, and basal cells. Regeneration of ORNs requires the division of basal cells, neural stem cells, to produce new receptor neurons. This regeneration process makes ORNs unique when compared to other neurons.

=== ORN Specificity ===
In the nasal passages, inhaled odorant molecules interact with receptor proteins on localized neuronal cilia of ORNs. These dendritic extensions, cilia, express one type of protein receptor, although individual odorants can interact with multiple different receptor proteins. As new ORNs mature, they have decreased expression levels of multiple olfactory receptor genes, contrasting with mature ORNs firm rule of one neuron—one expressed olfactory receptor gene. Moreover, different odors activate specific ORNs in a molecular and spatial manner due to receptor specificity. Some ORNs contain receptor proteins with high affinity for some odorants, with distinct odor selectivity to a specific chemical structure, while other receptor proteins are less selective.

==Clinical significance==

===Examination===
Damage to this nerve leads to impairment or total loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). To simply test the function of the olfactory nerve, each nostril is tested with a pungent odor. If the odor is smelled, the olfactory nerve is likely functioning. On the other hand, the nerve is only one of several reasons that could explain if the odor is not smelled. There are olfactory testing packets in which strong odors are embedded into cards and the responses of the patient to each odor can be determined.

===Lesions===
Lesions to the olfactory nerve can occur because of &quot;blunt trauma&quot;, such as coup-contrecoup damage, meningitis, and tumors of the frontal lobe of the brain. These injuries often lead to a reduced ability to taste and smell. Lesions of the olfactory nerve do not lead to a reduced ability to sense pain from the nasal epithelium. This is because pain from the nasal epithelium is not carried to the central nervous system by the olfactory nerve - it is carried to the central nervous system by the trigeminal nerve.

===Aging and smell===
A decrease in the ability to smell is a normal consequence of human aging, and usually is more pronounced in men than in women. It is often unrecognized in patients except that they may note a decreased ability to taste (much of taste is actually based on reception of food odor). Some of this decrease results from repeated damage to the olfactory nerve receptors due likely to repeated upper respiratory infections. Patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease almost always have an abnormal sense of smell when tested.

===Pathway to the brain===
Some nanoparticles entering the nose are transported to the brain via olfactory nerve. This can be useful for nasal administration of medications. It can be harmful when the particles are soot or magnetite in air pollution.

In naegleriasis, &quot;brain-eating&quot; amoeba enter through the olfactory mucosa of the nasal tissues and follow the olfactory nerve fibers into the olfactory bulbs and then the brain.

<doc id="196436" wikidata="Q4475947" url="?curid=196436" title="NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters">
<text>The NATO bombing of the [[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) headquarters occurred on the evening of 23 April 1999, during Operation Allied Force. Sixteen employees of RTS were killed when a NATO missile hit the building.

== Bombing of RTS ==
The bombing was part of NATO&#x27;s aerial campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and severely damaged the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television of Serbia (RTS). Other radio and electrical installations throughout the country were also attacked. Sixteen employees of RTS were killed when a single NATO missile hit the building. Nearly all the RTS employees killed were technicians, security workers and makeup artists. Many were trapped for days, only communicating over mobile phones. The station returned to the air less than 24 hours later from a secret location. The building of the Russian church nearby was also seriously damaged.

According to General Wesley Clark, the commander who oversaw the bombing campaign, NATO had planted a question at a Pentagon news conference to alert the Yugoslav government of their intention to target the broadcaster.

=== Justification ===
NATO Headquarters justified the bombing with two arguments; firstly, that it was necessary &quot;to disrupt and degrade the command, control and communications network&quot; of the Yugoslav Armed Forces, and secondly, that the RTS headquarters was a dual-use object which &quot;was making an important contribution to the propaganda war which orchestrated the campaign against the population of Kosovo&quot;.

The Yugoslav government said the building served no military purpose and only accommodated facilities of the civilian television network. It was, therefore, not a legitimate military target.

== Reactions ==
France was opposed to the attack. There was considerable disagreement between the United States and the French government regarding the legitimacy and legality of the bombing. 

While giving a speech at the Overseas Press Club sixtieth anniversary dinner, held on Thursday evening 22 April 1999 EST at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City, US envoy to Yugoslavia Richard Holbrooke reacted to the NATO&#x27;s bombing of the RTS headquarters almost immediately after it took place: &quot;Eason Jordan told me just before I came up here that while we&#x27;ve been dining tonight, the air strikes hit Serb TV and took out the Serb television, and at least for the time being they’re off the air. That is an enormously important event, if it is in fact as Eason reported it, and I believe everything CNN tells me. If, in fact, they&#x27;re off the air even temporarily, as all of you know, one of the three key pillars, along with the security forces and the secret police, have been at least temporarily removed. And it is an enormously important and, I think, positive development.&quot;

A report by Amnesty International into NATO&#x27;s bombing in Yugoslavia said NATO had violated international law by targeting areas where civilians were certain to be killed. In particular, the Amnesty report said the bombing of the RTS building by NATO &quot;was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime&quot;.

Human Rights Watch also condemned the attack, stating that &quot;Even if one could justify legal attacks on civilian radio and television, there does not appear to be any justification for attacking urban studios, as opposed to transmitters&quot;.

In 2001, the European Court of Human Rights declared inadmissible a case brought on behalf of the station&#x27;s employees by six Yugoslav citizens against NATO. Dragoljub Milanović, general manager of Radio Television of Serbia, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for failing to evacuate the building. 

Tim Judah and others stated that RTS had been broadcasting Serb nationalist propaganda, which demonised ethnic minorities and legitimised Serb atrocities against them.

Noam Chomsky said NATO&#x27;s bombing of RTS was an act of terrorism.

According to an Amnesty article published in 2009, nobody was held accountable for the attack itself, and no justice for the victims has been made.

A report prepared by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) entitled &quot;Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot; concluded that the TV station&#x27;s broadcasts to generate support for the war was not sufficient to make the RTS building a military target, but that the TV network had been part of the overall military communication system of the Serbian government, thus making the RTS building a legitimate military target. It said:

In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, &quot;unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.&quot;

==Aftermath==

The RTS building remains as it was left by the bombing. A new building has since been built next to the bomb-damaged one, and a monument has been erected to those killed in the attack.

In 2002, Dragoljub Milanović, the general manager of RTS, was sentenced to 10 years in prison because he had not ordered the workers in the building to evacuate, despite knowing that the building could be bombed.

<doc id="196446" wikidata="Q238215" url="?curid=196446" title="Natalie Merchant">
<text>Natalie Anne Merchant (born October 26, 1963) is an American singer-songwriter. She joined the band 10,000 Maniacs in 1981 and was lead vocalist and primary lyricist for the group. She remained with the group for their first seven albums before leaving to begin her solo career in 1993. She has since released nine studio albums as a solo artist.

==Early life==
Natalie Merchant was born October 26, 1963, in Jamestown, New York, the third of four children of Anthony and Anne Merchant (née Meyer). Her paternal grandfather, who played the accordion, mandolin and guitar, emigrated to the United States from Sicily; his surname was &quot;Mercante&quot; before it was anglicized. Her parents divorced when she was 7. Merchant grew up Roman Catholic although she started drifting away from the faith as a teen but continues to believe in a God.

When Merchant was a child, her mother listened to music (primarily Petula Clark but also the Beatles, Al Green, Aretha Franklin) and encouraged her children to study music, but would not allow television after Merchant was 12. &quot;I was taken to the symphony a lot because my mother loved classical music. But I was dragged to see Styx when I was 12. We had to drive 100 miles to Buffalo, New York. Someone threw up next to me and people were smoking pot. It was terrifying. I remember Styx had a white piano which rose out of the stage. It was awe-inspiring and inspirational.&quot; 

&quot;She [her mother] had show tunes, she had the soundtrack from &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;. And then eventually... she&#x27;d always liked classical music and then she married a jazz musician, so that&#x27;s the kind of music I was into. I never really had friends who sat around and listened to the stereo and said &#x27;hey, listen to this one&#x27;, so I&#x27;d never even heard of who Bob Dylan was until I was 18.&quot;

Merchant says she did not have a television set growing up: &quot;I grew up in a house where no one watched the news on television and no one read the paper. I&#x27;ve been discovering these things as I get older, and the news has affected me more than it ever has before.&quot;

Merchant started working in a health food store at 16. She considered a career in special education after taking part in a summer program for disabled children, but in 1981, she started singing for a band, Still Life, which became 10,000 Maniacs.

==Career==
===10,000 Maniacs===
Merchant was lead singer and primary lyricist for 10,000 Maniacs, joining in its infancy in 1981 while she was a student at Jamestown Community College. The group recorded their first album &quot;Human Conflict Number Five&quot;, and recorded a corresponding music video at the Hotel Franklin and at Group W Westinghouse studios in Jamestown, New York, in 1982. Merchant sang lead vocals, and later played the piano as well on seven studio albums with 10,000 Maniacs. In 1993 she announced that she was leaving the group, citing a lack of creative control over the music she wrote with the band. Her last recording with the band, a cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s and Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Because the Night&quot; at the 10,000 Maniacs &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance, reached #11 on the Hot 100 chart on February 18, 1994; becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting song in the U.S.

===&quot;Tigerlily&quot; (1995)===

After her split with 10,000 Maniacs, Merchant was so eager to begin writing her own material that she went home that very day and composed the song &quot;I May Know the Word&quot;, which was originally meant to appear on the soundtrack to the Tom Hanks movie &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. The song was eventually cut from the soundtrack, but it would go on to appear on Merchant&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Tigerlily&quot;, which was released on the Elektra label in 1995.
The third song on the album, &quot;Beloved Wife&quot;, was featured as the first song in the trailer for the film &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;.

&quot;Tigerlily&quot; was a critical and commercial success, spawning her first top-ten hit in the single &quot;Carnival&quot;, and achieving top-40 success with subsequent singles &quot;Wonder&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot;. The album would go on to sell over five million copies, and continues to be Merchant&#x27;s most successful album to date. She did extensive touring for it and made numerous television appearances, including performances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and on late-night talk shows. The media&#x27;s immediate and critical effect on culture and cultural icons was of particular interest to Merchant. In &quot;River&quot;, a song from &quot;Tigerlily&quot;, Merchant defends River Phoenix as she castigates the media for systematically dissecting the child actor after his death.

===&quot;Ophelia&quot; (1998–1999)===

Three years passed before Merchant released her second solo effort, &quot;Ophelia&quot;. While &quot;Tigerlily&quot; contained sparse instrumentation, the music on &quot;Ophelia&quot; had lusher arrangements. The reprise at the close of the album featured a symphonic arrangement composed and conducted by British composer Gavin Bryars with whom she would collaborate nine years later to put Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets to music. Merchant treated the recording of &quot;Ophelia&quot; as a series of workshops, where she would invite various musicians she had met over the years into her home studio to collaborate and record. While &quot;Ophelia&quot; is not a concept record in the traditional sense, the name of the album and the title track are a literary reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s Ophelia.

The first single off the album was a happy and uncharacteristically simple song called &quot;Kind and Generous&quot;, which received massive airplay on VH1 and which solidified Merchant&#x27;s role as a bona fide solo artist. That summer, Sarah McLachlan invited Merchant to co-headline the year&#x27;s biggest music festival with her, Lilith Fair. The exposure from the tour helped the album reach Platinum status in just under a year, with subsequent singles &quot;Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; receiving moderate airplay on adult contemporary stations. No video was filmed for the latter, however, with a clip from Merchant&#x27;s appearance on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; being used instead. She would also go on to appear on PBS&#x27; &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot; and VH1&#x27;s &quot;Hard Rock Live&quot; before the year&#x27;s end. In 1998, Merchant also recorded George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;But Not for Me&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;, a tribute to George Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.

The &quot;Ophelia&quot; tour ended in 1999 with the final few shows being performed and recorded on Broadway. The performance would be released as the album &quot;Natalie Merchant: Live in Concert&quot; with a companion video of the same name. The performance was notable in that it featured numerous covers including songs by David Bowie, Neil Young, and Katell Keineg.

In 1998, Merchant collaborated on the making of the album &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; with Billy Bragg and Wilco, which set previously unreleased Guthrie lyrics to music by Bragg. She provided lead vocals for the song &quot;Birds and Ships&quot; and backing vocals for &quot;Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key&quot;, and returned for the second volume of the album, 2000s &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot;, providing vocals on the song &quot;I Was Born&quot;.

===American folk music tour (2000) and &quot;Motherland&quot; (2001)===
In 2000, Merchant embarked on a folk tour in the United States with many shows being supported by alt-country band Wilco.

Merchant&#x27;s next studio album on the Elektra label was &quot;Motherland&quot;, released in 2001. &quot;Motherland&quot; saw Merchant at her most experimental musically. &quot;Motherland&quot; achieved Gold on the Billboard charts after debuting at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 and No. 13 on the Top Internet Albums of 2001, respectively. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; favored this album with stars, and also noticed a difference in Merchant&#x27;s voice, which was more deep and gritty like that of Sade than her previous albums. Singles that were released from &quot;Motherland&quot; were &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Last&quot;, &quot;Build a Levee&quot; and &quot;Tell Yourself&quot;.

Merchant embarked on a year-and-a-half-long world tour to promote &quot;Motherland&quot;. The first leg of the tour started in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 17, 2001, with performances across the United States, and heading to Europe with some special acoustic shows in Europe. Merchant also participated in the Rock am Ring Festival and Rock im Park in 2002. In the summer of 2002, she was paired with Chris Isaak and played at stadiums and arenas.

===&quot;The House Carpenter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003)===
After her contract with Elektra expired in August 2002, Merchant decided not to sign with them again, or any other major label. Her next studio album, &quot;The House Carpenter&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, was released in September 2003 on her own label, Myth America Records. To date this has been the only release on Myth America.

===&quot;Leave Your Sleep&quot; (2010)===
In October 2009, the websites of Nonesuch Records and Natalie Merchant announced that she had signed with the label. &quot;Leave Your Sleep&quot; was released on April 13, 2010 and is a compilation of five years of inspiration from a &quot;conversation&quot; with her daughter over the &quot;first 6 years of her life&quot;. The album debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at No. 17, Billboard Folk Albums at No. 1, Amazon.com at No.1, and iTunes, No. 3. The album was co-produced by Andres Levin.

Merchant contributed a recording of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Learning the Game&quot; to the tribute album &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly&quot;, released September 6, 2011.

===&quot;Natalie Merchant&quot; (2014)===
In February 2014, Merchant announced her eponymous album. The album consists of new works. It is her first collection of original material since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Motherland&quot;. &quot;Natalie Merchant&quot; was released May 6, 2014, on Nonesuch Records and was named Album of the Week by &quot;The Daily Telegraph.&quot; The album debuted at #20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 albums and #2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Folk Albums charts for the week of May 24, 2014. She toured from July 3, 2014, kicking off in Kingston, New York, concluding at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee on July 25, 2014.

===&quot;Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings&quot; (2015)===
In 2015, Merchant released an album of new recordings of the songs from her multi-platinum solo album. She enhanced many of the tracks with strings and stripped others bare. She says, &quot;The distance this music traveled once it left my hands is humbling, and I am moved by how many lives it has touched along the way.&quot;
===&quot;Butterfly&quot; (2017)===
In 2017, Merchant released &quot;Butterfly&quot;, a collection of new songs and orchestral versions of previously recorded songs.

===&quot;Keep Your Courage&quot; (2023)===
On April 14, 2023, Merchant released her eighth studio album, &quot;Keep Your Courage&quot;, via Nonesuch Records. It was her first album with new material since her 2014 eponymous album &quot;Natalie Merchant&quot;.

==Personal life==
Merchant met Michael Stipe of the band R.E.M. in 1983. The two became close friends and eventually had a romantic relationship. They credit each other as inspirations for some of their songwriting. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Stipe said, &quot;Natalie was really the reason my work became politicised in the late Eighties.&quot;

In 2003, Merchant married Daniel de la Calle and had a daughter named Lucia. In an interview in 2012, she indicated that she was divorced. She currently lives in Rhinecliff, New York.

Merchant enjoys gardening and painting. Some of her paintings can be seen on her website. She has been a vegetarian since 1980, except for the duration of her pregnancy, when she temporarily resumed eating meat. In 1997, she said: 

She now teaches arts and crafts to underprivileged children in New York state.

After suffering ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in 2019, Merchant received surgery for the condition, leaving her unable to sing for several months.

==Activism==
In 2012, Merchant, along with actor and writer Mark Ruffalo, organized a concert to protest against oil and gas fracking in New York state. A documentary, written and directed by Jon Bowermaster, was made of the event and titled &quot;Dear Governor Cuomo&quot;. She directed a short 2013 documentary titled &quot;Shelter: A Concert Film to Benefit Victims of Domestic Violence&quot;, that shone light on a group of women living in the mid-Hudson region of New York State responding to the crisis of domestic violence in their community with compassion and creativity. It was inspired by an event for One Billion Rising, a global campaign calling for an end to violence against women, held on February 14, 2013. Merchant presented a screening of the film at the Old Dutch Church in Kingston, New York, on the day of One Billion Rising for Justice.

Merchant, an outspoken critic of then-President-elect Donald Trump, participated in an anti-Trump protest organized by Ruffalo and Michael Moore, held outside Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City on January 19, 2017. Merchant performed her single &quot;Motherland&quot;. She concluded the event with a group sing-along of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;. The event was covered by CNN and broadcast live.

Merchant is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them in the past on awareness campaigns.

<doc id="196447" wikidata="Q960016" url="?curid=196447" title="Burgrave">
<text>Burgrave, also rendered as burggrave (from , ), was since the medieval period in Europe (mainly Germany) the official title for the ruler of a castle, especially a royal or episcopal castle, and its territory called a &quot;Burgraviate&quot; or &quot;Burgravate&quot; (German &quot;Burggrafschaft&quot; also &quot;Burggrafthum&quot;, Latin &quot;praefectura&quot;).

The burgrave was a &quot;count&quot; in rank (German &quot;Graf&quot;, Latin &quot;comes&quot;) equipped with judicial powers, under the direct authority of the emperor or king, or of a territorial imperial state—a prince-bishop or territorial lord. The responsibilities were administrative, military and jurisdictional.

A burgrave, who ruled over a substantially large territory, might also have possessed the regality of coinage, and could mint his own regional coins (see silver bracteates).

==History==
Etymologically, the word burgrave is the English and French form of the German noble title Burggraf (compounded from &quot;Burg&quot;: castle, fortress or equally fortified town and &quot;Graf&quot;: count) from Middle High German burcgrâve. The feminine form is burgravine, in German &quot;Burggräfin&quot; (from Middle High German &quot;burcgrâvin&quot;).

From the early High Middle Ages, the German &quot;Burggraf&quot; (burgrave) was the military governor or commander of a castle, similar to that of the Anglo-Norman French &quot;castellain&quot; and Middle English &quot;castellan&quot; (from ).

In the mid-12th century, King Conrad III of Germany created a new quality for the title of burgrave during the German eastward colonization. They became protectors and administrators of extensive royal territories near major imperial castles, such as Meissen, Altenburg and Leisnig, and received &quot;judicial lordship&quot; (German: &quot;Gerichtsherrschaft&quot;). They also acted as colonizers and created their own dominions.

Under the reign of King Rudolf I of Germany, their dignity was considerably advanced. Before his time, burgraves were ranked only as counts (&quot;Graf&quot;), below the princes (&quot;Fürst&quot;), but during his reign, they began to receive the same esteem as princes.

===Holy Roman Empire territories===
In the Kingdom of Germany, owing to the distinct conditions of the Holy Roman Empire, the title, borne by feudal nobles having the status of Reichsfürst (princes of the Empire), obtained a quasi-royal significance.

Like other officials of the feudal state, some burgraves became hereditary rulers. There were four hereditary burgraviates ranking as principalities within the Holy Roman Empire, plus the burgraviate of Meissen: 
* The Burgraviate of Antwerp (in present-day Belgium): this was a title inherited from the Margraviate of Antwerp by the Counts of Nassau, lords of Breda, who later became the title Prince of Orange. The most famous holder was William the Silent, who used his influence over the city to control its local government and use it as a base for the Dutch Revolt. Subsequently in the Low countries, the rank of burggraaf evolved into the nobility synonymous with viscount. The title &quot;Viscount of Antwerp&quot; is still claimed by the reigning monarch of the Netherlands as one of its subsidiary titles.
* The Burgraviate of Magdeburg,
* The Burgraviate of Friedberg,
* The Burgraviate of Meissen,
* The Burgraviate of Nuremberg: established by King Conrad III of Germany, the first burgraves were from the Austrian &quot;Count&#x27;s of Raabs&quot;, and then passed to the count&#x27;s surviving son-in-law from the House of Hohenzollern, which, since Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, continued to hold it until 1801. It was still included among the subsidiary titles of several German semi-sovereign princes; the king of Prussia, whose ancestors were burgraves of Nuremberg for over 200 years, maintaining the additional style of &quot;Burggraf von Nürnberg&quot;.

===Bohemia===
In the Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia, the title of burgrave was given by the King of Bohemia to the chief officer, or the regal official whose command is equivalent to a viceroy&#x27;s. From the 14th century, the burgrave of Prague—the highest-ranking of all burgraves, seated at Prague castle, gradually became the state&#x27;s highest-ranking official, who also acted as the king&#x27;s deputy; the office became known as the high or supreme burgrave of the Kingdom of Bohemia (Czech: &quot;&quot;); the appointment was usually for life. After the reforms of Maria Theresa (reign 1740–1780) and her son Joseph II (reign 1780–1790), the title of highest burgrave gradually lost its de facto power. The title of highest burgrave was still granted, however, and its holder remained the first officer of the kingdom. It was abolished in 1848.

===Poland===
In the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, the burgrave (Polish: &quot;burgrabia&quot;, earlier also &quot;murgrabia&quot;) was also of senatorial rank (i.e. held a seat in the upper chamber of the Senate of Poland). Ranking first among them was the &quot;Burgrave of Kraków&quot; (Polish: &quot;Burgrabia krakowski&quot;) of the former capital of Poland and Wawel Castle, who was appointed directly by the King of Poland. The royal office was originally created during the reign of Casimir III the Great. At that time, Kraków&#x27;s burgrave was also of the supreme court of Magdeburg law (Polish: &quot;Sąd wyższy prawa niemieckiego&quot;) erected in Kraków in lieu of Magdeburg. The burgrave of Kraków also collected an income from the royal Wieliczka Salt Mine, run by the Royal Salt Mines company &quot;Żupy krakowskie&quot; since the 13th century.

===Prussia===
In the Kingdom of Prussia, the burgrave was one of the four chief officers of a province, delegated by the King of Prussia.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the burgrave (, earlier spelling &quot;burggrefve&quot;) was the highest official in the cities of Gothenburg and Malmö during periods in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The title was first introduced by the king Gustavus Adolphus in the 1621 charter for Gothenburg, though it was not actually used until 1625. The burgrave of Gothenburg was to protect the &quot;highness, reputation and regalia&quot; of the monarch and was appointed by him or her from a group of six candidates proposed by the city board. In Gothenburg, the title ceased to be used in 1683 but was briefly reintroduced by Charles XII between 1716 and 1719. Now appointed among three candidates, the burgrave was the executive of the city, keeping the city keys and supervising the board. Following the Gothenburg model, the title was introduced in Malmö by Charles X Gustav after the city was ceded to Sweden in 1658, but was abolished 19 years later in 1677.

===England and France===
In Anglo-French parlance, a burgrave was considered analogous to a viscount.

<doc id="196448" wikidata="Q926234" url="?curid=196448" title="Orange clownfish">
<text>The orange clownfish (&quot;Amphiprion percula&quot;) also known as percula clownfish and clown anemonefish, is widely known as a popular aquarium fish. Like other clownfishes (also known as anemonefishes), it often lives in association with sea anemones. &quot;A. percula&quot; is associated specifically with &quot;Heteractis magnifica&quot; and &quot;Stichodactyla gigantea&quot;, and as larvae use chemical cues released from the anemones to identify and locate the appropriate host species to use them for shelter and protection. This causes preferential selection when finding their anemone host species. Although popular, maintaining this species in captivity is rather complex. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority regulates the number of collection permits issued to aquarium fish dealers who seek this, and other tropical fish within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
The symbiosis between anemonefish and anemones depends on the presence of the fish drawing other fish to the anemone, where they are stung by its venomous tentacles. The anemone helps the fish by giving it protection from predators, which include brittle stars, wrasses, and other damselfish, and the fish helps the anemone by feeding it, increasing oxygenation, and removing waste material from the host. Various hypotheses exist about the fish&#x27;s ability to live within the anemone without being harmed. One study carried out at Marineland of the Pacific by Dr. Demorest Davenport and Dr. Kenneth Noris in 1958 revealed that the mucus secreted by the anemone fish prevented the anemone from discharging its lethal stinging nematocysts. A second hypothesis is that &quot;A. percula&quot; has acquired immunity towards the sea anemone&#x27;s toxins, and a combination of the two has been shown to be the case. The fish feed on algae, zooplankton, worms, and small crustaceans.

==Description==
&quot;Amphiprion percula&quot; can grow to be in length, but is on average , and can be recognized by three white lines across their bright orange bodies, with no distinction in color between sexes. The anterior white bar is placed just behind the eye, the middle bar goes straight down the middle of the fish, and the posterior bar occurs near the caudal fin. An anterior projecting bulge also exists on the middle bar. In addition to the white coloring, black edging outlines each fin with varying thickness. This species can be mistaken for the similar species of clownfishes, &quot;A. ocellaris&quot;. This is known as the ocellaris clownfish and sometimes referred to as the &quot;false percula clownfish&quot; or &quot;common clownfish&quot; due to its similar color and pattern. The &quot;easiest&quot; way to distinguish the two species is the fact that &quot;A. percula&quot; has 10 spines in the first dorsal fin (rarely having 9) and &quot;A. ocellaris&quot; has 11 (rarely 10), which is a more reliable distinction than color patterns. &quot; A. ocellaris&quot; does not have thick black edging outlining the fins.

==Reproduction==
Since these fish live in a warm-water environment, they can reproduce all year long. Each group of fish consists of a breeding pair and none to four nonbreeders. Within each group there is a size-based hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning each fish is born male, but changes to female if the sole breeding female dies. If the female dies, the breeding male becomes the breeding female, and the largest nonbreeder becomes the breeding male. The spawning process is correlated with the lunar cycle. At night time the moon maintains a higher level of alertness in &quot;A. percula&quot; and this increases the interaction with the males and females. Before spawning, the male attracts the female via courting behaviour. These courting actions include extending their fins, biting the female and chasing her. The males also swim rapidly in an upward and downward motion to attract the females. The nest site is also important for the survival of the eggs. Depending on her size, the female spawns about 400–1500 eggs per cycle. The expected tenure of breeding females is roughly 12 years and is relatively long for a fish of its size, but is characteristic of other reef fish.

Why the nonbreeders continue to associate with these groups has been unclear. Unlike nonreproductives in some animal groups, they cannot obtain occasional breeding opportunities, because their gonads are not functional. They cannot be regarded as helpers at the nest, since their presence does not increase the reproductive success of the breeders. Recent research suggests that they are simply queuing for the territory occupied by the breeders, i.e. the anemone; nonbreeders living in association with breeders have a better chance of eventually securing a territory than a nonresident. The probability of a fish ascending in rank in this queue is equal to that of the individual outliving at least one of its dominants because an individual ascends in rank if any one of its dominants dies, and not simply when its immediate dominant dies.

The development of the fish from juvenile to adult is dependent on the system of hierarchy, and can be described as density-dependent. Aggression is involved in these small families, although usually not between the male and the female. The aggression usually exists between the males. The largest male suppresses the development of the next smallest male, and the cycle continues until the smallest fish is evicted from the host anemone. Within each anemone, the regulation of the species is controlled by the female, since the amount of space for fish in her anemone is directly proportional to her size (which eventually reaches a maximum), so she ultimately controls the size of the other fish. &quot;A. percula&quot; is a very competitive fish and this causes the smaller fish to have stunted growth. A potential exists for a fish to ascend in rank by contesting its dominant. This depends on the relative body sizes of the two fish, and is very unlikely to happen since &quot;A. percula&quot; maintains well-defined size differences between individuals adjacent in rank. However, in an aquarium, this fish is peaceful, and it can live in an aquarium environment well.

The fish lay their eggs in a safe spot close to the anemone from where they are easily protected, and the parents can retreat to safety if danger threatens. Anemonefish usually lay their nests in the evening after a few days of carefully cleaning and examining the chosen site. Preferred egg sites are flat or slightly curved rocks or some other item the fish have dragged near their nest for the purpose. (In captivity, clay pots and saucers are an attractive choice.) First, the female deposits some eggs with her ovipositor (a whitish tube descending from her belly), making a wiggling pass over the surface, then the male follows behind her, fertilizing the eggs. After many passes, the nest is complete and will hatch in 6–8 days shortly after sunset, usually on a very dark night. In the meantime, the male is very protective of the nest and ceaselessly fans the eggs to provide proper oxygen circulation, and checks them for any bad eggs, which he eats before they can rot and damage more eggs. Females may help the male tend the nest. At hatching, the larvae burst free and swim up toward the moonlight and the open ocean to ride the currents and eat plankton for about a week, before the still tiny metamorphosed clowns return to the reef and look for an anemone in which to settle. Eventually, the cycle repeats.

==Recruitment==
Recruitment is the number of individuals in a given species that can survive within a certain amount of time following larval habitation. The higher the level of recruitment, the better chance a larva has of surviving long enough to become an adult fish. Large food supplies, low predator threats, and the availability of nearby anemones are all factors that affect their recruitment levels. 
&quot;A. percula&quot;, like most coral reef fish, has a bipartite lifecycle, which has a scattering pelagic larval stage, whereas its resident phase is motionless. At the end of the pelagic phase, the larvae begin to settle on the coral reef and begin their recruiting process in the resident population. Larvae that settle successfully and join a resident population are called recruits. Anemonefish species are recruited to areas where the fish are commonly found. Most anemonefish are site-attached and do not move from one anemone to another that are spatially distributed more than a few meters. This is simply because it is always a dangerous undertaking for &quot;A. percula&quot; to be outside its anemonefish safe haven, exposed to dangerous predators. They are also very poor swimmers, increasing the risk involved in travel.
Recruitment is essentially the only method that the fish can use to inhabit new anemones. Finding a better living situation in a different anemone is unlikely because every anemone is already occupied by other anemonefish species. Anemonefish are known for reproducing all year round when they are in lower latitudes and recruitment with these fish is anticipated to follow the same pattern.

==Habitat==

Anemonefish are specialized coral reef fish that live within host anemones and are found in warmer waters in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, off northwest Australia, southeast Asia, and Japan.
 Both &quot;A. percula&quot; and the anemones reside in shallow waters and the depth usually does not exceed 12 m with water temperatures ranging between 25 and 28 °C. Host anemones, which are tube-like organisms that reside on coral reefs, are usually occupied by only one anemonefish species because one species outcompetes and exclude other species when they inhabit the same host anemone. Unless a significant size difference exists, two anemonefish species show aggression towards each other when trying to occupy the same host anemone. This is why the supply of nearby anemone hosts so strongly influences &quot;A. percula&quot;’s ability to achieve recruitment and survival in general.
A primary host anemone has an anemonefish at a high frequency and a secondary host anemone has one at a relatively low frequency. The distribution and availability of sea anemones is limited by the activity of photosynthesis of algae that occupy the anemones’ tentacles. Secondary hosts are usually only used if a severe lack of available primary hosts exists. When many different species of anemonefishes occupy similar habitats, they tend to spread themselves out according to smaller microhabitats and available species of anemones. &quot;A. percula&quot; and &quot;A. perideraion&quot; both essentially live within the &quot;H. magnifica&quot; anemone, but &quot;A. percula&quot; has the highest selection ratios with the &quot;S. gigantea&quot;. A study done by Elliot &amp; Mariscal in the region of Madang, Papua New Guinea found that all of the &quot;H. magnifica&quot; anemones that were censused were occupied by &quot;A. percula&quot; and &quot;A. perideraion&quot;. 
&quot;A. percula&quot; generally occupies anemones that are near shore, while &quot;A. perideraion&quot; occupies anemones that are more offshore. Anemonefish do not occupy anemones if they are in shallow water or if they are too small. Shallow waters are not an inhabitable environment for &quot;A. percula&quot; because of the lower salinity levels, increased temperatures, and exposure during low tides. Also, small anemones would not provide protection from predators. &quot;A. percula&quot; and the host anemone are very important to one another and interact in a symbiotic relationship. &quot;A. percula&quot; cleans the host anemone by consuming algae residue and zooplankton such as copepods and larval tunicates. They also protect the anemone from polyp-consuming fish and other predators, while the clownfish is protected from predators by the anemone. &quot;A. percula&quot; sometimes carries pieces of food to the host anemone for later consumption. In most cases the host anemone then devours the food that &quot;A. percula&quot; stored around it. Chances of survival for both parties involved are increased through this co-existence.

The larvae of orange clownfish use olfaction to avoid predators, and increased ocean acidification may cause larvae to be unable to differentiate predators from other odors. This could allow them to be preyed upon more easily, and lead to higher population mortality rates. Impairment of larval olfaction may also make them less able to locate appropriate reef habitats at the higher levels of ocean acidification that are projected to occur with increased carbon dioxide emissions. A paper published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2020 cast doubt on the effect of acidification, stating &quot;our findings indicate that the reported effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of coral reef fishes are not reproducible, suggesting that behavioural perturbations will not be a major consequence for coral reef fishes in high CO2 oceans&quot;. A meta-analysis published in 2022 also found that effect sizes of studies assessing ocean acidification effects on fish behaviour have declined dramatically over a decade of research on this topic, with effects appearing negligible since 2015, representing one of the most extreme examples of the decline effect in ecology.

==Development==
The development of &quot;A. percula&quot; is relatively fast. After the eggs are fertilized, they are ready to hatch after about 6–7 days. After hatching, the larvae are very small and are transparent except for the eyes, yolk sac, and a few colors across the body. The larvae then sink to the benthic environment, but then swim to the upper water column. The larvae spend about a week floating among plankton and are transported by ocean currents. The larval stage ends when &quot;A. percula&quot; settles to the bottom of the ocean. The process from larval stage to juvenile takes about one day. Rapid development of color occurs during &quot;A. percula&quot;&#x27;s juvenile stage. During the juvenile stage the anemonefish has to find a suitable anemone host. Specific chemical components are used when finding their host. These chemical cues are different for each anemonefish. This causes preferential selection when finding their anemone host species. When &quot;A. percula&quot; comes in contact with the anemone, it produces a protective mucous coat. This mucous coat is developed with multiple interactions with the host anemone. &quot;A. percula&quot; dances around the anemone, touching its fins first to the tentacles and then its entire body during its first interaction with the anemone. This process could take a few minutes or up to several hours. If &quot;A. percula&quot; does not continue to come in contact with the host anemone, the protective mucus may disappear. &quot;A. percula&quot; belongs to a group of fishes that are not stung by the nematocysts of the anemone. If &quot;A. percula&quot; did not have the protective mucous covering, it would be stung. Other fish species that lack the mucous covering are consumed by the anemone.

<text>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is a global humanitarian aid, relief, and development nongovernmental organization. Founded in 1933 as the International Relief Association, at the request of Albert Einstein, and changing its name in 1942 after amalgamating with the similar Emergency Rescue Committee, the IRC provides emergency aid and long-term assistance to refugees and those displaced by war, persecution, or natural disaster. The IRC is currently working in about 40 countries and 26 U.S. cities where it resettles refugees and helps them become self-sufficient. It focuses mainly on health, education, economic wellbeing, power, and safety.

Consisting of first responders, humanitarian relief workers, international development experts, health care providers, and educators, the IRC has assisted millions of people around the world since its founding in 1933. In 2016, 26 million people in about 40 countries and 26 U.S. cities benefited from IRC programs.

The current President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is David Miliband (2013–present), who previously served as the British foreign secretary.

== History ==
The International Rescue Committee (IRC) was founded as the New York branch of the International Relief Association (which later combined with another relief organization) in 1931, at the suggestion of Albert Einstein. As of 1933, the IRC was initially an organization that helped those who were fleeing Nazi Germany and as need arose it expanded its clientele.

=== Founding ===
The International Relief Association (IRA) was founded in 1931 in Germany by two left-wing factions, the Communist Party Opposition (KPO) and the Socialist Workers Party (SAP). Its purpose was to aid victims of state oppression and persecution. After the Nazis took power in 1933, the organization moved its headquarters to Paris.

The KPO consisted of the &quot;right opposition&quot; – communists who had been purged by Stalin in 1929 because of their support for Nikolai Bukharin. Among those purged was Jay Lovestone, the erstwhile head of the American Communist Party. It was Lovestone who formed an American section of the International Relief Association in 1933. Among those who joined him was Albert Einstein. Its purpose was to assist Germans suffering under Adolf Hitler&#x27;s government – particularly supporters of the &quot;right opposition&quot;. Later, refugees from Mussolini&#x27;s Italy and Franco&#x27;s Spain were assisted.

In 1940, European exiles and American liberals close to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, founded the Emergency Rescue Committee (ERC) to aid European refugees trapped in Vichy France. ERC founding member Varian Fry arrived in Marseille within a few weeks of the fall of France, where he pulled together a small team that was instrumental in helping many individuals escape Vichy and the Nazis to safety in the U.S. and elsewhere. Over 2,000 political, cultural, union and academic leaders were rescued in just 13 months, ending when Fry was expelled by the Vichy French. Fry also worked closely with British intelligence, helping to establish escape routes for British servicemen. Fry also took a map showing the distribution of mines in the Mediterranean that he received from a refugee and gave it to an agent of British intelligence.

In 1942, after the US entered the Second World War, IRA and ERC joined forces under the name International Relief and Rescue Committee, which was later shortened to the International Rescue Committee. The organization was financed largely by the National War Fund. 

While historian Eric Thomas Chester writes that by the 1950s the IRC had evolved into a global operation functioning as an integral link in the CIA&#x27;s covert network, became deeply involved in the volatile confrontations between the two superpowers, and participated in an array of sensitive clandestine operations, many other historians have taken a less polemical tone about the IRC during this period, arguing that the ‘relationship’, where one existed, was of cooperative collaboration only where goals aligned - as opposed to one of cooptation by any intelligence services. 

=== Timeline ===

==== 1940s ====
In the 1940s, IRC fed people during the Soviet blockade of West Berlin. In 1945, at the end of World War II, the IRC initiated emergency relief programs, established hospitals and children&#x27;s centers, and started refugee resettlement efforts in Europe. With the descent of the Iron Curtain in 1946, the IRC initiated a resettlement program for East European refugees, which continued until the end of the Cold War.
In the period immediately following the end of the Second World War, the IRC was one of several organizations aiding refugees from Eastern Europe. These refugees were screened to see if they had valuable information concerning the Soviet bloc countries. A select few were recruited to participate in covert operations being conducted by the intelligence community.
In 1949, the IRC took a significant step toward a greater integration into the covert network. The IRC distributed a confidential memorandum that it was prepared to take part in sensitive covert operations at the behest of the U.S. government. Only a select few within the committee would be told of these operations. From this point onward, the IRC would function on a two-pronged basis. There would be programs to assist refugees that would be transparent and, at the same time, there would be parallel operations known to only a few.

==== 1950s ====
In 1950, the IRC intensified its aid in Europe with Project Berlin, which provided food to the people of East Berlin amid increased Soviet oppression. After the war, the committee&#x27;s European representatives focused on rebuilding the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as a bulwark against the Communists.

Leo Cherne, an IRC board member since 1946, was elected IRC Chairman in 1951. He would hold the position for 40 years.

Also in the 1950s, the IRC began relief and resettlement programs for refugees displaced by the North Vietnamese defeat of the French and by the Soviet forces’ crushing of the Hungarian revolution. According to historian Eric Thomas Chester, the IRC was instrumental in the establishment of two key Washington lobby groups supporting South Vietnam, the American Friends of Vietnam, and its successor, the Citizens Committee for Peace with Freedom in Vietnam.

==== 1960s ====
In 1960, an IRC resettlement program began for Cuban refugees fleeing the Castro dictatorship and for Haitian refugees escaping the Duvalier regime.

IRC operations were extended to Africa in 1962 when 200,000 Angolans fled to Zaire. Also that year, the IRC began aiding Chinese fleeing to Hong Kong from the mainland.

==== 1970s ====
The IRC was active worldwide, providing support for refugees fleeing conflict and oppression in India, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guatemala, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Uganda and the Soviet Union, while resettling refugees in the United States.

==== 1980s ====
At the turn of the decade, the IRC launched emergency relief programs for Afghan refugees fleeing to Pakistan. Eight years later, the IRC started community rehabilitation activities in Afghanistan for tens of thousands of returning refugees.

During the 1982 war in Lebanon, the IRC assisted Palestinian and Lebanese refugees.

Spanish Refugee Aid, which served the survivors of the Spanish Civil War in France, became a division of the IRC in 1984. That same year, the IRC initiated health and community development projects in El Salvador for displaced victims of the civil war.

Partnering with the Polish trade union movement Solidarity in 1987, the IRC began a health care program in Poland.

Relief programs to assist Mozambican refugees in Malawi also began in 1987. Eight years later, the IRC was in Mozambique helping with their return.

In 1989, the Women&#x27;s Commission for Refugee Women and Children was established by the IRC as an affiliate organization whose purpose is to serve the rights and interests of the 80% of the world&#x27;s refugees who are women and children. The Women&#x27;s Commission became the Women&#x27;s Refugee Commission in 2009.

==== 1990s ====
After the first Gulf War, the IRC came to the aid of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees who fled Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. In 1992, the IRC began work in the former Yugoslavia, first dealing with the consequences of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina and later launching community rehabilitation programs in Bosnia.

IRC became headquartered in the Chanin Building in midtown Manhattan in 1994. In the same year, the IRC set up emergency programs in Tanzania and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) to aid refugees fleeing genocide and civil war in Rwanda.

IRC operations began inside Kosovo in 1997 and were expanded in 1999 to meet the needs of Kosovar refugees in Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia. Also in 1997, the IRC opened a UK office.

In 1999, the IRC launched emergency operations in East Timor.

==== 2000s ====
In 2000, the IRC launched emergency shelter, sanitation and education programs for Chechen refugees fleeing fighting between Russian forces and Ichkerian people.

Following the September 11 attacks, the IRC undertook an advocacy campaign to reverse the U.S. government&#x27;s slowdown in refugee resettlement.

The IRC conducted operations across Iraq from April 2003 through December 2004. The organization resumed operations there in 2007 and launched expanded programs throughout the country. In addition to aiding displaced Iraqis within the country, the IRC also provided assistance to Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria, as well as to those granted refuge in the United States.

In 2003, IRC programs in West Africa expanded to serve the growing populations of refugees and displaced persons uprooted by civil conflict.

In 2005, around two decades after Burmese refugees first began crossing into Thailand, poverty and violent conflict in Myanmar&#x27;s ethnic minority areas continue to drive people into camps along the border. Since its opening in 2005, by 2012 the Resettlement Support Center (formerly known as the Overseas Processing Entity) in the Thai capital Bangkok had helped 90,000 people seek admission to the United States as refugees. The Resettlement Support Center primarily assists refugees in Thailand but also assists asylum seekers in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia. The activities of the center are funded by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.

The IRC worked closely with local aid organizations to respond to various disasters, including in Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake; and in Indonesia after the South Asian tsunami; and in Myanmar after the 2008 cyclone.

In 2008, the IRC released the fifth in a series of surveys demonstrating the excess loss of life in the Democratic Republic of Congo caused by the nation&#x27;s long-running civil war. The fifth survey put the excess-death toll between August 1998 and April 2007 at 5.4 million.

The IRC affiliate Women&#x27;s Commission for Refugee Women and Children became the Women&#x27;s Refugee Commission in 2009.

==== 2010s ====

Following the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, the IRC deployed its Emergency Response Team to Haiti to deliver help to Port-au-Prince. IRC experts in emergency health, shelter and children&#x27;s welfare worked with local aid groups to assist survivors.

David Miliband, former British Foreign Secretary, became the IRC president and CEO in 2013. In 2015, according to IRC it trained 15,000 farmers, gave 440,000 babies measles vaccinations, job training to 27,000 people and resettled 10,000 refugees in the United States.

In 2016, &quot;Fast Company&quot; said that IRC &quot;might be the most under-recognized yet influential nongovernmental aid group in the world.&quot; In 2016, it had 11,000 people in it, and offices in around 40 countries. It had an annual operating budget of around $700 million. In 2016, the IRC aided around 15,000 women and girls through protection and empowerment programs in Jordan. In 2016 the IRC published the &quot;Outcomes and Evidence Framework,&quot; an interactive tool that aims to create a framework for guiding humanitarian decision-making using theories of change and research evidence. The same year, they publicly committed to using this tool to ensure that all of their programs are evidence-based or evidence-generating by 2020 as part of the &quot;Grand Bargain&quot; commitments.

In July 2018, IRC was behind the Welcome Home initiative to give tours and activities for refugees in New York City and Northern California.

In 2019, the IRC in San Diego began hosting a &quot;Refugee Film Festival&quot; that presents documentaries about the refugee experience.

==== 2020s ====
On March 13, 2020, the second annual IRC&#x27;s Refugee Film Festival in San Diego was postponed until June due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the IRC provided support for Ukrainian refugees and civilians, both abroad and within Ukraine. The IRC provided mobile health teams and equipment capable of quickly deploying to crisis locations, supplied civilians with heating equipment such as gas stoves to keep homes warm during winter, and conducted many other efforts amid the large-scale humanitarian crisis. As of 2024, these efforts are still ongoing.

After a report published in December 2023 the IRC has warned that humanitarian crises will worsen in 2024 due to several key factors, including climate change, worsening armed conflicts, and less international support. Africa is expected to be the region most adversely effected.

== Current work ==
The IRC is now at work in about 40 countries and in 26 U.S. cities. In 2010, notable operations included disaster response in the wake of the earthquake in Haiti, ongoing programs to address the humanitarian crisis in Congo and to help community rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and advocacy and resettlement efforts on behalf of Iraqis uprooted by the war.

The organization was involved in responding to a massacre in Bani Walid, Libya, where near a hundred young men attempting to escape a militia were gunned down.

On August 5, 2018, it was reported that the agency had lowered its staff number in Georgia after refugee arrivals decreased.

, the agency is operating in around 30-40 countries, primarily in the Middle East and developing countries, providing humanitarian aid and necessities. 

=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
The IRC is one of the largest providers of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, where conflict and humanitarian crisis have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998, according to peer-reviewed studies by the IRC. The organization runs programs dedicated to health, education, civil society development, emergency response and reducing gender-based violence, in seven Congolese provinces. As rape and other forms of sexual violence have increasingly been used as a tactic of war by militias involved in the conflict, the IRC has stepped up its sexual violence aid and protection programs. Between 2002 and 2018, the IRC has provided medical care, counseling and economic support services to about 40,000 women and girls who have survived sexual violence in Congo.

The IRC is at the origin of a controversial estimate of the excess mortality in the DRC due to conflicts following the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. According to the IRC at first, the excess mortality was estimated at 3.8 million deaths. This estimate was challenged by a group of Belgian demographers sent to the DRC by a European institution to help draw up electoral lists for the DRC. For cross-checking purposes, they made a study of the excess mortality in the DRC over the period 1998-2004 which came to 183,000 deaths, twenty times less.

== Operations ==
The IRC delivers a number of services, including emergency response, health care, programs fighting gender-based violence, post-conflict development projects, children and youth protection and education programs, water and sanitation systems, strengthening the capacity of local organizations, and supporting civil society and good-governance initiatives.

For refugees afforded sanctuary in the United States, IRC resettlement offices across the country provide a range of assistance aimed at helping new arrivals settling, adjusting and acquiring the skills to become self-sufficient.

The IRC operates in over 40 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the United States.

=== Emergency response ===
The IRC maintains an Emergency Response Team of 17 specialists who assess survival needs and mount responses to sudden or protracted emergencies.

The team includes coordinators, logisticians, doctors, and water and sanitation experts. It also includes specialists who focus on human rights protection, the special needs of children in crisis, the prevention of sexual violence, and aid for rape survivors.

Emergency Response Team members remain on standby to deploy to a crisis within 72 hours, whether they are launching new relief efforts or lending support to IRC teams already on the ground. Equipment and supplies are pre-positioned in key transport hubs so that the materials can be dispatched anywhere in the world on short notice. The IRC also maintains a kit with inventory necessary for the startup of an emergency program in a remote location, as well as a roster of IRC employees and qualified external personnel who are available on short notice for emergency deployment.

Recent IRC Emergency Response Team deployments include Darfur, Indonesia after the South Asian tsunami, Myanmar after the 2008 cyclone, and Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

=== Health programs ===
During emergencies, the IRC endeavors to rapidly reduce illness and death rates to normal levels. When the conflict subsides, the IRC works with displaced individuals and communities to rebuild their health systems.

IRC health programs assist approximately 13 million people in 25 countries, focusing on primary health care, reproductive health care, environmental health, child survival, blindness treatment and prevention, and assistance for victims of sexual violence.

The IRC works in various settings such as in refugee camps, in disaster-stricken areas and in host countries where refugees have resettled after a conflict.

=== Gender-based anti-violence programs ===
Gender-based violence is any harm perpetrated against a person based on power inequalities resulting from gender roles. The overwhelming majority of cases involve women and girls. The IRC&#x27;s gender-based anti-violence programs aim to meet the safety, health, psychosocial and justice needs of women and girls who are survivors of or vulnerable to gender-based violence. In partnership with communities and institutions, the IRC works to empower communities to lead efforts that challenge beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that perpetuate or condone violence against women and girls.

IRC programs implement and support social work services to help individual survivors of gender-based violence, economic empowerment activities to support survivors of violence and women and girls at-risk of violence, community education and mobilization projects around gender-based violence, training and capacity-building for NGOs and governments, coordination of humanitarian services, and advocacy efforts to advance laws preventing violence against women, and the enforcement of policies ensuring survivors’ access to care and legal justice.

=== Post-conflict development ===
The IRC assists with post-conflict recovery by supporting conflict-impacted communities and countries in their transition to sustainable peace and development.

In addition to the provision of humanitarian assistance, IRC post-conflict development projects aim to restore and strengthen physical and social institutions, as well as rebuild and restore social cohesion.

Program areas include social programs emphasizing rebuilding the health, public infrastructure and education sectors; gender-based violence programs; economic recovery and development programs; and governance programs that support civil society, enhance protection and the rule of law, and rebuild ties between governments and their constituencies.

=== Programs for children ===
In 2016, the IRC and its partners helped provide over 1.5 million children with access to educational opportunities. The IRC promotes the protection and development of children and youth from the early stages of an emergency through post-conflict and recovery. Its children&#x27;s and youth programs include emergency care; formal and non-formal education; rehabilitation and community reintegration of former child soldiers; psychosocial care and protection; life skills training, recreational and cultural activities; and economic and leadership development for youth.

=== Resettling refugees ===
The IRC&#x27;s 22 regional offices help to resettle newly arrived refugees in the U.S. and provide various services to refugees, asylees and victims of human trafficking.

Resettlement services include providing immediate aid, including food and shelter; assisting with job placement and employment skills; and giving access to clothing, medical attention, education, English-language classes and community orientation.

In addition to integrating refugees into the U.S., the IRC also provides immigration services to refugees and people who have been granted asylum, as well as specialized services to victims of human trafficking in the U.S.

=== Advocacy ===
The IRC seeks to focus the attention of policy makers on humanitarian crises and the needs of refugees, internally displaced people and other victims of conflict.

Its annual Freedom Award recognizes &quot;extraordinary contributions to the cause of refugees and human freedom&quot;.

The IRC spearheaded a campaign urging the United States to pass the International Violence Against Women Act, which has been introduced into several sessions of Congress but as of 2023 never passed. The organization has also advocated for the United States to complete ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; 196 nations (including the United States) have signed the convention; the United States is the only UN nation which has not ratified it.

== Organization ==
The current president and CEO of the IRC is David Miliband, formerly British Foreign Secretary.

Miliband&#x27;s predecessor as president was George Erik Rupp, a former president of Columbia University and of Rice University. It was announced on 27 March 2013 that Miliband would succeed Rupp in September 2013.

The organization is governed by an unpaid board of directors, and lists, under the heading of &quot;Overseers&quot;, individuals described as providing counsel to the board on matters of policy, fundraising and advocacy; the several score listed in early 2017 include Madeleine Albright, Kofi Annan, Tom Brokaw, Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell, and Liv Ullmann.

In addition to its New York headquarters, the IRC also has offices in approximately 40 countries and 27 U.S. cities, as well as European offices in London, Berlin, Bonn, Geneva, Stockholm and Brussels.

As of June 2018, the IRC had over 11,000 staff members.

The IRC has generally been awarded high marks by charity watchdog groups and major publications for the efficient use of its financial support and the effectiveness of its work. The American Institute of Philanthropy gives the IRC an A rating; the Forbes Investment Guide named the IRC one of 10 gold star charities, and in its 2009 review of American charities, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine gave the IRC high ratings for program and fundraising efficiency, however, in 2020 &quot;Forbes&quot; dropped IRC to 48th in its top 100 list; Charity Navigator gave the IRC its top rating of four stars every year from 2006 to 2018 (but has downgraded them to three stars for 2019, likely due to a new, less transparent, donor privacy policy); and the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance reports that the IRC meets all of its 20 Standards for Charity Accountability.

In March 2021, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia fined the International Rescue Committee $6.9 million pursuant to the False Claims Act. The government alleged the IRC failed to maintain adequate oversight over procurement in Turkey for humanitarian assistance to refugees in Syria. Bid-rigging, kickbacks, and other procurement fraud resulted in overcharging the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

== Finances ==
As of 2019, the IRC reportedly held $224,275,287 in net assets, with funding coming from private and institutional donors. U.S. government funding of the IRC&#x27;s programs originates from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (BPRM), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). A breakdown of the IRC&#x27;s financial report for the year 2016 shows that the largest program service investment was in health services, which absorbed 38% of the IRC&#x27;s funds for the year. According to Charity Navigator, in 2019, more than 87 cents of every $1 received by IRC went to programs and services that directly affected their clientele.

== Reports ==
* The IRC issued a report in 2008 detailing the plight of Iraqi refugees on the five-year anniversary of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.
* The next year, the organization followed up with a report on the plight of Iraqi refugees in the United States. The report argued that while &quot;resettlement continues to be a critical and lifesaving intervention for thousands of at-risk Iraqi refugees who are living in precarious conditions in exile and unable to return home safely…the federal program no longer meets the basic needs of today’s newly arriving refugees and requires urgent reform.&quot;
* In 2010, the IRC&#x27;s Commission on Iraqi Refugees issued a third report on displaced Iraqis entitled, &quot;A Tough Road Home: Uprooted Iraqis in Jordan, Syria and Iraq.&quot; The report asserted that Iraqis are trapped in poverty and uncertainty and their needs are growing more acute, even as international attention and assistance wanes. The IRC&#x27;s recommendations included increasing aid for the displaced, intensifying efforts to create conditions that would enable people to go home safely and accelerating resettlement for those who cannot go back.
* In a series of five mortality surveys between 2000 and 2007, the IRC documented the impact of the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The most recent report estimated that 5.4 million people had died from conflict-related causes in Congo since 1998, and that 2.1 million of those deaths occurred after the formal end of the war in 2002. These statistics are often cited by media and nongovernmental agencies reporting on the humanitarian crisis in Congo.

<text>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) bestows its Freedom Award for extraordinary contributions to the cause of refugees and human freedom. According to the IRC, &quot;The Freedom Award reveals the remarkable ability of an individual to shape history and change for the better a world moving toward freedom for all.&quot;

The IRC was founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein, and made its first Freedom Award in 1957, to German politician Willy Brandt, who went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The following year, the award was presented to Winston Churchill, British prime minister during the Second World War, for his &quot;dedicated and devoted service to the cause of human liberty&quot;. The first joint recipients of the award were Lane Kirkland and his wife Irena who won the prize in 1981. Lane was honored for his &quot;long devotion to the cause of refugees&quot; while Irena was described as &quot;very much a human rights activist&quot;. Chinese dissidents Li Shuxian and Fang Lizhi were jointly honored in 1991; two American Presidents, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton took the prize as a pair in 2005, and film actress Angelina Jolie and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees High Commissioner António Guterres received the award together in 2007.

Since the first award presentation in 1957, the IRC has made it to 46 recipients, 24 of which were American; the majority of awards have been to politicians. The 1995 presentation was made &quot;&quot; to Burmese pro-democracy campaigner and leader of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party, Aung San Suu Kyi. The 2011 award ceremony was held in New York City, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in November, where the presentation was made to the Brokaw family. In 2012, John C. Whitehead received the prize for a second time, the only person to do so.

<doc id="196460" wikidata="Q12808232" url="?curid=196460" title="96 Tears (album)">
<text>96 Tears is the debut studio album by the American garage rock band ? and the Mysterians, released in 1966. It peaked at number 66 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Pop Albums chart. The single &quot;96 Tears&quot; reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 29, prior to release of the album. The album and the single &quot;96 Tears&quot; were both on the charts for fifteen weeks, while the single &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; was on the charts for ten weeks.

First pressings had a misprinted Side 2 label listing the last track as &quot;Tears&quot; instead of &quot;96 Tears&quot;. The album also incorrectly shows David Graham as composer for &quot;Stormy Monday&quot;.

==Background==
The band recorded the songs &quot;96 Tears&quot; and &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; on April 15, 1966 at Art Schiell&#x27;s Recording Studio in Bay City, Michigan, for the small Pa-Go-Go label, which released the single in April, 1966. After getting extensive regional airplay in Michigan and Ontario, Neil Bogart, president of Cameo-Parkway Records purchased the rights to the record for national distribution. After replacing bassist Fernando Aguilar with Frank Lugo, the band went into the studio to record the remainder of the songs for their debut album released in November, 1966. The album was an immediate success and quickly shot up the charts before the end of the year. A second single, &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; was released in conjunction with the album.

Allen Klein and ABKCO Records acquired the Cameo-Parkway catalog in 1967, and refused to license the ? and the Mysterians records for release on CD. In July, 1997, the band reunited and rerecorded the album for the Collectables Records label. In 2011, ABKCO released the original recordings.

<doc id="196463" wikidata="Q832452" url="?curid=196463" title="Super Trouper (album)">
<text>Super Trouper is the seventh studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA, released on 3 November 1980. It features the No.1 singles &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; and &quot;Super Trouper&quot;. The album became the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling album of 1980.

==Overview==
Led by the international hit &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, &quot;Super Trouper&quot; was the group&#x27;s sixth chart-topping album in the UK. It was also the best-selling album in Britain for 1980. &quot;Super Trouper&quot; was first released on CD in 1983 by Polar Music International, in the early 1980s by Polydor, and in the late 1980s by Atlantic Records for the US. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form four times; first in 1997, then in 2001, again in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set and as a Deluxe Edition (containing a bonus DVD) in 2011.

The previous year&#x27;s divorce between Björn and Agnetha was explored in &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, and the members&#x27; lives in Stockholm high society circles coloured the lyrics for &quot;On and On and On&quot;. Other well-known songs on the album include the hit single title track &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, as well as the electro-dance of &quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot;.

Probably due to the disco backlash at that time, the album saw ABBA returning to a more straightforward pop sound, as opposed to the preceding (and noticeably more dance-oriented) &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; album. The album closed with &quot;The Way Old Friends Do&quot;, which was recorded live a year earlier during their 1979 concert tour. Although not released as a single with this album, the song was later released as a single in 1992 to promote the compilation &quot;More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits&quot;. The song was later covered by The Alexander Brothers, The Kingston Trio, Philomena Begley and Faryl Smith. On some European vinyl issues, the cheering and applause at the end of &quot;The Way Old Friends Do&quot; is recorded up to the run-out groove, playing in an endless loop on manual turntables.

==Writing and recording==
In January 1980, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson went to Barbados to write songs for a new album, which resulted in five compositions. The first songs recorded for the album were &quot;Andante, Andante&quot;, &quot;Happy New Year&quot; (originally intended as part of a never realised musical), and the backing track of the rockier &quot;On and On and On&quot;. The sessions for the album was then interrupted by a short tour in Japan in March. Returning to the Polar Studios in Stockholm, the group then recorded and mixed the five tracks written, also including &quot;The Piper&quot; and &quot;Elaine&quot; (which would be released as a single b-side). Returning to the studio again in June with three new songs written to work on, including &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, which was released as the first single from the album in July would become a worldwide hit single, &quot;Our Last Summer&quot; and the country-flavoured &quot;Burning My Bridges&quot;, which remains unreleased. After a summer holiday the group started the recording sessions again in September with yet another three new songs written, including &quot;Me and I&quot; and the electro-disco track &quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot;. The third song in the September session was &quot;Put On Your White Sombrero&quot;, which eventually was not included on the album. Having already decided that the album was going to be entitled &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, the group realised that they needed another track for the album to replace the ditched &quot;Put On Your White Sombrero&quot;. Written in the studio as the last track for the album in October, the song fitted to become the title track and also a single. 

Lyrically, many of the songs feature personal themes, most notably &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; which partly is about the break-up of Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog&#x27;s marriage. &quot;Our Last Summer&quot; was based on a teenage romance Björn Ulvaeus had experienced in Paris in his youth. &quot;The Piper&quot; features an unusual lyric inspired by Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stand&quot; about the rise of a fascist-type leader. &quot;Me and I&quot; has another unusual lyric about conflicting sides in one&#x27;s personality.

== Release ==
&quot;Super Trouper&quot; was released in November 1980. It was first issued on CD in 1983 by Polar Music International, in the early 1980s by Polydor, and in the late 1980s by Atlantic Records for the US. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form four times; first in 1997, then in 2001, again in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set and as a Deluxe Edition (containing a bonus DVD) in 2011.

On 30 October 2020, Super Trouper was reissued for its 40th anniversary as a multi-format release. It included: a double-LP, half-speed mastered version of the album, done by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios on 12&quot; black 180 gram, 45rpm vinyl discs; a 7&quot; singles box set of &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, &quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot; and &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; pressed on colored vinyl; and individual 7&quot; picture discs of these three singles.

=== Deluxe edition ===
On 9 May 2011, &quot;Super Trouper&quot; was reissued as a 2-disc deluxe edition package to celebrate as part of its 30th anniversary celebration. Disc one consisted of a remastered CD version of the original album, expanded with five bonus tracks. It featured the stereo mix of the original, full length version of &quot;On And On And On&quot;, that was previously only found in mono, as well as &quot;Put on Your White Sombrero&quot;, a song recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions, released until 1994 for the &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; box set. The mastering of the tracks was done by Erik Broheden, using the original master tapes, at Masters of audio in Stockholm. 

The second disc contained a variety of television content, including: ABBA&#x27;s appearance on ZDF&#x27;s &quot;Show Express&quot;, that included performances of &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, and &quot;On And On And On&quot;; a performance of &quot;Happy New Year&quot; from SVT; &quot;Words And Music&quot;, a documentary produced by Polar Music International that features the group talking about the album after its completion; the new featurette, &quot;Somewhere In The Crowd There&#x27;s You – On Location With ABBA&quot;, that compiles footage from the night of the photo shoot for the album&#x27;s sleeve; remastered promo clips of &quot;Super Trouper&quot; and &quot;Happy New Year&quot;; two &quot;Super Trouper&quot; TV commercials; and the &quot;International Sleeve Gallery&quot;. This issue also had a 28-page booklet with an essay on the making of the album.

Paul Sinclair of &quot;SuperDeluxeEdition&quot; said that &quot;Super Trouper&quot;″s deluxe edition &quot;doesn&#x27;t offer a great deal that fans will not already be familiar with&quot; but that &quot;for those wishing to explore beyond the boundaries of the enduring &quot;ABBA Gold&quot; collection... [it] could be a very good place to start&quot;.

==Album cover and title==
Super Trouper is a registered trademark owned by Strong Entertainment Lighting for their brand of followspots, i.e., directional spotlights used to follow a performer on stage. 

Album cover designer, Rune Söderqvist, decided to use the spotlight theme and photograph the group, surrounded by circus performers, at Piccadilly Circus, London, but after failing to gain permission to base the shoot in central London, they instead invited the members of two local circuses to Europa Film Studios, Stockholm to take the photograph there. 

Several of ABBA&#x27;s friends were also invited to take part and the following also appear on the cover: Görel Hanser (vice-president of Polar Music who subsequently married the band&#x27;s photographer Anders Hanser), Berka Bergkvist (another Polar Music employee), Tomas Ledin, and Anders Anderson (ABBA&#x27;s manager&#x27;s son). 

At the same time, Lasse Hallström also filmed scenes that were eventually used in the videos for &quot;Happy New Year&quot;, &quot;Felicidad&quot; and &quot;Super Trouper&quot; even though the latter had not even been composed at the time.

==Critical reception==

The album received favorable reviews from music critics. 

William Ruhlmann from AllMusic noted that &quot;&quot;Super Trouper&quot; found ABBA, always trend-conscious, taking account of the passing of disco and returning to the pop/rock sound typical of their early albums&quot; and that it includes &quot;an unusual amount of what sounded like real unhappiness into their pop music&quot;.

Douglas Wolk from &quot;Blender&quot; gave the album four out of five stars and wrote that although it shows some &quot;dark side&quot; of the group like &quot;being sick of show business&quot;, the Agnetha and Björn divorce, it has a &quot;lot of joy&quot; like the song &quot;Lay All Your Love On Me&quot;.

Christopher Thelen, from &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; gave the album an A− and wrote that &quot;whatever was happening to the band, internally or externally, they were able to take it and put the best creative spin on it. The result was possibly their best album&quot;.

The German counterpart of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; both gave four out of five stars, while &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine and &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; gave the album mixed reviews.

==Track listing==
All tracks are written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.


=== Deluxe edition ===
Released on 11 May 2011, for the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. All tracks are written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, except where noted.

==Non-album tracks==
* &quot;Elaine&quot;
A song recorded in 1980 and released as B-side &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; single.
* &quot;Put on Your White Sombrero&quot;
A song based on waltz with a Latin American sound recorded in 1980 with lead vocal by Lyngstad. The track was replaced at a late stage by this album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Super Trouper&quot;. The arrangement of &quot;Put On Your White Sombrero&quot; was later remodelled into a new ABBA song, &quot;Cassandra&quot;, which became the B-Side to &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;.

<text>Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is the debut studio album by American band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, released in March 1971 by Warner Bros. Records. The album peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart.

==Overview==
The album was produced by Joe Wissert. Hip hop artist Ludacris has also named this LP as one of his five favorite records which he considers forerunners of hip-hop.

==Singles==
The track &quot;Love Is Life&quot; reached No. 43 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.

== Critical reception ==
Lester Bangs of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted a &quot;heavy Sly influence&quot; and the &quot;smooth harmonies&quot; of The Fifth Dimension on the LP. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;s Robert Christgau was ambivalent towards the album&#x27;s various musical &quot;cross-references&quot;, including &quot;the expert vocal harmonies [that] neither fit the concept nor assert any personality of their own&quot;, and said that even its successful songs have &quot;a way of slipping away unnoticed once the record is over&quot;.

Larry Ridley of DownBeat, with a 5 out of 5 rating, exclaimed &quot;go 
out and buy this record and keep your eyes and ears open to Earth. Wind and Fire.&quot; Al Rudis of the Chicago Sun Times found &quot;Earth, Wind and Fire brings to mind Bossa nova, Sly and the Family Stone, Ray Conniff, Afro-Cuban music and The 5th Dimension&quot;. 
John Bush of AllMusic gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and complimented the song&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;freewheeling arrangements&quot;. Bush found &quot;the songwriting was as strong and focused as the musicianship&quot; and praised the LP&#x27;s social context, noting &quot;unerringly positive compositions, reflecting the influence of the civil rights movement with nearly every song urging love, community, and knowledge as alternatives to the increasing hopelessness plaguing American society&quot;. Bob Talbert of the Detroit Free Press also wrote &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what to call this group. Afro-gospel-jazz-blues-rock? Must there be a label?&quot;.

Isaac Hayes called Earth, Wind &amp; Fire one of the band&#x27;s five essential recordings.

<doc id="196470" wikidata="Q3519259" url="?curid=196470" title="Count">
<text>Count (feminine: countess) is a historical title of nobility in certain European countries, varying in relative status, generally of middling rank in the hierarchy of nobility. Especially in earlier medieval periods the term often implied not only a certain status, but also that the &quot;count&quot; had specific responsibilities or offices. The etymologically related English term &quot;county&quot; denoted the territories associated with some countships, but not all. 

The title of &quot;count&quot; is typically not used in England or English-speaking countries, and the term &quot;earl&quot; is used instead. A female holder of the title is still referred to as a &quot;countess&quot;, however.

==Origin of the term==

The word &quot;count&quot; came into English from the French &#x27;, itself from Latin &#x27;—in its accusative form &quot;comitem&quot;. It meant &quot;companion&quot; or &quot;attendant&quot;, and as a title it indicated that someone was delegated to represent the ruler. 

In the late Roman Empire, the Latin title &quot;comes&quot; denoted the high rank of various courtiers and provincial officials, either military or administrative. Before Anthemius became emperor in the West in 467, he was a military &quot;comes&quot; charged with strengthening defenses on the Danube frontier.

In the Western Roman Empire, &quot;count&quot; came to indicate generically a military commander but was not a specific rank. In the Eastern Roman Empire, from about the seventh century, &quot;count&quot; was a specific rank indicating the commander of two &quot;centuriae&quot; (i.e., 200 men).

The medieval title of &quot;comes&quot; was originally not hereditary. It was regarded as an administrative official dependent on the king, until the process of allodialisation during the 9th century in which such titles came to be private possessions of noble families. By virtue of their large estates, many counts could pass the title to their heirs—but not always. For instance, in Piast Poland, the position of &quot;komes&quot; was not hereditary, resembling the early Merovingian institution. The title had disappeared by the era of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the office had been replaced by others. Only after the Partitions of Poland did the title of &quot;count&quot; resurface in the title &quot;hrabia&quot;, derived from the German &quot;Graf&quot;.

In the Frankish kingdoms in the early Middle Ages, a count might also be a count palatine, whose authority derived directly over a royal household, a palace in its original sense of the seat of power and administration. This other kind of count had vague antecedents in Late Antiquity too: the father of Cassiodorus held positions of trust with Theodoric, as &quot;comes rerum privatarum&quot;, in charge of the imperial lands, then as &quot;comes sacrarum largitionum&quot; (&quot;count of the sacred doles&quot;), concerned with the finances of the realm.

In the United Kingdom, the title of &quot;earl&quot; is used instead of &quot;count&quot;. Although the exact reason is debated by historians and linguists, one of the more popular theories proposes that &quot;count&quot; fell into disuse because of its phonetic similarity to the vulgar slang word &quot;cunt&quot;.

===Land attached to title===

It is only after some time that the continental medieval title came came to be strongly associated with the ownership of and jurisdiction over specific lands, which led to evolution of the term &quot;county&quot; to refer to specific regions. The English term county, used as an equivalent to the English term shire, is derived from the Old French &quot;conté&quot; or &quot;cunté&quot; which denoted the jurisdiction of a French count or viscount. The modern French is &quot;comté&quot;, and its equivalents in other languages are &quot;contea&quot;, &quot;contado&quot;, &quot;comtat&quot;, &quot;condado&quot;, &quot;Grafschaft&quot;, &quot;graafschap&quot;, etc. (cf. &quot;conte&quot;, &quot;comte&quot;, &quot;conde&quot;, &quot;Graf&quot;). The title of Count also continued to exist in cases which are not connected to any specific to a geographical &quot;county&quot;. 

In the United Kingdom, the equivalent &quot;Earl&quot; can also be used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of a duke or marquess. In the Italian states, by contrast, all the sons of certain counts were little counts (&quot;contini&quot;). In Sweden there is a distinction between counts (Swedish: &quot;greve&quot;) created before and after 1809. All children in comital families elevated before 1809 were called count/countess. In families elevated after 1809, only the head of the family was called count, the rest have a status similar to barons and were called by the equivalent of &quot;Mr/Ms/Mrs&quot;, before the recognition of titles of nobility was abolished.

==Comital titles in different European languages==
The following lists are originally based on a Glossary on Heraldica.org by Alexander Krischnig. The male form is followed by the female, and when available, by the territorial circumscription.

=== Etymological derivations from the Latin ===
=== Etymological derivations from German and/or Dutch ===
===Compound and related titles===
Apart from all these, a few unusual titles have been of comital rank, not necessarily permanently.
* (English: &quot;Dolphin&quot;; ; ; ; ) was a multiple (though rare) comital title in southern France, used by the Dauphins of Vienne and Auvergne, before 1349 when it became the title of the heir to the French throne. The Dauphin was the lord of the province still known as the .
* &quot;Count-Duke&quot; is a rare title used in Spain, notably by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares. He had inherited the title of count of Olivares, but when created Duke of Sanlucar la Mayor by King Philip IV of Spain he begged permission to preserve his inherited title in combination with the new honour—according to a practice almost unique in Spanish history; logically the incumbent ranks as Duke (higher than Count) just as he would when simply concatenating both titles.
* &#x27;Count-Baron&#x27; is a rare title used in Portugal, notably by Dom , 7th Baron of Alvito, who received the title of Count of Oriola in 1653 from King John IV of Portugal. His palace in Lisbon still exists, located in a square named after him ().
* Archcount is a very rare title, etymologically analogous to archduke, apparently never recognized officially, used by or for:
** the count of Flanders (an original of the French realm in present Belgium, very rich, once expected to be raised to the rank of kingdom); the informal, rather descriptive use on account of the countship&#x27;s de facto importance is rather analogous to the unofficial epithet (before Grand duke became a formal title) for the even wealthier Duke of Burgundy
** at least one Count of Burgundy (i.e. of )
* In German kingdoms, the title was combined with the word for the jurisdiction or domain the nobleman was holding as a fief or as a conferred or inherited jurisdiction, such as (see also Marquess), , (&quot;free count&quot;), , where signifies castle; see also Viscount, (translated both as &quot;Count Palatine&quot; and, historically, as &quot;Palsgrave&quot;), (&quot;Raugrave&quot;, see &quot;Graf&quot;, and (), where signifies a large forest) (from Latin &quot;nemus&quot; = grove).
* The German and Dutch () stem from the Byzantine-Greek meaning &quot;he who calls a meeting [i.e. the court] together&quot;).
* The Ottoman military title of was used in Montenegro and Serbia as a lesser noble title with the equivalent rank of a Count.
* These titles are not to be confused with various minor administrative titles containing the word in various offices which are not linked to feudal nobility, such as the Dutch titles (a court sinecure, so usually held by noble courtiers, may even be rendered hereditary) and (to the present, in the Low Countries, a manager in the local or regional administration of watercourses through dykes, ditches, controls etc.; also in German , synonymous with , &quot;dike captain&quot;).

==Lists of countships ==

===Territory of today&#x27;s France===

====Kingdom of the Western Franks====
Since Louis VII (1137–80), the highest precedence amongst the vassals (Prince-bishops and secular nobility) of the French crown was enjoyed by those whose benefice or temporal fief was a &quot;pairie&quot;, i.e. carried the exclusive rank of &quot;pair&quot;; within the first (i.e. clerical) and second (noble) estates, the first three of the original twelve &quot;anciennes pairies&quot; were ducal, the next three comital &quot;comté-pairies&quot;:
* Bishop-counts of Beauvais (in Picardy)
* Bishop-counts of Châlons (in Champagne)
* Bishop-counts of Noyon (in Picardy)
* Count of Toulouse, until united to the crown in 1271 by marriage
* Count of Flanders (Flandres in French), which is in the Low countries and was confiscated in 1299, though returned in 1303
* Count of Champagne, until united to the crown (in 1316 by marriage, conclusively in 1361)
Later other countships (and duchies, even baronies) have been raised to this French peerage, but mostly as apanages (for members of the royal house) or for foreigners; after the 16th century all new peerages were always duchies and the medieval countship-peerages had died out, or were held by royal princes

Other French countships of note included those of:
* Count of Angoulême, later Duke
* Count of Anjou, later Duke
* Count of Auvergne
* Count of Bar, later Duke
* Count of Blois
* Count of Boulogne
* Count of Foix
* Count of Montpensier
* Count of Poitiers

====Parts of today&#x27;s France long within other kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire====
* Freigraf (&quot;free count&quot;) of Burgundy (i.e. present Franche-Comté)
* The Dauphiné

===The Holy Roman Empire===
&quot;See also above for parts of present France&quot;

====In Germany====

A &quot;Graf&quot; ruled over a territory known as a &quot;Grafschaft&quot; (&#x27;county&#x27;). See also various comital and related titles; especially those actually reigning over a principality: Gefürsteter Graf, Landgraf, Reichsgraf; compare Markgraf, Burggraf, Pfalzgraf (&quot;see Imperial quaternions&quot;).

====Northern Italian states====
The title of &quot;Conte&quot; is very prolific on the peninsula. In the eleventh century, &quot;Conti&quot; like the Count of Savoy or the Norman Count of Apulia, were virtually sovereign lords of broad territories. Even apparently &quot;lower&quot;-sounding titles, like Viscount, could describe powerful dynasts, such as the House of Visconti which ruled a major city such as Milan. The essential title of a feudatory, introduced by the Normans, was &quot;signore&quot;, modeled on the French &quot;seigneur&quot;, used with the name of the fief. By the fourteenth century, &quot;conte&quot; and the Imperial title &quot;barone&quot; were virtually synonymous.

Some titles of a count, according to the particulars of the patent, might be inherited by the eldest son of a Count. Younger brothers might be distinguished as &quot;X dei conti di Y&quot; (&quot;X of the counts of Y&quot;). However, if there is no male to inherit the title and the count has a daughter, in some regions she could inherit the title.

Many Italian counts left their mark on Italian history as individuals, yet only a few &quot;contadi&quot; (countships; the word &quot;contadini&quot; for inhabitants of a &quot;county&quot; remains the Italian word for &quot;peasant&quot;) were politically significant principalities, notably:
* Norman Count of Apulia
* Count of Savoy, later Duke (also partly in France and in Switzerland)
* Count of Asti
* Count of Montferrat (Monferrato)
* Count of Montefeltro
* Count of Tusculum

====In Austria====
The principalities tended to start out as margraviate or (promoted to) duchy, and became nominal archduchies within the Habsburg dynasty; noteworthy are:
* Count of Tyrol
* Count of Cilli
* Count of Schaumburg

==== In the Low Countries ====
Apart from various small ones, significant were :
* in presentday Belgium :
** Count of Flanders (Vlaanderen in Dutch), but only the small part east of the river Schelde remained within the empire; the far larger west, an original French comté-pairie became part of the French realm
** Count of Hainaut
** Count of Namur, later a margraviate
** Count of Leuven (Louvain), later a dukedom
** Count of Loon
* in the presentday Netherlands:
** Count of Guelders later Dukes of Guelders
** Count of Holland
** Count of Zeeland
** Count of Zutphen

==== In Switzerland ====

* Count of Geneva
* Count of Neuchâtel
* Count of Toggenburg
* Count of Kyburg
* Count de Salis-Soglio (also in the UK, Canada and Australia)
* Count de Salis-Seewis
* Count of Panzutti
*Count In-Albon

===In other continental European countries===
==== Holy See ====

Count/Countess was one of the noble titles granted by the Pope as a temporal sovereign, and the title&#x27;s holder was sometimes informally known as a papal count/papal countess or less so as a Roman count/Roman countess, but mostly as count/countess. The comital title, which could be for life or hereditary, was awarded in various forms by popes and Holy Roman Emperors since the Middle Ages, infrequently before the 14th century, and the pope continued to grant the comital and other noble titles even after 1870, it was largely discontinued in the mid 20th-century, on the accession of John XXIII. The Papacy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies might appoint counts palatine with no particular territorial fief. Until 1812 in some regions, the purchaser of land designated &quot;feudal&quot; was ennobled by the noble seat that he held and became a &quot;conte&quot;. This practice ceased with the formal abolition of feudalism in the various principalities of early-19th century Italy, last of all in the Papal States.

==== In Poland ====
Poland was notable throughout its history for not granting titles of nobility. This was on the premise that one could only be born into nobility, outside rare exceptions. Instead, it conferred non-hereditary courtly or civic roles. The noble titles that were in use on its territory were mostly of foreign provenance and usually subject to the process of indygenat, naturalisation.

==== In Hungary ====

Somewhat similar to the native privileged class of nobles found in Poland, Hungary also had a class of Conditional nobles.

====On the Iberian peninsula====

As opposed to the plethora of hollow &quot;gentry&quot; counts, only a few countships ever were important in medieval Iberia; most territory was firmly within the Reconquista kingdoms before counts could become important. However, during the 19th century, the title, having lost its high rank (equivalent to that of Duke), proliferated.

=====Portugal=====

Portugal itself started as a countship in 868, but became a kingdom in 1139 (see:&quot;County of Portugal&quot;). Throughout the history of Portugal, especially during the constitutional monarchy many other countships were created.

=====Spain=====

In Spain, no countships of wider importance exist, except in the former Spanish march.
*County of Barcelona, the initial core of the Principality of Catalonia, later one of the states of the Crown of Aragon, which became one of the two main components of the Spanish crown.
*Count of Aragon
*Count of Castile
*Count of Galicia
*Count of Lara
*Count Cassius, progenitor of the Banu Qasi
*County of Urgell, later integrated into the Principality of Catalonia.
*The other Catalan counties were much smaller and were absorbed early into the County of Barcelona (between parentheses the annexation year): County of Girona (897), County of Besalú, County of Osona, which included the nominal County of Manresa (1111), County of Berga and County of Conflent (1117) and County of Cerdanya (1118). From 1162 these counties, together with that of Barcelona, were merged into the Principality of Catalonia, a sovereign state that absorbed some other counties: County of Roussillon (1172), County of Pallars Jussà (1192), County of Empúries (1402), County of Urgell (1413) and County of Pallars Sobirà (1487), giving the Principality its definitive shape.

===South Eastern Europe===
====Bulgaria====
In the First Bulgarian Empire, a &quot;komit&quot; was a hereditary provincial ruler under the tsar documented since the reign of Presian (836-852) The Cometopouli dynasty was named after its founder, the &quot;komit&quot; of Sredets.

====Montenegro and Serbia====
The title of Serdar was used in the Principality of Montenegro and the Principality of Serbia as a noble title below that of Voivode equivalent to that of Count.

=== Crusader states ===
* Count of Edessa
* Count of Tripoli (1102–1288)

=== Scandinavia ===

In Denmark and historically in Denmark-Norway the title of count (&quot;greve&quot;) is the highest rank of nobility used in the modern period. Some Danish/Dano-Norwegian countships were associated with fiefs, and these counts were known as &quot;feudal counts&quot; (&quot;lensgreve&quot;). They rank above ordinary (titular) counts, and their position in the Danish aristocracy as the highest-ranking noblemen is broadly comparable to that of dukes in other European countries. With the first free Constitution of Denmark of 1849 came a complete abolition of the privileges of the nobility. Since then the title of count has been granted only to members of the Danish royal family, either as a replacement for a princely title when marrying a commoner, or in recent times, instead of that title in connection with divorce. Thus the first wife of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger son of Margrethe II of Denmark, became Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg on their divorce—initially retaining her title of princess, but losing it on her remarriage.

In the Middle Ages the title of jarl (earl) was the highest title of nobility. The title was eventually replaced by the title of duke, but that title was abolished in Denmark and Norway as early as the Middle Ages. Titles were only reintroduced with the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660, with count as the highest title.

In Sweden the rank of count is the highest rank conferred upon nobles in the modern era and are, like their Danish and Norwegian counterparts, broadly comparable to that of dukes in other European countries. Unlike the rest of Scandinavia, the title of duke is still used in Sweden, but only by members of the royal family not considered part of the nobility.

==Equivalents==
Like other major Western noble titles, Count is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-western languages with their own traditions, even though they are as a rule historically unrelated and thus hard to compare, but which are considered &quot;equivalent&quot; in rank.

This is the case with:

*the Chinese &quot;Bó&quot; (伯), or &quot;Bojue&quot; (伯爵), hereditary title of nobility ranking below &quot;Hóu&quot; (侯) and above &quot;Zĭ&quot; (子)
*earl of Britain
*the Japanese equivalent &quot;Hakushaku&quot; (), adapted during the Meiji restoration
*the Korean equivalent &quot;Baekjak&quot; (백작) or &quot;Poguk&quot;
* in Vietnam, it is rendered &quot;Bá&quot;, one of the lower titles reserved for male members of the Imperial clan, above &quot;Tử&quot; (Viscount), &quot;Nam&quot; (Baron) and &quot;Vinh phong&quot; (lowest noble title), but lower than—in ascending order—&quot;Hầu&quot; (Marquis), &quot;Công&quot; (Prince), &quot;Quận-Công&quot; (Duke/Duke of a commandery) and &quot;Quốc-Công&quot; (Grand Duke/Duke of the Nation), all under &quot;Vương&quot; (King) and &quot;Hoàng Đế&quot; (Emperor).
*the Indian &quot;Sardar&quot;, adopted by the Maratha Empire, additionally, Jagirdar and Deshmukh are close equivalents
*the Arabic equivalent &quot;Sheikh&quot;
*In traditional Sulu equivalent to Datu Sadja

==In fiction==

The title &quot;Count&quot; in fiction is commonly, though not always, given to evil characters, used as another word for prince or vampires:

*Count Nefaria
*Count Vertigo
*Count von Count
*Count Duckula
*Count Olaf
*Count Chocula
*Count Paris
*Count of Monte Cristo
*Count Dooku
*Count Dracula
*Count Orlok
*Count Arthur Strong

* Icelandic nobility
* Romanian nobility
* Russian nobility
* Viscount
* Earl

<doc id="196472" wikidata="Q588352" url="?curid=196472" title="Rio (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Rio is the second studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 10May 1982 through EMI. Produced by Colin Thurston, the band wrote and demoed most of the material before recording the album at AIR Studios in London from January to March 1982. The band utilised more experimentation compared to their debut album, from vibraphone and marimba to the sound of a cigarette being lit and cracking ice cubes. Andy Hamilton played a saxophone solo on the title track &quot;Rio&quot;.

A synth-pop, new wave and pop rock album with musical elements such as disco and funk, &quot;Rio&quot; is mostly composed of fast, upbeat numbers, with some slower synthesiser-based ballads. Lead vocalist Simon Le Bon&#x27;s lyrics cover topics from chasing one&#x27;s dreams to pursuing a love interest. Bassist John Taylor conceived the title, which the band felt represented the optimistic and exotic tone of the album. The cover artwork, painted by Patrick Nagel and designed by Malcolm Garrett to resemble 1950s cigar packaging, is considered one of the greatest of all time.

Duran Duran shot music videos for many of the album&#x27;s tracks, all of which helped spearhead the 1980s MTV revolution. Accompanied by three worldwide hit singles, &quot;Rio&quot; peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and remained in the chart for 110 weeks. Initially unsuccessful in the United States, the album was remixed by Capitol Records to better match American radio at the time; the remixed album spent 129 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, reaching number six. The band toured the US and Europe throughout the latter half of 1982.

&quot;Rio&quot; initially received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, who commended the melodies but disparaged the lyrics. Retrospective reviewers consider &quot;Rio&quot; timeless and the band&#x27;s best work, praising its instrumentation and band performances. With the album, Duran Duran were forerunners in the Second British Invasion of the 1980s, helping ensure the success of other English artists throughout the decade. It has since made appearances on best-of lists and has been reissued several times.

==Background and development==
Duran Duran released their self-titled debut album in June 1981. Aided by the album&#x27;s highly successful third single &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, the album peaked at number three in the UK and remained in the charts for over two years. With the album, Duran Duran had established themselves as one of the biggest new pop groups of 1981. Around July, they began writing songs for their second studio album, spending time at their resident nightclub the Rum Runner in Birmingham like their debut. The band&#x27;s label, EMI Records, doubled their budget for the new record. Feeling pressure in England, the band briefly withdrew to a secluded château in France to continue writing. Keyboardist Nick Rhodes later stated:

On 28 August 1981, Duran Duran recorded demos of several songs that would appear on their next album, including &quot;Last Chance on the Stairway&quot;, &quot;My Own Way&quot;, &quot;New Religion&quot; and &quot;Like an Angel&quot;, at the basement studio of EMI&#x27;s Manchester Square building. According to bassist John Taylor, the demo of &quot;Last Chance on the Stairway&quot; was identical to the final album version, while &quot;My Own Way&quot; and &quot;New Religion&quot; both had different arrangements. This version of &quot;My Own Way&quot; was dance-inspired and featured bursts of electric guitar, a different bassline and pattering percussion. Dissatisfied with this version, the band rerecorded the song during the official sessions. An early version of &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; was also taped with German sound engineer Renate Blauel.
Both &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; were the result of collaborations between Rhodes and guitarist Andy Taylor; Rhodes began on synthesiser, which Taylor fashioned into guitar riffs. The latter commented, &quot;When we wrote &#x27;Hungry&#x27;, I knew we had the album right.&quot; The band taped demos of &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Lonely in Your Nightmare&quot; at engineer Bob Lamb&#x27;s home studio in Birmingham. The band used this material for reference during the proper sessions, particularly for the sequenced-based tracks &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;.

Duran Duran continued promotional appearances and live performances throughout September and October 1981, including their first American tour. EMI wanted a new single, so the band returned to England and taped a new version of &quot;My Own Way&quot;, boasting disco and American R&amp;B-influenced production, with &quot;Like an Angel&quot; as the B-side. Released on 16 November 1981 in England only, the single spent 11 weeks on the chart, hitting number 14. Rhodes disliked the single-only release: &quot;It was the only time we actually sat down and said, &#x27;Ok, we&#x27;ve got to write a hit single now&#x27;.&quot; The band underwent the Careless Memories tour in December, featuring 17 sold-out dates, before taking a holiday break.

==Recording==
The recording sessions for &quot;Rio&quot; commenced in January 1982 at London&#x27;s AIR Studios and lasted six to eight weeks. The members rented apartments in close vicinity to the studio during the duration of the sessions. Colin Thurston returned from the debut as producer and engineer. The band were excited to record at AIR, having previously demoed &quot;Girls on Film&quot; there in July 1980. Founded by former Beatles producer George Martin, the studio boasted high-tech equipment that Rhodes, in particular, was eager to experiment with. The keyboardist devoted time learning production techniques with Thurston and was purportedly the first to arrive and last to leave every day.
According to John Taylor, all of the songs, except for &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;, were fully arranged before recording began; &quot;Rio&quot; had been played during multiple sound checks. Recording followed the same template as the debut: the bass, drums and synthesiser parts were recorded first, followed by guitar, keyboard overdubs and vocals. The band recalled recording going by relatively easily. Drummer Roger Taylor recorded his parts quickly and returned to Birmingham with his girlfriend, while John Taylor and Andy Taylor dwelled at the Embassy Club on Old Bond Street throughout the sessions. At AIR, Paul and Linda McCartney, who were recording the former&#x27;s &quot;Tug of War&quot; LP in the adjacent studio, stopped by on occasion to say good night, a gesture Rhodes described as &quot;very surreal&quot;; John also listened back to a mix of the finished &quot;Rio&quot; album with Paul.
Having defined the majority of the arrangements before recording began, the band sharpened their individual performances and experimented with different sounds. John Taylor played fretless bass on &quot;Lonely in Your Nightmare&quot;, while lead vocalist Simon Le Bon added vibraphone and marimba to &quot;New Religion&quot; and &quot;Last Chance on the Stairway&quot;, respectively. Rhodes added the sound of a cigarette being lit and clinking glasses to the latter, while &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; opens with a giggle from his then-girlfriend Cheryl. With Thurston, Roger Taylor melded accents from his Simmons&#x27; electronic drum kit to multiple tracks, hooking up the electronic tom-toms to his acoustic set. He said in 2021: &quot;I&#x27;d play an acoustic drum kit and just lay the Simmons over the top. [...] And I&#x27;m glad that we did that...it was great to have something modern coming through as part of the kit, but it didn&#x27;t completely dominate the sound.&quot;

Saxophonist Andy Hamilton played the solo on &quot;Rio&quot;. Hamilton had previously contributed to the &quot;night version&quot; of &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and performed with Duran Duran on their 1981 European tour dates. He mostly improvised his part, basing most of the solo on two chords. Rhodes oversaw Hamilton&#x27;s part, which he later described as &quot;more of an integral melody within the song rather than a solo&quot;, leading it to be played the same way during concert performances. The track&#x27;s opening was created when Rhodes dropped metal rods onto the strings of the studio&#x27;s grand piano and flipped the tape over, reversing the sound.

&quot;The Chauffeur&quot; was created on the spot in the studio. During downtime, Rhodes retreated to an auxiliary studio room with Blauel, their tape operator, and crafted a track using keyboards, synthesisers, the sound of an ice cube cracking and a conversation about nature for extra effects. Le Bon accompanied him and brought lyrics inspired by a 1979 visit to a kibbutz in Israel, further adding a melody on an ocarina. The final track features no contributions from the three Taylors. An acoustic version was recorded without Rhodes, which appeared as a B-side to &quot;Rio&quot;. The keyboardist later quipped, &quot;I guess that was my punishment for have created an entirely electronic track.&quot;

===Mixing===
The band were contracted to finish mixing the album by the end of March 1982 and were due to fly to Sri Lanka to film music videos before their tour of Australia commenced in mid-April. With the record still unfinished, Le Bon, John Taylor and Roger Taylor flew to Sri Lanka while Rhodes and Andy Taylor stayed in London with Thurston to make some last-minute tweaks; according to biographer Steve Malins, the trio worked for 48 hours straight. Once completed, Rhodes and Andy flew to Sri Lanka, the former listening to and analysing &quot;Rio&quot; the entire ride.

==Music and lyrics==

Musically, &quot;Rio&quot; is a synth-pop, new wave and pop rock album that contains elements of dance, post-punk, rock, disco, funk and gothic rock. According to author Stephen Davis, EMI wanted the band to change direction from their debut, desiring more of a rock-edged dance groove, telling Thurston: &quot;Think Led Zeppelin and Talking Heads having a baby and calling it Duran Duran.&quot; The band&#x27;s influences at the time included Roxy Music, David Bowie, Japan, pre-&quot;Dare&quot; Human League and 1970s UK guitar rock. AllMusic&#x27;s Donald Guarisco retrospectively compared the title track&#x27;s instrumental to the Roxy Music releases &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (1980) and &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), even associating Hamilton&#x27;s saxophone solo to Andy Mackay&#x27;s contributions to Roxy Music. Rhodes later described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;elegant punk&quot;.

Of the album&#x27;s nine tracks, the first seven (&quot;Rio&quot; to &quot;Last Chance on the Stairway&quot;) are faster and more upbeat numbers, while the last two (&quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;) are slower and atmospheric synthesiser-based ballads. In &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, writer Annie Zaleski described the rhythm section of John Taylor and Roger Taylor as &quot;formidable&quot; and &quot;locked into grooves with nimble precision&quot;, with Rhodes&#x27;s synthesisers adding &quot;artsy textures&quot; and Andy Taylor&#x27;s &quot;blazing guitar acrobatics&quot; bringing &quot;ferocity and heft&quot; to the tracks; Malins highlights &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;New Religion&quot; as showcasing Andy&#x27;s guitar. The album&#x27;s production is sparser than that of the debut, although Rhodes felt its bouts of studio experimentation made &quot;Rio&quot; definitively theirs: &quot;It sounds like us – I don&#x27;t think it sounds like anybody else.&quot;

Le Bon turned to his experiences on their first American tour for inspiration in writing the lyrics. In a nod to artists such as Joy Division and the Doors&#x27; Jim Morrison, the lyrics of &quot;Rio&quot; touch on topics from chasing one&#x27;s dreams and finding one&#x27;s place in the world, to pursuing a love interest and providing solace to a friend—mainly using dark and poetic words. The title track paints a picture of a girl with a &quot;cherry ice cream smile&quot; that is &quot;too lovely to resist&quot;; &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; concerns a couple&#x27;s love affair that ends too soon; and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; conveys images of restless driving and attractive women. Malins says that Le Bon&#x27;s lyrics are sometimes full of the &quot;most obtuse tongue-twisters&quot;, with &quot;New Religion&quot; being presented as &quot;a dialogue between the ego and the alter ego&quot;, but he does find the line &quot;no time to worry cause we&#x27;re on the roam again&quot; in &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot; perfectly encapsulates the album&#x27;s &quot;high spirits&quot;. Guarisco argued that Le Bon&#x27;s &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; lyrics on tracks like &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; primarily add to the tracks&#x27; personalities rather than mean anything &quot;in the literal sense&quot;.

==Title and packaging==

John Taylor came up with the album&#x27;s title in 1981 during the band&#x27;s worldwide tour supporting their debut. Taylor, who had never left England before, was taken by the glamour and excitement of the road which included stops in Los Angeles, New York City, Paris and Berlin. While visiting Brazil, he was fascinated with the idea of exotica, stating in his memoir: &quot;Rio [de Janeiro], to me, was shorthand for the truly foreign, the exotic, a cornucopia of earthly delights, a party that would never stop.&quot; The other band members liked the title, feeling it encapsulated the &quot;more optimistic&quot; tone of the entire album. Le Bon later said: &quot;The word looks great, sounds great and makes people think of parties, rivers – it&#x27;s Spanish for river! – foreign places and sunshine.&quot;

Duran Duran themselves do not appear on the front cover of &quot;Rio&quot;, which was a stylistic departure from their debut and most albums at the time; the band felt that photographs and the music videos would suffice. Instead, the cover artwork is a portrait of a woman with striking make-up, a large smile and black hair. It was painted by artist Patrick Nagel, who was commissioned by the band after co-manager Paul Berrow discovered his work while browsing a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine; Nagel was a regular contributor to the magazine at the time. Creating what became known as his trademark style, Nagel presented two options: a woman with a flower in her hair sitting sideways and the chosen shot of a woman smiling. Rhodes recalled, &quot;We all said instantly: &#x27;Yes, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the cover.&quot; Author Elena G. Millie described her as the &quot;quintessential&quot; 1980s woman: &quot;elegant and sophisticated, alluring but cool, stark but sensual, mysterious, contradictory and utterly contemporary&quot;. In 2024, it was revealed that cover girl was based on a photograph of the fashion model Marcie Hunt in the February 1981 issue of &quot;Vogue France&quot;.

Malcolm Garrett, who had designed the cover artworks for the band&#x27;s singles and first album, had &quot;no more than a week&quot; to complete the final sleeve design. Garrett, who had yet to hear the title track, stated that &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;made me think of cigars and cigar packaging. The whole idea of something Latin and something Cuban and South American.&quot; Disliking album sleeves at the time having a plain image on the front and nothing on the back, he wrapped the painting around the front and back of the sleeve, later saying it was a conceptual choice: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to go through the picture to get to the album.&quot; Like cigar packaging, initial pressings had a physical sticker sealing the LP shut, a design choice that was pasted directly onto the sleeve for later reissues. For the title&#x27;s typeface, Garrett used a retro style that was also evocative of 1950s cigar packaging. He received credit on the sleeve itself with &quot;Assorted Images&quot; integrated into the design. Duran Duran loved the finished design, with Rhodes stating that &quot;it just seemed to represent everything we wanted at that point&quot;. Duran Duran became closely associated with the sleeve&#x27;s image over the course of their career. The original drawing hung at Paul Berrow&#x27;s office at the Rum Runner before the band stole it on their way to appear on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, after which the members each took turns hanging it in their respective houses or apartments.

Garrett used the sleeve to establish a distinctive system of visual elements that provided &quot;conceptual continuity&quot; across &quot;Rio&quot; advertising, tour materials, merchandise and singles, which he also supervised. He stated in 2000: &quot;What we were doing with music then was always about creating and defining a visual world in which the fans operated and could come to understand.&quot; In a mix-up between the band and the Japanese label, Nagel&#x27;s second rejected image was used for the Japanese single release of &quot;My Own Way&quot;, issued months ahead of &quot;Rio&quot;. Rhodes later quipped: &quot;No one had told the Japanese label that we hadn&#x27;t actually bought that one.&quot;

A lyric sheet and a band portrait appears in the LP liner. Deliberately incongruous to the album title, Duran Duran were photographed on the top of the British Petroleum Building, the tallest building in London at the time, against a modern nighttime skyline. They wore Antony Price suits, which they used for the subsequent music videos. Photographer Andy Earl recalled: &quot;Because their music was so electronic, I wanted to try and create that energy in the picture. Just before the end of the exposure, I kicked the tripod, and that&#x27;s what gives it this fizzy, electronic and glamorous look. Which, to me, captured the music and what they were all about.&quot;

===Music videos===
Music videos were shot for six of &quot;Rio&quot; nine tracks. Russell Mulcahy, who had directed the video for &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, worked with Duran Duran on videos for &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Lonely in Your Nightmare&quot; in Sri Lanka, one for &quot;Rio&quot; in Antigua and one for &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; in London without the band&#x27;s involvement; another video was commissioned for the single version of &quot;My Own Way&quot;. Former film student Marcello Anciano acted as storyboard artist and art director for all the videos. The Sri Lanka videos emphasised the exotic location; &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; saw Le Bon cast as an Indiana Jones-type character, while &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; utilised elephants and found the band atop a mountain inspecting stone temples. While there, Rhodes and John Taylor were homesick, while Andy Taylor contracted a fever from the water, requiring his hospitalisation on his return to England. The guitarist was &quot;very run-down&quot; for the subsequent Australian and Japanese tours throughout the second half of April 1982 and had an oxygen mask at the side of the stage for the shows. He fully recovered for the &quot;Rio&quot; shoot, which found the band sailing aboard yachts.

Duran Duran earned a large advance from EMI to film the videos, particularly the Sri Lanka ones, said to range between £30,000 and £55,000. The label had strong faith in the group and wanted videos prepared in advance before &quot;Rio&quot; release. Both the band and EMI had ambitious plans for promotion and devised the release of a full-length video album consisting of the best songs from both &quot;Duran Duran&quot; (1981) and &quot;Rio&quot;. Le Bon had declared the medium&#x27;s importance in an interview with &quot;Smash Hits&quot; earlier in the year, stating, &quot;I take video very seriously. I see it as an artform. Most people see it as a promotional device.[...] Videos are the &#x27;talking pictures&#x27; of today&#x27;s music industry.&quot; Rhodes and Roger Taylor also spoke about it to the Associated Press later in the year. Other band members were more reserved, particularly John Taylor.
Although video albums originated as early as 1979, EMI&#x27;s parent corporation, Thorn, intended for the proposed Duran Duran album to sell exquisitely in the VHS and home video markets. At the time, Britain saw the significance of music videos and, with programmes such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, audiences were accustomed to watching bands perform on television. In America, music videos played a lesser role in promotion, as labels felt they were insignificant compared to radio. MTV, which launched in August 1981, soon provided a shift in this perspective, primarily due to the videos of British bands played on the channel. One of MTV&#x27;s original VJs, Alan Hunter, later stated that while American artists took more literal approaches when producing videos, &quot;the music of the young New Wave romantics [such as Duran Duran] lent itself better to a more ephemeral interpretation, or a little looser interpretation.&quot; Commenting on the more stylised British videos at the time, MTV co-founder John Sykes said:

===Release===
EMI issued &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; as the lead single from the album on 4May 1982; Duran Duran mimed to the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; nine days later. Entering the UK Singles Chart at number 35, it reached the top ten by the end of May, and peaked at number five in late June. Its accompanying video received frequent rotation on MTV by early July.

Shortly after the lead single, EMI issued &quot;Rio&quot; on 10May 1982. It debuted at number four and reached number two by 22May, behind the Madness greatest hits compilation &quot;Complete Madness&quot;. &quot;Rio&quot; remained in the UK chart for 110 weeks, including 96 consecutive weeks until March 1984. A tour EP generated publicity in Australia, leading &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; both reaching the top ten. In interviews, Duran Duran disassociated themselves with New Romanticism, as the band wanted to set themselves apart from &quot;any broader movement&quot;, drawing comparisons to Spandau Ballet and Ultravox.

Initial European tour dates were delayed to September 1982 due to Andy Taylor falling ill. Instead, the band toured the US throughout July, attracting their largest audiences to date, later opening for Blondie in August. &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; was released in England as the second single on 9August 1982, backed by a remix of &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot;, which charted at number two in the UK. Shortly before the European tour began, EMI issued interviews Le Bon made with &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;The Face&quot; as a 7″ picture single, titled &quot;An interview with Simon Le Bon&quot;. John Taylor injured his hand during the tour but fully recovered before a month-long UK tour that commenced on 30October. Two days later, &quot;Rio&quot; appeared as a single in England and America, reaching number nine in the former; it failed to chart in the US as a single until 1985 as part of the live album &quot;Arena&quot;.

===American remix===
&quot;Rio&quot; success in the UK, Australia and Japan initially went unmatched in the US. The first American release through Capitol-subsidiary Harvest Records debuted at number 164 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart before stalling at number 122. Capitol executives attributed geography, size and what they viewed as zero hit singles to the low performance. One executive even claimed that radio was the only way to achieve success in the country.

With dwindling fortunes, Capitol promised more promotion if Duran Duran remixed &quot;Rio&quot; to better align with American radio. With staff producer David Kershenbaum, the band remixed four songs: &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot;, &quot;My Own Way&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Duran Duran&quot; &quot;Girls on Film&quot;. According to Davis, Kershenbaum&#x27;s goal was to &quot;make Duran Duran sound like Van Halen on an American pickup truck radio&quot;. Andy Taylor states in his memoir that the new mix gave the album &quot;a smoother, cleaner sound&quot; for US audiences, who were used to more polished feel than what was developed in the UK. John Taylor was unhappy with the remix, believing it represented the death of the band&#x27;s original vision: &quot;That was the end of Duran Duran, our original idea—an underground club band.&quot; Due to a lack of notice and a financial falling out with Paul Berrow, Thurston parted ways with the band, making &quot;Rio&quot; his final work with the group.

Capitol collected the remixes and released them as an EP in late September 1982 called &quot;Carnival&quot;. Packaged with band photos and liner notes, &quot;Carnival&quot; earned Duran Duran radio play throughout the US, hitting number 98 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in early October. Following the successful remixes, Capitol rebranded Duran Duran as a dance band and commissioned Kershenbaum to remix the entire first side of the &quot;Rio&quot; album. In November, Capitol issued the remixed &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; single in the US, the latter charting at number three by Christmas. With the music videos garnering heavy airplay on MTV and nationwide chart success, marketing executives pushed radio DJs to refer to Duran Duran as &quot;the Fab Five&quot;. The remixed &quot;Rio&quot; charted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in March 1983 and spent 129 weeks on the chart.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rio&quot; received mixed-to-negative reviews on release. Critics commended the melodies but ridiculed the lyrics. Robin Denselow, in particular, mused in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Why do bands with no lyrical skill insist on printing their ghastly efforts on inside record sleeves?&quot; He deemed the music &quot;melodic, disposable pop to a best-selling formula&quot;. A writer for &quot;Record Mirror&quot; bluntly described &quot;Rio&quot; as &quot;thoroughly competent and yet bereft of the soul, passion and wit that makes a great record&quot;. Allentown, Pennsylvania newspaper &quot;The Morning Call&quot; was also negative, finding the album &quot;a pain in the butt to sit through&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; Paul Du Noyer found a lack of artistic differentiation from their debut, stating, &quot;What they&#x27;ve done is spin out the formula, quite efficiently.&quot; Deeming &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;a sweet, lumpy pudding of a noise&quot;, he concluded: &quot;In its own blandly unambitious way, I guess, it&#x27;s a perfect record. In other ways, it&#x27;s boring as hell.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau deemed the LP &quot;Anglodisco at its most solemnly expedient&quot;, feeling that &quot;it lacks even the forced cheerfulness&quot; of Haircut 100, and that &quot;if it had as many hooks as &quot;A Flock of Seagulls&quot; (not bloody likely) it still wouldn&#x27;t be silly enough to be any fun&quot;. By late 1983, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had dismissed Duran Duran as soulless, musically derivative and typical of the &quot;frivolous dance-oriented synthesizer pop made by [British] fashion-conscious groups&quot; that MTV had helped to popularise.

Other reviewers were warmer to the record. Writing for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Fred Dellar gave praise to the first three tracks, commenting that they &quot;had me jotting down theories about the new golden age of pop&quot;, but by the LP&#x27;s end, it turned into &quot;yet another well-dressed but not totally satisfying album&quot;. In &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Jack Lloyd wrote that &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;indicates a strong feel for the pop market&quot; and gave positive mentions to the instrumentation and accessible music. A writer for &quot;Billboard&quot; agreed, finding &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;catchy, melodic and accessible&quot;, with tunes hewing toward &quot;bright and sassy pop&quot;. A particularly positive review came from &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, wherein Steve Sutherland proclaimed &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;the true culmination of the much-misunderstood New Romanticism – energetic, proud, enthusiastic, joyous; something to escape FULLY into&quot;. He expressed excitement in seeing where the band would go next. Ira Robbins was also positive in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, finding the music showcased the young band as an emerging and creative talent: &quot;Even when Duran Duran aims for the b.p.m. crowd, they display enough musical perspicacity to avoid tedium.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
The success of &quot;Rio&quot; electrified the already-rising Second British Invasion. With their contemporaries the Human League, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club and Thomas Dolby, Duran Duran dominated the American pop charts throughout 1983 and led to the rise of other would-be successful British acts, including Tears for Fears, Eurythmics, Naked Eyes and the Rhodes-discovered Kajagoogoo. With Culture Club and Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran created a teen frenzy similar to Beatlemania during the first British Invasion of the 1960s. Additional UK acts, including Wham!, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Pet Shop Boys and Dead or Alive, found American success in the ensuing years, alongside other bands who originated in small clubs like Duran Duran—the Cure, Depeche Mode, the Psychedelic Furs and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. David Bowie, Duran Duran&#x27;s idol, also found massive commercial success in 1983 with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

According to Zaleski, &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;sonic approach—blasing electric guitars blended with moody synthesisers—became the dominant template for mainstream 1980s rock&quot;; bands such as INXS used Duran Duran and &quot;Rio&quot; as a basis for their edgier and funkier sound. Discussing the album&#x27;s impact, Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Lyndsey Parker pondered: &quot;Was there ever any album that embodied all things grand and glamorous about the escapist, excessive, exotic, erotic, aspirational &#x27;80s more than Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Rio&quot;?&quot;

Three decades after its release, John Taylor still held &quot;Rio&quot; in high regard, calling the songwriting &quot;fantastic&quot; and &quot;essential Duran Duran&quot;. He also had high praise for the band&#x27;s musicianship, arguing that each member was performing at their peaks. Rhodes admitted in 2022 that &quot;Rio&quot; was tough to top: &quot;It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been a double-edged sword for us, because it was such a powerful record, and perhaps the images from the videos stuck in people&#x27;s minds. Then it came to the end of the 1980s, and people wanted to close the door on us.&quot; John Taylor felt &quot;Rio&quot; helped the band establish longevity beyond the 1980s, leading to a career spanning 15 albums and more than 100 million record sales. Speaking to Yahoo! Music, he proclaimed: &quot;This is the album that put us on the map — and has kept us there.&quot;

===Retrospective appraisal===

Critics have retrospectively declared &quot;Rio&quot; Duran Duran&#x27;s finest work. Beyond the 2000s, commentators agreed the album has aged well, with AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett asserting that &quot;its fusion of style and substance ensures that even two decades after its release it remains as listenable and danceable as ever&quot;. Zaleski argued that the band&#x27;s use of basic instrumentation ensured &quot;Rio&quot; sounded more timeless than other albums of the time. In &quot;The Quietus&quot;, John Freeman concluded that over 30 years after its release, &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;encompasses all anyone needs to know about Duran Duran&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Record Collector&quot; Mark Elliot deemed it a &quot;seminal 80s classic&quot; and a record that displays a band figuring out their sound, growing in confidence and &quot;setting to conquer the world&quot;. Chris Ingalls of &quot;PopMatters&quot; agreed, referring to it as &quot;an iconic statement of its times&quot; and one that rewards repeated listens.

Other reviewers have given praise to the band, with Zaleski arguing that &quot;&quot;Rio&quot; was a testament to the band&#x27;s chemistry and ambition, and how quickly they evolved as musicians.&quot; Writing for &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Paul Moody viewed &quot;Rio&quot; as reinitiating Duran Duran&#x27;s status as &quot;a national pop treasure&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Tom Ewing, who gave negative assessments to their debut and their follow-up studio album &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; (1983), stated that &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;is where the band&#x27;s hunger for success really catalyzed its mix of rock, disco, and heartthrob pop&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s Wyndham Wallace found the album &quot;confirms [the band] packed a significant punch&quot;, while Robbins wrote in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;:

The band members&#x27; performances and instrumentation have been highlighted, with Raggett stating that &quot;the quintet integrates [their] sound near-perfectly throughout&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ John Bergstrom observed that &quot;not even nearly 30 years of cultural change have been able to budge the careful juxtaposition between Andy Taylor&#x27;s power riffing and Simon Le Bon&#x27;s willfully artful lyrics and vocals, or the brilliant interplay between the awesome, seriously funky rhythm section of John Taylor and Roger Taylor, and Nick Rhodes&#x27; atmospheric, arpeggiated synthesizer framework. Together, it all created all kinds of energy and just the right amount of camp.&quot; Despite its praise, several commentators have taken issue with Le Bon&#x27;s lyrics, arguing they lack literal meaning and range from &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;sublime&quot;, but agree that the singer&#x27;s confident vocal performances offer bouts of connotation.

&quot;Rio&quot; cover artwork has been deemed iconic and one of the greatest of all time by publications such as &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and VH1. In 2006, Ernest Simpson of &quot;Treblezine&quot; wrote that with the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; (1979), &quot;rarely does an album cover truly fit the style and attitude within&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; &quot;not only encapsulated the slick new wave of the stylish band, but also the early &#x27;80s in general&quot;. Reflecting on the artwork in his 2021 book &quot;Please Please Tell Me Now&quot;, Davis states that the decline of the &quot;classic album art&quot; era began following the release of &quot;Rio&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;Rio&quot; has made appearances on several best-of lists. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Rio&quot; at number 98 in their list of the 100 Greatest British Albums ever, while &quot;The Word&quot; ranked it number 24 is a similar list of the 50 best British albums in 2008. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 95th best album of the 1980s in 2002. A year later, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Rio&quot; the 65th greatest album of all time. A decade later in 2013, BBC Radio 2 placed it at number three in a list compiling their &quot;Top 100 Favourite Albums of All Time&quot;. In lists compiling the best new wave albums, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; placed it at numbers 4 and 24, respectively. Despite its acclaim, Malins finds that &quot;Rio&quot; is often not as highly revered as other records of the time, such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, the Human League&#x27;s &quot;Dare&quot; and Simple Minds&#x27; &quot;New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)&quot;.

The album was included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;Rio&quot; was first released on CD in early 1984 and was one of the first CDs issued by EMI in the UK and the US. The album&#x27;s first major reissue by EMI was released on 3July 2001. This release contained Enhanced CD material featuring the music videos for &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Save a Prayer&quot;, plus memorabilia and a link to the band&#x27;s official website. The European limited-edition booklet cover used an alternate version of the Nagel cover painting. The original CD version was used rather than the original LP version, with EMI claiming that it was due to master tape research issues as a result of there being several different versions of the album.

&quot;Rio&quot; was again reissued as a two-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition on 7September 2009 in the UK, and 6October 2009 in the US. This edition includes the original LP release tracks and the US Kershenbaum remixes, along with several other tracks that were either previously unavailable officially on CD, or were only available on &quot;Singles Box Set 1981–1985&quot; (2003). The release was packaged with the &quot;Live at Hammersmith &#x27;82&quot; DVD, which &quot;Record Collector&quot; Joel McIver felt was superior to &quot;Rio&quot;. This reissue received mixed reviews. Commentators felt the bonus tracks were mostly disposable and not worth the price tag, although some welcome the presence of several &quot;night versions&quot; and the US mixes. Ewing concluded: &quot;The 2xCD package is probably best used as a way of recreating whichever version of &quot;Rio&quot; floats your nostalgia yacht.&quot; On 23June 2015, Parlophone repackaged this edition as a two-disc set, featuring the US album mixes, demos, assorted B-sides and five remixes.

<text>Douglas Owen Hopkins (April 11, 1961 – December 5, 1993) was an American musician and songwriter. He co-founded Gin Blossoms, a popular modern rock band of the early 1990s, with Richard Taylor. He was the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and a principal songwriter. Hopkins&#x27; writing credits included the hits &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot;, &quot;Found Out About You&quot;, &quot;Hold Me Down&quot; and &quot;Lost Horizons&quot;.

Hopkins died by suicide in 1993, after suffering from mental health issues and alcoholism.

==Early life and education==
Hopkins was born in Seattle, Washington, and raised in Tempe, Arizona. He graduated from Tempe&#x27;s McClintock High School in 1979, and two years later, while attending Arizona State University, formed his first rock band with Bill Leen. Hopkins was the guitarist and Leen the bassist, although neither knew how to play the instruments. Hopkins graduated from Arizona State in 1985, with a degree in sociology.

== Career ==

By 1987, Hopkins and Leen formed Gin Blossoms, and in 1988, Jesse Valenzuela and Phillip Rhodes signed on as the band&#x27;s second guitarist and drummer, respectively. Robin Wilson, the band&#x27;s eventual lead singer, joined in 1988 as well.

Hopkins had suffered from chronic depression since childhood and had been battling alcoholism for several years. However, in 1990, Gin Blossoms were one of the hottest local bands in Tempe and the surrounding areas, and they signed a contract with A&amp;M Records.

Hopkins was resistant to signing to a major label, feeling like its property, and reacted with stubbornness and more drinking. When the band recorded its second studio album &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; in February 1992, it was reported that Hopkins was unable to stand during his recording sessions. Faced with the prospect of firing Hopkins or being dropped by A&amp;M, the band terminated Hopkins. Doused in aftershave and mouthwash to cover the effects of his days-long drinking binge, he was flown back to Arizona.

Hopkins was replaced by Scott Johnson. The record label then withheld $15,000 () owed to Hopkins until he agreed to sign over half of his publishing royalties. Hopkins was also required to relinquish his mechanical royalties to Johnson, his replacement. Hopkins reluctantly agreed to these demands because of his dire financial situation. &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; went on to become a multi-platinum album, though sales were initially slow. 

After he returned to Tempe, Hopkins started another band, The Chimeras, with brothers Lawrence and Mark Zubia. Hopkins soon quit the band after a live performance went poorly. Shortly before his death, Hopkins appeared on stage with Dead Hot Workshop and Hans Olson in Tucson. The Chimeras later changed their name to The Pistoleros, upon signing a short-lived recording contract. The first several singles released by Gin Blossoms, and the only mainstream hit released by the Pistoleros prior to being dropped by their label, were penned by Hopkins.

== Death ==
As Gin Blossoms experienced mounting success performing songs he had written, Hopkins became increasingly despondent. Although he had always dreamed of having a gold record, when he received one (for the song &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot;), he hung it up for two weeks before taking it down and then destroying it. Nine days later, after an intake consultation in the detox unit of Phoenix&#x27;s St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, Hopkins purchased a .38 caliber pistol. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound the next day – December 5, 1993.

In 1994, Larry Rudolph of the New York firm of Rudolph &amp; Beer, which represented the Hopkins estate, announced that eighteen songs were found and were open for a recording deal. Circa 2000, award-winning documentarian Mark Stanoch secured the rights to Hopkins’ music and story for a biopic potentially starring Ethan Hawke, but plans got bogged down.

<text>Margrave was originally the medieval title for the military commander assigned to maintain the defence of one of the border provinces of the Holy Roman Empire or a kingdom. That position became hereditary in certain feudal families in the Empire and the title came to be borne by rulers of some Imperial principalities until the abolition of the Empire in 1806 (e.g., Margrave of Brandenburg, Margrave of Baden). Thereafter, those domains (originally known as &quot;marks&quot; or &quot;marches&quot;, later as &quot;margraviates&quot; or &quot;margravates&quot;) were absorbed into larger realms or the titleholders adopted titles indicative of full sovereignty.

== History ==

Etymologically, the word &quot;margrave&quot; (, ) is the English and French form of the German noble title (;, meaning &quot;march&quot; or &quot;mark&quot;, that is, borderland, added to , meaning &quot;Count&quot;); it is related semantically to the English title &quot;Marcher Lord&quot;. As a noun and hereditary title, &quot;margrave&quot; was common among the languages of Europe, such as Spanish and Polish.

A (margrave) originally functioned as the military governor of a Carolingian march, a medieval border province. Because the territorial integrity of the borders of the realm of a king or emperor was essential to national security, the vassal (whether a count or other lord) whose lands were on the march of the kingdom or empire was likely to be appointed a margrave and given greater responsibility for securing the border.

The greater exposure of a border province to military invasion mandated that the margrave be provided with military forces and autonomy of action (political as well as military) greater than those accorded other lords of the realm. As a military governor, the margrave&#x27;s authority often extended over a territory larger than the province proper, because of border expansion after royal wars.

The margrave thus usually came to exercise commensurately greater politico-military power than other noblemen. The margrave maintained the greater armed forces and fortifications required for repelling invasion, which increased his political strength and independence relative to the monarch. Moreover, a margrave might expand his sovereign&#x27;s realm by conquering additional territory, sometimes more than he might retain as a personal domain, thus allowing him to endow his vassals with lands and resources in return for their loyalty to him; the consequent wealth and power might allow the establishment of a near-independent principality of his own.

Most marches and their margraves arose along the eastern borders of the Carolingian Empire and the successor Holy Roman Empire. The Breton Mark on the Atlantic Ocean and the border of peninsular Brittany and the on the Muslim frontier (including Catalonia) are notable exceptions. The Spanish March was most important during the early stages of the peninsular of Iberia: ambitious margraves based in the Pyrenees took advantage of the disarray in Muslim to extend their territories southward, leading to the establishment of the Christian kingdoms that would become unified Spain in the fifteenth century. The Crusaders created new and perilous borders susceptible to holy war against the Saracens; they thus had use for such border marches as the Greek Margraviate of Bodonitsa (1204–1414).

As territorial borders stabilised in the late Middle Ages, marches began to lose their primary military importance; but the entrenched families who held the office of margrave gradually converted their marches into hereditary fiefs, comparable in all but name to duchies. In an evolution similar to the rises of dukes, landgraves, counts palatine, and (ruling princes), these margraves became substantially independent rulers of states under the nominal overlordship of the Holy Roman Emperor.

Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV&#x27;s Golden Bull of 1356 recognized the Margrave of Brandenburg as an elector of the Empire. Possession of an electorate carried membership in the highest &quot;college&quot; within the Imperial Diet, the main prerogative of which was the right to elect, along with a few other powerful princes and prelates, the non-hereditary Emperor whenever death or abdication created a vacancy on the Imperial throne. became the nucleus of the House of Hohenzollern&#x27;s later Kingdom of Prussia and the springboard to their eventual accession as German Emperors in 1871.

Another original march also developed into one of the most powerful states in Central Europe: the Margraviate of Austria. Its rulers, the House of Habsburg, rose to obtain a monopoly on election to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. They also inherited several, mainly Eastern European and Burgundian, principalities. Austria was originally called in Latin, the &quot;eastern borderland&quot;, as (originally roughly the present Lower-) Austria formed the easternmost reach of the Holy Roman Empire, extending to the lands of the Magyars and the Slavs (since the 19th century, has been translated as by some Germanophones, though medieval documents attest only to the vernacular name ). Another march in southeast, Styria, still appears as in German today.

The margraves of Brandenburg and Meissen eventually became, respectively, the kings of (originally &#x27;in&#x27;) Prussia and Saxony.

== Rank ==
The title of margrave, no longer a military office, evolved into a rank in the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s nobility; higher than (count), it was equivalent to such associated compound titles as Landgrave, Palsgrave, and , yet remained lower than (duke) and even, officially, lower than .

A few nobles in southern Austria and northern Italy, whose suzerain was the Emperor, received from him the title of margrave, usually translated in Italian as marquis (): those who reigned as virtual sovereigns (Marquis of Mantua, Marquis of Montferrat, Marquis of Saluzzo, Marquis of Fosdinovo) exercised authority closer to the dynastic jurisdiction associated in modern Europe with the margrave, while some non-ruling nobles (e.g., Burgau, Pallavicini, Piatti) retained use of the margravial title but held the non-sovereign status of a &quot;marquis&quot;.

== Usage ==
By the 19th century, the sovereigns in Germany, Italy and Austria had all adopted &quot;higher&quot; titles, and not a single sovereign margraviate remained. Although the title remained part of the official style of such monarchs as the German Emperors, Kings of Saxony ,and Grand Dukes of Baden, it fell into desuetude as the primary title of members of any reigning family.

The children of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden by his second, morganatic wife, Luise Karoline Geyer von Geyersberg, only legally shared their mother&#x27;s title of &quot;Imperial Count von Hochberg&quot; from 1796, and were not officially elevated to the title of margrave until 1817 when they were publicly de-morganitised. But their father had allowed its use for his morganatic children at his own court in Karlsruhe from his assumption of the grand ducal crown in 1806, simultaneously according to the princely title to the dynastic sons of his first marriage. However, from 1817 his male-line descendants of both marriages were internationally recognised as entitled to the princely prefix, which all used henceforth.

The title of &quot;Margrave of Baden&quot; has been borne as a title of pretence only by the head of the House of Zähringen since the death of the last reigning Grand Duke, Frederick II, in 1928. Likewise, &quot;Margrave of Meissen&quot; is used as a title of pretence by the claimant to the Kingdom of Saxony since the death in exile of its last monarch, King Fredrick Augustus III, in 1932.

In 1914, the Imperial German Navy commissioned a dreadnought battleship &quot;SMS Markgraf&quot; named after this title. She fought in WWI and was interned and scuttled at Scapa Flow after the war.

== Translations ==
The etymological heir of the margrave in Europe&#x27;s nobilities is the marquis, also introduced in countries that never had any margraviates, such as the British marquess; their languages may use one or two words, e.g. French or . The &quot;margrave/marquis&quot; ranked below its nation&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;duke&quot; (Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Scandinavia, Spain) or of &quot;prince&quot; (Belgium, Italy), but above &quot;count&quot; or &quot;earl&quot;.

The wife of a margrave is a &quot;margravine&quot; ( in German, but in French). In Germany and Austria, where titles were borne by all descendants in the male line of the original grantee, men and women alike, each daughter was a as each son was a .

The title of &quot;margrave&quot; is translated below in languages which distinguish &quot;margrave&quot; from &quot;marquis&quot;, the latter being the English term for a Continental noble of rank equivalent to a British marquess. In languages which sometimes use &quot;marquis&quot; to translate &quot;margrave&quot;, that fact is indicated below in parentheses):
== Variations ==
* Several states have had analogous institutions, sometimes also rendered in English as &quot;margrave&quot;. For example, on England&#x27;s Celtic borders (Welsh Marches and Scottish Marches), Marcher Lords were vassals of the King of England, expected to help him defend and expand his realm. Such a lord&#x27;s demesne was called a &quot;march&quot; (compare the English county palatine). The Marcher Lords were a conspicuous exception to the general structure of English feudalism as set up by William the Conqueror, who made a considerable effort to avoid having too-powerful vassals with a big contiguous territory and a strong local power base; the needs of fighting the Welsh and Scots made it necessary to have exactly this kind of vassal in the Marches, who did develop their territorial ambitions (for example those of Chester).
* The late-medieval commanders, fiefholders, of Viborg Castle in Finland (see Fief of Viborg), the bulwark of the then-Swedish realm, at the border against Novgorod, did, in practice, function as &quot;margraves.&quot; They had feudal privileges and kept all of the crown&#x27;s income from the fief to use for the defence of the realm&#x27;s eastern border. Its fiefholders were (almost always) descended from, or married to, the noble family of from in Sweden.
* is an example of a town whose name comes from a margrave. Located in the Masurian region of East Prussia, was founded in 1560 by Albert, Duke of Prussia, Margrave of Brandenburg. It has since been renamed to the Polish .
* The German word also has other meanings than the margrave&#x27;s territorial border area, often with a territorial component, which occurs more numerously than &quot;margraviates&quot;; so its occurrence in composite place names does not necessarily imply that it was part of a &quot;margraviate&quot; as such. Uses of in German names are commonly more local, as in the context of a , which means a partially self-governing association of agricultural users of an area; the German name-component can also be a truncated form of &#x27;market&#x27;, as in the small town of in the area of Thuringia, meaning &#x27;market town on the river &#x27;. The non-margravial origin even applies to the County of Mark and the country of Denmark (meaning &#x27;march of the Danes&#x27;, in the sense of border area, yet never under a Margrave but the Danish national kingdom, outside the Holy Roman Empire).
* The Sassanid Persian position of ( means border, and means lord) or was a position given to officials or generals who were trusted by the king and that had land, villages, and towns in far reaches of the empire. In return for their position and privilege to collect taxes, they were responsible for defending the empire from foreign intrusion.
* The Byzantine Empire had a number of fortified passes in the mountainous frontier districts called or &quot;kleisarchy&quot;, particularly along its eastern border with the Caliphate, each headed by a who controlled access to inner lands. However an &quot;Exarch&quot; in the late Roman, early Eastern Roman Empire era, was the military commander and imperial governor of a region at the brink of the controlled territories, not an aristocratic lord in his own (hereditary) right.
* The Turkish title and position of (&quot;frontier lord&quot;), used in early Turkish Anatolia and during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, is also often rendered as &quot;margrave&quot;.
* The wife of a Margrave is called a Margravine.

<doc id="196476" wikidata="Q1141955" url="?curid=196476" title="Private Snafu">
<text>Private Snafu is the title character of a series of black-and-white American instructional adult animated shorts, ironic and humorous in tone, that were produced between 1943 and 1945 during World War II. The films were designed to instruct service personnel about security, proper sanitation habits, booby traps and other military subjects, and to improve troop morale. Primarily, they demonstrate the negative consequences of doing things wrong. The main character&#x27;s name is a play on the military slang acronym SNAFU, &quot;Situation Normal: All Fucked Up&quot;. (The cleaned-up version of that phrase, usually used on radio and in print, was &quot;Situation Normal: All Fouled Up&quot;.)

The series was directed by Chuck Jones and other prominent Hollywood animators, and the voice of Private Snafu was performed by Mel Blanc.

==Background==
The character was created by director Frank Capra, chairman of the U.S. Army Air Force First Motion Picture Unit, and most shorts were written by Theodor &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot; Geisel, Philip D. Eastman, and Munro Leaf. Although the United States Army gave Walt Disney the first crack at creating the cartoons, Leon Schlesinger of the Warner Bros. animation studio underbid Disney by two-thirds and won the contract. Disney had also demanded exclusive ownership of the character and merchandising rights.

The goal was to help enlisted men with weak literacy skills learn through animated cartoons (and also supplementary comic books). They featured simple language, racy illustrations, mild profanity, and subtle moralizing. Private Snafu did (almost) everything wrong, so that his negative example taught basic lessons about secrecy, disease prevention, and proper military protocols.

&quot;Private Snafu&quot; cartoons were a military secret—for the armed forces only. Surveys to ascertain the soldiers&#x27; film favorites showed that the &quot;Snafu&quot; cartoons usually rated highest or second highest. Each cartoon was produced in six weeks. The shorts were classified government documents. Martha Sigall, employed at the ink and paint department, recalled the government security measures imposed on the staff working on them. They had to be fingerprinted and given FBI security clearances; they also had to wear identification badges at work. Workers at the ink and paint department were given only ten cels at a time in an effort to prevent them from figuring out the story content.

The name &quot;Private Snafu&quot; comes from the unofficial military acronym SNAFU (&quot;Situation Normal: All Fucked Up&quot;), with the opening narrator in the first cartoon merely hinting at its usual meaning as &quot;Situation Normal, ... All &quot;Fouled&quot; Up!&quot;

==Content==


The shorts did not have to be submitted for approval at the Production Code Administration and so were not subject to the Motion Picture Production Code. Most of the &quot;Private Snafu&quot; shorts are educational, and although the War Department had to approve the storyboards, the Warner directors were allowed great latitude in order to keep the cartoons entertaining. Through his irresponsible behavior, Snafu demonstrates to soldiers what &quot;not&quot; to do while at war. In &quot;Private Snafu vs. Malaria Mike&quot;, for example, Snafu neglects to take his malaria medications or to use his repellent, allowing a suave mosquito to get him in the end—literally. In &quot;Gas&quot; Snafu throws away his gas mask and is almost killed by poison gas. In &quot;Spies&quot;, Snafu leaks classified information a little at a time until the Axis enemies piece it together, ambush his transport ship, and literally blow him to hell. Six of Snafu&#x27;s shorts actually end with him being killed due to his stupidity: &quot;Spies&quot; (blown up by enemy submarine torpedoes), &quot;Booby Traps&quot; (blown up by a bomb hidden inside a piano), &quot;The Goldbrick&quot; (run over by an enemy tank), &quot;A Lecture on Camouflage&quot; (large enemy bomb lands on him), &quot;Private Snafu vs. Malaria Mike&quot; (malaria), and &quot;Going Home&quot; (run over by a street car).

Nine of the &quot;Snafu&quot; shorts feature a character named Technical Fairy, First Class. The Technical Fairy is a crass, unshaven, cigar-smoking miniature G.I. whose fairy wings bear the insignia of a technical sergeant, and who wears only socks, shorts, and a uniform hat. When he appears, he grants Snafu&#x27;s wishes, most of which involve skipping protocol or trying to do things the quick and sloppy way. The results typically end in disaster, with the Technical Fairy teaching Snafu a valuable lesson about proper military procedure. For example, in the 1944 cartoon &quot;Snafuperman&quot;, the Technical Fairy transforms Private Snafu into the superhero Snafuperman, who takes bungling to a super-powered level through his carelessness.

Later in the war, however, Snafu&#x27;s antics became more like those of fellow Warner character Bugs Bunny, a savvy hero facing the enemy head-on. The cartoons were intended for an audience of soldiers (as part of the bi-weekly &quot;Army-Navy Screen Magazine&quot; newsreel), and so are quite risqué by 1940s standards, with minor cursing, bare-bottomed GIs, and plenty of scantily clad (and even semi-nude) women. The depictions of Japanese and Germans are hostile-comic, par for the course in wartime U.S.
The &quot;Snafu&quot; shorts are notable because they were produced during the Golden Age of Warner Bros. animation. Directors such as Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, and Frank Tashlin worked on them, and their characteristic styles are in top form. P. D. Eastman was a writer and storyboard artist for the Snafu shorts. Voice characterizations were provided by the celebrated Mel Blanc (Private Snafu&#x27;s voice was similar to Blanc&#x27;s Bugs Bunny characterization, and Bugs himself actually made cameos in the Snafu episodes &quot;Gas&quot; and &quot;Three Brothers&quot;). Toward the end of the war, other studios began producing Snafu shorts as well (the Army accused Schlesinger of padding his bills), though these were never filmed before the war ended. The Snafu films are also partly responsible for keeping the animation studios open during the war—by producing such training films, the studios were declared an essential industry.

The character has since made a couple of brief cameos: the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;Boot Camping&quot; has a character looking very much like Private Snafu, and the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;I Dated a Robot&quot; shows Private Snafu on the building-mounted video screen for a few seconds in the opening credits.


While Private Snafu was never officially a theatrical cartoon character when the series was launched in 1943 (with the debut short &quot;Coming! Snafu&quot;, directed by Chuck Jones), a proto-Snafu does appear, unnamed and in color, in Jones&#x27; cartoon &quot;The Draft Horse&quot;, released theatrically one year earlier, on May 9, 1942. This appearance would serve as the basis for Snafu&#x27;s character in the series.

The 24th film of the series, &quot;Going Home&quot;, produced in 1945, was never released. The premise is what damage could be done if a soldier on leave talks too much about his unit&#x27;s military operations. In the film, Snafu discusses a &quot;secret weapon&quot; with his girlfriend which was unnervingly (and unintentionally) similar to the atomic bombs under development.

In 1945, a series of cartoons for the Navy featuring Private Snafu&#x27;s brother &quot;Seaman Tarfu&quot; (for &quot;Things Are Really Fucked Up&quot;) was planned, but only one was produced before the war came to a close: &quot;Private Snafu Presents Seaman Tarfu in the Navy&quot;.

==Availability==
As now-declassified work of the United States government, all Private Snafu shorts are in the public domain and are thus freely available in numerous places, including on YouTube and Internet Archive.

Warner Home Video has begun including Private Snafu shorts as bonus material on their &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot;. Other commercial DVDs are available from Thunderbean Animation, who released a DVD containing all the Snafu cartoons entitled &quot;Private Snafu Golden Classics&quot;, and Bosko Video. The Private Snafu shorts were released on Blu-ray on November 19, 2015 by Thunderbean.

At least one of the Private Snafu shorts was used as an exhibit piece: the short &quot;Spies&quot; was used for the World War II exhibit at the International Spy Museum.

==Impact on children&#x27;s literature==
According to a postwar study of the &quot;Snafu&quot; cartoons, the wartime experiences of authors Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), Philip D. Eastman, and Munro Leaf shaped their successful postwar children&#x27;s books, especially the use of simple language, and some of the themes. Dr. Seuss wrote &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (1957) because Geisel believed the widely used Dick and Jane primers were too boring to encourage children to read. Geisel, Eastman, and Leaf authored books designed to promote personal responsibility, conservation, and respect for multiculturalism. Some racial characterisations are considered questionable today. Geisel&#x27;s characters were often portrayed as rebels who displayed independence of mind. Eastman&#x27;s characters, on the other hand, typically embraced the wisdom of authority figures. Leaf&#x27;s heroes were in between, and seemed more ambiguous toward independence and authority.

==Filmography==
=== Private Snafu ===
Note: All shorts were created by Warner Bros. Cartoons for the U.S. War Department unless otherwise noted. The films, being produced for the U.S. government, are in the public domain. 
=== &quot;A Few Quick Facts&quot; ===
In addition to his own shorts, Snafu made some cameo appearances in the &quot;Few Quick Facts&quot; series of Army-commissioned training films produced by other studios. 
In addition, &quot;Weapons of War&quot; (1945) was originally planned to be part of the &quot;Few Quick Facts&quot; series but was left out, while &quot;Another Change&quot; (1945) produced by Disney was probably also left out of the &quot;Few Quick Facts&quot; series.

==Similar cartoons==
While Private Snafu is well known for educating military soldiers, a few other similar series were produced for slightly different purposes. Produced by Walter Lantz Productions and later Warner Bros. Cartoons, Mr. Hook was created to encourage American Navy personnel to buy war bonds and hold them until the end of the war.

Also around the same time, Hugh Harman Productions created a short series called &quot;Commandments for Health&quot;, along with a character named Private McGillicuddy. McGillicuddy was a US Marine who shared similarities to Snafu (both even voiced by Mel Blanc), but this series has a much greater emphasis on health care. Because of the small budget, the shorts use limited animation, which had yet to be popularized by mainstream studios at the time.

Warner Bros. also produced a short entitled &quot;Dive Bombing Crashes,&quot; a cartoon made for a joint-series called Pilot Safety, featuring Grampaw Pettibone. Two shorts were known to be made, the second of which was produced by UPA.

Chuck Jones would later direct a 1955 cartoon entitled &quot;A Hitch In Time&quot;, a short made for the United States Air Force to encourage airmen to re-enlist. The lead character, John McRoger, bears strong resemblance to Snafu, albeit updated to Jones&#x27;s mid-1950s style, while he encounters Grogan, Technical Gremlin First Class, an updated version of the Technical Fairy from the WWII Snafu shorts.

<text>Faucigny (; ) is a commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France.

Historically, Faucigny was a region in Savoy which included the area of the modern &quot;département&quot; of Haute Savoie and the municipalities of Chamonix, Argentière, and Les Houches.

==Geography==
In the Faucigny region, the river Arve flows through the low-lying, agricultural Arve Valley. The village of Faucigny is at an elevation of approximately 639 m., northeast of La Roche-sur-Foron, and about 20 km. southeast of the city of Geneva. The village lies on a river terrace on the eastern side of the Arve Valley.

==History==
The fertile valley of the Arve and the area around Faucigny were already settled in neolithic times, and there are numerous Roman ruins. Legend suggests that the area was the estates of the Roman family Falcinius. It was known by various names in the Middle Ages: Falciniacum, Fociniacum and Fossiniacum, but the first documented name was Fulciniaco. Around 930 a castle was built on a rocky promontory overlooking the Arve. The castle was the regional governmental seat from the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries. The barons of Faucigny dominated the valley of the Arve and its tributary the Giffre, the Arly as far as Flumet, and the valley of Doron de Beaufort (Beaufortain). During this time, suzerainty over Faucigny was contested between the House of Savoy and the Dauphin de Viennois. In 1253, Pierre II of Savoy acquired Faucigny by marrying Agnès, the daughter of the Baron de Faucigny. Their daughter, Béatrix, inherited the province in 1268. Béatrix married Guigues VII and the lands came under the Dauphin de Viennois. Savoy fought to regain the Faucigny region, but was unsuccessful and Faucigny became part of France in 1349 as part of the purchase from Humbert II de La Tour du Pin, Dauphin de Viennois of the Dauphiné lands. Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, challenged this purchase and defeated the French in 1354. Then Faucigny was transferred to the House of Savoy as part of the peace Treaty of Paris (1355). Recently Faucigny has come up in the news again as twelve cars were burned in the 2005 French riots.

<doc id="196486" wikidata="Q541981" url="?curid=196486" title="William J. Donovan">
<text>William Joseph &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan (January 1, 1883 – February 8, 1959) was an American soldier, lawyer, intelligence officer and diplomat. He is best known for serving as the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), during World War II. He is regarded as the founding father of the CIA, and a statue of him stands in the lobby of the CIA headquarters building in Langley, Virginia.

A decorated veteran of World War I, Donovan is believed to be the only person to have been awarded all four of the following prestigious decorations: the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the National Security Medal. He is also a recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart, as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars.

==Early life==
Of Irish descent, Donovan was born in Buffalo, New York, to Anna Letitia &quot;Tish&quot; Donovan (née Lennon) and Timothy P. Donovan, both American-born children of Irish immigrants. The Lennons were from Ulster and the Donovans from County Cork. Donovan&#x27;s grandfather, Timothy O&#x27;Donovan Sr., was from the town of Skibbereen; raised by an uncle who was a parish priest, he married Donovan&#x27;s grandmother Mary Mahoney, who belonged to a propertied family of substantial means that disapproved of him. They first moved to Canada and then to Buffalo, where they dropped the &quot;O&quot; from their name. Donovan&#x27;s father, born in 1858, worked as the superintendent of a Buffalo railroad yard, as secretary for Holy Cross Cemetery, and attempted to engage in a political career with little success.

Donovan was born on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1883. (Named William, he chose his middle name, Joseph, at the time of his confirmation.) He had two younger brothers and two younger sisters who survived into adulthood and several additional younger siblings who died in infancy or childhood. &quot;From Anna&#x27;s side of the family came style and etiquette and the dreams of poets,&quot; Donovan&#x27;s biographer, Douglas Waller, wrote. &quot;From Tim came toughness and duty and honor to country and clan.&quot; Donovan attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Collegiate Institute, a Catholic institution at which he played football, acted in plays, and won an award for oratory. He went on to Niagara University, a Catholic university and seminary where he undertook a pre-law major. Considering the priesthood, he ultimately decided &quot;he wasn&#x27;t good enough to be a priest,&quot; although he did win another oratorical contest, this time with a speech warning of corrupt, anti-Christian forces that threatened the United States.

With the expectation of studying law, Donovan eventually transferred to Columbia University, where he looked beyond &quot;Catholic dogma&quot; and attended Protestant and Jewish worship services to decide whether he wanted to change religions. He joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, rowed on varsity crew, again won a prize for oratory, was a campus football hero, and was voted the &quot;most modest&quot; and one of the &quot;handsomest&quot; members of the graduating class of 1905.

After earning his bachelor of arts, Donovan spent two years at Columbia Law School, where he was a classmate of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and studied under Harlan Fiske Stone. Returning to Buffalo, he joined the respected law firm of Love &amp; Keating in 1909 and, two years later, opened his own Buffalo firm in partnership with a Columbia classmate, Bradley Goodyear. In 1914, their firm merged with another, becoming Goodyear &amp; O&#x27;Brien. In 1912, Donovan helped form, and became the leader of, a troop of cavalry of the New York National Guard. This unit was mobilized in 1916 and served on the U.S.–Mexico border during the American government&#x27;s campaign against Pancho Villa. He studied military strategy and combat tactics. He also took acting courses in New York City from a stage star of the day, Eleanor Robson. In 1914, he married Ruth Rumsey, a Buffalo heiress who had attended Rosemary Hall.

In 1916, Donovan spent several months in Berlin on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation, seeking to persuade the governments of Britain and Germany to allow the shipment of food and clothing into Belgium, Serbia, and Poland. In July of that year, at the behest of the State Department, he returned to the U.S. and took his cavalry troop to the Texas border to join Brigadier General John J. Pershing&#x27;s army in the hunt for Pancho Villa. Promoted to major in the field, he returned to Buffalo, then joined the 69th Regiment, also known as the &quot;Fighting Irish Regiment&quot;. This was the same 69th of Civil War fame, later called the 165th, which was training for America&#x27;s expected entry into World War I, and which became part of the 42nd Division, also known as the &quot;Rainbow Division&quot;. Douglas MacArthur was the 42nd Division&#x27;s chief of staff. Donovan&#x27;s son David was born in 1915, and a daughter, Patricia, was born in 1917. (Patricia died in an accident in 1940.)

==World War I==
During World War I, Major Donovan led the 1st battalion, 165th Infantry of the 42nd Division. Serving in France, he suffered a shrapnel wound in one leg and was almost blinded by gas. After performing a rescue under fire, he was offered the Croix de Guerre, but turned it down because a Jewish soldier who had taken part in the rescue had not also been awarded the honor. When this insult was corrected, Donovan accepted the distinction. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for leading an assault during the Aisne-Marne campaign, in which hundreds of members of his regiment died, including his acting adjutant, the poet Joyce Kilmer. The 1940 James Cagney movie, &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, dramatised the events of this battle and the 69th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s role in it.

Donovan&#x27;s remarkable level of endurance, which far exceeded that of the much younger soldiers under his command, led those men to give him the nickname &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, which stuck with him for the rest of his life. Although he &quot;professed annoyance with the nickname&quot;, his wife &quot;knew that deep down he loved it&quot;.

Assigned commanding officer of the 165th Regiment, Donovan fought in another battle that took place near Landres-et-Saint-Georges on October 14–15, 1918. Going into battle, Donovan &quot;ignored the officers&#x27; custom of covering or stripping off insignia of rank (targets for snipers) and instead sallied forth wearing his medals&quot;, according to Evan Thomas. &quot;They can&#x27;t hit me and they won&#x27;t hit you!&quot; he told his men. Struck in the knee by a bullet, he &quot;refused to be evacuated and continued to direct his men until even American tanks were turning back under withering German fire&quot;. After lobbying by his friend, Father Francis P. Duffy, a famous and widely revered Army chaplain, Donovan was awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster of the Distinguished Service Cross (i.e., a second DSC) for his service in that battle. After the Armistice of November 11, 1918, Donovan remained in Europe as part of the occupation. On returning to New York in April 1919, Donovan, now a colonel, was widely discussed as a possible candidate for governor, but he rejected the idea, proclaiming his intention to return to Buffalo and resume the practice of law.

Army Distinguished Service Medal
AWARDED FOR ACTIONS
DURING World War I

Service: Army

GENERAL ORDERS:
War Department, General Orders No. 43 (1922)

CITATION:
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Colonel (Infantry) William Joseph &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan (ASN: 0-102383), United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. As Battalion Commander of the 165th Infantry Regiment, 42d Division, during its operations in the Baccarat Sector from 28 to 31 July 1918, Colonel Donovan demonstrated high professional attainments and marked ability. He displayed conspicuous energy and most efficient leadership in the advance of his battalion across the Ourcq River and the capture of strong enemy positions. In October 1918, as Lieutenant Colonel he commanded the same regiment with marked success and distinction in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. His devotion to duty, heroism, and pronounced qualities of a commander enabled him to successfully accomplish all missions assigned to him in this important operation. From 3 January to 3 March 1919, as Inspector Instructor, Provost Marshall General&#x27;s Department, he rendered services of great value to the American Expeditionary Forces.
==Interwar years==

Following his return to the U.S., Donovan took his wife on a combined vacation, business trip, and intelligence mission to Japan, China, and Korea, then went on alone to Siberia during the Russian Civil War. He went back to work at his law firm, but also took an extensive journey to Europe, where he did business on behalf of J. P. Morgan and gathered intelligence about international Communism.

From 1922 to 1924, while maintaining his private law practice, he also served as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York. A high point came in 1923, when, as a result of continued pressure from Father Duffy, Donovan was finally awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic acts in the battle at Landres-et-Saint-Georges. Presented with the medal at a New York City ceremony that was attended by about four thousand veterans, Donovan refused to keep it, saying that it belonged not to him but &quot;to the boys who are not here, the boys who are resting under the white crosses in France or in the cemeteries of New York, also to the boys who were lucky enough to come through.

As US Attorney, he was becoming well known as a vigorous crime-fighter. He was especially famous (and, in some circles, notorious) for his energetic enforcement of Prohibition. There were a number of threats to assassinate him and to dynamite his home, but he was not deterred. The climax of his war on alcohol came in August 1923, when his agents raided Buffalo&#x27;s upmarket Saturn Club (of which Donovan himself was a member) and confiscated large amounts of illegal liquor. The club&#x27;s members, who formed much of the city&#x27;s upper crust, were outraged, having assumed that Prohibition did not apply to people such as themselves. Some regarded Donovan as a traitor to their class, and recalled that Donovan had not, after all, been born to high station but was, in fact, an Irish Catholic who had married into the world of privileged, professional Protestants. Donovan&#x27;s law partner, Goodyear, quit their firm in anger over the raid, and Donovan&#x27;s own wife never forgave him for it. Many working class residents of Buffalo cheered the raid as an example of equal justice under the law, however.

In 1924, when President Calvin Coolidge cleaned house at the Department of Justice in the wake of the late President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s Teapot Dome scandal, he appointed Donovan&#x27;s former professor Harlan Stone as Attorney General and named Donovan as Stone&#x27;s assistant, in charge of the criminal division. Donovan and his wife split their time between Washington and Buffalo, where he continued to run his law firm. At the Justice Department, Donovan hired women and eschewed yes-men. He and his wife became a popular Washington couple, although Donovan&#x27;s relationship with the acting Director of the Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, briefly one of his underlings, was fraught with friction.

When Stone was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1925, Donovan was put in charge of the Department of Justice&#x27;s antitrust division, often serving as &quot;de facto&quot; Attorney General during the frequent absences of Stone&#x27;s successor, John Garibaldi Sargent. Donovan was admired for his energetic and effective arguments before the Supreme Court, and was a favorite off-the-record source for the Washington press corps. He was talked up as a possible candidate for Governor of New York in 1926 and for the Vice Presidency in 1928; Herbert Hoover promised to make him Attorney General if Hoover won the Presidency in 1928, but instead, under the influence of anti-Catholic Southerners, among others, Hoover ended up offering him the governorship of the Philippines, a post Donovan turned down.

Resigning from the Department of Justice in 1929, Donovan moved to New York City and formed a new law firm, Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine, in partnership with Frank Raichle. Despite the stock market crash, he made a success of handling many of the mergers and acquisitions and bankruptcies that then resulted; he also acquired celebrity clients, such as Mae West and Jane Wyman.

Donovan ran on the Republican line in the 1932 state election to succeed Franklin D. Roosevelt as Governor of New York. Assisting Donovan in his campaign was journalist James J. Montague, who served as &quot;personal adviser and campaign critic&quot;. But despite Donovan&#x27;s offstage charm and force, he proved to be an uninspiring campaigner on the stump. He ran a disorganized, strategy-free campaign, and in the end lost to the Democratic nominee, Herbert Lehman.

==World War II==
During the interwar years, as &quot;part of an informal network of American businessmen and lawyers who closely tracked and collected intelligence on foreign affairs,&quot; Donovan traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, &quot;establishing himself as a player in international affairs – and honing his skills as an intelligence gatherer overseas.&quot; He met with such foreign leaders as Benito Mussolini, with whom he discussed World War I, the expansionist ideology of Italian Fascism, and Roosevelt&#x27;s prospects for re-election in 1936. Mussolini granted Donovan permission to visit the Italian front in Ethiopia, where he found Italy&#x27;s military much improved since the war and predicted an Italian victory. Donovan also made connections with leading figures in Nazi Germany. But he was no friend of the dictators, publicly assailing Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin as totalitarians and taking steps to protect his Jewish clients in Europe from the Nazis.

Donovan openly believed during this time that a second major European war was inevitable. His foreign experience and realism earned him the friendship of President Roosevelt, notwithstanding their extreme differences in domestic policy and despite the fact that Donovan, during the 1932 election campaign, had harshly criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s record as Governor of New York. The two men were from opposing political parties, but were similar in personality. Roosevelt respected Donovan&#x27;s experience, felt that Hoover had done Donovan wrong on the Attorney General appointment, and believed that if Donovan had been a Democrat he could have been elected president. Also, Donovan&#x27;s national profile had risen considerably thanks to the 1940 Warner Brothers film &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, in which Pat O&#x27;Brien played Father Duffy and George Brent played Donovan, and Roosevelt recognized a useful opportunity to exploit Donovan&#x27;s newfound popularity. As the two men began exchanging notes about developments abroad, Roosevelt recognized that Donovan could be an important ally and adviser.

Roosevelt came to place great value on Donovan&#x27;s insight. Following Germany&#x27;s and the USSR&#x27;s invasions of Poland in September 1939 and the start of World War II in Europe, President Roosevelt began to put the United States on a war footing. This was a crisis of the sort that Donovan had predicted, and he sought out a responsible place in the wartime infrastructure. On the recommendation of Donovan&#x27;s friend, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, Roosevelt gave him a number of increasingly important assignments. In 1940 and 1941, Donovan traveled as an informal emissary to Britain, where he was urged by Knox and Roosevelt to gauge Britain&#x27;s ability to withstand Germany&#x27;s aggression.

During these trips, Donovan met with key officials in the British war effort, including Winston Churchill and the directors of Britain&#x27;s intelligence services. He also had lunch with King George VI. Donovan and Churchill got along famously, sharing war stories and reciting in unison the nineteenth-century poem &quot;The Cavalier&#x27;s Song&quot; by William Motherwell. Impressed by Donovan and cheered by his eagerness to help Britain, Churchill ordered that he be given unlimited access to classified information. Donovan returned to the U.S. confident of Britain&#x27;s chances and enamored of the possibility of founding an American intelligence service modeled on that of the British. He strongly urged Roosevelt to give Churchill the aid he requested. Roosevelt wanted to provide such aid, and asked Donovan to use his knowledge of the law to figure out how to skirt the congressional ban on selling armaments to the United Kingdom.

British diplomats, who shared Churchill&#x27;s admiration for Donovan, expressed the wish to State Department officials that Donovan replace U.S. Ambassador to Britain Joseph P. Kennedy, who favored the appeasers and was defeatist regarding British prospects. In the view of Walter Lippmann, a political columnist, Donovan&#x27;s findings about Britain&#x27;s fighting capability &quot;almost singlehandedly overcame the unmitigated defeatism which was paralyzing Washington.&quot; Donovan also examined U.S. naval defenses in the Pacific (which he found wanting) and visited several countries along the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, serving as an unofficial envoy for both the U.S. and Britain and urging leaders there to stand up to the Nazis. He also met frequently in New York with British Security Co-ordination head William Stephenson, a spy for MI6 who was known as &quot;Intrepid&quot;, and Stephenson&#x27;s deputy, Australian-born MI6 intelligence officer Dick Ellis, who has been credited with writing the blueprint for Donovan&#x27;s new American intelligence agency.

Donovan and Stephenson, according to Thomas, &quot;eventually became so close that they were known as &#x27;Big Bill&#x27; and &#x27;Little Bill&#x27;.&quot; Donovan, Waller has said, &quot;could not have formed the OSS without the British, who provided intelligence, trainers, organizational charts and advice – all with the idea of making OSS an adjunct to British intelligence. But Donovan wanted to mount his own operations.&quot;

According to Ellis, quoted in his biography by British-Australian author Jesse Fink: ‘I was soon requested to draft a blueprint for an American intelligence agency, the equivalent of BSC [British Security Co-ordination] and based on these British wartime improvisations... detailed tables of organisation were disclosed to Washington... among these were the organisational tables that led to the birth of General William Donovan’s OSS.’

Said United States Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle: ‘The really active head of the intelligence section in [William] Donovan’s [OSS] group is [Ellis] . . . in other words, [Stephenson’s] assistant in the British intelligence [sic] is running Donovan’s intelligence service.’&quot;

===OSS===

On July 11, 1941, Roosevelt signed an order naming Donovan Coordinator of Information (COI). &quot;At the time,&quot; Thomas wrote, &quot;the U.S. government had no formal spy agency. In 1929, the Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, had abolished the highly effective Black Chamber, a code-breaking organization left over from World War I.&quot; In Stimson&#x27;s view, &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; The Army, Navy, FBI, State Department, and other entities all ran their own intelligence units, but they were feeble and isolated from one another. They also saw Donovan&#x27;s new operation as a threat to their turfs.

Nevertheless, Donovan began to lay the groundwork for a centralized intelligence program. Working closely with Dick Ellis, it was he who organized the COI&#x27;s New York headquarters in Room 3603 of Rockefeller Center in October 1941 and asked Allen Dulles to head it; the offices Dulles took were on the floor immediately above the location of the operations of Britain&#x27;s MI6. Thomas has described the OSS as an &quot;informal&quot; and &quot;freewheeling&quot; place where &quot;[r]ank meant little.&quot; David Bruce later recalled: &quot;Woe to the officer who turned down a project because, on its face, it seemed ridiculous or at least unusual  ... His [referring to the ideal officers in the OSS, contrasting with the aforementioned officers, who turned down such projects] imagination was unlimited. Ideas were his plaything. Excitement made him snort like a race horse.&quot; Throughout the war, the OSS would endure criticism by segments of the U.S. media and by many highly placed figures in the U.S. government and military. General George Marshall was an early critic but later changed his mind. Eisenhower was always supportive, as was General George Patton.

On December 7, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Donovan met privately with Roosevelt and Edward R. Murrow, and FDR told Donovan, apropos of the COI, &quot;It&#x27;s a good thing you got me started on this.&quot; When Hitler gave a speech declaring war on the United States, he mentioned Donovan, whom he called &quot;utterly unworthy&quot;. Donovan urged Roosevelt not to intern Japanese-Americans, warning that such an action would address a problem that did not exist, do harm to loyal Americans, and provide the Japanese with ammunition for their propaganda.

Donovan set up espionage and sabotage schools, established front companies, arranged clandestine collaborations with international corporations and the Vatican, and oversaw the invention of new, espionage-friendly guns, cameras, and bombs. Donovan also recruited agents, selecting individuals with a wide range of backgrounds – ranging from intellectuals and artists to people with criminal backgrounds. He hired a great many female spies, dismissing criticism by those who felt women were unsuited to such work. Among his prominent recruits were film director John Ford, actor Sterling Hayden, author Stephen Vincent Benét, and Eve Curie, daughter of the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie. Other OSS recruits included poet Archibald MacLeish, banker Paul Mellon, businessman Alfred V. du Pont (son of industrialist Alfred I. du Pont), chef Julia Child, psychologist Carl Jung (who helped with the effort to analyze the psyches of Hitler and other Nazi leaders), author Walter Lord, and members of the Auchincloss and Vanderbilt families. There were so many aristocrats in the agency that the joke went around that OSS stood for &quot;Oh So Social&quot;.

In 1942, the COI ceased being a White House operation and was placed under the aegis of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Roosevelt also changed its name to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Donovan was returned to active duty in the U.S. Army in his World War I rank of colonel. He was promoted to brigadier general in March 1943 and to major general in November 1944. Under his leadership the OSS would eventually conduct successful espionage and sabotage operations in Europe and parts of Asia, but continued to be kept out of South America owing to Hoover&#x27;s hostility to Donovan, which also had a deleterious impact on efforts to share information between the two agencies. In addition, the OSS was blocked from the Philippines by the antipathy of General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the Southwest Pacific Theater. OSS espionage and other on-site activities helped prepare the ground for the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa, however, and Donovan himself took part in the Allied landing at Salerno, Italy, on September 3, 1943, and at the Anzio landing on January 22, 1944.

Donovan was in fact very active in virtually every theater of World War II. He spent a good deal of time in the Balkans, to which he had urged both Roosevelt and Churchill to pay more attention. He met in Europe with highly placed anti-Nazi Germans to broker an early peace that would allow for occupation by the Western Allies, establish a democratic Germany, and leave the Soviets out in the cold. In China, he struggled with Chiang Kai-shek and his underlings for permission to carry out espionage activities in their territory. He inspected OSS operations in Burma, met with Vyacheslav Molotov in Moscow to arrange for cooperation between the OSS and NKVD, and was present for MacArthur&#x27;s successful April 1944 invasion of Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea. Overall, the OSS was most effective in the Balkans, China, Burma, and France.

By 1943, Donovan&#x27;s relations with British officials were becoming increasingly strained as a result of turf wars, strategic and tactical disagreements, radical differences in style and temperament (the British accused the OSS of playing &quot;cowboys and red Indians&quot;), and contrasting visions of the postwar world. (The British wanted to retain their empire; Donovan saw the empire, at least in some instances, as an impediment to democracy and economic development.) MI6 chief Stewart Menzies was extremely hostile towards the idea of OSS operations anywhere in the British Empire, and categorically forbade the OSS to operate within the UK, or to deal with allied governments in exile which were based in London. Nonetheless, as of May 1944, Donovan had &quot;some eleven thousand American officers and foreign agents scattered in every important capital.&quot; During the war he also received intelligence from a network of Catholic priests across Europe who engaged in espionage without the Pope&#x27;s knowledge.

On D-Day, Donovan was on one of the ships that took part in the Normandy landing. Going ashore, he and his commander of covert operations in Europe, Colonel David K. E. Bruce, were shot at by a German plane, then moved on toward the American front lines and encountered German machine-gun fire. As they lay on the ground, Bruce later recalled, Donovan said, &quot;David, we mustn&#x27;t be captured. We know too much.&quot; Donovan said that he had two suicide pills, but then discovered he didn&#x27;t. &quot;I must shoot first,&quot; Donovan said. Bruce replied, &quot;Yes, sir, but can we do much against machine guns with our pistols?&quot; Donovan explained: &quot;Oh, you don&#x27;t understand. I mean, if we are about to be captured, I&#x27;ll shoot you first. After all, I am your commanding officer.&quot;

Eventually, they found their way to General Omar Bradley&#x27;s newly set-up tent headquarters on the beach. Upon returning to Washington, Donovan reported directly to Roosevelt on what he had observed. The success of the invasion, he said, showed that German naval and air forces were definitely no longer &quot;Big League&quot; and that &quot;something has died in the German machine. Before the month was over, he was in Italy, implementing reforms in the OSS operation in that theater. He also met with Pope Pius XII, telling him about the activities of intelligence agents working out of the Japanese embassy at the Vatican. During the weeks leading up to the Valkyrie plot to kill Hitler, Dulles, Donovan&#x27;s man in Switzerland, who was in contact with the plotters, kept him abreast of developments.

A particular triumph for the OSS was the role it played in conveying intelligence from southern France in the run-up to the Allied landing on the French Riviera on August 15, 1944. Thanks to Donovan&#x27;s spies, said Colonel William Wilson Quinn, the invading army &quot;knew everything about that beach and where every German was.&quot; Donovan was present for that invasion, too, after which he returned to Rome for a secret meeting with Hitler&#x27;s envoy to the Vatican, Ernst von Weizsäcker. Shortly afterwards, he met with Marshal Tito to discuss OSS operations in Yugoslavia. Also in August 1944, Donovan came into conflict with Churchill over the OSS&#x27;s support for Greek anti-royalists.

In the closing days of the war in Europe, Donovan spent much of his time in London, where he worked out of a command center that took up an entire floor of Claridge&#x27;s Hotel. He fielded reports from across the continent, where the Wehrmacht was in such chaos that he &quot;knew their positions on the battlefield better than German generals did.&quot; In one of many initiatives, he sent out &quot;teams of French, Danish, Norwegian, and Polish nationals&quot; to identify Gestapo officers who had tortured them and who now were trying to blend in with civilians in Allied-controlled areas of Germany. Acting on Donovan&#x27;s orders, Dulles oversaw the surrender of the remaining Nazi forces in Italy several days in advance of the final German capitulation.

===Postwar plans===
As World War II began to wind to a close in early 1945, Donovan began to focus on preserving the OSS beyond the end of the war. A February 19 article in the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; revealed his plans for a postwar intelligence agency and published a secret memo he had sent to Roosevelt proposing its creation. The article compared the proposed agency to the Gestapo. Knowing that Americans wanted a smaller federal government after the war, Roosevelt was not entirely sold on Donovan&#x27;s proposal, although Donovan felt reasonably confident he could talk the president into the idea. Hoover disapproved of Donovan&#x27;s plan, which he saw as a direct threat to FBI authority, even though Donovan had stressed that his agency would operate only abroad, not domestically. After Roosevelt&#x27;s death in April, however, Donovan&#x27;s political position was substantially weakened. Although he argued forcefully for the OSS&#x27;s retention, he found himself opposed by the new president, Harry S. Truman. While the OSS got &quot;glowing reviews&quot; from many wartime commanders, notably Eisenhower, who described its contributions as &quot;vital&quot;, critics dismissed it as &quot;an arm of British intelligence&quot; and, like the Times-Herald reporter, painted dark pictures of it as an American Gestapo in the making.

===Nuremberg trials===
While British authorities and the US military and State Department were relatively indifferent to the question of trying war criminals after the war, Donovan was lobbying Roosevelt as early as October 1943 to arrange for such prosecutions. Roosevelt tasked Donovan with looking into the legalities and technicalities, and in the months that followed Donovan collected testimonies about war criminals and related information from a wide range of sources. In addition to seeking justice, Donovan wanted to exact retribution for the torture and killing of OSS agents. When Truman named Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson to serve as chief U.S. counsel in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals, Jackson, discovering that the OSS was the only agency that had seriously explored the issue, invited Donovan to join his trial staff.

On May 17, 1945, Donovan flew to Europe to prepare for the prosecutions, and eventually brought 172 OSS officers onto Jackson&#x27;s team, interviewing Auschwitz survivors, tracking down SS and Gestapo documents, and uncovering other evidence. Donovan, whose idea it was to hold the trials in Nuremberg, also introduced Jackson to useful foreign officials and even released OSS funds to bankroll the prosecution effort. Eventually, Jackson, who had been a political rival of Donovan&#x27;s in New York State, considered him a &quot;godsend&quot;; in return for Donovan&#x27;s help, but also because the OSS had proven &quot;vital for the prosecution team,&quot; Jackson lobbied Truman in person to approve of Donovan&#x27;s plans for a permanent postwar intelligence agency. The effort was unsuccessful, however. On September 20, 1945, Truman signed an executive order abolishing the OSS.

As was only revealed 60 years later, Donovan succeeded in getting the Americans to block the Soviet attempt to add the Katyn massacre to the list of German war crimes. He had been convinced by the German opponent of Hitler, Fabian von Schlabrendorff, unofficially included on his staff, that it was not the Germans but the Soviet secret service NKVD that had murdered some 4,000 Polish officers in the Katyn forest. But shortly afterwards Donovan came into conflict with Jackson.

In Nuremberg, Donovan interrogated many prisoners, including Hermann Göring, whom he spoke with ten times. But eventually Donovan fell out with Jackson. The latter wanted to indict the entire German High Command, not just men who had personally ordered or committed war crimes; Donovan considered this a violation of American principles of fairness. Donovan, a former prosecutor, also criticized Jackson&#x27;s lack of skill and experience at putting together a strong case and at courtroom examination and cross-examination. Jackson removed him from the team, and Donovan returned to the U.S., where in January 1946 Truman presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal.

===CIA===
In 1946, Donovan resumed the practice of law and began writing a history of American intelligence since the Revolutionary War – a book he never completed. He traveled extensively in Europe and Asia and ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the US Senate.

He also became chairman of the newly founded American Committee on United Europe (ACUE), which worked to counter the new Communist threat to Europe (→ Cold War) by promoting European political unity. The vice-chairman was Dulles, and Walter Bedell Smith sat on the board as well. The ACUE financed the European Movement, the most important federalist organization in the immediate postwar years. (In 1958, the ACUE provided 53.5% of the movement&#x27;s funds.) In addition, the ACUE provided all of the funding for the European Youth Campaign, in which Joseph Retinger, Robert Schuman, and Paul-Henri Spaak were involved.
Meanwhile, Truman moved forward with plans for a new intelligence agency, finally giving approval in 1946 for a watered-down interdepartmental &quot;Central Intelligence Group.&quot; Donovan warned that it would be ineffectual – he compared it to a &quot;debating society&quot; – and he soon proved to be right. As the Cold War quickly intensified, Truman recognized the need for a far stronger intelligence service, and in February 1947 asked Congress to approve plans for a Central Intelligence Agency along the lines Donovan had proposed. Donovan himself lobbied Congress privately to pass the enabling legislation, the National Security Act of 1947. It was, in Waller&#x27;s words, &quot;a vindication of Donovan&#x27;s vision&quot;. Among the OSS members who went on to become major CIA figures were Dulles, William Casey, William Colby, and James Jesus Angleton.

Donovan wanted to lead the CIA, and had many supporters who urged Truman to put him in charge. Instead, the president gave the job to Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, whom Waller described as &quot;lackluster&quot;. Meanwhile, Donovan accepted a Truman appointment to head a committee studying the country&#x27;s fire departments. But he worked behind the scenes to aid in the formation of the CIA, recommending that Hillenkoetter hire Dulles and other OSS veterans, suggesting various covert operations, and sharing contacts and information from behind the Iron Curtain. After returning from abroad, U.S. businessmen and ambassadors passed information to Donovan that he shared with the CIA. Instead of being grateful for Donovan&#x27;s help, Truman was furious, considering him an intrusive meddler. In the 1952 presidential election, Donovan campaigned for Eisenhower, who had become a good friend since the war. After his victory, Donovan hoped to be named CIA head, but instead Eisenhower appointed Dulles, whose brother, John Foster Dulles, was the new Secretary of State. Eisenhower offered to make Donovan the Ambassador to France, but Donovan turned down the offer, not wanting to work closely with John Foster Dulles, for whom he had little respect. In August 1953, however, he did accept the post of Ambassador to Thailand, because the country was an important Cold War front and the position was one in which he felt he could operate with relative independence from Secretary Dulles.

Donovan took up that post on September 4. While in Thailand, he frequently traveled to Vietnam, which he thought could become a communist country, a possibility he felt the U.S. ambassador to that country, Donald Heath, lacked the energy and vision to prevent. One source says that he &quot;was deeply involved in setting up C.I.A. operations in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia.&quot; Although his performance as ambassador received glowing reviews from the Thai government, he resigned from his position effective August 21, 1954.

After returning to the U.S., he resumed his law practice and registered as a lobbyist for the Thai government. Eisenhower made him chairman of the People to People Foundation, a group that arranged international citizen exchanges; Donovan also worked with the International Rescue Committee, co-founded American Friends of Vietnam, and in 1956 raised a large sum of money for Hungarians who fled their country after the Soviet Army had crushed the Hungarian Revolution.

==Death and legacy==

Donovan had begun experiencing symptoms of dementia while in Thailand, and he was hospitalized in 1957. While in the hospital, he &quot;imagined he saw the Red Army coming over the 59th Street bridge, into Manhattan, and in one memorable last mission, fled the hospital, wandering down the street in his pajamas.&quot; Shortly before his death, he was visited by Eisenhower, who later told a friend that Donovan was &quot;the last hero&quot;.

Donovan died at the age of 76 from complications of vascular dementia on February 8, 1959, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Upon learning of his death, the CIA sent a cable to its station chiefs: &quot;The man more responsible than any other for the existence of the Central Intelligence Agency has passed away.&quot; He is buried in Section 2 of Arlington National Cemetery. After his death, Donovan was awarded the Freedom Award of the International Rescue Committee. The law firm he founded, Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine, was dissolved in 1998. His home in Chapel Hill near Berryville, Virginia, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

In 2011, it was suggested that a new federal courthouse in Buffalo be named after Donovan, but, instead, it was named after Robert H. Jackson, his rival prosecutor at Nuremberg. In 2014, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer asked the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to name an upstate New York cemetery after Donovan. In 2016, however, the VA decided against using Donovan&#x27;s name. &quot;It is outrageous that nothing has been done to honor Gen. Donovan, one of America&#x27;s greatest patriots, in Buffalo or western New York,&quot; declared Charles Pinck, president of the OSS Society, who had thought the naming of the cemetery after Donovan was &quot;a done deal&quot;.

Donovan is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame. He is also known as the &quot;Father of American Intelligence&quot; and the &quot;Father of Central Intelligence&quot;. &quot;The Central Intelligence Agency regards Donovan as its founding father,&quot; according to Thomas in a 2011 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; profile. The George Bush Center for Intelligence, the CIA headquarters building in Langley, Virginia, has a statue of Donovan in the lobby. Thomas observed that Donovan&#x27;s &quot;exploits are utterly improbable but by now well documented in declassified wartime records that portray a brave, noble, headlong, gleeful, sometimes outrageous pursuit of action and skulduggery.&quot;

===William J. Donovan Award===
The William J. Donovan Award was created by the OSS Society, which was founded by Donovan in 1947. The award is presented by the OSS Society to &quot;someone who has exemplified the distinguishing features that characterized General Donovan&#x27;s lifetime of public service to the United of States of America as a citizen and a soldier&quot;. Notable recipients include Allen W. Dulles, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Margaret Thatcher, President George H. W. Bush, and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Gina Haspel.

==Personal life==
Donovan&#x27;s son, David Rumsey Donovan, was a naval officer who served with distinction in World War II. His grandson, William James Donovan, served as an enlisted soldier in Vietnam and is also buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="196493" wikidata="Q427087" url="?curid=196493" title="Non-coding RNA">
<text>A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. The DNA sequence from which a functional non-coding RNA is transcribed is often called an RNA gene. Abundant and functionally important types of non-coding RNAs include transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), as well as small RNAs such as microRNAs, siRNAs, piRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, scaRNAs and the long ncRNAs such as Xist and HOTAIR.

The number of non-coding RNAs within the human genome is unknown; however, recent transcriptomic and bioinformatic studies suggest that there are thousands of non-coding transcripts. 
Many of the newly identified ncRNAs have unknown functions, if any. 
There is no consensus on how much of non-coding transcription is functional: some believe most ncRNAs to be non-functional &quot;junk RNA&quot;, spurious transcriptions, while others expect that many non-coding transcripts have functions to be discovered. 

==History and discovery==

Nucleic acids were first discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, and by 1939, RNA had been implicated in protein synthesis. Two decades later, Francis Crick predicted a functional RNA component which mediated translation; he reasoned that RNA is better suited to base-pair with an mRNA transcript than a pure polypeptide.
The first non-coding RNA to be characterised was an alanine tRNA found in baker&#x27;s yeast, its structure was published in 1965. To produce a purified alanine tRNA sample, Robert W. Holley &quot;et al.&quot; used 140kg of commercial baker&#x27;s yeast to give just 1g of purified tRNAAla for analysis. The 80 nucleotide tRNA was sequenced by first being digested with Pancreatic ribonuclease (producing fragments ending in Cytosine or Uridine) and then with takadiastase ribonuclease Tl (producing fragments which finished with Guanosine). Chromatography and identification of the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends then helped arrange the fragments to establish the RNA sequence. Of the three structures originally proposed for this tRNA, the &#x27;cloverleaf&#x27; structure was independently proposed in several following publications. The cloverleaf secondary structure was finalised following X-ray crystallography analysis performed by two independent research groups in 1974.

Ribosomal RNA was next to be discovered, followed by URNA in the early 1980s. Since then, the discovery of new non-coding RNAs has continued with snoRNAs, Xist, CRISPR and many more. Recent notable additions include riboswitches and miRNA; the discovery of the RNAi mechanism associated with the latter earned Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Recent discoveries of ncRNAs have been achieved through both experimental and bioinformatic methods.

==Biological roles==

Noncoding RNAs belong to several groups and are involved in many cellular processes. These range from ncRNAs of central importance that are conserved across all or most cellular life through to more transient ncRNAs specific to one or a few closely related species. The more conserved ncRNAs are thought to be molecular fossils or relics from the last universal common ancestor and the RNA world, and their current roles remain mostly in regulation of information flow from DNA to protein.

===In translation===
Many of the conserved, essential and abundant ncRNAs are involved in translation. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles called ribosomes are the &#x27;factories&#x27; where translation takes place in the cell. The ribosome consists of more than 60% ribosomal RNA; these are made up of 3 ncRNAs in prokaryotes and 4 ncRNAs in eukaryotes. Ribosomal RNAs catalyse the translation of nucleotide sequences to protein. Another set of ncRNAs, Transfer RNAs, form an &#x27;adaptor molecule&#x27; between mRNA and protein. The H/ACA box and C/D box snoRNAs are ncRNAs found in archaea and eukaryotes. RNase MRP is restricted to eukaryotes. Both groups of ncRNA are involved in the maturation of rRNA. The snoRNAs guide covalent modifications of rRNA, tRNA and snRNAs; RNase MRP cleaves the internal transcribed spacer 1 between 18S and 5.8S rRNAs. The ubiquitous ncRNA, RNase P, is an evolutionary relative of RNase MRP. RNase P matures tRNA sequences by generating mature 5&#x27;-ends of tRNAs through cleaving the 5&#x27;-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Another ubiquitous RNP called SRP recognizes and transports specific nascent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. In bacteria, Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) is an RNP involved in rescuing stalled ribosomes, tagging incomplete polypeptides and promoting the degradation of aberrant mRNA.

===In RNA splicing===

In eukaryotes, the spliceosome performs the splicing reactions essential for removing intron sequences, this process is required for the formation of mature mRNA. The spliceosome is another RNP often known as the snRNP or tri-snRNP. There are two different forms of the spliceosome, the major and minor forms. The ncRNA components of the major spliceosome are U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. The ncRNA components of the minor spliceosome are U11, U12, U5, U4atac and U6atac.

Another group of introns can catalyse their own removal from host transcripts; these are called self-splicing RNAs. There are two main groups of self-splicing RNAs: group I catalytic intron and group II catalytic intron. These ncRNAs catalyze their own excision from mRNA, tRNA and rRNA precursors in a wide range of organisms.

In mammals it has been found that snoRNAs can also regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA, for example snoRNA HBII-52 regulates the splicing of serotonin receptor 2C.

In nematodes, the SmY ncRNA appears to be involved in mRNA trans-splicing.

===In DNA replication===

Y RNAs are stem loops, necessary for DNA replication through interactions with chromatin and initiation proteins (including the origin recognition complex). They are also components of the Ro60 ribonucleoprotein particle which is a target of autoimmune antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

===In gene regulation===

The expression of many thousands of genes are regulated by ncRNAs. This regulation can occur in trans or in cis. There is increasing evidence that a special type of ncRNAs called enhancer RNAs, transcribed from the enhancer region of a gene, act to promote gene expression.

====Trans-acting====

In higher eukaryotes microRNAs regulate gene expression. A single miRNA can reduce the expression levels of hundreds of genes. The mechanism by which mature miRNA molecules act is through partial complementarity to one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, generally in 3&#x27; UTRs. The main function of miRNAs is to down-regulate gene expression.

The ncRNA RNase P has also been shown to influence gene expression. In the human nucleus, RNase P is required for the normal and efficient transcription of various ncRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III. These include tRNA, 5S rRNA, SRP RNA, and U6 snRNA genes. RNase P exerts its role in transcription through association with Pol III and chromatin of active tRNA and 5S rRNA genes.

It has been shown that 7SK RNA, a metazoan ncRNA, acts as a negative regulator of the RNA polymerase II elongation factor P-TEFb, and that this activity is influenced by stress response pathways.

The bacterial ncRNA, 6S RNA, specifically associates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the sigma70 specificity factor. This interaction represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase.

Another bacterial ncRNA, OxyS RNA represses translation by binding to Shine-Dalgarno sequences thereby occluding ribosome binding. OxyS RNA is induced in response to oxidative stress in Escherichia coli.

The B2 RNA is a small noncoding RNA polymerase III transcript that represses mRNA transcription in response to heat shock in mouse
cells. B2 RNA inhibits transcription by binding to core Pol II. Through this interaction, B2 RNA assembles into preinitiation 
complexes at the promoter and blocks RNA synthesis.

A recent study has shown that just the act of transcription of ncRNA sequence can have an influence on gene expression. RNA polymerase II transcription of ncRNAs is required for chromatin remodelling in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Chromatin is progressively converted to an open configuration, as several species of ncRNAs are transcribed.

====Cis-acting====

A number of ncRNAs are embedded in the 5&#x27; UTRs (Untranslated Regions) of protein coding genes and influence their expression in various ways. For example, a riboswitch can directly bind a small target molecule; the binding of the target affects the gene&#x27;s activity.

RNA leader sequences are found upstream of the first gene of amino acid biosynthetic operons. These RNA elements form one of two possible structures in regions encoding very short peptide sequences that are rich in the end product amino acid of the operon. A terminator structure forms when there is an excess of the regulatory amino acid and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded. When there is a deficiency of the charged tRNA of the regulatory amino acid the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure forms. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon. Known RNA leaders are Histidine operon leader, Leucine operon leader, Threonine operon leader and the Tryptophan operon leader.

Iron response elements (IRE) are bound by iron response proteins (IRP). The IRE is found in UTRs of various mRNAs whose products are involved in iron metabolism. When iron concentration is low, IRPs bind the ferritin mRNA IRE leading to translation repression.

Internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) are RNA structures that allow for translation initiation in the middle of a mRNA sequence as part of the process of protein synthesis.

===In genome defense===

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) expressed in
mammalian testes and somatic cells form RNA-protein complexes with Piwi proteins. These piRNA complexes (piRCs) have been linked to transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposons and other genetic elements in germline cells, particularly those in spermatogenesis.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are repeats found in the DNA of many bacteria and archaea. The repeats are separated by spacers of similar length. It has been demonstrated that these spacers can be derived from phage and subsequently help protect the cell from infection.

===Chromosome structure===

Telomerase is an RNP enzyme that adds specific DNA sequence repeats (&quot;TTAGGG&quot; in vertebrates) to telomeric regions, which are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. The telomeres contain condensed DNA material, giving stability to the chromosomes. The enzyme is a reverse transcriptase that carries Telomerase RNA, which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres, which are shortened after each replication cycle.

Xist (X-inactive-specific transcript) is a long ncRNA gene on the X chromosome of the placental mammals that acts as major effector of the X chromosome inactivation process forming Barr bodies. An antisense RNA, Tsix, is a negative regulator of Xist. X chromosomes lacking Tsix expression (and thus having high levels of Xist transcription) are inactivated more frequently than normal chromosomes. In drosophilids, which also use an XY sex-determination system, the roX (RNA on the X) RNAs are involved in dosage compensation. Both Xist and roX operate by epigenetic regulation of transcription through the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes.

===Bifunctional RNA===

&quot;Bifunctional RNAs&quot;, or &quot;dual-function RNAs&quot;, are RNAs that have two distinct functions. The majority of the known bifunctional RNAs are mRNAs that encode both a protein and ncRNAs. However, a growing number of ncRNAs fall into two different ncRNA categories; e.g., H/ACA box snoRNA and miRNA.

Two well known examples of bifunctional RNAs are SgrS RNA and RNAIII. However, a handful of other bifunctional RNAs are known to exist (e.g., steroid receptor activator/SRA, VegT RNA, 
Oskar RNA, ENOD40, p53 RNA SR1 RNA, and Spot 42 RNA.) Bifunctional RNAs were the subject of a 2011 special issue of Biochimie.

=== As a hormone ===

There is an important link between certain non-coding RNAs and the control of hormone-regulated pathways. In &quot;Drosophila&quot;, hormones such as ecdysone and juvenile hormone can promote the expression of certain miRNAs. Furthermore, this regulation occurs at distinct temporal points within &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; development. In mammals, miR-206 is a crucial regulator of estrogen-receptor-alpha.

Non-coding RNAs are crucial in the development of several endocrine organs, as well as in endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Specifically in the MCF-7 cell line, addition of 17β-estradiol increased global transcription of the noncoding RNAs called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) near estrogen-activated coding genes.

===In pathogenic avoidance===
&quot;C. elegans&quot; was shown to learn and inherit pathogenic avoidance after exposure to a single non-coding RNA of a bacterial pathogen.

==Roles in disease==

As with proteins, mutations or imbalances in the ncRNA repertoire within the body can cause a variety of diseases.

===Cancer===

Many ncRNAs show abnormal expression patterns in cancerous tissues. These include miRNAs, long mRNA-like ncRNAs, GAS5, SNORD50, telomerase RNA and Y RNAs. The miRNAs are involved in the large scale regulation of many protein coding genes, the Y RNAs are important for the initiation of DNA replication, telomerase RNA that serves as a primer for telomerase, an RNP that extends telomeric regions at chromosome ends (see telomeres and disease for more information). The direct function of the long mRNA-like ncRNAs is less clear.

Germline mutations in miR-16-1 and miR-15 primary precursors have been shown to be much more frequent in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to control populations.

It has been suggested that a rare SNP (rs11614913) that overlaps hsa-mir-196a-2 has been found to be associated with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Likewise, a screen of 17 miRNAs that have been predicted to regulate a number of breast cancer associated genes found variations in the microRNAs miR-17 and miR-30c-1of patients; these patients were noncarriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, lending the possibility that familial breast cancer may be caused by variation in these miRNAs.
The p53 tumor suppressor is arguably the most important agent in preventing tumor formation and progression. The p53 protein functions as a transcription factor with a crucial role in orchestrating the cellular stress response. In addition to its crucial role in cancer, p53 has been implicated in other diseases including diabetes, cell death after ischemia, and various neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington, Parkinson, and Alzheimer. Studies have suggested that p53 expression is subject to regulation by non-coding RNA.

Another example of non-coding RNA dysregulated in cancer cells is the long non-coding RNA Linc00707. Linc00707 is upregulated and sponges miRNAs in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, gastric cancer or breast cancer, and thus promotes osteogenesis, contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma progression, promotes proliferation and metastasis, or indirectly regulates expression of proteins involved in cancer aggressiveness, respectively.

===Prader–Willi syndrome===

The deletion of the 48 copies of the C/D box snoRNA SNORD116 has been shown to be the primary cause of Prader–Willi syndrome. Prader–Willi is a developmental disorder associated with over-eating and learning difficulties. SNORD116 has potential target sites within a number of protein-coding genes, and could have a role in regulating alternative splicing.

===Autism===

The chromosomal locus containing the small nucleolar RNA SNORD115 gene cluster has been duplicated in approximately 5% of individuals with autistic traits. A mouse model engineered to have a duplication of the SNORD115 cluster displays autistic-like behaviour. A recent small study of post-mortem brain tissue demonstrated altered expression of long non-coding RNAs in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of autistic brains as compared to controls.

===Cartilage–hair hypoplasia===

Mutations within RNase MRP have been shown to cause cartilage–hair hypoplasia, a disease associated with an array of symptoms such as short stature, sparse hair, skeletal abnormalities and a suppressed immune system that is frequent among Amish and Finnish. The best characterised variant is an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 70 that is in a loop region two bases 5&#x27; of a conserved pseudoknot. However, many other mutations within RNase MRP also cause CHH.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===

The antisense RNA, BACE1-AS is transcribed from the opposite strand to BACE1 and is upregulated in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. BACE1-AS regulates the expression of BACE1 by increasing BACE1 mRNA stability and generating additional BACE1 through a post-transcriptional feed-forward mechanism. By the same mechanism it also raises concentrations of beta amyloid, the main constituent of senile plaques. BACE1-AS concentrations are elevated in subjects with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.

===miR-96 and hearing loss===

Variation within the seed region of mature miR-96 has been associated with autosomal dominant, progressive hearing loss in humans and mice. The homozygous mutant mice were profoundly deaf, showing no cochlear responses. Heterozygous mice and humans progressively lose the ability to hear.

===Mitochondrial transfer RNAs===

A number of mutations within mitochondrial tRNAs have been linked to diseases such as MELAS syndrome, MERRF syndrome, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.

==Distinction between functional RNA (fRNA) and ncRNA==

Scientists have started to distinguish &quot;functional RNA&quot; (&quot;fRNA&quot;) from ncRNA, to describe regions functional at the RNA level that may or may not be stand-alone RNA transcripts. This implies that fRNA (such as riboswitches, SECIS elements, and other cis-regulatory regions) is not ncRNA. Yet fRNA could also include mRNA, as this is RNA coding for protein, and hence is functional. Additionally artificially evolved RNAs also fall under the fRNA umbrella term. Some publications state that &quot;ncRNA&quot; and &quot;fRNA&quot; are nearly synonymous, however others have pointed out that a large proportion of annotated ncRNAs likely have no function. It also has been suggested to simply use the term &quot;RNA&quot;, since the distinction from a protein coding RNA (messenger RNA) is already given by the qualifier &quot;mRNA&quot;. This eliminates the ambiguity when addressing a gene &quot;encoding a non-coding&quot; RNA. Besides, there may be a number of ncRNAs that are misannoted in published literature and datasets.

<text>Small RNA (sRNA) are polymeric RNA molecules that are less than 200 nucleotides in length, and are usually non-coding. RNA silencing is often a function of these molecules, with the most common and well-studied example being RNA interference (RNAi), in which endogenously expressed microRNA (miRNA) or exogenously derived small interfering RNA (siRNA) induces the degradation of complementary messenger RNA. Other classes of small RNA have been identified, including piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) and its subspecies repeat associated small interfering RNA (rasiRNA). Small RNA &quot;is unable to induce RNAi alone, and to accomplish the task it must form the core of the RNA–protein complex termed the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), specifically with Argonaute protein&quot;.

Small RNA have been detected or sequenced using a range of techniques, including directly by MicroRNA sequencing on several sequencing platforms, or indirectly through genome sequencing and analysis. Identification of miRNAs has been evaluated in detecting human disease, such as breast cancer. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) miRNA expression has been studied as potential biomarker for different neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Multiple sclerosis. Evaluating small RNA is useful for certain kinds of study because its molecules &quot;do not need to be fragmented prior to library preparation&quot;.

Types of small RNA include:
* microRNA (miRNA)
* Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)
* small interfering RNA (siRNA)
* small nuclear RNA (snRNA), also commonly referred to as U-RNA
* small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)
* small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA)
* tRNA fragment (tRF)
* Y RNA-derived small RNA (ysRNA)

==In plants==
The first known function in plants was discovered in mutants of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;. Specifically with decline in function mutations for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and DICER-like production. This impairment actually enhanced &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; resistance against &quot;Heterodera schachtii&quot; and &quot;Meloidogyne javanica&quot;. Similarly, mutants with reduced Argonaute function - &quot;ago1-25&quot;, &quot;ago1-27&quot;, &quot;ago2-1&quot;, and combined mutants with &quot;ago1-27&quot; and &quot;ago2-1&quot; - had greater resistance to &quot;Meloidogyne incognita&quot;. Altogether this demonstrates great dependence of nematode parasitism on plants&#x27; own small RNAs.

<text>The Pretender is the fourth album by the American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1976. It peaked at No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s album chart. The singles from the album were &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot;, which reached No. 23, and &quot;The Pretender&quot;, which peaked at No. 58.

==History==
&quot;The Pretender&quot; was released after the suicide of Browne&#x27;s first wife, Phyllis Major, and one of the album&#x27;s songs &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot; (co-written by Major&#x27;s mother Nancy Farnsworth) is dedicated to her. The album has production by Jon Landau and a mixture of styles.

The title track was used in the 1995 film &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot;.

The album was certified as a gold record in 1976 and platinum in 1977 by the RIAA. It reached multi-platinum in 1997 and 2006.

The back cover of &quot;The Pretender&quot; shows Pablo Neruda&#x27;s poem Brown and Agile Child, translated by Kenneth Rexroth, in its entirety.

==Reception==
&quot;The Pretender&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1978, but did not win.

&quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Browne&#x27;s tender concerns are as insightfully expressed as has become the norm, Jon Landau&#x27;s production adding a subtle broadening of the rock base&quot; and said that &quot;&#x27;The Fuse,&#x27; &#x27;The Pretender,&#x27; &#x27;Sleep&#x27;s Dark and Silent Gate&#x27; and &#x27;The Only Child&#x27; are particularly moving and beautifully arranged.&quot;

In his review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann was equivocal about the album, stating Browne &quot;took a step back from the precipice so well defined on his first three albums, but doing so didn&#x27;t seem to make him feel any better... The man who had delved so deeply into life&#x27;s abyss on his earlier albums was in search of escape this time around.&quot;

In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Marc Coleman wrote, &quot;...even when his songwriting is sharp, the mellowing trend in his music dulls the impact. Browne eerily predicts the rise of the yuppie on &quot;The Pretender&quot;″s title track, only to have his point undercut by a creeping string section.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B grade, but explained, &quot;This is an impressive record, but a lot of the time I hate it; my grade is an average, not a judgment&quot; and &quot;The shallowness of his kitschy doomsaying and sentimental sexism is well-known, but I&#x27;m disappointed as well in his depth of craft.&quot; In 2012, the album was ranked number 391 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; says, &quot;Its sense of despair is derived in part from the suicide of his first wife, Phyllis, in 1976, two and a half years after the birth of their son, Ethan.&quot; The single &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot; was credited as co-written with Nancy Farnsworth, Phyllis Major&#x27;s mother.

&quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian rated three songs from the album as being among Browne&#x27;s ten greatest songs – &quot;The Fuse&quot;, &quot;Here Come Those Tears Again&quot; and the title track – and said that &quot;just about every song from the album could have made this list.&quot;

<text>Wardenclyffe Tower (1901–1917), also known as the Tesla Tower, was an early experimental wireless transmission station designed and built by Nikola Tesla on Long Island in 1901–1902, located in the village of Shoreham, New York. Tesla intended to transmit messages, telephony, and even facsimile images across the Atlantic Ocean to England and to ships at sea based on his theories of using the Earth to conduct the signals. His decision to increase the scale of the facility and implement his ideas of wireless power transfer to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s radio-based telegraph system was met with refusal to fund the changes by the project&#x27;s primary backer, financier J. P. Morgan. Additional investment could not be found, and the project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.

In an attempt to satisfy Tesla&#x27;s debts, the tower was demolished for scrap in 1917 and the property taken in foreclosure in 1922. For 50 years, Wardenclyffe was a processing facility producing photography supplies. Many buildings were added to the site and the land it occupies has been trimmed down from to but the original, , brick building designed by Stanford White remains standing.

In the 1980s and 2000s, hazardous waste from the photographic era was cleaned up, and the site was sold and cleared for new development. A grassroots campaign to save the site succeeded in purchasing the property in 2013, with plans to build a future museum dedicated to Nikola Tesla. In 2018, the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Design and operational principles==
===Origin===
Tesla&#x27;s design for Wardenclyffe grew out of his experiments beginning in the early 1890s. His primary goal in these experiments was to develop a new wireless power transmission system.

Tesla discarded the idea of using the newly discovered Hertzian waves (radio waves), detected in 1888 by German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. Tesla doubted they existed and he followed scientific thought of the period that, if they did exist, this was just a type of invisible light which would travel in straight lines the way visible light did, meaning they would travel straight out into space and be &quot;hopelessly lost&quot;.

In laboratory work and later large-scale experiments at Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1899, Tesla developed his own ideas on how a worldwide wireless system would work. He theorized from these experiments that if he injected electric current into the Earth at just the right frequency he could harness what he believed was the planet&#x27;s own electrical charge and cause it to resonate at a frequency that would be amplified in &quot;standing waves&quot; that could be tapped anywhere on the planet to run devices or, through modulation, carry a signal. His system was based more on 19th-century ideas of electrical conduction and telegraphy instead of the newer theories of electromagnetic waves, with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and being returned through the air.

Tesla&#x27;s design used a concept of a charged conductive upper layer in the atmosphere, a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless power system by Mahlon Loomis. Tesla not only believed that he could use this layer as the return path in his electrical conduction system, but that the power flowing through it would make it glow, providing night time lighting for cities and shipping lanes.

In February 1901, in a &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; article titled &quot;Talking With Planets&quot;, Tesla described his &quot;system of energy transmission and of telegraphy without the use of wires&quot; as:

(using) the Earth itself as the medium for conducting the currents, thus dispensing with wires and all other artificial conductors ... a machine which, to explain its operation in plain language, resembled a pump in its action, drawing electricity from the Earth and driving it back into the same at an enormous rate, thus creating ripples or disturbances which, spreading through the Earth as through a wire, could be detected at great distances by carefully attuned receiving circuits. In this manner I was able to transmit to a distance, not only feeble effects for the purposes of signaling, but considerable amounts of energy, and later discoveries I made convinced me that I shall ultimately succeed in conveying power without wires, for industrial purposes, with high economy, and to any distance, however great.

Although Tesla demonstrated wireless power transmission at Colorado Springs, lighting electric lights mounted outside the building where he had his large experimental coil, he did not scientifically test his theories. He believed he had achieved Earth resonance which, according to his theory, would work at any distance.

===Financing===

Tesla was back in New York in January 1900. He had convinced his friend Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, to allow him to publish an article covering his work and Johnson had even sent a photographer to Colorado Springs the previous year to photograph Tesla&#x27;s experiments. The article written by Tesla, titled &quot;The Problem of Increasing Human Energy&quot;, appeared in the June 1900 edition of &quot;Century Magazine&quot;.

Instead of the understandable scientific description Johnson had hoped for, it was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise where Tesla described his futuristic ideas on harnessing the sun&#x27;s energy, control of the weather with electricity, wireless control, and how future inventions would make war impossible. It also contained what were to become iconic images by photographer Dickenson Alley of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.

Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for his system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria&#x27;s Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club and Delmonico&#x27;s. Tesla first went to his old friend George Westinghouse for help. Westinghouse seemed like a natural fit for the project given the large-scale AC equipment Westinghouse Electric manufactured and Tesla&#x27;s need for similar equipment.

Tesla asked Westinghouse to &quot;meet me on some fair terms in furnishing me the machinery, retaining the ownership of the same and interesting yourself to a certain extent&quot;. Though Westinghouse declined to buy into the project, he did agree to lend Tesla $6,000 . Westinghouse suggested Tesla pursue some of the rich venture capitalists. Tesla talked to John Jacob Astor, Thomas Fortune Ryan, and even sent a cabochon sapphire ring as a gift to Henry O. Havemeyer. No investment was forthcoming from Havemeyer and Ryan, but Astor did buy 500 shares in Tesla&#x27;s company. Tesla gained the attention of financier J. P. Morgan in November 1900.

Morgan was impressed by Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s feat of sending reports from the America&#x27;s Cup yacht races off Long Island back to New York City via radio the previous year, and he was dubious about the feasibility and patent priority of Tesla&#x27;s system.

In several discussions, Tesla assured Morgan his system was superior to, and based on patents that superseded, that of Marconi and of other wireless inventors, and that it would far outpace the performance of its main competitor, the transatlantic telegraph cable. Morgan signed a contract with Tesla in March 1901, agreeing to give the inventor $150,000 to develop and build a wireless station on Long Island, capable of sending wireless messages to London as well as ships at sea. The deal also included Morgan having a 51% interest in the company as well as a 51% share in present and future wireless patents developed from the project.

===Design changes and financial problems===

Tesla began working on his wireless station immediately. As soon as the contract was signed with Morgan in March 1901, he placed an order for generators and transformers with Westinghouse Electric. Tesla&#x27;s plans changed radically after he read a June 1901 &quot;Electrical Review&quot; article by Marconi titled &quot;Syntonic Wireless Telegraph&quot;.

At this point, Marconi was transmitting radio signals beyond the range most physicists thought possible (over the horizon) and the description of the Italian inventor&#x27;s use of a &quot;Tesla coil&quot; &quot;connected to the Earth&quot; led Tesla to believe Marconi was copying his earth resonance system to do it. Tesla, believing a small pilot system capable of sending Morse code yacht race results to Morgan in Europe would not be able to capture the attention of potential investors, decided to scale up his designs with a much more powerful transmitter, incorporating his ideas of advanced telephone and image transmission as well as his ideas of wireless power delivery.

In July 1901, Tesla informed Morgan of his planned changes to the project and the need for much more money to build it. He explained the more grandiose plan as a way to leap ahead of competitors and secure much larger profits on the investment. With Tesla basically proposing a breach of contract, Morgan refused to lend additional funds and demanded an account of money already spent. Tesla claimed a few years later that funds were also running short because of Morgan&#x27;s role in triggering the stock market Panic of 1901, making everything Tesla had to buy much more expensive.

Morgan stated no additional funds would be supplied, but Tesla continued with the project. He explored the idea of building several small towers or a tower and even tall to transmit the type of low-frequency longwaves that Tesla thought were needed to resonate the Earth. His friend, architect Stanford White, who was working on designing structures for the project, calculated that a 600-foot tower would cost $450,000 and the idea had to be canceled.

==Plant at Wardenclyffe==
Tesla purchased of land close to a railway line from New York City in Shoreham on Long Island Sound from land developer James S. Warden who was building a resort community known as Wardenclyffe-On-Sound. Tesla would later state his plans were to eventually make Wardenclyffe a hub &quot;city&quot; in his plans for a worldwide system of 30 wireless plants, sending messages and media content and broadcasting electrical power. The land surrounding the Wardenclyffe plant was intended to be what Tesla would later in life refer to as a &quot;radio city&quot; with factories producing Tesla&#x27;s patented devices. Warden expected to build housing on the part of his remaining land for the expected 2,000–2,500 Tesla employees. At the end of July 1901 Tesla closed a contract for the building of the wireless telegraph plant and electrical laboratory at Wardenclyffe.
The final design Tesla started building at Wardenclyffe consisted of a wood-framed tower tall and the cupola in diameter. It had a 55-ton steel (some report it was a better conducting material, such as copper) hemispherical structure at the top (referred to as a cupola). The structure was such as to allow each piece to be taken out and replaced as necessary.

The main building occupied the rest of the facility grounds. Stanford White designed the Wardenclyffe facility main building. It included a laboratory area, instrumentation room, boiler room, generator room and machine shop. Inside the main building, there were electromechanical devices, electrical generators, electrical transformers, glass blowing equipment, X-ray devices, Tesla coils, a remote controlled boat, cases with bulbs and tubes, wires, cables, a library, and an office. It was constructed in the style of the Italian Renaissance. The tower was designed by W.D. Crow, an associate of White.

There was a great deal of construction under the tower to establish some form of ground connection but Tesla and his workers kept the public and the press away from the project so little is known. The descriptions (some from Tesla&#x27;s 1923 testimony in foreclosure proceedings on the property) include that the facility had a ten by twelve foot wood and steel lined shaft sunk into the ground beneath the tower with a stairway inside it. Tesla stated that at the bottom of the shaft he &quot;had special machines rigged up which would push the iron pipe, one length after another, and I pushed these iron pipes, I think sixteen of them, three hundred feet, and then the current through these pipes takes hold of the earth.&quot; In Tesla&#x27;s words, the function of this was &quot;to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver&quot;. There is also contemporaneous and later descriptions of four 100 foot long tunnels, possibly brick lined and waterproofed, radiating from the bottom of the shaft north, south, east, and west terminating back at ground level in little brick igloos. Speculation on the tunnels ranges from them being for drainage, acting as access ways, or having the function of enhancing ground connection or resonance by interacting with the water table below the tower, maybe via being filled with salt water or liquid nitrogen.

The Tesla biographer John Joseph O&#x27;Neill noted the cupola at the top of the 186-foot tower had a 5-foot hole in its top where ultraviolet lights were to be mounted, perhaps to create an ionized path up through the atmosphere that could conduct electricity. How Tesla intended to employ the ground conduction method and atmospheric method in Wardenclyffe&#x27;s design is unknown. Power for the entire system was to be provided by a coal fired 200 kilowatt Westinghouse alternating current industrial generator.

Construction began in September 1901 but money was so short (with Morgan still owing Tesla the remainder of the original $150,000 promised) Tesla complained in a letter to White he was facing foreclosure. Tesla kept writing Morgan letters pleading for more money and assuring the financier his wireless system would be superior to Marconi&#x27;s, but in December Tesla&#x27;s plans were dealt another serious blow when Marconi announced to the world he was able to send a wireless transmission (the Morse code for the letter S) across the Atlantic.
Construction at Wardenclyffe continued in 1902 and that June Tesla began moving his laboratory operations from 46 East Houston Street laboratory to the 94-foot-square brick building at Wardenclyffe. By the end of 1902 the tower reached its full height of 187 feet. What Tesla was doing at Wardenclyffe and the site itself was generally kept from the public. Tesla would respond to reporters inquiries stating there was a similar wireless plant in Scotland and that &quot;We have been sending wireless messages for long distances from this station for some time, but whether we are going into the telegraph field on a commercial basis I cannot say at present.&quot;

Tesla continued to write to Morgan asking the investor to reconsider his position on the contract and invest the additional funds the project needed. In a July 3, 1903 letter Tesla wrote &quot;Will you help me or let my great work — almost complete — go to pots?&quot; Morgan&#x27;s reply on July 14 was &quot;I have received your letter and in reply would say that I should not feel disposed at present to make any further advances&quot;. The night of Morgan&#x27;s reply, and several nights after, newspapers reported that the Wardenclyffe tower came alive shooting off bright flashes lighting up the night sky. No explanation was forthcoming from Tesla or any of his workers as to the meaning of the display and Wardenclyffe never seemed to operate again.

Tesla&#x27;s finances continued to unravel. Investor money on Wall Street was continuing to flow to Marconi&#x27;s system, which was making regular transmissions, and doing it with equipment far less expensive than the &quot;wireless plant&quot; Tesla was attempting to build. Some in the press began turning against Tesla&#x27;s project claiming it was a hoax and the &quot;rich man&#x27;s panic&quot; of late 1903 on Wall Street reduced investment further. Some money came from Thomas Fortune Ryan but the funds went towards the debt on the project instead of funding any further construction. Investors seemed to be shying away from putting money into a project that J. P. Morgan had abandoned. Tesla continued to write Morgan trying to get extra funding stating his &quot;knowledge and ability [...] if applied effectively would advance the world a century&quot;. Morgan would only reply through his secretary saying &quot;it will be impossible for [me/ Morgan] to do anything in the matter&quot;. Tesla&#x27;s attempts to raise money by getting the US Navy interested in his remote control boat and torpedo and other attempts to commercialize his inventions went nowhere. In May 1905, Tesla&#x27;s patents on alternating current motors and other methods of power transmission expired, halting royalty payments and causing a further severe reduction of funding to the Wardenclyffe Tower. In an attempt to find alternative funding Tesla advertised the services of the Wardenclyffe facility but he was met with little success.

===Abandonment===
In 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla&#x27;s part. In June architect Stanford White was murdered by Harry Kendall Thaw over White&#x27;s affair with Thaw&#x27;s wife, actress Evelyn Nesbit. In October long time investor William Rankine died of a heart attack. George Scherff, Tesla&#x27;s chief manager who had been supervising Wardenclyffe, had to leave to find other employment. The people living around Wardenclyffe noticed the Tesla plant seemed to have been abandoned without notice.

In 1904, Tesla took out a mortgage on the Wardenclyffe property with George C. Boldt, proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, to cover Tesla&#x27;s living expenses at the hotel. In 1908 Tesla procured a second mortgage from Boldt to further cover expenses. The facility was partially abandoned around 1911, and the tower structure deteriorated. Between 1912 and 1915, Tesla&#x27;s finances unraveled, and when the funders wanted to know how they were going to recoup their investments, Tesla was unable to give satisfactory answers.

The March 1, 1916 edition of the publication &quot;Export American Industries&quot; ran a story titled &quot;Tesla&#x27;s Million Dollar Folly&quot; describing the abandoned Wardenclyffe site:

There everything seemed left as for a day — chairs, desks, and papers in businesslike array. The great wheels seemed only awaiting Monday life. But the magic word has not been spoken, and the spell still rests on the great plant.

By mid-1917 the facility&#x27;s main building was breached and vandalized.

===Demolition===

By 1915, Tesla&#x27;s accumulated debt at the Waldorf-Astoria was around . When Tesla was unable to make any further payments on the mortgages, Boldt foreclosed on the Wardenclyffe property. Boldt went on to make the property available for sale and decided to demolish the tower for scrap. On July 4, 1917, the Smiley Steel Company of New York began demolition of the tower by dynamiting it. The tower was knocked on a tilt by the initial explosion but it was not totally demolished until September. The scrap value realized was .

Since this was during World War I a rumor spread, picked up by newspapers and other publications, that the tower was demolished on orders of the United States Government with claims German spies were using it as a radio transmitter or observation post, or that it was being used as a landmark for German submarines. Tesla was not pleased with what he saw as attacks on his patriotism via the rumors about Wardenclyffe, but since the original mortgages with Boldt as well as the foreclosure had been kept off the public record in order to hide his financial difficulties, Tesla was not able to reveal the real reason for the demolition.

On April 20, 1922, Tesla lost an appeal of judgment on Boldt&#x27;s original foreclosure.

==Post-Tesla era==
In 1925, the property ownership was transferred to Walter L. Johnson of Brooklyn. On March 6, 1939, Plantacres, Inc. purchased the facility&#x27;s land and subsequently leased it to Peerless Photo Products, Inc.

AGFA Corporation bought the property from Peerless and used the site from 1969 to 1992 before closing the facility. The site has undergone a final cleanup of waste produced during its Photo Products era. The clean up was conducted under the scrutiny of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and paid for by AGFA.

In 2009, AGFA put the property up for sale for $1,650,000. The main building remains standing to this day; AGFA advertised that the land can &quot;be delivered fully cleared and level.&quot; It says it spent $5 million through September 2008 cleaning up silver and cadmium. A non-profit preservation organization supported by The Oatmeal purchased the land in 2013 with hopes to create a museum to Tesla there.

===Landmarking===
On February 14, 1967, the nonprofit public benefit corporation Brookhaven Town Historical Trust was established. It selected the Wardenclyffe facility to be designated as a historic site and as the first site to be preserved by the Trust on March 3, 1967. The Brookhaven Town Historic Trust was rescinded by resolution on February 1, 1972. There were never any appointments made after a legal opinion was received; it was never set up properly. On July 7, 1976, a plaque from Yugoslavia was installed by representatives from Brookhaven National Laboratory near the entrance of the building. It reads:


The sign was stolen from the property in November 2009. An anonymous benefactor is offering a $2,000 reward if it is returned to the property.

In 1976, an application was filed to nominate the main building for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It failed to get approval. The &quot;Tesla Wardenclyffe Project, Inc.&quot; was established in 1994 for the purpose of seeking placement of the Wardenclyffe laboratory-office building and the Tesla tower foundation on both the New York State and NRHP. Its mission is the preservation and adaptive reuse of Wardenclyffe, the century-old laboratory of electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla located in Shoreham, Long Island, New York.

In October 1994, a second application for formal nomination was filed. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation conducted inspections and determined the facility meets New York State criteria for historic designation. A second visit was made on February 25, 2009. The site cannot be registered until it is nominated by a willing owner.

Designation of the structure as a National Landmark is awaiting completion of plant decommissioning activities by its present owner.

===Museum===
In August 2012, concerned about an apparent offer to purchase the site and develop it for commercial use, web cartoon &quot;The Oatmeal&quot; launched a fundraiser for the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe to raise $1.7 million to purchase the property, with the hope of eventually building a museum on the grounds.

Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of &quot;The Oatmeal&quot;, collaborated in 2012 to honor &quot;the Father of the Electric Age&quot;, by preserving the Wardenclyffe facility as a science center and museum. They initiated the &quot;Let&#x27;s Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum&quot; fund-raising campaign on the Indiegogo crowdfunding site, to raise funding to buy the Wardenclyffe property and restore the facility. The project reached its goal of raising $850,000 within a week, more than exceeded the requested amount, including a $33,333 donation from the producers of the Tesla film &quot;Fragments from Olympus-The Vision of Nikola Tesla&quot;. The campaign also attracted donations from benefactors such as Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc.

The money raised within one week was enough to get a matching grant from the state of New York, allowing the project to be able to meet the seller&#x27;s asking price of $1.6 million; the state had agreed to match donations up to half that amount. A total of $1.37 million was donated, the matching grant from the State of New York brought the total collected to over $2.2 million. The surplus was to be used to fund the cleaning and restoration of the property. Tesla, Wardenclyffe and the museum fundraising effort was the subject of a documentary called &quot;Tower to the People – Tesla&#x27;s Dream at Wardenclyffe Continues&quot;.

On May 2, 2013, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe announced that they had purchased the 15.69-acre laboratory site from Agfa Corporation and will begin to raise &quot;about $10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of Tesla and his legacy&quot;.

On May 13, 2014, The Oatmeal published a comic called &quot;What It&#x27;s Like to Own a Model S, Part 2&quot;, to request a further donation of $8 million from Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk. The next day, Musk tweeted that he &quot;would be happy to help&quot;. On July 10, 2014, during a 158th birthday celebration for Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site, it was announced that Musk would donate $1 million toward funding the museum, and install a Tesla Motors supercharging station onsite.

The center plans to offer several programs, including science teacher associations, conferences, symposia, field trips, associations with science competitions, and other science programs. Planned permanent exhibits include a Tesla exhibit, exploratorium-type exhibits, and a living museum. On September 23, 2013, the President of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić, unveiled a monument to Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site. Nikolić said that he had planned to push for the monument to be displayed at the United Nations, but chose Wardenclyffe once he learned it had been purchased for the center.

Emergency renovations on the chimney started in February 2020. A ground breaking event took place in June of 2023.

==Facility grounds==
Wardenclyffe is located near the Shoreham Post Office and Shoreham Fire House on Route 25A in Shoreham, Long Island, New York. Wardenclyffe was divided into two main sections. The tower, which was located in the back, and the main building now compose the entire facility grounds. At one time the property was about . Now it consists of slightly less than .

==2023 fire==

On 21 November 2023, just months after the groundbreaking, the laboratory building caught fire. Over 100 firefighters across Long Island helped contain the fire. Much of the original brick building survived.
