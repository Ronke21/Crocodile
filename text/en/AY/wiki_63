<text>In telecommunication and data transmission, serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication, where several bits are sent as a whole, on a link with several parallel channels.
Serial communication is used for all long-haul communication and most computer networks, where the cost of cable and difficulty of synchronization make parallel communication impractical. Serial computer buses have become more common even at shorter distances, as improved signal integrity and transmission speeds in newer serial technologies have begun to outweigh the parallel bus&#x27;s advantage of simplicity (no need for serializer and deserializer, or SerDes) and to outstrip its disadvantages (clock skew, interconnect density). The migration from PCI to PCI Express (PCIe) is an example.

Modern high speed serial interfaces such as PCIe send data several bits at a time using modulation/encoding techniques such as PAM4 which groups 2 bits at a time into a single symbol, and several symbols are still sent one at the time. This replaces PAM2 or non return to zero (NRZ) which only sends one bit at a time, or in other words one bit per symbol. The symbols are sent at a speed known as the symbol rate or the baud rate.

==Cables==
Many serial communication systems were originally designed to transfer data over relatively large distances through some sort of data cable.

Practically all long-distance communication transmits data one bit at a time, rather than in parallel, because it reduces the cost of the cable. The cables that carry this data (other than &quot;the&quot; serial cable) and the computer ports they plug into are usually referred to with a more specific name, to reduce confusion.

Keyboard and mouse cables and ports are almost invariably serial—such as PS/2 port, Apple Desktop Bus and USB.

The cables that carry digital video are also mostly serial—such as coax cable plugged into a HD-SDI port, a webcam plugged into a USB port or FireWire port, Ethernet cable connecting an IP camera to a Power over Ethernet port, FPD-Link, digital telephone lines (ex. ISDN), etc.

Other such cables and ports, transmitting data one bit at a time, include Serial ATA, Serial SCSI, Ethernet cable plugged into Ethernet ports, the Display Data Channel using previously reserved pins of the VGA connector or the DVI port or the HDMI port.

==Serial buses==

Many communication systems were generally designed to connect two integrated circuits on the same printed circuit board, connected by signal traces on that board (rather than external cables).

Integrated circuits are more expensive when they have more pins. To reduce the number of pins in a package, many ICs use a serial bus to transfer data when speed is not important. Some examples of such low-cost lower-speed serial buses include RS-232, DALI, SPI, CAN bus, I²C, UNI/O, and 1-Wire. Higher-speed serial buses include USB, SATA and PCI Express.

==Serial versus parallel==
The communication links, across which computers (or parts of computers) talk to one another, may be either serial or parallel. A parallel link transmits several streams of data simultaneously along multiple channels (e.g., wires, printed circuit tracks, or optical fibers); whereas, a serial link transmits only a single stream of data. The rationale for parallel communication was the added benefit of having Direct Memory Access to the 8-bit or 16-bit registry addresses at a time where mapping direct data lanes was more convenient and faster than synchronizing data serially.

Although a serial link may seem inferior to a parallel one, since it can transmit less data per clock cycle, it is often the case that serial links can be clocked considerably faster than parallel links in order to achieve a higher data rate. Several factors allow serial to be clocked at a higher rate:
*Clock skew between different channels is not an issue (for unclocked asynchronous serial communication links). This can be caused by mismatched wire or conductor lengths.
*A serial connection requires fewer interconnecting cables (e.g., wires/fibers) and hence occupies less space. The extra space allows for better isolation of the channel from its surroundings.
*Crosstalk is less of an issue, because there are fewer conductors in proximity.
*Budgets for power use, power dissipation, cable cost, component cost, IC die area, PC board area, ESD protection, etc. can be focused on a single link.

The transition from parallel to serial buses was allowed by Moore&#x27;s law which allowed for the incorporation of SerDes in integrated circuits.
An electrical serial link only requires a pair of wires, whereas a parallel link requires several. Thus serial links can save on costs (also known as the Bill of Materials). Differential signalling uses length-matched wires or conductors and are used in high speed serial links. Length-matching is easier to perform on serial links as they require fewer conductors.

In many cases, serial is cheaper to implement than parallel. Many ICs have serial interfaces, as opposed to parallel ones, so that they have fewer pins and are therefore less expensive.

<text>Ciudad del Carmen or Carmen is a city in the southwest of the Mexican state of Campeche. Ciudad del Carmen is located at on the southwest of Carmen Island, which stands in the Laguna de Términos on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. , Ciudad del Carmen had a population of 169,466, up from the 2005 census of 154,197. In July 2006, Ciudad del Carmen celebrated its 150th anniversary as a city.

The city is nicknamed &quot;The Pearl of the Gulf&quot;. Ciudad del Carmen was a small city mostly devoted to fishing until the 1970s when oil was discovered in the region; since then it has grown and developed substantially. To this day Carmen is known as one of the best locations to find seafood in Mexico. As late as the early 1980s the city could long be reached only by ferry boats called &quot;pangas&quot; or small motorboats (&quot;lanchas&quot;) operating between Ciudad del Carmen and Zacatal; this changed with the construction of a causeway bridge to the mainland in the 1980s (eastbound) and another one in 1994 (westbound). The construction of the first bridge was motivated by the sinking of one of the island&#x27;s &quot;pangas&quot; which resulted in the death of nearly everyone on board. The bridge &quot;Puente El Zacatal&quot;, constructed in 1994, is one of the longest in Latin America.

This border area at the western edge of the Yucatán Peninsula was previously part of the state of Yucatán, then of Tabasco; since 1863 it has been part of the state of Campeche. In 1840 the city had a population of about 7,000.

The city is also the seat of the state of Campeche&#x27;s Carmen municipality, which includes the city and the surrounding area. The 2010 census population of the municipality of Carmen was 221,094 people, second only to the capital municipality of Campeche.

The main university in Ciudad del Carmen is the Universidad Autónoma del Carmen (UNACAR).

== Nomenclature ==

=== Toponymy ===
The city takes its name from 16 July of 1717, Virgen del Carmen day, when pirates were defeated and expelled from the island by Alonso Felipe de Andrade in the fort of San Felipe.

=== Shield ===
The Carmen shield is an oval limited by a gray periphery that has the name of the city and the state to which it belongs. In the center of the oval is the Laguna de Términos and on it the Isla del Carmen.

The lion symbolizes the European siege of Mexico during Spanish rule and French intervention, it is on the island and an eagle wounds it with its beak and claws. The eagle symbolizes the Carmelite people, preventing a foreign country from intervening in its territory and the nation.

The original shield of Ciudad del Carmen has the legend &quot;The lagoon by Yucatán and both by the Mexican Republic&quot;. At the beginning of the 19th century, During the first years of Mexico as an independent country, the Carmen region was known as La Laguna and until the first years of the 20th century it was called that. The reason for the motto is that when it was created in 1828 the current state of Campeche had not yet been separated from Yucatán. It should be remembered that the island was part of the Captaincy General of Yucatán during the Spanish domination and in 1828 the Mexican nation was in formation after the territories that formed it gained their independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821.

==History==

Founded in the pre-Hispanic era, Ciudad del Carmen was known as Xicalango and served as a city state and port, and as an important connection between the Aztec and Mayan civilizations. Between the 16th and 18th centuries when the city of Campeche was a trade hub between Spain and New Spain (Mexico), Ciudad del Carmen was inhabited by pirates and served as a port for repairing ships and planning attacks against the Spanish. A 1699 map of the Bay of Campeche indicates Isla del Carmen as two islands: Triest I and Port Royal I. On the opposite side of the lagoon there is a waterway marked as Logwood Creek; this indicates that the residents were probably English and logging was another of their activities.

The city got its current name on 16 July 1717, in honor of the Virgin of Carmen, believed to be the protector of the island, when the Spanish forces, commanded by Alonso Felipe de Andrade evicted the pirates from the island and took control the city after a long period of occupation. Since then, every year at the end of July, Ciudad del Carmen turns into the very center of the regional social, cultural and religious festivities, on the fair that celebrates the island&#x27;s protector virgin.

=== Colonization ===

The Isla del Carmen and its surrounding places were found on the discovery route. By 1518 the island was inhabited by indigenous people of Maya origin, by migrations of Toltec, Zapotec and Xutian tutul groups, conquerors of Xicalango. At the end of May of that same year, the Spaniards arrived aboard four ships at the desired port - Puerto Real or Isla Aguada. At the head of that expedition was Juan de Grijalva and, as an experienced pilot, Antón or Antonio de Alaminos, a navigation man who, to the recorder in his heading letters the Island of Trs (then for making reading difficult in the sea letters are added the letter &quot;i&quot; remaining as tris), from Terms, gave a sense that was the limit of the land discovered by them, although they also considered that there ended the great island they believed was Yucatán. The abbreviation Tris became usual in maps and navigation charts, giving birth to a memorable place for future events, since the colonization of the island was only made years later of the Spanish foundation of San Pedro de Champotón in 1537 and San Francisco de Campeche in 1540. After these initial moments of the Colony, it was pirates who arrived in 1558 to take refuge, first, after taking advantage of the natural resources of the Island of Terms.

Captured as a safe haven and converted into a base for different attacks by sea and land, the Tris Island seems to be destined to fulfill the functions played by Jamaica, in the power of the English since 1655, or the Tortuga Island, which the French dominated, that is to say, port of provisioning of the corsair ships.
Laguna or Isla del Carmen has, along with the territorial portion, a unique history for different reasons, among them, that the Spaniards discovered but did not conquer or colonize it; while the pirates made it a den and residence while fighting for neighboring lands and populating other places in the region. Its formal Spanish surgical colonization almost two centuries after the trip of Hernández de Córdoba (Francisco Hernández de Córdoba) and Grijalva to these places. Consequently, the buccaneers sat in that region their reals, and when they did not attack the commercial controls that passed near the place, they dedicated themselves to cutting the dye stick to send it to Europe. They were men of great physical strength, confirmed that the work they carried out, however criminal it was and effectively productive, is carried out in extremely difficult conditions, since the temperatures they supported in the jungle or along rivers and swamps exceeded 35 degrees, In addition to the humidity and the high number of insects, without neglecting the wide variety of vipers and arachnids.

Another historical explanation about the late colonization of the island was its location: in the most hidden area of the Gulf of Mexico, on the border with the indigenous Mayan and Tabscoobs tribes, and immediately to the isthmic region of Tehuantepec, together with its extraordinary timber wealth, but, for that reason, safe refuge of the lowlands that are dedicated to its traffic, reason why always it is constituted in object of ambition of other countries.

The problems of the [Europe of America Colony] remained on the mainland, with a slow and difficult colonization. Progress was made so slowly that, for example, on 4 September 1663, during the provincial government of Francisco Esquivel and de la Rosa, governor and captain general of Yucatán, came news that Tris Island was held by the pirates, who at that time already exploited, with great utilities, the dye stick.
; First expedition (1672)

Two decades had to pass for something to be done about it: on 14 August 1672, a decision was made and a first expedition to the island left the port of Veracruz with the intention of throwing the pirates who had possessed it into the sea; however, in October 1673, the expedition returned with the news of not being able to evict them.

; Second expedition (1680)

The stumbling blocks, with the discouragement capacity, did not fall into oblivion, and in the year 1680, the mayor of San Francisco de Campeche, Felipe González de la Barrera, put into operation what we can call the second expedition, which then fixed the mature port and reached Laguna, where rooms, houses, and dyewood were set on fire. The expulsion was temporary, however, because when the soldiers concentrated on the square from which they had left, the pirates returned to their inhabited tasks. However, the fact was considered so remarkable that the king granted the mayor the noble title of Count de la Laguna.

; Third expedition (1703)

The characteristics of the region at that time were not hospitable, and that is what I add the distance, what normally covered by water, and what required months and months to go from one place to another. In addition, the settlement of the peninsula passed slowly, and it took a little over two decades to send a third expedition to remove the pirates from the lagoon. At the end of the seventeenth century there are about 600 people organized in Terms and Puerto Real, from 1686 to a considerable number of pirates returned to the island, restarting the harassment of Tabasco villages and taking out the Usumacinta. The Spaniards took over the initiative and Viceroy Gálvez supported the provinces of Tabasco and Yucatán, which in 1690 reconquered the place, but did not settle. Also, the viceroy sent engineer Jaime Frank to study the possibility of fortifying the island; but this one thought that it was not convenient, since when there were several entrances to the island, the opposites could surprise the soldiers and fortify.
It is Captain Francisco Fernández who overcomes pirate resistance around the years 1703–1704 with a coast guard, six canoes and 184 well-equipped and armed men. He arrested a hundred English outlaws and nine blacks, and destroyed facilities and boats, seized a small urca loaded with dye stick, a British-built patache with 800 quintals of Campeche stick, a Spanish brig, stolen before by pirates and another built in San Román; the victorious expeditionaries of a sloop, half a hundred canoes, useful for different movements also took over; good amount of rigging and miles of quintals of the stick already cut and ready to embark, but withdrew from the place due to lack of financial support. They made nothing despicable prisoners, like Isaac Hamilton, a London Jew whose mission was to ship the dye bound for New England; William Haven, a native of Jamaica, and John Elliot, a Londoner enlisted in Jamaica in the ranks of piracy. Booty and prisoners were transferred to San Francisco de Campeche, and the last ones sent to the capital of New Spain.

As the continuous pirate attacks, the Spanish authorities decided to organize an eviction of the pirates stationed on the island of Tris. This incursion is carried out in the month of May 1704, for which, the Viceroy sent the Mayor of Tabasco the order to incorporate the Laguna de Términos to carry out an attack along with Campeche forces. The Mayor of Tabasco Mayor, Alonso Felipe de Andrade, affected and personally controlled by 200 men and 14 canoes towards the Laguna de Términos. Andrade discovered fourteen pirate campaigns and after facing them, captured several pirates and artillery pieces that led to Tabasco after having stayed more than a month in the lagoon of Terms, entrances and exits to land and sea demarcated making a map.
; Fourth expedition (1707)

Several years have to pass again so that in 1707 — fourth attempt — the governor of Tabasco, Pedro Mier y Terán, sending forces to remove the pirates from the island. They succeed, but the circumstances are repeated: when leaving the place, the pirates return. It was the time when Barbillas settled on the island and from there captured ships and dismantled wineries of other ships. That is, as long as a group of inhabitants was not established, the region would change possession with relative ease.

; Fifth expedition (1716)

The English ships were seen returning in 1710, and on their way they sank a coast guard. It became impossible to admit eventualities in the matter of the Laguna de Términos, in such a way that the mayor of Tabasco, Juan Francisco Medina y Cachón, proposed an eviction strategy in which ships from the Windward Navy, based in Veracruz, and the naval forces of Tabasco and San Francisco de Campeche. Those chosen in San Francisco de Campeche for the expedition were: the frigate Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, owned by Mayor Ángel Rodríguez de la Gala; the frigate of Andrés Benito, the sloop of Sebastián García, two coast guard and several canoes for the service of the containers. Mérida, Tacotalpa de la Real Corona and San Francisco de Campeche contributed 7,945 pesos from their royal boxes for the purchase of groceries, war gear and boat cage Preliminary movements were in operation when they had to depend: they reached San Francisco de Campeche the sailor Agustín Toledo, received from Laguna, warning that three English frigates were on the island, one of them with 20 guns, another of 16 and the last with 10; In addition, two brigs without artillery were prepared to ask for help in Jamaica.
Finally, the Mayor of Tabasco, Graniel de Gil, ordered the attack, and the fifth expedition departed from Tabasco on 7 December 1716, under the command of Sergeant Major and former Rulers of Tabasco Mayor of Tabasco, Alonso Felipe de Andrade; the pirates were defeated again, but this time the triumphant Tabasco forces did not withdraw, but instead established a garrison on the island which they named &quot;Fort of San Felipe&quot;. The eviction, says Calderón Quijano: 

=== Military post of El Carmen ===

After that victory, the rapid construction of a defense lurch began, which is the origin of the current Ciudad del Carmen. The prison or fort floor was built with simplicity; the plans indicated that the building was perfectly square and regular, and that it had bulwarks at its angles.

Shortly after, more than a hundred buccaneers wanted to retake the territory and returned with more troops and war supplies, and attacked the Tabasco troops by surprise on 15 July 1717, at night, but courageously were rejected, with the blunt response of &quot;men, bullets and gunpowder enough to defend themselves.&quot; The pirates urged De Andrade to surrender and he replied: &quot;Men have enough gunpowder to not deliver the square.&quot;

Sergeant Alonso Felipe de Andrade counterattacked, snatched a shrapnel cannon and engaged in a memorable battle. In the combat the sergeant major died Andrade of , which is in the center of the rush. The British pirates fled. Throughout the night, the locals continued to persecute those fleeing, at dawn 16 July of 1717, there was not a single pirate left alive on the island.

=== Final eviction of pirates ===

Finally, in 1786, the Mayor of Tabasco Francisco de Amuzquívar sent the militias of Tabasco, under the command of the captain Juan de Amestoy and the lieutenant Francisco Interiano, who defeat and evict the English from la Isla del Carmen, reintegrating the island to Tabasco. and rebuilding the military post of &quot; &quot; &#x27;Nuestra Señora del Carmen&#x27; &quot; &quot; thus ending the presence of pirates in the region.

Since then never again the buccaneers, who were in possession of the island for about 200 years, exploiting their resources and attacking Spanish ships and the Tabasco coasts, where they forced the colonial authorities to change twice the capital of the province of Tabasco, of Santa María de la Victoria to Villahermosa de San Juan Bautista in 1641, and from there to Tacotalpa of the Royal Crown in 1677. Undoubtedly, the expelled English are the ones who went to the opposite side - Belize - to continue their trade as smugglers and smugglers.

=== Dispute between Tabasco and Yucatán ===

Since the colonial era there was a dispute between Tabasco and Yucatán for the possession of the island of Carmen. In 1540 the Province of Tabasco had its greatest extension, since the &quot;... boundary that separated Tabasco from Yucatán was after Sabancuy, and the first Yucatecan people was Tixel&quot;&quot;. Still in 1817 Tabasco owned the island of Carmen, Palizada and Sabancuy. However, the country&#x27;s government did not have a clear idea of the geographical location of the island, to such an extent that Iturbide, by order of September 2, 1822, made El Carmen depend on the state of Puebla. But in 1823 the restored Mexican Congress wanting to correct this error, ordered to be reinstated in the jurisdiction of Tabasco &quot; &quot;... adding the District of the Laguna de Términos&quot; &quot; to the General Command of Tabasco fact that was consumed when the Electoral Law for the elections of deputies to the Second Constituent Congress of the Nation &quot;was published on 17 June 1823. However, in August 1824, due to pressure from the Yucatán government, Carmen&#x27;s territory was segregated from Tabasco to be incorporated into Yucatán.

In 1842, the governor of Tabasco Francisco de Sentmanat, decided to invade Yucatán and took Palizada and El Carmen, segregating them from the Yucatecan jurisdiction and reinstating them to the Department of Tabasco, however, when it was overthrown, the new governor José Julián Dueñas returned the territories to Yucatán A few months later, Tabasco recovered the territory of El Carmen, when General Santa Anna decreed, on 2 October 1843, the pass of the El Carmen party to the jurisdiction of Tabasco. However, on 15 July 1854, the same general Antonio López de Santa Anna decreed the creation of the Territory of Carmen, with territory segregated to Tabasco and Yucatán, with which Tabasco was snatched almost the entire game of Usumacinta and the island of Carmen.

Later, on 4 June 1856, the governor of Tabasco José Víctor Jiménez sent a letter to the Constituent Congress of the Nation, raising his voice to request that his old limits be returned to Tabasco, &quot;... to demarcate and extend the current limits of Tabasco with the states of Chiapas, Yucatán and Veracruz&quot;. On 17 September 1856, with 77 votes in favor by 8 against, there was the dissolution of the Territory of Carmen, recovering Tabasco only the Usumacinta party, while the district of El Carmen was added to Yucatán, this resolution was embodied in the 1857 Constitution, with which Tabasco lost the territory of El Carmen.

=== Villa title ===

He was granted the title of villa by governmental provision of 2 October 1828, with his respective shield: a lion perched on the island that is eaten by the eagle; Around it bears the following legend: &quot;La Laguna by Yucatán and both by the Mexican Republic&quot;.

In 1841, the town of Carmen was granted, by decree of 26 October, the port height category because of the importance of its maritime trade. He also participated in national vicissitudes, struggles between federalists and centralists, and military conflicts. Following the fate of the peninsula, when they experience the split of the Mexican Republic in the 1840s, they chose separation and neutrality; in 1846, in the war against the United States, he followed the criteria that he had adopted on 8 December of that same year the City Hall of San Francisco de Campeche: without being oblivious to popular pressure, in a meeting he pronounced for a postponement of reinstatement until the national government is stable. The historian Bolivar points out that El Carmen was occupied by US forces, commanded by the Commodore Perry who made the line of the Parish; The state authorities contacted the occupation forces. According to Luis Ramírez Aznar, the political group of Santiago Méndez had established communication with Commodore Perry through a special shipment from José Robira, a man of Spanish nationality who had been raised in the United States and settled in Carmen; Méndez himself had visited the Commodore in the port of Veracruz. The neutrality of Yucatán was accepted on the condition of facilitating the occupation of Isla del Carmen, which would be a US base in the region because of its importance. Robira presided over a popular meeting in which the neighbors asked Commodore Perry not to withdraw from the island when peace was signed between the United States and Mexico, until the Supreme Government was in a position to care for the security and defense of Carmen. This exhibition, signed on 5 June 1848, referred to the belligerence between the two countries, as well as the Caste War that had the peninsula in alarm:
From 1848, due to the social war, the population of Carmen and Sabancuy increased; the Party would count 12,352 inhabitants in the year of 1852, added those established in Palizada. By the year 1849, there was already agricultural production by the course of Palizada, Cerillos and Atasta. The existence of trapiches allowed to process panela, sugar and brandy; rice, corn, cotton, and vegetables, onions, peanuts and sweet potatoes were grown, among others. The town of Carmen caught fire on the days of 16 to 18 March 1850. The guano of the roofs, the weather and the weakness of the buildings caused them to be swept by fire, a tragedy whose origin was suspicious. But the population survived and three years later it was planned with the impulse of the authority exercised by General Tomás Marín.

The fire left those who had been prosperous merchants in misery; An example is the disappearance of the Preciat and Gual company, which lost goods for 10,000 pesos and buildings that were calculated with a value of 30,000 pesos; or the MacGregor house, which disappeared when three buildings that cost 20,000 pesos were reduced to ashes; Domingo Trueba lost in merchandise and buildings 56,000 pesos. Others were fortunate not to lose all of their assets in the fire, and two of the most important dye stick marketers were saved: Benito Anizán and Victoriano Nieves. Esteban Paullada also saved his estate.

=== Territory of El Carmen ===

Shortly thereafter, in November 1853, only the region that comprised Isla del Carmen was declared federal territory; subsequently, its jurisdiction was extended on 15 July 1854, extending from Punta Varaderos to the San Pedro and San Pablo river, on the coast. The City of San Francisco de Campeche, at the motion of the alderman Francisco Estrada Ojeda, agreed to recommend to the Superior Government of the peninsula to make every possible effort to return the Territory of Carmen to the state; the Yucatán government asked the Constituent Congress of 1856 for the restitution of that separate party and, after some discussions, the peninsular entity was reinstated with 77 votes in favor by 8 against, which resulted in the dissolution of the territory of Carmen, recovering Tabasco and Yucatán their respective territories.

A situation that paralyzed political concerns needs to be clarified; Justo Sierra O&#x27;Reilly dealt with the points on the items at the time, remembering that only the spirit of the party and interests drove that detachment, sponsored by the dictator Antonio López de Santa Anna, whose purposes were, during 27 months of his regime, split the great states of the nation to more easily impose the yoke and the influence of centralist power.

Because of the importance acquired and its marked development, the government of the president Comonfort decreed, on 10 July 1856, the title of city for Carmen, a fact that approved the Congress of the Union on 17 September of that same year. The population, before being part of the state, had already managed to integrate its personality: among the most characteristic neighborhoods were El Guanal&quot;, which was populated by families of Palizada, Atasta and San Francisco de Campeche; the &quot;del Jesús &quot;neighborhood, that of &quot;Tila, &quot;founded by Yucatecan families who came fleeing from the Caste War; &quot;La Puntilla&quot;, of fishermen; &quot;El Salitral&quot;, close to the stream of the French, and that of &quot;Fatima, &quot;just to name a few.&quot;

=== Status creation ===
The conflict in the Yucatán Peninsula, between the politicians Méndez and Barbachano, continued, the caste war did the same.

Major difficulties in the peninsula were presented in 1857 due to irregularities in the election of the state governor, Pantaleón Barrera. Pablo García, who was then 33 years old and had been elected deputy, left the session room of the local Congress in Mérida in July, arguing falsehood of the electoral process. Immediately the uprisings began in different towns, mainly in the Campeche district, asking for new elections to be called; military forces persecuted the rebels, but placated some, others appeared. On the night of 6 August 1857, several Campechanos grouped around García and Pedro Baranda seized the bulwarks of Santiago and the Soledad in San Francisco de Campeche, as well as the artillery mastery. When the negotiations took place, they requested the dismissal of the Campeche City Council for its mendist affiliation, as well as that of the Customs administrator and other conditions that were not entirely justified. Shortly after, on 9 August, Congress and Governor Pantaleón Barrera were unknown in the minutes of that date, due to lack of freedom in the elections. They stopped City Hall and named other people. Pablo García was appointed political and military chief, and began receiving accessions from other places in the district.
García&#x27;s actions to unify in August 1857 the decision of the break with Yucatán, were not easy and he had to exercise the authority he held. Consequently, on the 19th he addressed the political chief of El Carmen asking him not to prevent the free manifestation of the lagoons, of whom he had knowledge that they wished to adhere to his project. He warned him that in order to protect the free he had instructed Captain Andrés Cepeda Peraza to disembark in Las Pilas with the forces under his command and, approaching the population, give the inhabitants an opportunity to express their opinions. Days later, thanks to Nicolás Dorantes and Ávila, García learned that he had the support of the lagoons. The fact was not peaceful, since there were victims: Jerónimo Castillo and Santiago Brito, who had resisted García&#x27;s objectives, died within the proclamation. Likewise, Pablo García separated José del Rosario Gil from the political headquarters of Carmen and sent José García y Poblaciones from Campeche, to whom he also granted the party&#x27;s military command.

From August to December 1857 numerous populations adhered to the proclamation of García and Barrera left the government in the hands of Martín F. Peraza. For all these reasons, it was no accident that in April 1858 there was a majority consensus for the creation of the new state. On 3 May 1858, the Territorial Division Agreement was signed, which among other points stipulated the respective dividing line, obligations in the war against the natives, taxes and tariffs; It was published in San Francisco de Campeche with the solemnity of the case on 15 May. Immediate consequence of the Agreement was the issuance of a four-point document whereby the Government Board of the District of Campeche and Isla del Carmen declared that it was willing to establish itself in a state, recognizing Pablo García as governor and establishing that the designation of commander would fall in Pedro Baranda; They also appointed a Governing Council that would be integrated with five members.
The final decree of the creation of the new state was issued on 29 April 1863. The state was formed with one of the Yucatecan districts: that of Campeche (the others were Mérida, Tekax, Izamal and Valladolid), the district of Campeche was formed by the parties of Carmen, Champotón, Campeche, Hecelchakán and Bolonchenticul. The first governor was Mr. Pablo García y Montilla.

=== French intervention ===

The suspension of the payment of the external debt gave the opportunity to England, Spain and France to get, again, a hegemonic place in Mexico, and sent their fleets to demand payment, arriving at Veracruz in January 1862.

On 12 February, at four in the afternoon, the French war steamer &quot;Le Granade&quot; anchored in the Bay of Carmen, with the excuse landed armaments in the month of May. The struggle between the adherents to the conservative cause and the faithful to the Republic of Juarez became manifest, a meeting of authorities and connoted persons was called and, after a vote, Carmen remained as a French colony, the liberals had Than exile from the city.

In San Francisco de Campeche forces were organized to reconquer the island, the troops of the intervention under the command of Don Pedro Pucurul arrived at Palizada and in San Joaquin they fought. Loyal Carmelites addressed a proclamation to the inhabitants of the island to resist and defend the homeland, among the first was Arturo Shields. In Carmen, nature came to the rescue and the crew of &quot;La Granade&quot; died, in its entirety, of yellow fever, the only one who was saved was Captain Hoquart.

Campeche was the last bulwark of the liberals in the peninsula and after violent fighting they were dominated by the imperialist forces, giving the arrival to the country of Maximilian and Carlota. At the end of 1865, the Empress made a trip to the peninsula arriving at Carmen on 17 December aboard the Tabasco steam.

In early 1866, Pablo Gracia and other loyal Campechens returned to Carmen, entering Tabasco, to reorganize the release of Campeche. On 23 April 1867, the liberal forces, under the command of Don Juan Carbo, and the fleet, under the command of Vicente Campan, entered Carmen to take the place, upon obtaining it they were handed over by the political prefect of the territory José María Ponce.

The state began the path of progress, a statistical report of March 1871 indicated that they had exported to Europe, in the 1861-1870s, the figure of 4 million 650 thousand 139 quintals of dye stick.

Every day there were more than 25 ships of different nationalities docked at the docks and many others were waiting to dock. The dye stick extract plant was established with Belgian and French capital and the first electric current generator for lighting in the country was installed there, it was the year 1874.

=== The Revolution ===

Obeying an economic trend, guided by the transition of land to private individuals, the Porfirio Díaz government handed over large concessions to foreign companies and connoted people in the region.

At the end of 1907, in El Carmen, two groups faced conflicting ideas, the one of friends of the Porfirian regime called &quot;Club dos de Abril&quot;, who met at the pharmacy of Don Jesus Cervera, and the other called &quot;The hornet&quot; , who met in the pharmacy of Carlos González l.

On 11 September, at the beginning of his campaign, Don Francisco I. Madero arrived by boat to Carmen from Tabasco, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Sara Pérez de Madero, from the graduates José María Pino Suárez and Serapio Rendón and other supporters and collaborators from Tabasco. At night there was a rally in Zaragoza square, where Mr. Pino Suárez, Mr. Rendón and Francisco I. Madero himself took the floor.

Once the power was reached in 1912, there was a great economic collapse, the dissatisfied against President Madero faced a frank struggle, the Porfiristas for their part, struggled to regain power, all these facts led the country to the Tragic Decade. In the state the governor Manuel Castilla Brito rebelled.

In July 1914, Victoriano Huerta&#x27;s forces were in frank defeat, Venustiano Carranza became the head of the revolution. Among the officers of the Venustiano Carranza pre-constitutional army, came the young Joaquín Mucel Acereto, who had lived in Carmen since childhood and abandoned his engineering studies at the beginning of the movement. Colonel Mucel is sent as chief of arms and governor. With the arrival of Mucel, several young Carmelites decided to enlist in the army, among them, Ramón Arcovedo, Ramón Vadillo, Alfonso Rosiñol del Valle, Benjamin Pérez, Marcos Almeida and José Ruiz.

=== From shrimp to oil ===
Between 1946 and 1947, the inhabitants of the Isla del Carmen were looking for a way out of their economic crisis, according to data from Leriche, several were the projects that had in mind, from a great hotel until a factory of buttons, of all these projects the only one that was consummated was the installation of seafood packers. While these possibilities were being discussed on the island, domestic and foreign shrimp companies increased their presence on the coasts of Carmen, where the virgin [pink shrimp] banks of the Gulf were located.

Shrimp activity had an anarchic start, somewhat chaotic; however, it would mark Carmen&#x27;s economy for the next 35 years. The benefits between this industry and those that preceded it, such as dye stick and precious wood, allowed the diversification of occupational activities in the region.
The discovery of oil, by fisherman Rudesindo Cantarell in March 1971 off the coast of Carmen, meant a new stage in the life of the city and an element of great importance in the destiny of the country.

==Culture == 
Sella Maris &quot;The star of the sea&quot; (in Latin &#x27;Stella Maris&#x27;) known as Statue of the Virgin of Carmen, is one of the most famous and visited monuments of &quot;&#x27;Ciudad del Carmen&#x27;. &quot; It is located two hundred meters from the boardwalk within the waters of the Laguna de Términos. This sculpture was inaugurated on the night of 15 July 2014 by ecclesiastical authorities and the State and municipal government before more than 15 thousand people who packed the esplanade of the monumental horn and part of the city boardwalk. The monumental structure of the &quot;&#x27;Virgen del Carmen&#x27; &quot;, one of the works sponsored by the former owner of Oceanography, Amado Yáñez Osuna. At the time, Amado Yáñez&#x27;s company reported that it allocated close to 44 million pesos in the filling and construction of the base. But, after the company&#x27;s crisis was revealed, the municipality asked the state Congress for a 40 million pesos item to conclude the works, which the legislature denied the request, so it is unknown where the remaining money came from the play.
; Details of the work

More than 15 months it took the Mexican sculptor Sergio Andrés Peraza Ávila the realization of the sculpture in honor of the Virgen del Carmen &quot;Stella Maris&quot; whose work of art the greatest in her artistic career has been the biggest challenge with more than 15 tons of bronze weight and 14 meters high, which keeps mystique and feeling in the process of its creation. To the sculptor in charge of the construction of the monument Stella Maris, he explained that it took more than 2 years to take the project to its culmination. He indicated that 4 workshops had to be created for the realization of the work of art, three mounted in a special way in Mexico City and one in Ciudad del Carmen near the Industrial Fishing Port, where the last details of the work were carried out of art. He interpreted some parts of the Stella Maris, such as the look of the image that he stares at the citizens when they begin their journey inside their facilities, just as he said that the creation of said sculpture had different challenges, as well as difficulties, so the wave that lies at the foot of the image, represents the storm that was had and the Virgin poses her foot in a delicate way to appease the waters.

The project completed in honor of the Virgen del Carmen, weighs 12 tons and measures 12 meters high, had a total consort of 70 million pesos of which Oceanography reported that it had allocated some 44 million pesos in the landfill and construction of the base.
; Final stage of construction and assembly
This work was unveiled by Governor Fernando Ortega Bernés, the mayor of Ciudad del Carmen Enrique Iván González López and Bishop José Francisco González, within the framework of the Fiesta del Carmen celebrations. During the opening ceremony, the mayor explained that the image has a weight of 12 tons and a height of 12 meters, but seated at its base rises approximately 25 meters above sea level. In his speech, the state president described the night as &quot;historic&quot; and recalled that next year marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of the mestizo culture and the beginning of the evangelization process led by the Franciscans throughout the region.

Ciudad del Carmen has historically been a natural port, which has allowed it to have a relevant position over the centuries in the commercial sphere, not only regionally but also nationally and internationally.

In the past, the concept of City and Port was closely linked since all the activity of the population moved directly or indirectly on the basis of port commercial activities, occupying the areas of docks, shipyards, and support areas, the whole front from La Puntilla to the Lighthouse of La Atalaya.

With the arrival of the Camarón boom, the Laguna Azul Fishing Port was built, located between the La Caleta estuary and the Gulf of Mexico, an installation that operated until the occurrence of two events: the increase in oil production and the decline in shrimp catch volumes.

Today, the Puerto Isla del Carmen is the port with the highest number of ship movements registered nationwide, being the axis of support work in terms of the movement of personnel, food, and materials of smaller scale in the area of oil exploitation of Campeche Bank, and it is in a stage of modernization and expansion of its facilities.

The name and veneration of the Virgin of Carmen was born in a circumstantial way, motivated by the order that Felipe V made the Viceroy of New Spain, Marquis de Valeros, for which the Windward squad joined several Campeche vessels manned by campers who were vividly interested in throwing their terrible enemies off the island, the expedition was entrusted to Don Alonso Felipe de Andrade, who achieved a glorious victory over the pirates on 16 July 1717.

The neighborhood where the fair is held is known as Guanal because years before 1900 all the houses in the place had a guano roof. On 16 July 2017, Ciudad del Carmen would be celebrating the 300th Anniversary of its foundation.

== Urbanism ==
In 2009, the Municipal Planning Institute, an organization created to promote integral and long-term development, directing the information and strategic planning processes of the municipality of Carmen, presented the Urban Director Program of Ciudad del Carmen, called: &quot;A beautiful, competitive, sustainable and inclusive city&quot;, commemorates a project execution horizon in the short, medium and long term and a review period of every three years.

Among the topics addressed in the Urban Director Program are the land use and destination planning, policies by areas and conservation, improvement and growth actions and urban development policies and guidelines for the prevention of phenomena risks natural and man-made. The urban development norms on the road structure, transport, infrastructure and public services and the secondary zoning of land uses and destinations to which urban areas and land susceptible to urbanization can be dedicated were also taken into account. In the same way, the zoning regulations that regulate in each of the zones that are established: the permitted and prohibited uses and destinations of the land, the density and intensity in the use of the land, minimum surface of urban lots, surface and height maximum that can be built, lateral construction restrictions, parking requirements and other urban structure standards. Among other things.

=== Occupation strategy of the Isla del Carmen ===
The planning approach established in the new Urban Director Program considers that:

Ciudad del Carmen is integrated into the natural area of Isla del Carmen, so it is necessary to strengthen the unity and harmonic relations between the city and its environment. In this sense, it will seek to promote the adequate development of the island complex that will ensure the patrimonial integrity of the island by promoting actions aimed at the conservation, protection and restoration of the natural environment, as well as the use of the building. According to the current conditions and the new planning instruments at the municipal and regional level, the areas previously considered as part of the urban system of cities of Carmen, can now be established as population centers that are part of a broader regional system.

In this way, Isla del Carmen is defined as the population center of Ciudad del Carmen and includes the urban area of the city with its reserve, Lagartera or Isla Media and Puerto Real. The city can be considered as an industrial and business tourism center, it will include the urban area and areas of economic activities such as services related to the exploitation of oil, but areas for economic activities will also be promoted parallel to that of Petroleum such as tourism and fishing; in the Lagartera or Media Island area, tourist use, fishing and activities related to these activities will prevail. On the other hand, Puerto Real will have a low intensity tourism development related to low impact tourism. Los programas que se consultaron en la elaboración del PDU fueron:

* Plan de Manejo de Flora y Fauna de la Laguna de Términos elaborado en 1997.
* Programa Municipal de Ordenamiento Ecológico y Territorial de Carmen, Campeche, en proceso de elaboración.
* Programa Regional de Desarrollo Turístico del Corredor Costero, Ciudad de San Francisco de Campeche-Ciudad del Carmen, en proceso.

<text>In geometry, Heron&#x27;s formula (or Hero&#x27;s formula) gives the area of a triangle in terms of the three side lengths Letting be the semiperimeter of the triangle, formula_1 the area is

formula_2

It is named after first-century engineer Heron of Alexandria (or Hero) who proved it in his work &quot;Metrica&quot;, though it was probably known centuries earlier.

==Example==
 
 


Let be the triangle with sides , , and .
This triangle&#x27;s semiperimeter is formula_3formula_4 therefore , , , and the area is
formula_5

In this example, the triangle&#x27;s side lengths and area are integers, making it a Heronian triangle. However, Heron&#x27;s formula works equally well when the side lengths are real numbers. As long as they obey the strict triangle inequality, they define a triangle in the Euclidean plane whose area is a positive real number.

== Alternate expressions ==

Heron&#x27;s formula can also be written in terms of just the side lengths instead of using the semiperimeter, in several ways,

formula_6

After expansion, the expression under the square root is a quadratic polynomial of the squared side lengths , , .

The same relation can be expressed using the Cayley–Menger determinant,

formula_7

== History ==

The formula is credited to Heron (or Hero) of Alexandria ( 60 AD), and a proof can be found in his book &quot;Metrica&quot;. Mathematical historian Thomas Heath suggested that Archimedes knew the formula over two centuries earlier, and since &quot;Metrica&quot; is a collection of the mathematical knowledge available in the ancient world, it is possible that the formula predates the reference given in that work.

A formula equivalent to Heron&#x27;s was discovered by Chinese mathematician Qin Jiushao:

formula_8

published in &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; (Qin Jiushao, 1247).

== Proofs ==
There are many ways to prove Heron&#x27;s formula, for example using trigonometry as below, or the incenter and one excircle of the triangle, or as a special case of De Gua&#x27;s theorem (for the particular case of acute triangles), or as a special case of Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula (for the case of a degenerate cyclic quadrilateral).

===Trigonometric proof using the law of cosines===
A modern proof, which uses algebra and is quite different from the one provided by Heron, follows.
Let be the sides of the triangle and the angles opposite those sides.
Applying the law of cosines we get

formula_9
From this proof, we get the algebraic statement that

formula_10

The altitude of the triangle on base has length , and it follows

formula_11

===Algebraic proof using the Pythagorean theorem===

The following proof is very similar to one given by Raifaizen.
By the Pythagorean theorem we have formula_12 and formula_13 according to the figure at the right. Subtracting these yields formula_14 This equation allows us to express in terms of the sides of the triangle:
formula_15
For the height of the triangle we have that formula_16 By replacing with the formula given above and applying the difference of squares identity we get
formula_17

We now apply this result to the formula that calculates the area of a triangle from its height:
formula_18

===Trigonometric proof using the law of cotangents===

If is the radius of the incircle of the triangle, then the triangle can be broken into three triangles of equal altitude and bases and Their combined area is
formula_19
where formula_20 is the semiperimeter.

The triangle can alternately be broken into six triangles (in congruent pairs) of altitude and bases and of combined area (see law of cotangents)
formula_21

The middle step above is formula_22formula_23 the triple cotangent identity, which applies because the sum of half-angles is formula_24

Combining the two, we get
formula_25
from which the result follows.

== Numerical stability ==
Heron&#x27;s formula as given above is numerically unstable for triangles with a very small angle when using floating-point arithmetic. A stable alternative involves arranging the lengths of the sides so that formula_26 and computing
formula_27
The extra brackets indicate the order of operations required to achieve numerical stability in the evaluation.

== Similar triangle-area formulae ==

Three other formulae for the area of a general triangle have a similar structure as Heron&#x27;s formula, expressed in terms of different variables.

First, if and are the medians from sides and respectively, and their semi-sum is formula_28 then
formula_29

Next, if , , and are the altitudes from sides and respectively, and semi-sum of their reciprocals is formula_30 then
formula_31

Finally, if and are the three angle measures of the triangle, and the semi-sum of their sines is formula_32 then
formula_33

where is the diameter of the circumcircle, formula_34 This last formula coincides with the standard Heron formula when the circumcircle has unit diameter.

== Generalizations ==
Heron&#x27;s formula is a special case of Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral. Heron&#x27;s formula and Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula are both special cases of Bretschneider&#x27;s formula for the area of a quadrilateral. Heron&#x27;s formula can be obtained from Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula or Bretschneider&#x27;s formula by setting one of the sides of the quadrilateral to zero.
Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula gives the area of a cyclic quadrilateral whose sides have lengths as

formula_35

where formula_36 is the semiperimeter.

Heron&#x27;s formula is also a special case of the formula for the area of a trapezoid or trapezium based only on its sides. Heron&#x27;s formula is obtained by setting the smaller parallel side to zero.

Expressing Heron&#x27;s formula with a Cayley–Menger determinant in terms of the squares of the distances between the three given vertices,
formula_37
illustrates its similarity to Tartaglia&#x27;s formula for the volume of a three-simplex.

Another generalization of Heron&#x27;s formula to pentagons and hexagons inscribed in a circle was discovered by David P. Robbins.

===Degenerate and imaginary triangles===
If one of three given lengths is equal to the sum of the other two, the three sides determine a degenerate triangle, a line segment with zero area. In this case, the semiperimeter will equal the longest side, causing Heron&#x27;s formula to equal zero.

If one of three given lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then they violate the triangle inequality and do not describe the sides of a Euclidean triangle. In this case, Heron&#x27;s formula gives an imaginary result. For example if and , then . This can be interpreted using a triangle in the complex coordinate plane , where &quot;area&quot; can be a complex-valued quantity, or as a triangle lying in a pseudo-Euclidean plane with one space-like dimension and one time-like dimension.

=== Volume of a tetrahedron ===
If are lengths of edges of the tetrahedron (first three form a triangle; opposite to and so on), then
formula_38
where
formula_39

===Spherical and hyperbolic geometry===
L&#x27;Huilier&#x27;s formula relates the area of a triangle in spherical geometry to its side lengths. For a spherical triangle with side lengths and , semiperimeter , and area ,
formula_40

For a triangle in hyperbolic geometry the analogous formula is
formula_41

<doc id="194124" wikidata="Q204887" url="?curid=194124" title="Pakistan International Airlines">
<text>Pakistan International Airlines, commonly known as PIA, is the flag carrier of Pakistan. With its primary hub at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, the airline also operates from its secondary hubs at Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore and at Islamabad International Airport.

Founded on 29 October 1946 by Mirza Ahmad Ispahani and Adamjee Haji Dawood as Orient Airways, the airline was initially based in Calcutta, British India, before shifting operations to the newly independent state of Pakistan in August 1947. Orient Airways was nationalised to form the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC). The new airline commenced international services in 1955 to London, via Cairo and Rome. In 1964, it became the first non-Communist airline to fly to China. The airline assisted in the establishment of Emirates in 1985. In 2004, PIA became the launch customer of the Boeing 777-200LR. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the Boeing 777-200LR to complete the world&#x27;s longest nonstop flight by a commercial airliner. This flight lasted 22 hours and 22 minutes on the eastbound route between Hong Kong and London.

PIA is Pakistan&#x27;s largest airline and operates a fleet of 33 aircraft. The airline operates a frequent flyer program, Awards +Plus. It is not part of any airline alliance. The airline operates nearly 50 flights daily, servicing 20 domestic destinations and 27 international destinations across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. It is under the administrative control of the Secretary to the Government of Pakistan for Aviation.

In addition to commercial flight operations, PIA also owns the Sofitel Paris, The Scribe Hotel in Paris, and The Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. The Roosevelt is now used as a homeless shelter.

The Government of Pakistan&#x27;s report in 2020 emphasized that after Air Marshals Nur Khan and Asghar Khan—whose tenures were regarded in aviation circles as the &quot;Golden Age of PIA&quot;—departed from their leadership roles, the airline began a downward trajectory, suffering billions in losses. Its assets declined, disciplinary issues escalated, and unions indirectly took control of management. Aircraft capable of flying were grounded, and equipment that could have been repaired was neglected.

On 30 June 2020, PIA was banned from flying in European airspace initially for six months, starting on 1 July 2020, and then indefinitely after EASA determined that the airline was not capable of certifying and overseeing its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards. This decision was made soon after it was revealed that at least a fourth of all pilots&#x27; licences issued in Pakistan were not genuine. By 9 July 2020, the airline was also banned by the United Kingdom and the United States.

On November 29, 2024, the EASA lifted its ban on PIA and other Pakistani carriers, allowing travel between Pakistan and Europe.

== Early years ==
Pakistan International Airlines can trace its origins to the days when Pakistan had not gained independence and was still part of the British Raj until 1947. In the early 1930s, Imperial Airways operated its long-haul routes by creating a lot of small airports across Africa and Asia. The Handley Page H.P.42 aircraft was Imperial Airways&#x27; first major success, as it was specially designed to handle operations from unprepared ground.

In 1945, the country&#x27;s founder Muhammed Ali Jinnah realised the need for a flag carrier for the prospective country and requested financial help from wealthy businessmen Mirza Ahmad Ispahani and Adamjee Haji Dawood for this purpose. As a result, the new airline, Orient Airways, was registered in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) on 23 October 1946. Orient became the first and only Muslim-owned airline in the British Raj.

In February 1947, the airline bought three Douglas DC-3 aircraft and obtained a licence to fly in May of the same year. The airline started its operations on 30 June 1947, offering services in British India from Calcutta to Sittwe and Rangoon (present-day Yangon).

== Post-independence ==
On 14 August 1947, Pakistan gained independence and Orient Airways started relief operations for the new country. The airline was entrusted with the task of servicing air routes between East and West Pakistan. By 1949, Orient acquired three Convair CV-240s to service the Karachi-Delhi-Kolkata-Dhaka route and became the first Asian airline to operate Convair aircraft.

=== 1950s ===
Orient&#x27;s traffic continuously declined until 1953 as Great Britain&#x27;s BOAC had been granted rights to carry passengers between the two wings of Pakistan, while two other local competitors also began serving Orient routes. As a result of losses, the Pakistani government began subsidising Orient&#x27;s operations through a 1952 contract for the purchase of three Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations registered to the government&#x27;s newly established subsidiary, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), at the cost of 25 million rupees. PIA had been established as a department of Pakistan&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority, and was tasked with operation and maintenance of the new Lockheed aircraft.

Pakistan&#x27;s government established the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation through the merger of Orient Airways with Pakistan International Airlines on 1 October 1953 by an interim joint operating agreement in which the government assumed financial control of the airline, while Orient&#x27;s operations and ground assets could be complemented by the aircraft of Pakistan International Airlines – although Orient Airways continued to operate under its name for a few more years.

Pakistan&#x27;s Ministry of Defence took over operations from the Civil Aviation Authority in early 1954, while the chairman of Orient Airways became the CEO of PIA, and foreign staff brought in to help relaunch the airline. On 7 June 1954, Orient Airways began nonstop flight services between East and West Pakistan, with service from Karachi to Dhaka using Pakistan International Airlines&#x27; Lockheed aircraft that had been ordered in 1952 and delivered in early 1954. The route was subsidised by the government so that middle-class Pakistanis could afford to fly the route, with rates that may have been the lowest in the world at the time. The airline also introduced two new domestic routes: Karachi–Lahore–Peshawar and Karachi–Quetta–Lahore.

On 11 March 1955, Orient Airways and Pakistan International Airlines were formally merged as part of the &quot;Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ordinance, 1955.&quot; Orient Airways ceased operations while the Government of Pakistan took a majority holding in the airline. The new PIA had a fleet of three L-I049C Super Constellations, two Convair CV-240s, and eleven DC-3s.

The newly relaunched airline also inaugurated its first international route, Karachi-London Heathrow Airport via Cairo and Rome, using the newly acquired Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellations. The airline continued using DC-3s on domestic routes in Pakistan. PIA carried 113,165 passengers in 1955 – 50% higher than in 1954.

In May 1956, PIA ordered five Vickers Viscount 815s. The airline also entered into a partnership with PanAm to train PIA&#x27;s personnel in 1956. In 1957–1958, passenger numbers rose to 208,000, necessitating the purchase of two additional Lockheed Super Constellations. The appointment of Air Marshal Nur Khan as the managing director of PIA in 1959 heralded an era of success for PIA.

=== 1960s ===
In February 1960, PIA wet-leased a Boeing 707 from Pan American Airlines and introduced it onto the Karachi-London route on 7 March 1960 initially using Pan Am pilots, thereby becoming the second Asian airline to induct and commercially operate a jet aircraft in its fleet after Air India. An all-Pakistani crew began operation of the 707 from 20 June 1960 onwards. By the end of 1960, PIA, for the first time, entered financial profitability.

With the newly acquired aircraft, the airline introduced its first trans-Atlantic route Karachi-New York JFK (then known as Idlewild) via London Heathrow on 5 May 1961, which was suspended in February 1963. In 1961, it expanded its fleet by placing orders for 3 Boeing 720s, which were delivered in 1962. On 2 January 1962, a PIA Boeing 720B flown by Captain Abdullah Beg from London to Karachi established a world record for speed over a commercial airline route of 938.78 km/h (582.98 mph), a record which still holds to this day. Fokker F27 Friendships, and Sikorsky helicopters were also ordered and delivered in 1963, with the helicopters used to provide air service to 20 towns in East Pakistan until 1966.

The helicopters were retired in 1966 and a reduced network of eight cities was served by Fokker F27 aircraft. Upon the establishment of ties between Pakistan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, PIA started flying the Dhaka-Guangzhou-Shanghai route on 29 April 1964, becoming the first airline of a non-communist country flying to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. On 10 May 1964, PIA became the first non-Soviet airline offering flights to Europe via Moscow.

At the outbreak of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Pakistani Armed Forces used PIA&#x27;s services for logistics and transport purposes. The Viscounts were phased out in 1966 and were replaced by four Hawker Siddeley Tridents.

PIA&#x27;s route network grew rapidly in the mid to late 1960s: Dhahran was added in 1965, while Cairo services resumed. In 1966, Paris, Istanbul, Baghdad, Kuwait, Jeddah and Nairobi were added to PIA&#x27;s routes. Bangkok was added in 1967, while Manila, Tokyo, and Damascus were added in 1969.

During a news conference in Karachi on 11 May 1967, Air Marshal Asghar Khan announced that the airline had become the fifth largest profit-making airline in the world, carrying one million passengers annually. At a press conference held at the PIA headquarters in Karachi in July 1967, Asghar Khan announced plans for the construction of a series of small hotels in major cities and resort areas across the country, with a total investment of PKR 44.5 million (approximately $9,345,000). The project included building 64-room hotels in Sylhet, Sargodha, Sukkur, Mohenjo-daro, Chitral, Gilgit, and Kaptai, and 88-room hotels in Khulna, Lyallpur, Multan, and Murree, with an additional 20 cottages attached to the new 644 room Kaptai Hotel. Furthermore, Peshawar and Chittagong will each have hotels with 125 rooms. 

These establishments are designed to be European-style motels equipped with modern amenities such as air conditioning, heating, parking facilities, and swimming pools. The cost of rooms would range from twenty to thirty Pakistani rupees, approximately four to five dollars per person, depending on the room type. The hotels were completed in 1970. A new holding company was established to attract domestic investment for this venture, in addition to forming small companies in the cities where the hotels will be located. For the foreign exchange portion, which constitutes 20% of the total cost, successful discussions were conducted with the Export-Import Bank. The entire project relied on private investment, with no financial participation from the Government of Pakistan. Air Marshal Asghar Khan mentioned that the PIA Board of Directors approved an investment of approximately Rs. 10 million for the project. Pakistan Services Ltd., which operated the Intercontinental hotel chain, contributed significantly. Local municipal bodies were approached for investment as well. Bechtel Corp. of New York prepared the design and cost estimates for the proposed motels. To ensure cost-effectiveness and timely execution, it was recommended that a standardized design be used for all the motels, utilizing local materials, equipment, and expertise as much as possible. 

=== 1970s ===
On 3 December 1971, a French national&#x27;s attempt to hijack a PIA flight from Paris to Karachi was thwarted by French security forces. Transatlantic flights to New York City were resumed in May 1972 with a stopover in Europe. With the establishment of cordial ties between the Libyan and Pakistani governments in the early 1970s, PIA added Tripoli to its network in 1972. PIA also signed an agreement with Yugoslav airline JAT (today known as Air Serbia) in 1972 to lease two PIA Boeing 707s to JAT.

PIA acquired McDonnell Douglas DC-10s in 1973 to replace its remaining Boeing 707-300s. Nur Khan was appointed as PIA executive for the second term in 1974. In 1974, PIA launched Pakistan International Cargo, offering air freight and cargo services.

The latter half of the decade witnessed a further expansion of PIA&#x27;s fleet with the introduction of Boeing 747s, with its first two aircraft leased from TAP Air Portugal in 1976. By 1976–7, PIA carried 2.2 million passengers, compared to 698,000 in 1972–3. Revenues in 1976 rose sharply compared to 1975, with the airline revenues of $134 million in the July–December period of 1976. On 20 January 1978, a PIA Fokker 27 was hijacked en route to Karachi from Sukkur.

For the first time since its inauguration, PIA started providing technical and administrative assistance or leased aircraft to foreign airlines including Air China, Air Malta, Choson Minhang (today known as Air Koryo), Philippine Airlines, Somali Airlines, and Yemenia. A subsidiary of PIA also started providing hotel management services in the United Arab Emirates towards the end of the decade. Political upheaval in Pakistan in the late 1970s began to impact PIA&#x27;s operations negatively.

=== 1980s ===
The 1980s saw a continuation of PIA growth. The decade began with the opening of a cargo handling centre at Karachi airport, duty-free shops, the first C and D safety checks on its entire fleet, as well as the introduction of the airline&#x27;s first Airbus A300B4-200 aircraft. In 1981, PIA had an employee workforce of almost 24,000, which despite being reduced to 20,000 by 1983 still resulted in PIA having the world&#x27;s highest ratio of employees to aircraft. PIA&#x27;s operations became increasingly de-centralised during the early 1980s, with responsibilities being split between new departments. Despite de-centralisation, PIA reported its highest ever profits in 1981-82, followed by record profits again in 1983-84.

In 1984, the airline introduced the Night Coach service as a low-cost alternative to day-time domestic flights. In the following years, PIA Planetarium was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetaria in Lahore and Peshawar. These planetariums featured retired PIA aircraft on display for educational and observational purposes. Two more retired Boeing 720B aircraft were donated to the planetaria in Karachi and later on Lahore. PIA profits again rose in 1984–5.

In June 1985, PIA became the first Asian airline to operate the Boeing 737-300 aircraft, after six of the aircraft were delivered. Pakistan International Airlines also played a significant role in establishing UAE&#x27;s Emirates airline in 1985 by providing technical and administrative assistance to the new carrier as well as leasing a new Boeing 737–300 and an Airbus A300B4-200. In late 1987 and early 1988, services to Malé, Manchester, and Toronto were introduced.

=== 1990s ===
PIA began to sustain operating losses and liquidity problems throughout the 1990s due to frequent pilot strikes, issues with various vendors, over-staffing, and political interference in airline management. In 1990, First Officer Maliha Sami became the first female pilot of PIA when she took off on the Karachi-Panjgur-Turbat-Gwadar route. In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six Airbus A310-300s. With the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to Tashkent in 1992 and to Zürich in 1993.

In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An Open Skies agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put enormous pressure on PIA&#x27;s financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist &#x27;Air Safari&#x27; scenic flight over the Karakoram Mountains in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku, and Al-Ain to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight reservation systems, namely: SABRE, Galileo, and Amadeus.

A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747–300 aircraft from Cathay Pacific to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.

=== 2000s ===
The War in Afghanistan following the attacks on 11 September 2001 negatively impacted PIA&#x27;s operations as Afghan airspace was closed. However, following the restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable. Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000 and 2003, and lower engineering and maintenance costs led to enhanced airline revenue.

In July 2002, PIA purchased six Boeing 747–300 aircraft from Cathay Pacific, five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight Boeing 777 aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range), and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.

Boeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven ATR 42-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world&#x27;s longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometres on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes – a record which still stands as of late 2019. On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease. The same year, Ayesha Rabia Naveed became the first woman to captain a scheduled commercial flight. The following year, she captained a flight with the first all-woman crew. On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.

On 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military Lockheed C-130 Hercules for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the PIA Flight 688 accident.

Under the careful supervision and guidance of Mr. Syed Shah, who was serving as the Station Manager at the time, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) initiated the induction of long-range 777 aircraft into its fleet. This pivotal move allowed PIA to offer non-stop flights from Toronto to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore, beginning on 3 March 2006.

The introduction of the long-range 777 aircraft into PIA&#x27;s fleet marked a significant milestone in the airline&#x27;s history.

As a result of this strategic decision, PIA was able to offer a more efficient and seamless travel experience for its passengers, enabling them to travel non-stop to their desired destinations in Pakistan. This move also positioned PIA as a prominent player in the aviation industry, further cementing its reputation as a reliable and customer-centric airline. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, Washington, and Houston but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.

A PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45. A government inquiry afterward blamed aging aircraft for the crash. Houston services also ended in 2006. Following the crash, on 5 March 2007, the European Commission banned all but 9 of PIA&#x27;s 42-strong fleet from flying to Europe, citing safety concerns over its ageing aircraft. The fleet of Boeing 777s was exempted from the ban, but 15 aircraft were over 20 years old by this point. PIA claimed that the ban was discriminatory and unjustifiable.

The ban on some of the aircraft was lifted after four months on 5 July 2007, following an inspection by the European Union Air Safety Administration. Of the eleven aircraft allowed to resume operations to the EU, five were Boeing 747-300s, and the remaining six were Airbus A310-300s. On 29 November 2007, the EU completely removed the ban, and PIA&#x27;s entire fleet was permitted to fly to Europe.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, PIA altered its livery. The tail design was replaced with a much larger version of the Pakistan national flag and added the text &quot;Pakistan International&quot; in gold writing underneath the large billboard-style PIA on the fuselage. The green stripe was modified to include gold and was extended to the rear of the fuselage.

By 2011, PIA began to be unprofitable again, requiring government subsidies.

In 2014, PIA leased four Boeing 737-800s. PIA also issued a request for tender for four Boeing 777-300ERs, however, the bids for the 777s were not accepted. The airline did lease Airbus A320 aircraft and inducted two A320-214s in its fleet in 2014. Another wet-leased A320-211s joined PIA on 11 August 2014. In October 2014, the airline again wet-leased three Boeing 737-800s, and it also accepted bids to dry lease five ATR 72–500s for eight years. In 2015, after serving PIA for 16 years, the last of PIA&#x27;s Boeing 747-300s were phased out.

In early 2016, PIA was fundamentally grounded for an entire week as employees walked out en masse following the deaths of two employees in a demonstration against the airline&#x27;s privatization. In August 2016, PIA launched a new &quot;Premier Service&quot; for flights to London, using an Airbus A330-300 wet-leased from SriLankan Airlines. The wet-lease period ended after six months, and as a result, the A330-300 was returned to SriLankan Airlines, and the Premier Service discontinued. By the end of 2016, the airline was saddled with $3 billion in debt.

In January 2017, PIA retired all of the Airbus A310-300s from its fleet. For replacement, PIA leased four Boeing 737-800s from Pegasus Airlines, which were returned later on completion of the lease period. After over 50 years of service, PIA service to New York ended in October 2017 as a result of TSA regulation preventing nonstop flights from Pakistan and the US, leaving Toronto as PIA&#x27;s only destination in North America – which continues to be served by nonstop flights from Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.

In 2017, PIA decided to replace its reservation and ticketing system &quot;Sabre&quot; with a Turkish-origin system called &quot;Hitit&quot;. Both PIA &amp; Hitit signed an agreement and in September 2018, the airline successfully switched to the new system. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3 billion in debt, up from $2.97 the year before, and thus requiring government bailouts for continued operation. With the demise of Shaheen Air, PIA launched routes that had previously been served only by Shaheen.

New profitable routes were launched in 2019, while profitable routes such as Karachi-Toronto saw increased frequencies. six unprofitable routes were discontinued in 2019. In April 2019, PIA claimed that its revenues almost matched operating costs. Later that year following a visit of TSA officials to the Islamabad International Airport in July 2019, PIA expressed hope that non-stop flights to the US would be permitted. In August 2019, PIA laid off 1,000 &quot;redundant employees&quot;. In September, PIA announced that it would lease additional aircraft to increase the airline&#x27;s fleet to 37 by 2020, and 45 by 2023. By the end of 2019, PIA reported a 41% increase in year-on-year revenue due to discontinuation of unprofitable routes, reintroduction of grounded aircraft, and a sharp increase in cargo-space utilization.

=== 2020s ===

For the first time in its history, PIA operated a relief flight from Lahore to Melbourne, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 22 May 2020, a PIA Airbus A320-214 AP-BLD, crashed near Karachi airport with 99 people on board. The flight was en route to Karachi from Lahore. Flight PK8303, carrying 91 passengers and eight crew members on board, crashed while on the descent towards the runway of Jinnah International Airport, killing 97 while two passengers survived. The cause of the crash was due to the aircraft being badly damaged in the first belly landing, with both engines flaming out during the go-around. The final report listed following as the primary reasons: human error, non-adherence to SOPs and disregard of ATC instructions during the event flight, lack of communication between the ATC and the flight crew.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) communicated concerns over the &quot;serious lapse in licensing and safety oversight by the aviation regulator&quot;.

In November 2020, PIA shut down its courier arm, SpeedEx, whose infrastructure was scattered over 74 domestic destinations, and laid off its 320 employees.

In December 2020, PIA announced a plan to lay off half of its employees and transferred its engineering arm, Precision Engineering Complex (PEC), to the Pakistan Air Force.

==== Pilot licensing scandal ====
On 24 June 2020, Pakistani aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan told Parliament that 262 of Pakistan&#x27;s 860 active, licensed pilots had been found to have suspicious or fake licences. They were suspected of having paid someone else to take their certification examination on their behalf. PIA subsequently grounded 150 of its 434 pilots on suspicion of having a bogus license. Later, the employment of seven pilots was terminated.

On 30 June, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) revoked PIA&#x27;s &#x27;third part authorisation&#x27;, subsequently banning PIA from flying in European airspace for six months from the following day, following multiple safety failings.

On 9 July 2020, the United States banned the airline because of concerns about its certification of pilots. By that date, PIA was also banned from flights in the United Kingdom, and Pakistani pilots in Vietnam and Malaysia were grounded on a temporary basis. Reports on 16 July 2020 stated that the US Federal Aviation Administration downgraded Pakistan&#x27;s air safety rating to category 2. This decision &quot;means no Pakistani airlines can establish new services to the United States or codeshare with US airlines&quot;.

On 18 July, PIA dismissed seven pilots and one member of cabin crew whose licences had been revoked by the country&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

On 28 December, the EU ban was extended for three more months, stating that an official inspection of the CAA would have to be performed first. On 16 March 2021, the ban was extended to July. Less than a month later, the ban was extended indefinitely, following another safety concern regarding the CAA that was made public by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). ICAO has yet to perform safety audit of the CAA. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) stated that the ICAO&#x27;s safety audit would be a sign of improvement.

On 6 November 2021, the first sign of improvement appeared when the CAA received positive feedback from Europe&#x27;s Safety Audit for Foreign-Origin Aircraft (SAFA).

Further improvement was made on 8 March 2023, when PIA completed an online safety audit conducted by EASA.

On 29 November 2024, EASA lifted the EU ban on PIA, citing improvements in the CAA&#x27;s oversight. PIA subsequentially announced the resumption of flights to Europe, beginning with a flight to Paris that took off on 10 January 2025. However, PIA subsequently apologised after it released an advertisement for the event, which was criticised for using imagery reminiscent of the September 11 attacks and led to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announcing an inquiry.

==== Canceled flights due to unpaid fuel bills ====
In late 2023, PIA was forced to cancel numerous flights due to unpaid fuel bills. Resulting cancelations resulted in multiple instances of customer anger creating viral social media content. State-owned Pakistan State Oil suspended fueling of PIA aircraft after PIA&#x27;s request for additional government funding was denied.

In late December 2023, the Interim government announced a plan to privatize the airline. During a question hour in Senate, the adviser to Prime Minister on Aviation Air Marshal (Retd) Farhat Hussain Khan that said privatization of Pakistan International Airlines is being carried out under the government&#x27;s policy to privatize loss making entities. The Adviser said that initially PIA will be privatized as a flight entity and the decision on its other properties will be decided later.

==== Expansion to the Middle East ====
On 6 January 2025, it was reported that PIA will be expanding its number of destinations to the Middle East by deploying its fleet of Boeing 777 and Airbus A320 aircraft. From 20 January 2025 onward, PIA will be offering two weekly flights between Sialkot and Bahrain. Another two weekly flights will be operated between Lahore and Dammam beginning 22 January 2025 while a once-a-week flight will commence on 25 January 2025 between Lahore and Kuwait. Besides, PIA will also introduce weekly flight from Faisalabad to Jeddah starting 20 January 2025 and another weekly service between Sialkot and Doha, Qatar from 21 January 2025.

== Corporate management ==
=== Structure ===
Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) is majority-owned by the Government of Pakistan (86%) while the remainder (14%) is owned by private shareholders. The airline is under the administration of Aviation Division and is managed by a president and chief executive officer as well as the board of directors.

The board consists of nine independent non-executive members and has four sub-committees: an Audit Committee, Brand and Advertising Committee, Finance Committee, and Human Resource Committee, each having its charter and chairman. The president and chief executive officer leads the executive management of staff who run the airline. The airline&#x27;s main headquarters are located at Karachi, while smaller subhead offices are located in several cities within Pakistan.

Seven of PIA&#x27;s ten departments are in Islamabad, viz, Marketing Department, Procedure Bureau, Central Reservation Control, Revenue Management, HR and Security and Vigilance Department. The remaining three departments are in Karachi, namely finance, engineering and situation room.

=== Privatisation ===
In the late 1990s, the Government of Pakistan announced privatisation plans due to the persistent losses suffered by the airline, but they were never implemented; however, several steps towards the outsourcing of non-core businesses were initiated. Catering units (starting with Karachi Flight Kitchen), ground handling (starting with ramp services) and engineering, are to gradually leave the airline and operate as independent companies. In 1997, Pakistan called in a team from International Finance (IFC), the consulting arm of the World Bank, to advise on restructuring and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, no agreement was reached. Despite the government&#x27;s multiple privatisation plans, on 18 February 2009, the carrier was dropped from the privatisation list.

In 2013, the Government of Pakistan once again aimed to privatise the airline due to increased losses by selling twenty-six percent of shares and management control to the investor. This plan was dropped due to protests by airline unions and associations after security forces killed two employees approaching the Jinnah International Airport terminal building.

In 2018, the newly elected government aimed to not privatise the entity and instead achieve profitability through the change in its top management.

On 6 February 2024, the Caretaker Cabinet of the interim Government decided to split different functions of Pakistan International Airlines into two entities to make it attractive for investors. These entities were named TopCo and HoldCo. TopCo was allocated basic functions, including engineering, ground handling, and flight kitchen and training. HoldCo was given Precision Engineering Complex, PIA Investment Limited and subordinate departments and properties.

On 4 June 2024, the government pre qualified 6 companies to bid for the privatization of Pakistan International Airlines. these companies were Air Blue, Arif Habib Corporation, Blue World City, Fly Jinnah, Pak Ethanol (Pvt) Consortiums, and YB Holdings Consortiums. 

=== Financial and operational performance ===
In 2011, PIA began to be unprofitable, requiring government subsidies. By the end of 2016, the airline was saddled with $3 billion in debt. At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3 billion in debt, up from $2.97 the year before, and thus requiring government bailouts for continued operation. In April 2019, PIA claimed that its revenues almost matched operating costs. An audit in September 2019 revealed that PIA had operated 46 empty flights between 2016 and 2017, without any passengers causing a loss of $1.1 million to the airline. Additionally, 36 Hajj flights were flown without any passengers. By the end of 2019, PIA reported a 41% increase in year-on-year revenue due to discontinuation of unprofitable routes, reintroduction of idle aircraft, and a sharp increase in the airline cargo space utilization.

The airline faces many challenges to its profitability. PIA, along with Etihad, were once considered one of the cheapest airlines in the GCC. Pakistan faces what has been termed &quot;capacity dumping&quot; by Middle East airlines, who operate numerous daily flights to every major city in Pakistan. Pakistan&#x27;s Open Skies Agreement with the UAE, for example, allows Emirati airlines an unlimited number of seats into Karachi, with Emirates airline alone operating up to seven daily flights to Karachi from Dubai on high-capacity Boeing 777s. PIA also discontinued previously profitable routes to the US, as the TSA forbade nonstop flights from Pakistan to the US, and instead required costly diversions to European airports for immigration clearance – resulting in flight times that were significantly longer than flights on Middle Eastern airlines. New routes such as to Najaf and Bangkok also did not improve the airline&#x27;s finances given the seasonality of those destinations. Further, staffing levels and overall management issues, including an employee count of 18,014 in 2010 for a fleet of 40 aircraft, present further challenges, although in August 2019, PIA laid off 1,000 &quot;redundant employees&quot;.

== Livery ==
In December 2003, PIA introduced a new image that was applied to its first Boeing 777-200ER and on two newly leased Airbus A310s, one of which was in service. The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism, the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. The tail logo was replaced by a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. The &quot;Pakistan&quot; titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.

In early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The &quot;Frontier&quot; tail represented the &quot;Phulkari&quot; (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The &quot;Punjab&quot; tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore. The &quot;Balochistan&quot; tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The &quot;Sindh&quot; tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.

PIA launched its new livery in mid April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777–200 and Boeing 747–300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, &#x27;PIA&#x27; was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.

In July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a &quot;crescent and star&quot; on the aircraft engines&#x27; cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.

In April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the Markhor in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan&#x27;s national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand.

The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of &#x27;Kashmiri Markhor&#x27; endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the &quot;PIA&quot; acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. Urdu PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline&#x27;s slogan was also changed to &quot;We Fly at the Right Attitude&quot; from &quot;Great People to Fly With&quot;. The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hangar by the method of decals to make a debut at the New Islamabad International Airport. The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The Supreme Court of Pakistan &quot;suo motu&quot; notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. The Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed of the case. However, with a management change, the re-branding was abandoned altogether. Currently, the airline is operating a hybrid livery which features a euro-white fuselage and gold Urdu logo in-front of the front exits and engine cowling while the flag tail, English PIA (and Pakistan International in gold) titles in dark green and Pakistan titles in dark green on the belly have been retained from the 2010 livery. The PIA corporate website was also added ahead of the aft exits. Currently, five Boeing 777s and three A320s are sporting this livery.

== Services ==
=== Catering ===

PIA Catering is the main supplier of meals for the airline at Islamabad and Karachi. It can produce 15,000 passenger meals each day. In 2006, the management of the flight kitchens was given to Singapore Air Terminal Services (SATS). This agreement ended in 2011 and PIA is managing the Flight Kitchens in Karachi and Islamabad itself. As of April 2019, an MOU was signed between PIA and McDonald&#x27;s for the airlines catering. PIA Catering provides special meals to allow for passengers&#x27; dietary and religious needs. No alcoholic beverages or pork are served on board due to Islamic dietary laws.

=== PIA Premier service ===
PIA Premier was launched as a luxury air service on 14 August 2016. An Airbus A330 aircraft was initially wet-leased from SriLankan Airlines to operate the service. There were six weekly flights to London, three each from Islamabad and Lahore. However, it was soon diminished due to a loss of 2.1 billion rupees.

=== In-flight entertainment ===
Pakistan International Airlines was the first international airline to introduce entertainment system showing a regularly scheduled film on board in the year 1962.

=== In-flight Internet ===

== Cargo operations ==
PIA operates a cargo delivery system within Pakistan. PIA Cargo transports goods across Pakistan as well as to international destinations. These goods include meat and vegetables, textiles, paper products, laboratory equipment and postal mail.

During the early 1970s, PIA operated a service called Air Express that delivered documents and parcels within Pakistan. In 1974, PIA launched a dedicated cargo division within its organisation using two Boeing 707-320C. This division was known as Pakistan International Cargo. The airline operated several cargo flights to the Middle East such as Dubai and Europe, especially London. The operations ended in the late 1990s when both aircraft were phased out. During 2004 to 2007, the airline again operated two Airbus A300 Freighter aircraft chartered through MNG Airlines to Haan. Luton, Amsterdam, Basel and Cologne. However, again the contract ended and PIA discontinued this service.

In 2003, the airline launched PIA Speedex, a courier service initially in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad. This expanded to twelve cities within a year. Today, the airline serves over 70 locations within Pakistan, with shipments collected and delivered from customers homes.

In 2019, the new PIA management experienced a sharp increase in the airline&#x27;s cargo space utilization, from 20 percent to almost 80 percent.

PIA currently offers cargo service for these international destinations: Abu Dhabi, Bangkok, Barcelona, Birmingham, China – Beijing, Copenhagen, Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, London, Manchester, Medina, Milan, Muscat, Najaf, Oslo, Paris, Riyadh, Sharjah, Tokyo – Narita and Toronto – Canada.

== Corporate sponsorship ==
The airline has sponsored events, both within Pakistan and in its overseas markets.

In the 1990s, the airline launched the three green stripe livery to represent its support for sports. The airline supports the Pakistan International Airlines first-class cricket team that plays in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy and Patron&#x27;s Trophy. PIA sponsors the PIA football club, and the A1 Team Pakistan in the A1 Grand Prix motorsports championship series of open-wheel auto racing series when it was initially launched. The airline also promotes the Shandur Polo Gala, that takes place every year in the Chitral and Gilgit regions of northern Pakistan during the summer period. PIA has had its own sports division since 1958, promoting sports within Pakistan such as cricket, hockey, football, squash, polo, tennis, bridge, chess, table tennis, cycling, and bodybuilding.

PIA has its own Boy Scouts Association (PIA-BSA), working in partnership with Pakistan Boy Scouts Association. After a devastating earthquake in 2005, PIA-BSA worked in partnership with other charity organisations to provide relief help.

PIA was one of the official sponsors of the &quot;Destination Pakistan 2007&quot; festivals. The official logo was added to a select number of aircraft during the year. In 2008, PIA teamed up with mobile phone provider, Ufone to provide air miles to passengers who used the mobile network. Standard Chartered Bank and PIA launched credit cards allowing passengers to earn air miles. In 2009, PIA was the gold sponsor for Logistics Pakistan, an exhibition and conference poised to highlight the emerging opportunities for the Logistics sector in Pakistan. In 2009, PIA and the Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) formed a strategic alliance to promote world money transfers.

PIA has Planetariums in Karachi and Lahore that enable the public to see static aircraft as well as astronomy shows. PIA Horticulture, set up in 1996, provides flowers for display in PIA&#x27;s offices and events, winning awards and accolades at flower exhibitions across the country. The airline supports non-profit organisations within Pakistan such as Al-Shifa Trust, Zindagi Trust, The Citizens Foundation, and Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation. In 2009, PIA teamed up with the fast-food franchise McDonald&#x27;s, to offer passengers discounts on meals and upgrades. PIA also owns three hotels, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Scribe Hotel and Skyrooms (Private) Limited. The airline also has an agreement with Pearl Continental Hotels for its UAE based passengers.

== Charter and special services ==
=== State officials transportation ===
PIA has been continuously serving government officials of Pakistan and has always transported the President and Prime Minister on overseas visits. During the late 1990s, a PIA Boeing 737–300 was used for official visits by the Bhutto and Sharif governments. The aircraft wore official government colours but was later repainted in the airline official colours at the end of the decade. When the government changed after a military coup in 1999, the Boeing 737–300 was transferred to PIA permanently. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of PIA&#x27;s Airbus A310-300s for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In February 2007 the government of Qatar gifted an Airbus A310 from its VIP fleet to the Pakistani government; this ended the need for the use of PIA aircraft. However, from time to time the government uses one of the airline&#x27;s Airbus A320s, or occasionally a Boeing 777, for official trips.

=== Charter services ===
PIA operates private charter flights using ATR 42s to Bhit, Kadanwari and Sehwan Sharif in Sindh as well as to other parts of the country for oil and gas companies and other customers. Ad hoc charters for United Nations peacekeeping troops are also carried out to Africa and Eastern Europe, Asia (South Korea, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, East Timor) and many other international destinations; PIA Charter Team provides these services.

=== Hajj and Umrah operations ===
PIA operates a two-month (pre- and post-) Hajj operation each year to and from Saudi Arabia. PIA transported over 100,000 intending pilgrims each year to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia until its fleet shrank to 25 aircraft in 2011–2012. Since then, the airline&#x27;s Hajj quota was reduced to 60,000 to 70,000 pilgrims by the then government.

Special services

A PIA plane carrying desperately needed medical supplies landed in Afghanistan on Monday, the World Health Organisation said, the first such flight since the Taliban took control of the country two weeks prior. He further thanked Pakistan for providing the Boeing 777 plane for the delivery. It was the first of three flights planned with PIA, and the WHO said it was working to ensure &quot;this week&#x27;s shipment is the first of many&quot;. PIA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Arshad Malik said it was the national flag carrier&#x27;s &quot;moral responsibility&quot; to help people in Afghanistan. &quot;PIA will continue humanitarian missions on the instructions of the Pakistan government and the aviation minister,&quot; he said in a statement.

==Awards and recognition==
On 27 September 2024, PIA received Pakistan&#x27;s first National Tourism Award for Promoting Travel and Tourism. The award was given to PIA in recognition of its outstanding work promoting domestic travel. At Pakistan&#x27;s First National Tourism Awards, organized by Discover Pakistan, Air Vice Marshal Amir Hayat, CEO of PIA, received the award.

== Accidents and incidents ==
The airline has lost more than 30 aircraft in crashes and other events, including 20 fatal crashes. There have also been at least eight hijacking incidents involving the airline&#x27;s aircraft between 1971 and 2017.

* In October 1952, an Orient Airways flight carrying cargo from Karachi to Dacca crashed. One of three was killed in this crash.
* On Monday 3 August 1953, the Douglas DC-3 registered AP-AAD was operating on a hajj flight, carrying pilgrims from Karachi to Jeddah via Sharjah and Bahrain. The leg to Bahrain was to be flown by the first officer from the left-hand seat. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft entered a steep descending turn. The captain took over control but could not recover the aircraft. The Douglas DC-3 struck the ground. One of 25 was killed in this crash. &quot;The accident resulted from the loss of control of the aircraft by the first officer shortly after taking off on a dark night when instrument flying was necessary. This loss of control was due to the inability of the first officer to fly on instruments. The responsibility for the accident is attributed to the captain for failing to supervise the piloting of the aircraft by the first officer.&quot;
* Pakistan International Airlines experienced its first recorded hull loss in 1956: a Douglas DC-3 flew into a mountain on 25 February while on a cargo flight from Gilgit to Islamabad in poor weather, killing the three crew members on board.
* On 1 July 1957, a Douglas DC-3 registered AP-AJS, operating a domestic flight from Chittagong to Dhaka in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), crashed on a mudflat in the Bay of Bengal, killing all 20 passengers and four crew members on board.
* On 15 May 1958, a Convair CV-240 with the registration AP-AEH, operating as Flight 205 from Delhi to Karachi, crashed and caught fire moments after it took off from Delhi&#x27;s Palam Airport on a moonless night in dusty conditions. The investigation attributed the crash to the captain experiencing a night somatogravic illusion, resulting in the aircraft descending shortly after it became airborne. Four of the six crew members and 21 of the 38 passengers on board were killed; two people on the ground were also killed.
* On 18 May 1959, a four-month-old Vickers Viscount with the registration AP-AJC was damaged beyond economic repair in a landing accident at Islamabad International Airport. The aircraft ran off the runway into a rainwater channel; there were no fatalities.
* Three months after the first Viscount crash, the airline lost another on 14 August 1959. The Viscount (registered AP-AJE) crashed at Karachi International Airport during a pilot training flight, while attempting an overshoot with two engines inoperative. Two of the three people on board were killed.
* On 26 March 1965 a Douglas DC-3 registered AP-AAH crashed in mountainous terrain near the Lowari Pass on a domestic flight from Peshawar to Chitral, killing the four crew members and 18 of the 22 passengers on board.

* Eight weeks later, on 20 May 1965, a Boeing 720 operating as Flight 705 crashed while descending to land on Runway 34 at Cairo International Airport, resulting in 121 fatalities.
* On 8 October 1965 a Fokker F27 Friendship, with less than 500 hours&#x27; flying time since it was delivered new to the airline earlier in the year, crashed while on a domestic cargo flight from Rawalpindi to Skardu. The aircraft (registered AP-ATT) hit a ridge near the village of Patian and slid down its side, the remains coming to rest more than below the impact point. The four crew members on board were killed.
* On 2 February 1966 Flight 17, operated by a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter, crashed on a scheduled domestic flight in East Pakistan after the main gearbox failed, killing 23 of the 24 passengers and crew on board.
* On 6 August 1970, a Fokker F27 Friendship registered AP-ALM, operating a domestic flight from Rawalpindi to Lahore, crashed at high speed a few minutes after taking off from Rawalpindi in stormy weather. All 26 passengers and four crew members on board were killed.
*On 3 December 1971, a French national&#x27;s attempt to hijack a Boeing 720B flight from Paris to Karachi was thwarted by French security forces. 
* On 8 December 1972, a Fokker F27 Friendship registered AP-AUS, operating a domestic flight between Gilgit and Rawalpindi in rainy weather as Flight 631, crashed in mountainous terrain. There were no survivors among the 22 passengers and four crew members on board.
*On 20 January 1978, a PIA Fokker F27 (registered AP-ALW) aircraft at Karachi with 22 passengers on board was hijacked by a gunman who asked to be flown to India. The then chairman of PIA, Air Marshal (Retd) Nur Khan boarded the aircraft to negotiate with the hijacker. He received a gunshot wound while trying to disarm the hijacker but still managed to overpower him.
*On 26 November 1979 Flight 740 was a Boeing 707-320C that crashed after takeoff from Jeddah International Airport for a flight to Karachi, resulting in 156 fatalities.
* On 2 March 1981 Flight 326 was hijacked by three gunmen and flown to Kabul. For almost two weeks, more than 100 passengers were held captive on the Boeing 720 until Pakistan released 55 prisoners. One passenger, Pakistani diplomat Tariq Rahim, was murdered during the ordeal.
* On 4 February 1986, a Boeing 747 registered as AP-AYW made a belly landing at Islamabad Airport around 9:00 am. The aircraft was operating Flight 300 from Karachi with 247 passengers and 17 crew members on board. Everyone survived this accident caused by pilot error.
* On 23 October 1986, a Fokker F27 aircraft crashed during approach to Peshawar Airport. Of the 54 passengers and crew on board, 13 were killed in the accident.
* On 25 August 1989, a Fokker F27 operating as Flight 404 disappeared shortly after taking off from Gilgit Airport. All 54 passengers and crew on board were presumed killed.

* On 28 September 1992 Flight 268, an Airbus A300 B4-200 registration AP-BCP, crashed on approach to Kathmandu&#x27;s Tribhuvan International Airport. All 167 on board were killed.
* On 27 December 1997, a Pakistan Airlines Boeing 747 plane from Karachi to London, crashed when landing at Dubai international airport. It overshot the runway and went through the perimeter wall before coming to rest. No one was killed.
* On 25 May 1998 a Fokker F27 Friendship operating as Flight 544 was hijacked. All passengers and crew escaped unhurt.
* On 17 October 2001, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 231, an Airbus A300, from Islamabad via Peshawar veered off the side of the runway after the right hand main landing gear collapsed as it touched down. The aircraft skidded and eventually came to rest in sand 50 meters from the runway. The aircraft sustained damage to its right wing structure and right engine, which partly broke off the wing. All 205 crew and passengers (which included high profile American political commentator and talk show host Tucker Carlson and his father Dick Carlson) evacuated safely. However, Tucker Carlson has erroneously claimed that the plane was flying over the Arabian Sea when it had a probable explosion in the cargo hold followed by a wing detachment resulting in its crashing into a sand dune in Dubai. 
* On 1 March 2004, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 2002, Airbus A300B4-203 registration AP-BBA, burst two tires whilst taking off from King Abdulaziz International Airport. Fragments of the tire were ingested by the engines, which caused the engines to catch fire and an aborted takeoff was performed. Due to the fire, substantial damage to the engine and the left wing caused the aircraft to be written off. All 261 passengers and 12 crew survived.
* In March 2005 Pakistan International Airlines experienced several minor accidents. This includes the wrong grease being used for the undercarriages in Pakistan airports leading to small fuselage fires. Poor maintenance in Pakistan had previously led to insufficient fuel in tanks and an engine falling onto the runway at Manchester Airport.
* On 10 July 2006 Flight 688, a Fokker F27 operating from Multan to Lahore and then to Islamabad, crashed in a field after bursting into flames a few minutes after takeoff from Multan International Airport. All 41 passengers and four crew members on board were killed.
* On 25 September 2010, a PIA Boeing 777-200LR registered AP-BGY, flying from Toronto to Karachi, made an emergency landing at Stockholm Arlanda Airport after a phone call was made claiming a passenger on board was armed with explosives. After the plane landed in Stockholm, it was parked at an emergency stand and the suspected passenger was removed from the plane by Swedish authorities. The rest of the passengers were also removed and the empty aircraft was searched. The plane and passengers were allowed to depart Sweden while the suspect was detained in the country for further investigation, but was later released after no evidence was found of the allegation made against him.
* On 31 August 2012, ATR 42–500 registration AP-BHJ, operating Flight 653 from Islamabad to Lahore, was landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport when it undershot the runway and came to rest on a grassy area on the right side of Runway 36R. There were no fatalities among the 42 passengers and four crew members. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and withdrawn from service.
* On 11 February 2013, a Boeing 737 aircraft registered AP-BEH was operating Flight 259 from Islamabad to Muscat via Sialkot when its port side main landing gear collapsed during landing at Muscat International Airport. There were no fatalities among the 107 passengers and seven crew members on board. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and withdrawn from service.
* On 8 June 2014, there was an attack on Jinnah International Airport. Several aircraft were damaged and written off, including a PIA Boeing 747-367, registered as AP-BFV, and a PIA Airbus A310-308, registered as AP-BDZ. In total, there were 36 fatalities, including the 10 attackers.
* On 24 June 2014, an Airbus A310-300 registered as AP-BGN was operating Flight 756 from Riyadh to Peshawar with 178 passengers and 12 crew members on board when it was hit by gunfire during its landing approach at Bacha Khan International Airport, Peshawar. The aircraft landed safely, but one passenger was killed and two crew members were injured. The aircraft was damaged but it was later ferried to Karachi for repair.
* On 7 December 2016, Flight 661, operated by an ATR 42–500 aircraft registered AP-BHO, crashed in Havelian, Pakistan while en route from Chitral to Islamabad, killing all 47 on board.
*On 22 May 2020, Flight 8303, operated by an Airbus A320, AP-BLD crashed while on final approach to Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, arriving from Lahore. According to CAA sources, PIA Airbus A320 from Lahore was about to land in Karachi when it crashed at the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir. CAA sources said that its communication with the plane had been cut off one minute prior to the landing. The pilots attempted an unstabilized landing which resulted in a belly landing as the landing gear was not lowered due to high workload in the cockpit. This badly damaged both the engines which suffered from oil leaks due to the heavy scraping on the runway. The pilots then tried to perform a go-around attempting to make a second approach, they requested to turn left for a direct route to the runway as they were losing altitude. The pilots then declared mayday reporting they had lost both engines (both engines had flamed out due to damage). Soon after, the aircraft lost altitude and crashed into flames in the Model Colony residential area at about 14:40 local time. A ground observer reported that the aircraft suddenly became silent in its final seconds of flight. 99 people were on board; two passengers survived while 97 on board, including eight crew members, were killed. Additional casualties on the ground were one fatality and seven injured.
* On January 1 2025, PIA Flight 503, which was heading from Karachi to the New Gwadar Airport, returned to Karachi after developing a technical fault. The aircraft was registered as AP-BHI and is back in service after repair at Jinnah International Airport.
* On 18 January 2025, the captain and first officer of flight PK150 from Dammam to Multan have been grounded for landing the plane at the wrong runway. The flight was initially diverted to Lahore Airport due to bad weather condition and heavy fog in Multan. An investigation has since been initiated.

<text>An air-start system is a power source used to provide the initial rotation to start large diesel engines and gas turbines.

==Diesel engines==
===Direct starting===
Compared to a gasoline (petrol) engine, a diesel engine has a very high compression ratio, an essential design feature, as it is the heat of compression that ignites the fuel. An electric starter with sufficient power to turn a large diesel engine would itself be so large as to be impractical so there is a need for an alternative system.

An air start system has three main components along with various safety components, namely the air start injector, the distributor and the air receivers. When the system is initiated, starting air from the receivers is distributed by the distributor unit to each respective air start valve according to the firing order of the engine’s cylinders. Safety components include flame traps, to prevent air line explosions, a turning gear interlock which ensures that air-start cannot be initiated when the turning gear is engaged, relief valves and isolation valves, as well as drain valves at certain points along the system. Control components include the control valves and remote air-start valves. A direct start system as used on a marine slow-speed diesel is required to have up to 12 starts on a non-reversing engine or 6 starts on a reversible, or geared, engine.

When starting the engine, compressed air is admitted to whichever cylinder has a piston just over top dead center, forcing it downward. As the engine starts to turn, the air-start valve on the next cylinder in line opens to continue the rotation. After several rotations, fuel is injected into the cylinders, the engine starts running and the air is cut off.

To further complicate matters, a large engine is usually &quot;blown over&quot; first with zero fuel settings and the indicator cocks open, to prove that the engine is clear of any water build up and that everything is free to turn. After a successful blow ahead and a blow astern, the indicator cocks are closed on all the cylinders, and then the engine can be started on fuel. Significant complexity is added to the engine by using an air-start system, as the cylinder head must have an extra valve in each cylinder to admit the air in for starting, plus the required control systems. This added complexity and cost limits the use of air-starters to very large and expensive reciprocating engines.
===Starter motor===
Another method of air-starting an internal combustion engine is by using compressed air or gas to drive a fluid motor in place of an electric motor. They can be used to start engines from 5 to 320 liters in size and if more starting power is necessary two or more motors can be used. Starters of this type are used in place of electric motors because of their lighter weight and higher reliability. They can also outlast an electric starter by a factor of three and are easier to rebuild. Engines operating in underground mining activities tend to operate on this type of starter system to reduce the risk of an electrical system igniting flammable material.

All vane type air starters should have a lubricator installed to insure long-life and maximum performance. Lubricators give the moving parts a needed friction barrier, reduce metal corrosion and keep vanes sealed properly against the cylinder walls. Even the so-called lube-free air starters require lubrication to prolong trouble free life. Two basic lubricator devices are typically employed. One is an in-line or reservoir type that typically stores up to 2 quarts of lubricant, and is installed along the air supply line. The second style of lubricator is a small one shot device that dispenses a measured amount of lubricant every time the starter is engaged. Installed directly onto the air inlet of the starter, the in-line lubricators are self priming pneumatic pumps that require a 1/4″ lubrication line piped from as far away as 4 feet. Air Starter lubricators perform best using misting type, non-detergent oils such as diesel fuel or Marvel Mystery oil. If emissions are a concern, there are environmentally friendly type lubricants available on the market.

Not all air starters require lubrication. Turbine type air starters do not require air motor lubrication, although some turbine air starters do use an oil filled transmission that may require periodic inspections and maintenance.

==Gas turbines==

Compressed air has been used to start gas turbine engines using air impingement starting (in which air is directed at the engine turbine blades through nozzles in the turbine casing, used on US Navy General Electric J79 engines). It is much more efficient to use an air turbine starter (ATS) which is usually mounted on an accessory gearbox. An early axial compressor turbojet had an ATS located in the compressor nose cone (eg particular variants of the J79).

Air impingement starting was not used for US military aircraft after the F-4B, A-5A and F-5 as the pneumatic energy requirement was several times greater than when using an air turbine starter. The gas turbine compressor required to start a J79 with impingement starting was sufficient to start two J79 engines simultaneously in a B-58 when using air turbine starters.

An ATS has its own turbine and gears to change its low torque and high speed to low speed and high torque at the engine mounting pad. Further gears in the engine gearbox connect to the engine shaft (high pressure spool on multi-spool engines). Compressed air is sent to the ATS turbine from the aircraft auxiliary power unit ( bleed air from the gas generator or from a free-turbine load compressor, eg PW901 APU), from an already-running engine (bleed air) on a multi-engined aircraft or, for early jet aircraft, from an air compressor mounted on ground support equipment.

Compared with electric starters, air-starters have a higher power-to-weight ratio so are used on large engines as an electric starter would be too big and, with its cables, too heavy and expensive. However, for smaller engines, which don&#x27;t need as much starter power, an electric starter is more suitable. It has a dual function as a generator (is known as a starter/generator) at speeds above which the engine no longer requires starter assistance.

<text>Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, Marquise de Pompadour (, ; 29 December 1721 – 15 April 1764), commonly known as Madame de Pompadour, was a member of the French court. She was the official chief mistress of King Louis XV from 1745 to 1751, and remained influential as court favourite until her death.

Pompadour took charge of the king&#x27;s schedule and was a valued aide and advisor, despite her frail health and many political enemies. She secured titles of nobility for herself and her relatives, and built a network of clients and supporters. She was particularly careful not to alienate the popular Queen, Marie Leszczyńska. On 8 February 1756, the Marquise de Pompadour was named as the thirteenth lady-in-waiting to the queen, a position considered the most prestigious at the court, which accorded her with honors.

Pompadour was a major patron of architecture and decorative arts, especially porcelain. She was a patron of the &quot;philosophes&quot; of the Enlightenment, including Voltaire.

Hostile critics at the time generally tarred her as a malevolent political influence, but historians are more favorable, emphasizing her successes as a patron of the arts and a champion of French pride. Modern historians suggest that the critics of Pompadour were driven by fears over the overturning of the existing hierarchies that Pompadour&#x27;s power and influence represented, as a woman who was not born into the aristocracy.

==Early life==
Jeanne Antoinette Poisson was born on 29 December 1721 in Paris to François Poisson (1684–1754) and his wife Madeleine de La Motte (1699–1745). Her father François Poisson was the youngest of nine children in the family of a weaver Claude Poisson (1631–1694) and his wife Marie Maranjé (1637–1707). Poisson was steward to the Paris brothers, the men primarily responsible for financing the French economy at the time. It is suspected that her biological father was either the rich financier Jean Pâris de Monmartel or the tax collector (&quot;fermier général&quot;) Charles François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem. Le Normant de Tournehem became her legal guardian when François Poisson was forced to leave the country in 1725 after a scandal over a series of unpaid debts. Such crime at that time was punishable by death; however, he was cleared eight years later and allowed to return to France.

At the age of five, Jeanne Antoinette was sent to receive the finest quality education of the day in an Ursuline convent in Poissy, where she gained admiration for her wit and charm. Due to poor health, thought to be whooping cough, Jeanne Antoinette returned home in January 1730, aged 9. Madeleine refused to allow this to prevent her daughter from becoming a highly educated and accomplished young lady, enrolling Jeanne Antoinette in private tutoring upon her return to Paris. Charles François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem took charge of the child&#x27;s education, sparing no expense. Jeanne-Antoinette was &quot;coached in elocution by an actor from the Comedie Francaise and the dramatist Crebillon. The opera singer Jélyotte taught her to sing&quot;, along with extensive education in the humanities, fine arts, music, and social finery. During this time, her mother took her to a fortuneteller, Madame de Lebon, who predicted that the girl would one day reign over the heart of a king. Pompadour left the fortuneteller 600 livres in her will, for correctly predicting the impossible.

==Marriage==

At the age of 20, Jeanne Antoinette was married to Charles Guillaume Le Normant d&#x27;Étiolles (1717–1799), the nephew of her guardian Charles Le Normant de Tournehem, who initiated the match and the large financial incentives that came with it. On 15 December 1740, Tournehem made his nephew his sole heir, disinheriting all his other nephews and nieces: the children of his brother and sister. These included the estate at Étiolles, a wedding gift from her guardian, which was situated on the edge of the royal hunting ground of the forest of Sénart. When she was married aged 20, she was already somewhat famous throughout the salons of Paris for her beauty, intelligence, and abundance of charm. Her husband, M. Le Normant d’Etioles, though initially displeased with their marriage arrangement, was said to have fallen in love with Mme Pompadour swiftly. Their marriage gave both parties something they desperately needed: Le Normant d&#x27;Etioles received &quot;an enormous dowry&quot; that lifted him from relative poverty. Jeanne-Antoinette &quot;gained a level of respectability that overshadowed her mother’s dubious past&quot;.

Once married, the couple seemed very much in love: Jeanne Antoinette would often joke that she would never leave Le Normant d’Etioles for anyone – except, of course, the king. The couple had a son who died in infancy and a daughter, Alexandrine Le Normant d&#x27;Étiolles born in 1744, who died at the age of nine.

== Attendance of salons ==

As a married woman, Jeanne Antoinette could frequent celebrated salons in Paris, such as those hosted by Mesdames de Tencin, Geoffrin, du Deffand and others. Within these salons she crossed paths with principal figures of the Enlightenment, including Voltaire, Charles Pinot Duclos, Montesquieu, Helvétius, and Bernard de Fontenelle. Additionally, Jeanne Antoinette created her own salon at Étiolles, which was attended by many of the cultural elite, among them were Crébillon fils, Montesquieu, the Cardinal de Bernis, and Voltaire. Within these circles she learned the fine art of conversation and developed the sharp wit for which she would later become known at Versailles.

==Meeting the King==

Due to her involvement in Paris salons as well as her grace and beauty, Louis XV had heard the name of Jeanne Antoinette mentioned at court as early as 1742. In 1744, Jeanne Antoinette sought to catch the eye of the King while he led the hunt in the forest of Sénart. Because she occupied an estate near this location, she was permitted to follow the royal party at a distance. However, wanting to attract the King&#x27;s notice, Jeanne Antoinette drove directly in front of the King&#x27;s path, once in a pink phaeton, wearing a blue dress, and once in a blue phaeton, wearing a pink dress. The King sent a gift of venison to her. Though the King&#x27;s current mistress Maria Anne de Mailly, named Madame de Châteauroux, had warned off Jeanne Antoinette, the position became vacant on 8 December 1744 when Châteauroux died. On 24 February 1745, Jeanne Antoinette received a formal invitation to attend the masked ball held on 25 February at the Palace of Versailles to celebrate the marriage of the Dauphin Louis of France to Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain. It was at this ball that the King, disguised along with seven courtiers as yew trees, publicly declared his affection for Jeanne Antoinette. Before all of court and the royal family, Louis unmasked himself before Jeanne Antoinette, who was dressed as Diana the Huntress in reference to their encounter in the forest of Sénart.

==Introduction to court==

By March, she was the King&#x27;s mistress, installed at Versailles in an apartment directly above his. On 7 May, the official separation between her and her husband was pronounced. To be presented at court, she required a title. The King purchased the marquisate of Pompadour on 24 June and gave the estate, with title and coat-of-arms, to Jeanne Antoinette, making her a &quot;Marquise&quot;. On 14 September 1745, Madame de Pompadour made her formal entry before the King, presented by the King&#x27;s cousin, the Princess of Conti. Determined to make her place at court secure, Jeanne Antoinette immediately attempted to forge a good relationship with the royal family. After the Queen engaged Pompadour in a conversation by enquiring after a mutual acquaintance, Madame de Saissac, Pompadour responded in delight, swearing her respect and loyalty to Marie Leszczyńska. The Queen in return favored Jeanne Antoinette instead of the King&#x27;s other mistresses. Pompadour quickly mastered the highly mannered court etiquette. However, her mother died on Christmas Day of the same year, and did not live to see her daughter&#x27;s achievement of becoming the undisputed royal mistress.

===Royal mistress===

Through her position as court favourite, Pompadour wielded considerable power and influence. She was elevated on 12 October 1752 to duchess and in 1756 to lady-in-waiting to the Queen, the most noble rank possible for a woman at court. Pompadour effectively played the role of prime minister, becoming responsible for appointing advancements, favors and dismissals, and contributing in domestic and foreign politics.

In 1755, she was approached by Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg, a prominent Austrian diplomat, asking her to intervene in the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Versailles. This was the beginning of the Diplomatic Revolution, which saw France allied to their former enemy Austria.

Under these changed alliances, the European powers entered the Seven Years&#x27; War, which saw France, Austria and Russia pitted against Britain and Prussia. France suffered a defeat at the hands of the Prussians in the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, and eventually lost the American colonies to the British. After Rossbach, Madame de Pompadour is alleged to have comforted the king with the now famous: &quot;au reste, après nous, le Déluge&quot; (&quot;Besides, after us, the Deluge&quot;). France emerged from the war diminished and virtually bankrupt.

Madame de Pompadour persisted in her support of these policies, and when Cardinal de Bernis failed her, she brought Choiseul into office and supported and guided him in all his plans: the Pacte de Famille, the suppression of the Jesuits, and the Treaty of Paris (1763). Britain&#x27;s victories in the war had allowed it to surpass France as the leading colonial power – something which was commonly blamed on Pompadour.

Pompadour protected the Physiocrates school (its leader was Quesnay, her own doctor) which paved the way for Adam Smith&#x27;s theories. She also defended the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, against those, among them the Archbishop of Paris Christophe de Beaumont, who sought to have it suppressed. In Diderot&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Les bijoux indiscrets&quot; (The Indiscreet Jewels), the characters of Mangogul and Mirzoza are allegories of Louis XV and Pompadour respectively. Diderot portrayed Pompadour in a flattering light, most likely to ensure her support for &quot;Encyclopedie&quot;. Pompadour had a copy of &quot;Les bijoux indiscrets&quot; in her library, which may explain why the crown did not pursue Diderot for such an indiscretion against the king.

The marquise had many enemies among the royal courtiers who felt it a disgrace that the king would thus compromise himself with a commoner. She was very sensitive to the unending libels called &quot;poissonnades&quot;, analogous to against Cardinal Mazarin and a pun on her family name, &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;fish&quot; in French. Only with great reluctance did Louis take punitive action against her known enemies, such as Louis François Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu.

===Friend of the King===

Madame de Pompadour was able to wield such influence at court due to the invaluable role she played as a friend and confidante of the King. In opposition to previous mistresses of Louis XV, Pompadour made herself invaluable to the King by becoming the only person whom Louis trusted and who could be counted on to tell him the truth. Pompadour was an indispensable comfort to Louis who was prone to melancholy and boredom. She alone was able to captivate and amuse him and would entertain Louis with elegant private parties and operas, afternoons of hunting, and journeying among their various chateaux and lodgings. She would sometimes even invite his wife, Queen Marie Leszczyńska, with his help.

Around 1750 Madame de Pompadour&#x27;s role as friend of the King became her solitary role, as she ceased her sexual relationship with the King. The end of this sexual relationship was in part attributed to Pompadour&#x27;s poor health, as she suffered from the aftereffects of whooping cough, recurring colds and bronchitis, spitting blood, headaches, three miscarriages to the King, as well as an unconfirmed case of leucorrhoea. In addition, Pompadour admitted to having &quot;the misfortune to be of a very cold temperament&quot;, and attempts to increase her libido with a diet of truffles, celery, and vanilla were unsuccessful. Furthermore, in 1750 the Jubilee year placed pressure upon the King to repent of his sins and renounce his mistress. In order to cement her continuing importance as favourite in the face of these impediments, Pompadour took on the role of &quot;friend of the King&quot; which she announced through artistic patronage. Pompadour&#x27;s announcement was most prominently declared through her commission from Jean Baptiste Pigalle, of a sculpture representing herself as Amitié [friendship], offering herself to a now lost pendant sculpture of Louis XV. Pompadour also had a related sculpture depicted in a portrait of herself painted by François Boucher in 1759.

===The consecration and the château de Saint-Ouen===
Source:

Built in the second half of the 17th century, the château de Saint-Ouen, (near Paris, in the Seine-Saint-Denis department), has belonged to the prestigious dukes of Gesvres until its destruction in 1821, to build the actual château for the comtesse du Cayla. After the sale of her , unexpectedly, the marquise de Pompadour did not purchase Saint-Ouen but benefited from the usufruct of this residence from 1759 until her death in 1764.

The plan of the château, originally designed by Antoine Lepautre, was a classical U-shape and consisted of a long façade with two wings prolonging the main body, facing the river Seine on the garden side.

Saint-Ouen&#x27;s originality resided in its interior distribution: the main body consisted of a succession of three &quot;salons à l&#x27;italienne&quot;, whose decoration was entirely modified by the Slodtz family in the 1750s for the Gesvres family. In French architecture, a &quot;salon à l&#x27;italienne&quot; is a room filling all the height of a building: a memorable example is the Grand salon at Vaux-le-Vicomte.

In addition to this layout, as soon as Madame de Pompadour acquired the estate, a vast project of reorganisation of the entire buildings (including stables and dependences) was planned, costing more than 500.000 livres. In the absence of the original plans, a restitution of the ground floor has been proposed. It seems that the architect who supervised this reorganisation was Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who, at that time, directed all the renovation and building works of the different residences of Mme de Pompadour. Using the central &quot;salon à l&#x27;italienne&quot; as a pivot, an apartment was created for the King as a counterpart to that of the henceforth Duchesse de Pompadour, making the prestigious château de Saint-Ouen into a reflection of her own status – a symbol of her social and political achievements.

===Historical misconceptions===

Despite misconceptions perpetuated by her contemporaries and much of historical discourse, Pompadour did not supplement her role as mistress by employing replacement lovers for the king. Following the cessation of Pompadour&#x27;s sexual relationship with Louis, the King met with young women in a house in Versailles established particularly for that purpose, called the Parc-aux-Cerfs, or Stag Park. It was not, as often described, a harem; it was occupied by only one woman at a time. Pompadour was not involved, other than to accept it as a &quot;necessity&quot;. Pompadour&#x27;s only contribution to the Stag Park was to accept it as a favorable alternative to a rival at court, as she stated: &quot;It is his heart I want! All these little girls with no education will not take it from me. I would not be so calm if I saw some pretty woman of the court or the capital trying to conquer it.&quot;

===Patron and participant in the arts===
Madame de Pompadour was an influential patron of the arts who played a central role in making Paris the perceived capital of taste and culture in Europe. She attained this influence through the appointment of her guardian Charles François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem, and later her brother, Abel-François Poisson in the post of &quot;Directeur Général des Bâtiments&quot;, which controlled government policy and expenditures for the arts. She championed French pride by constructing and later outright buying a porcelain factory at Sèvres in 1759, which became one of the most famous porcelain manufacturers in Europe, and which provided skilled jobs for the region. Numerous sculptors and portrait painters were patronized by Pompadour, among them the court artist Jean-Marc Nattier, in the 1750s François Boucher, Jean-Baptiste Réveillon and François-Hubert Drouais. She patronized Jacques Guay, the gemstone engraver, who taught her to engrave in onyx, jasper and other semi-precious stones.

Pompadour greatly influenced and stimulated innovation in what is known as the Rococo style in the fine and decorative arts: for example, through her patronage of the artists like Boucher and the constant refurnishing of the fifteen residences she held with Louis. Like Pompadour, this style was critiqued by some as a pernicious &quot;feminine&quot; influence, despite the fact that it was embraced by many men as well as women. However it is also widely recognised that Madame de Pompadour engaged with prominent artists as a way to capture the attention of the king whilst cultivating her public image. The oil sketch of Pompadour&#x27;s lost portrait by Boucher sits in the Starhemberg room at Waddesdon Manor built by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, surrounded by Sèvres porcelain, another industry that she greatly influenced and innovated through personal dissemination across an international network of her own clientele.

In addition to supporting the arts as a patron, Pompadour also participated in them more directly. Besides being one of the few 18th-century practitioners of gem engraving, she was an acclaimed stage actress in plays staged at her private theaters at Versailles and Bellevue. Some of the artworks made under Pompadour&#x27;s purview by other hands, notably the 1758 portrait by Boucher of &quot;Mme de Pompadour at Her Toilette&quot;, can be viewed as collaborations with Pompadour.

Madame de Pompadour is considered an amateur printmaker who made print engravings with the help of Boucher. She had engraving equipment, to create the prints of works by Boucher and Guay, brought within her personal apartments in Versailles

Her political mind also can be attributed to her great book collection. She collected influential books such as the &quot;History of the Stuarts&quot;, printed in 1760 with her own printing press which can be determined through the stamp markings of her arms located on the cover. Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, an avid 19th-century collector in London and Waddesdon Manor, collected a number of her books, including this previously mentioned book and a copy of her published catalogue of books from 1764, which lists her entire collection.

== Artwork ==
Madame de Pompadour created 52 engraved prints, of drawings by Boucher, after gemstone engravings by Guay. Her collection of work, in book form, is titled &quot;Suite d&#x27;Estampes Gravées Par Madame la Marquise de Pompadour d&#x27;Apres les Pierres Gravées de Guay, Graveur du Roy&quot;, which in English is &quot;Series of Prints engraved by Madame la Marquise de Pompadour after the engraved stones of Guay, engraver of the King&quot;.

The personal portfolio of Madame de Pompadour was found in the Walters Art Museum manuscript room by art historian Susan Wager.

Some art historians argue whether or not she should be considered a collaborator with the artists under her patronage, since there is no documentation of how much Pompadour might have contributed to the works; whose idea, and whose composition, will remain a mystery.

==Death==

Louis XV remained devoted to Pompadour until her death from tuberculosis in 1764 at the age of 42. Louis nursed her through her illness. Even her enemies admired her courage during the final painful weeks. Voltaire wrote: &quot;I am very sad at the death of Madame de Pompadour. I was indebted to her and I mourn her out of gratitude. It seems absurd that while an ancient pen-pusher, hardly able to walk, should still be alive, a beautiful woman, in the midst of a splendid career, should die at the age of forty-two.&quot; Many of her enemies were, however, greatly relieved. Looking at the rain during the departure of his mistress&#x27;s coffin from Versailles, the devastated king reportedly said: &quot;La marquise n&#x27;aura pas de beau temps pour son voyage&quot; (&quot;The marquise will not have good weather for her journey&quot;). She was buried at the Couvent des Capucines in Paris.

==In popular culture==

* The 56th (West Essex) Regiment of Foot, a unit of the British Army that existed from 1755 to 1881, was nicknamed &quot;The Pompadours&quot;, as the purple facing of the regiment&#x27;s uniform was allegedly Pompadour&#x27;s favourite colour. Some soldiers of the regiment preferred to claim that it was the colour of her underwear. Its successor, the Essex Regiment, kept the colour and the nickname.
* The &quot;coupe de champagne&quot; (French champagne glass) is sometimes claimed to have been modelled on the shape of her breast, although this is probably not the case.
* &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot;, a German operetta with music by Leo Fall and book and lyrics by Rudolph Schanzer and Ernst Welisch that also had successful adaptations in London (1923), and Broadway, where it opened the Martin Beck Theatre in 1924.
* She was the subject of several portraits throughout her lifetime.
* According to legend, the &quot;marquise cut&quot; diamond, also called &quot;navette&quot;, was commissioned by Louis XV to resemble the mouth of Madame de Pompadour.
* The Pompadour hairstyle was named after Madame de Pompadour.
* In the second act of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, the role of the countess recalls the great names of the artists of her past: &quot;and sometimes even the Marquise de Pompadour in person!&quot;
* She is mentioned in the first line of the Johnny Mercer song &quot;Personality&quot;, featuring the Pied Pipers.
* Madame De Pompadour is one of the main characters in &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot;, the fourth episode of second series of the second run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

<doc id="194129" wikidata="Q1149348" url="?curid=194129" title="Brahmagupta's formula">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula, named after the 7th century Indian mathematician, is used to find the area of any convex cyclic quadrilateral (one that can be inscribed in a circle) given the lengths of the sides. Its generalized version, &quot;Bretschneider&#x27;s formula&quot;, can be used with non-cyclic quadrilateral. &quot;Heron&#x27;s formula&quot; can be thought as a special case of the Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula for triangles.

== Formulation ==
Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula gives the area of a convex cyclic quadrilateral whose sides have lengths , , , as

: formula_1

where , the semiperimeter, is defined to be

: formula_2

This formula generalizes Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle. A triangle may be regarded as a quadrilateral with one side of length zero. From this perspective, as (or any one side) approaches zero, a cyclic quadrilateral converges into a cyclic triangle (all triangles are cyclic), and Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula simplifies to Heron&#x27;s formula.

If the semiperimeter is not used, Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula is

: formula_3

Another equivalent version is

: formula_4

== Proof ==
===Trigonometric proof===
Here the notations in the figure to the right are used. The area of the convex cyclic quadrilateral equals the sum of the areas of and :

:formula_5

But since is a cyclic quadrilateral, . Hence . Therefore,

:formula_6

:formula_7

:formula_8

(using the trigonometric identity).

Solving for common side , in and , the law of cosines gives

:formula_9

Substituting (since angles and are supplementary) and rearranging, we have

:formula_10

Substituting this in the equation for the area,

:formula_11

:formula_12

The right-hand side is of the form and hence can be written as

:formula_13

which, upon rearranging the terms in the square brackets, yields

:formula_14

that can be factored again into

:formula_15

Introducing the semiperimeter yields

:formula_16

Taking the square root, we get

:formula_17

===Non-trigonometric proof===
An alternative, non-trigonometric proof utilizes two applications of Heron&#x27;s triangle area formula on similar triangles.

== Extension to non-cyclic quadrilaterals ==
In the case of non-cyclic quadrilaterals, Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula can be extended by considering the measures of two opposite angles of the quadrilateral:

: formula_18

where is half the sum of any two opposite angles. (The choice of which pair of opposite angles is irrelevant: if the other two angles are taken, half their sum is . Since , we have .) This more general formula is known as Bretschneider&#x27;s formula.

It is a property of cyclic quadrilaterals (and ultimately of inscribed angles) that opposite angles of a quadrilateral sum to 180°. Consequently, in the case of an inscribed quadrilateral, is 90°, whence the term

:formula_19

giving the basic form of Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula. It follows from the latter equation that the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is the maximum possible area for any quadrilateral with the given side lengths.

A related formula, which was proved by Coolidge, also gives the area of a general convex quadrilateral. It is

: formula_20

where and are the lengths of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, according to Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem, and the formula of Coolidge reduces to Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula.

== Related theorems ==
* Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle is the special case obtained by taking .
* The relationship between the general and extended form of Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula is similar to how the law of cosines extends the Pythagorean theorem.
* Increasingly complicated closed-form formulas exist for the area of general polygons on circles, as described by Maley et al.

<text>In Euclidean geometry, a cyclic quadrilateral or inscribed quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a single circle. This circle is called the &quot;circumcircle&quot; or &quot;circumscribed circle&quot;, and the vertices are said to be &quot;concyclic&quot;. The center of the circle and its radius are called the &quot;circumcenter&quot; and the &quot;circumradius&quot; respectively. Other names for these quadrilaterals are concyclic quadrilateral and chordal quadrilateral, the latter since the sides of the quadrilateral are chords of the circumcircle. Usually the quadrilateral is assumed to be convex, but there are also crossed cyclic quadrilaterals. The formulas and properties given below are valid in the convex case.

The word cyclic is from the Ancient Greek (&quot;kuklos&quot;), which means &quot;circle&quot; or &quot;wheel&quot;.

All triangles have a circumcircle, but not all quadrilaterals do. An example of a quadrilateral that cannot be cyclic is a non-square rhombus. The section characterizations below states what necessary and sufficient conditions a quadrilateral must satisfy to have a circumcircle.

==Special cases==
Any square, rectangle, isosceles trapezoid, or antiparallelogram is cyclic. A kite is cyclic if and only if it has two right angles – a right kite. A bicentric quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral that is also tangential and an ex-bicentric quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral that is also ex-tangential. A harmonic quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral in which the product of the lengths of opposite sides are equal.

==Characterizations==
=== Circumcenter ===
A convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the four perpendicular bisectors to the sides are concurrent. This common point is the circumcenter.

=== Supplementary angles ===

A convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if its opposite angles are supplementary, that is
:formula_1

The direct theorem was Proposition 22 in Book 3 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. Equivalently, a convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if each exterior angle is equal to the opposite interior angle.

In 1836 Duncan Gregory generalized this result as follows: Given any convex cyclic 2&quot;n&quot;-gon, then the two sums of &quot;alternate&quot; interior angles are each equal to (&quot;n&quot;-1)formula_2. This result can be further generalized as follows: lf &quot;A1A2...A2n&quot; (n &gt; 1) is any cyclic 2&quot;n&quot;-gon in which vertex &quot;Ai-&gt;Ai+k&quot; (vertex &quot;Ai&quot; is joined to &quot;Ai+k&quot;), then the two sums of alternate interior angles are each equal to &quot;m&quot;formula_2 (where &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot;—&quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... is the total turning).

Taking the stereographic projection (half-angle tangent) of each angle, this can be re-expressed,

:formula_4

Which implies that

:formula_5

=== Angles between sides and diagonals ===
A convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if an angle between a side and a diagonal is equal to the angle between the opposite side and the other diagonal. That is, for example,
:formula_6

=== Pascal points ===
Other necessary and sufficient conditions for a convex quadrilateral to be cyclic are: let be the point of intersection of the diagonals, let be the intersection point of the extensions of the sides and , let formula_7 be a circle whose diameter is the segment, , and let and be Pascal points on sides and formed by the circle formula_7.
&lt;br&gt; (1) is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if points and are collinear with the center , of circle formula_7.
&lt;br&gt; (2) is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if points and are the midpoints of sides and .

=== Intersection of diagonals ===
If two lines, one containing segment and the other containing segment , intersect at , then the four points , , , are concyclic if and only if
:formula_10
The intersection may be internal or external to the circle. In the former case, the cyclic quadrilateral is , and in the latter case, the cyclic quadrilateral is . When the intersection is internal, the equality states that the product of the segment lengths into which divides one diagonal equals that of the other diagonal. This is known as the &quot;intersecting chords theorem&quot; since the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral are chords of the circumcircle.

=== Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem ===
Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem expresses the product of the lengths of the two diagonals and of a cyclic quadrilateral as equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides:
:formula_11

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; are the side lengths in order. The converse is also true. That is, if this equation is satisfied in a convex quadrilateral, then a cyclic quadrilateral is formed.

=== Diagonal triangle ===
In a convex quadrilateral , let be the diagonal triangle of and let formula_7 be the nine-point circle of .
 is cyclic if and only if the point of intersection of the bimedians of belongs to the nine-point circle formula_7.

==Area==
The area of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides , , , is given by Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula
:formula_14

where , the semiperimeter, is . This is a corollary of Bretschneider&#x27;s formula for the general quadrilateral, since opposite angles are supplementary in the cyclic case. If also , the cyclic quadrilateral becomes a triangle and the formula is reduced to Heron&#x27;s formula.

The cyclic quadrilateral has maximal area among all quadrilaterals having the same side lengths (regardless of sequence). This is another corollary to Bretschneider&#x27;s formula. It can also be proved using calculus.

Four unequal lengths, each less than the sum of the other three, are the sides of each of three non-congruent cyclic quadrilaterals, which by Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula all have the same area. Specifically, for sides , , , and , side could be opposite any of side , side , or side .

The area of a cyclic quadrilateral with successive sides , , , , angle between sides and , and angle between sides and can be expressed as
:formula_15

or
:formula_16

or
:formula_17

where is either angle between the diagonals. Provided is not a right angle, the area can also be expressed as
:formula_18

Another formula is
:formula_19

where is the radius of the circumcircle. As a direct consequence,

:formula_20
where there is equality if and only if the quadrilateral is a square.

==Diagonals==
In a cyclic quadrilateral with successive vertices , , , and sides , , , and , the lengths of the diagonals and can be expressed in terms of the sides as

:formula_21 and formula_22

so showing Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem
:formula_23

According to &quot;Ptolemy&#x27;s second theorem&quot;,
:formula_24

using the same notations as above.

For the sum of the diagonals we have the inequality

:formula_25

Equality holds if and only if the diagonals have equal length, which can be proved using the AM-GM inequality.

Moreover,

:formula_26

In any convex quadrilateral, the two diagonals together partition the quadrilateral into four triangles; in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite pairs of these four triangles are similar to each other.

If is a cyclic quadrilateral where meets at , then

:formula_27

A set of sides that can form a cyclic quadrilateral can be arranged in any of three distinct sequences each of which can form a cyclic quadrilateral of the same area in the same circumcircle (the areas being the same according to Brahmagupta&#x27;s area formula). Any two of these cyclic quadrilaterals have one diagonal length in common.

==Angle formulas==
For a cyclic quadrilateral with successive sides , , , , semiperimeter , and angle between sides and , the trigonometric functions of are given by
:formula_28
:formula_29
:formula_30

The angle between the diagonals that is opposite sides and satisfies
:formula_31

If the extensions of opposite sides and intersect at an angle , then
:formula_32

where is the semiperimeter.

Let formula_33 denote the angle between sides formula_34 and formula_35, formula_36 the angle between formula_35 and formula_38, and formula_39 the angle between formula_38 and formula_41, then:

:formula_42

==Parameshvara&#x27;s circumradius formula==
A cyclic quadrilateral with successive sides , , , and semiperimeter has the circumradius (the radius of the circumcircle) given by
:formula_43

This was derived by the Indian mathematician Vatasseri Parameshvara in the 15th century. (Note that the radius is invariant under the interchange of any side lengths.)

Using Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula, Parameshvara&#x27;s formula can be restated as
:formula_44

where is the area of the cyclic quadrilateral.

==Anticenter and collinearities==
Four line segments, each perpendicular to one side of a cyclic quadrilateral and passing through the opposite side&#x27;s midpoint, are concurrent. These line segments are called the &quot;maltitudes&quot;, which is an abbreviation for midpoint altitude. Their common point is called the &quot;anticenter&quot;. It has the property of being the reflection of the circumcenter in the &quot;vertex centroid&quot;. Thus in a cyclic quadrilateral, the circumcenter, the &quot;vertex centroid&quot;, and the anticenter are collinear.

If the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at , and the midpoints of the diagonals are and , then the anticenter of the quadrilateral is the orthocenter of triangle .

The anticenter of a cyclic quadrilateral is the Poncelet point of its vertices.

==Other properties==
*In a cyclic quadrilateral , the incenters &quot;M&quot;1, &quot;M&quot;2, &quot;M&quot;3, &quot;M&quot;4 (see the figure to the right) in triangles , , , and are the vertices of a rectangle. This is one of the theorems known as the Japanese theorem. The orthocenters of the same four triangles are the vertices of a quadrilateral congruent to , and the centroids in those four triangles are vertices of another cyclic quadrilateral.
*In a cyclic quadrilateral with circumcenter , let be the point where the diagonals and intersect. Then angle is the arithmetic mean of the angles and . This is a direct consequence of the inscribed angle theorem and the exterior angle theorem.
*There are no cyclic quadrilaterals with rational area and with unequal rational sides in either arithmetic or geometric progression.

*If a cyclic quadrilateral has side lengths that form an arithmetic progression the quadrilateral is also ex-bicentric.
*If the opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral are extended to meet at and , then the internal angle bisectors of the angles at and are perpendicular.

==Brahmagupta quadrilaterals==
A Brahmagupta quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral with integer sides, integer diagonals, and integer area. All Brahmagupta quadrilaterals with sides , , , , diagonals , , area , and circumradius can be obtained by clearing denominators from the following expressions involving rational parameters , , and :

:formula_45
:formula_46
:formula_47
:formula_48
:formula_49
:formula_50
:formula_51
:formula_52

==Orthodiagonal case==

===Circumradius and area===
For a cyclic quadrilateral that is also orthodiagonal (has perpendicular diagonals), suppose the intersection of the diagonals divides one diagonal into segments of lengths and and divides the other diagonal into segments of lengths and . Then (the first equality is Proposition 11 in Archimedes&#x27; &quot;Book of Lemmas&quot;)
:formula_53

where is the diameter of the circumcircle. This holds because the diagonals are perpendicular chords of a circle. These equations imply that the circumradius can be expressed as
:formula_54

or, in terms of the sides of the quadrilateral, as
:formula_55

It also follows that
:formula_56

Thus, according to Euler&#x27;s quadrilateral theorem, the circumradius can be expressed in terms of the diagonals and , and the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals as
:formula_57

A formula for the area of a cyclic orthodiagonal quadrilateral in terms of the four sides is obtained directly when combining Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem and the formula for the area of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral. The result is
:formula_58

===Other properties===
*In a cyclic orthodiagonal quadrilateral, the anticenter coincides with the point where the diagonals intersect.
*Brahmagupta&#x27;s theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral that is also orthodiagonal, the perpendicular from any side through the point of intersection of the diagonals bisects the opposite side.
*If a cyclic quadrilateral is also orthodiagonal, the distance from the circumcenter to any side equals half the length of the opposite side.
*In a cyclic orthodiagonal quadrilateral, the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals equals the distance between the circumcenter and the point where the diagonals intersect.

== Cyclic spherical quadrilaterals ==
In spherical geometry, a spherical quadrilateral formed from four intersecting greater circles is cyclic if and only if the summations of the opposite angles are equal, i.e., α + γ = β + δ for consecutive angles α, β, γ, δ of the quadrilateral. One direction of this theorem was proved by Anders Johan Lexell in 1782. Lexell showed that in a spherical quadrilateral inscribed in a small circle of a sphere the sums of opposite angles are equal, and that in the circumscribed quadrilateral the sums of opposite sides are equal. The first of these theorems is the spherical analogue of a plane theorem, and the second theorem is its dual, that is, the result of interchanging great circles and their poles. Kiper et al. proved a converse of the theorem: If the summations of the opposite sides are equal in a spherical quadrilateral, then there exists an inscribing circle for this quadrilateral.

<text>Bolonchén or Bolonchén de Rejón (Bolon Che&#x27;e&#x27;en in Modern Maya) is a town in the Mexican state of Campeche, about east from the state capital, Campeche, in Hopelchén Municipality. the town had a population of 3,975 people. A short distance to the south of Bolonchén are located the caves of Xtacunbilxunan.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bolonchén&quot; means &quot;Nine Wells&quot; in the Maya language, and &quot;de Rejón&quot; commemorates Manuel Crescencio Rejón, a lawyer who helped draft the 1917 Constitution and who was born here. Previously, the Pueblo was named Bolonchenticul. It was renamed in September 1955 to Balonchén de Rejón . It is also the birthplace of Olegario Molina y Solis, the Governor of Yucatán and Minister de Fomento in the Porfirio Díaz era (1877–1911). In 1833, it was the only pueblo to escape the cholera epidemic. This was due to the efforts of Julian Molina y Bastante (Olegario&#x27;s grandfather) and the brothers Martinez.

==Ruins==
The large Bolonchén ruins site of ancient Maya architecture is located just north of the modern town. It dates from the and Post Classic Period. Most of the carved stone facades of the ancient structures were removed in the 18th through mid−20th centuries for reuse in new construction work. Nonetheless, a few monuments with sculpture and hieroglyphic texts are still visible.

Both the ruins and cave were visited and described briefly by John Lloyd Stephens at the start of the 1840s, but no detailed scholarly examination of the ruins was made until Eric von Euw in 1973 (in part because Stephens and other early visitors failed to note that there were surviving inscriptions).

<text>Pole bending is a rodeo timed event that features a horse and one mounted rider, running a weaving or serpentine path around six poles arranged in a line. This event is usually seen in youth and high school rodeos, 4-H events, American Quarter Horse Association, Paint and Appaloosa sanctioned shows, as well as in many gymkhana or O-Mok-See events.

== Nez Perce Stake Race ==

The Nez Perce Stake Race is a type of pole bending race which is also a match race: two horses race on identical courses laid out side-by-side, with the loser eliminated and the winner moving up the brackets to race the other winners. It is not a timed event. It is one of five game classes approved for horse club shows by the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC). The ApHC rules state that racing competition is traditional to the Nez Perce Native American people. However, it is unclear if this particular competition is derived from any traditional competition.

<text>Rumia (; ; ) is a town in northern Poland, in the Wejherowo County in Pomeranian Voivodeship, with some 49,000 inhabitants. It is a part of the Kashubian Tricity (Rumia, Reda, Wejherowo) and a suburb part of the metropolitan area of the Tricity. It is situated in Kashubia in the historic region of Pomerania. It is connected by well-developed railway and highway connections to the Tricity, an urban agglomeration of almost 1 million inhabitants on the coast of Gdańsk Bay.

==History==

Slavic Lechitic settlements existed in present-day Rumia in the Early Middle Ages. The region formed part of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century. The village of Rumia (then &quot;Rumina&quot;) was first mentioned in 1224 when it was awarded by Swietopelk II, later duke of Eastern Pomerania to the Cistercian convent in Oliwa (today part of Gdańsk). The name of Rumia was applied also to the neighbourhoods of Janowo and Biała Rzeka. In 1285 Mestwin II, duke of Pomerania stopped here to issue official documents. It was part of Poland until 1309, when it was annexed by the State of the Teutonic Order. Poland tried to regain the region through diplomacy as it did not recognize its annexation by the Teutonic Knights, and from 1325 the local Cistercians secretly resumed collections of the Peter&#x27;s Pence tax on behalf of Poland for the Catholic Church. From 1320 to 1342 a Cistercian–Teutonic conflict took place, which ended with a privilege in which the Teutonic Knights confirmed the Cisterian possessions in the region, including Rumia.

In 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon re-incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland, and after the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War the Teutonic Knights renounced their claims to the region in 1466. Afterwards Rumia was administratively located in the Puck County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland until the Partitions of Poland. It remained a church village of the Cistercians from Oliwa, while the present-day district of Zagórze was a royal village of the Polish Crown, and also new craft settlements (also present-day districts) Szmelta and Stara Piła emerged.

In 1772 it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, and from 1773 it belonged to the newly established province of West Prussia until 1871 when it also became part of the unified German Empire. In 1905 Rumia (then officially &quot;Rahmel&quot;) had 760 inhabitants. 579 of them were Germans and 180 were Kashubian or Polish, while the present-day districts of Zagórze and Janowo had 754 and 161 inhabitants respectively, and remained predominantly Polish-Kashubian. Rumia was a German language island in a predominantly Slavic speaking region.
Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I gave Poles hope for the restoration of independent Poland. The Poles established a local Polish library, and on December 29, 1918 the first Polish pro-independence rally took place in Rumia. Germany responded with repressions and discrimination of Poles, and carried out arrests of Polish activists and searches of Polish homes, etc., however in 1920 Rumia was successfully restored to the newly re-established Polish state. Administratively it was part of the new Pomeranian Voivodeship.

In the late 1920s, the nearby village of Gdynia was developed into a city and one of the biggest seaports in the region – especially due to its strategic location on the Polish coastal region, to which Rumia also belonged. The rapid growth of the city of Gdynia prompted the price of land to increase. Labour migrants from other parts of Poland began to settle in the region including the village of Rumia and its vicinity. Zagórze, Kazimierz and Łężyce, which are today parts of Rumia, were originally separate villages, and were joined with Rumia in 1934 to form the Rumia Rural Commune. By 1934, Rumia had become a suburb of Gdynia (population of 12,000 in 1939), located approximately from the city centre and well-connected with it through a railway link. A small military airfield, home of two squadrons of the Coast Defence Escadrille (based in Puck) was opened to civilian planes on 1 May 1936. The airport serviced international route Gdynia-Copenhagen and domestic route Gdynia-Warsaw and by 1 January 1939, the number of passengers using it rose to over 3000 a year. The airfield was also the main base of the Gdynia-based glider club.

During the German invasion of Poland in 1939, which started World War II, Rumia was a site of heavy fighting. It was a flanking position of the main Polish defence line at Kępa Oksywska. Two military cemeteries are located in the area. Soldiers of the 207th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht) and SS members murdered 18 people in Rumia 11–12 September 1939. Afterwards the town was occupied by Nazi Germany, which annexed it to the newly formed province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and renamed it to Rahmel. In September and October 1939, SS and SD terrorized ethnic Polish and Jewish population. Most of the victims were either executed at a nearby mass execution site in Piaśnica or sent to the Stutthof concentration camp. Pre-war wójt of Rumia (head of the local administration) Hipolit Roszczynialski was among the victims of the massacres in Piaśnica. Approximately half of the pre-war inhabitants of the town were expelled from 1939 to 1941, mostly to the General Government in the more eastern part of German-occupied Poland. Many were also deported to forced labour near Szczecin. The town was also a place of internment for several thousand POWs, mostly from the United Kingdom, France and Italy. A forced labour camp and an aircraft assembly plant were located in the town&#x27;s vicinity. In 1945, shortly before the town&#x27;s liberation by the Red Army, the local airfield was destroyed by an RAF bombing raid.

In 1945, the town was transferred back to the once again reestablished Pomeranian Voivodeship. Rumia became a city in 1954 when a few other villages (Zagórze, Biała Rzeka, Szmelta and Janowo) were joined in. The town was administratively part of the Gdańsk Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. In 2001, the nearby village of Kazimierz was also included into city of Rumia.

==Transport==
Rumia is well connected through a 2-lane highway that leads from Wejherowo to Gdynia and from there by Circular Highway to Gdańsk. There is a plan to extend the Circular from Gdynia to beyond Wejherowo.

The Szybka Kolej Miejska (Urban Fast Train) makes two stops in the city, connecting it to Wejherowo, Gdynia, and beyond. The stops are Rumia and Rumia Janowo. There is also network of city buses that also offers connections to Wejherowo and Gdynia.

==Sports==
Football team Orkan Rumia and rugby team Arka Rumia are based in the city.

== People from Rumia ==
* Erika Steinbach (born 1943) a German CDU politician, served in the Bundestag 1990-2017
* Jerzy Treder (1942–2015) a Polish philologist and linguist, focusing on Kashubian studies
* Magdalena Damaske (born 1996) a Polish volleyball player

==International relations==
Rumia is twinned with:

<doc id="194143" wikidata="Q48964" url="?curid=194143" title="Double negative">
<text>A double negative is a construction occurring when two forms of grammatical negation are used in the same sentence. This is typically used to convey a different shade of meaning from a strictly positive sentence (&quot;You&#x27;re not unattractive&quot; vs &quot;You&#x27;re attractive&quot;). Multiple negation is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a clause. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have negative concord or emphatic negation. Lithuanian, Portuguese, Persian, French, Russian,
Polish,
Bulgarian,
Greek, Spanish, Icelandic, Old English, Italian, Afrikaans, and Hebrew are examples of negative-concord languages. This is also true of many vernacular dialects of modern English. Chinese, Latin, German, Dutch, Japanese, Swedish and modern Standard English are examples of languages that do not have negative concord. Typologically, negative concord occurs in a minority of languages.

Languages without negative concord typically have negative polarity items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs. Examples are &quot;ever&quot;, &quot;anything&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot; in the sentence &quot;I haven&#x27;t ever owed anything to anyone&quot; (cf. &quot;I haven&#x27;t never owed nothing to no one&quot; in negative-concord dialects of English, and &quot;&quot; in Portuguese, lit. &quot;Never have I owed nothing to no one&quot;, &quot; in Italian, or &quot; in Polish). Negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as &quot;not&quot; or &quot;never&quot;, but also by words such as &quot;doubt&quot; or &quot;hardly&quot; (&quot;I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone&quot; or &quot;He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone&quot;).

Because standard English does not have negative concord but many varieties and registers of English do, and because most English speakers can speak or comprehend across varieties and registers, double negatives as collocations are functionally auto-antonymic (contranymic) in English; for example, a collocation such as &quot;ain&#x27;t nothin&quot; or &quot;not nothing&quot; can mean either &quot;something&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot;, and its disambiguation is resolved via the contexts of register, variety, location, and content of ideas. 

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m not feeling unwell&quot;), an understatement of the positive (&quot;I&#x27;m feeling well&quot;). The rhetorical term for this is litotes.

==English==
===Two negatives resolving to a positive===
When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative (see the Robert Lowth citation below): this is known as litotes. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one&#x27;s speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker. Compare
* &quot;There isn&#x27;t no other way.&quot;
:= There&#x27;s some other way. Negative: isn&#x27;t (is not), no
versus
* &quot;There isn&#x27;t no other way!&quot;
:= There&#x27;s no other way!
These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence&#x27;s meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.

In Standard English, two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop Robert Lowth wrote &quot;A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes&quot;. For instance, &quot;I don&#x27;t disagree&quot; could mean &quot;I certainly agree&quot;, &quot;I agree&quot;, &quot;I sort of agree&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand your point of view (POV)&quot;, &quot;I have no opinion&quot;, and so on; it is a form of &quot;weasel words&quot;. Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative &quot;I don&#x27;t agree&quot;, which typically means &quot;I disagree&quot;. However, the statement &quot;I don&#x27;t completely disagree&quot; is a similar double negative to &quot;I don&#x27;t disagree&quot; but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning &quot;I completely agree&quot;, Lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making back-handed compliments. The phrase &quot;Mr. Jones wasn&#x27;t incompetent.&quot; will seldom mean &quot;Mr. Jones was very competent&quot; since the speaker would&#x27;ve found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===

Discussing English grammar, the term &quot;double negative&quot; is often, though not universally, applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as Southern American English, African American Vernacular English, and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in Middle English: for example, Chaucer made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. About the Friar, he writes &quot;&quot; (&quot;There never was no man nowhere so virtuous&quot;). About the Knight, &quot;&quot; (&quot;He never yet no vileness didn&#x27;t say / In all his life to no manner of man&quot;).

Following the battle of Marston Moor, Oliver Cromwell quoted his nephew&#x27;s dying words in a letter to the boy&#x27;s father Valentine Walton: &quot;A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies.&quot; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read &quot;not ... to be any more&quot; instead.

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* &quot;I didn&#x27;t go nowhere today.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m not hungry no more.&quot;
* &quot;You don&#x27;t know nothing.&quot;
* &quot;There was never no more laziness at work than before.&quot;

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* &quot;I didn&#x27;t not go to the park today.&quot;
* &quot;We can&#x27;t not go to sleep!&quot;
* &quot;This is something you can&#x27;t not watch.&quot;

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former. In the first example, the verb &quot;to go&quot; separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb. Indeed, the word &#x27;nowhere&#x27; is thus being used as an adverb and does not negate the argument of the sentence.

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in &quot;I&#x27;m not doing ; I&#x27;m thinking.&quot; A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it. Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb &#x27;to doubt&#x27; has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* &quot;I never had no doubt this sentence is false.&quot;

Then what happens is that the verb &quot;to doubt&quot; becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb &#x27;more&#x27; merges with the prefix &quot;no-&quot; to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence&#x27;s former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb &quot;hungry&quot;. Where people think that the sentence &quot;I&#x27;m not hungry no more&quot; resolves to a positive is where the latter negative &quot;no&quot; becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart &quot;more&quot; which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase &quot;no more&quot; is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren&#x27;t acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., ; therefore, it is argued, &quot;I did not go nowhere&quot; resolves to &quot;I went somewhere&quot;.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:&quot;I&#x27;m not entirely familiar with Nihilism nor Existentialism.&quot;

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of &#x27;nor&#x27; enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn&#x27;t to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred &quot;I&#x27;m not entirely familiar with Nihilism or Existentialism&quot;; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of &#x27;nor&#x27; to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through the works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:&quot;Nor did they not perceive the evil plight&quot;
:&quot;In which they were&quot; ~ John Milton - Paradise Lost

:&quot;I never was, nor never will be&quot; ~ William Shakespeare - Richard III

The negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasize the negative clause.
Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation. &quot;Prescriptive grammarians&quot; recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English. To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English. This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.

In his &quot;Essay towards a practical English Grammar&quot; of 1711, James Greenwood first recorded the rule: &quot;Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm&quot;. Robert Lowth stated in his grammar textbook &quot;A Short Introduction to English Grammar&quot; (1762) that &quot;two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative&quot;. Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it. Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth&#x27;s grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.

===In film and TV===

Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), the chimney sweep Bert employs a double negative when he says, &quot;If you don&#x27;t wanna go nowhere...&quot; Another is used by the bandits in the &quot;Stinking Badges&quot; scene of John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948): &quot;Badges? We ain&#x27;t got no badges. We don&#x27;t need no badges!.&quot;

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder&quot; (1999) features Bart writing &quot;I won&#x27;t not use no double negatives&quot; as part of the opening sequence chalkboard gag. 

In the Harry Enfield sketch &quot;Mr Cholmondley-Warner&#x27;s Guide to the Working-Class&quot;, a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: &quot;Inside toilet? I ain&#x27;t never not heard of one of them nor I ain&#x27;t nor nothing.&quot;

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, in which schoolchildren chant &quot;We don&#x27;t need no education / We don&#x27;t need no thought control&quot;) or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;). Other examples include Ain&#x27;t Nobody (Chaka Khan), Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine (Bill Withers), and Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough (Marvin Gaye)

==Other Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other West Germanic languages. A notable exception is Afrikaans in which it is mandatory (for example, &quot;He cannot speak Afrikaans&quot; becomes &quot;Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie&quot;, &quot;He cannot Afrikaans speak not&quot;). Dialectal Dutch, French and San have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:
* (&quot;I did not know that he would be coming.&quot;)
* (&quot;I knew that he would not be coming.&quot;)
* (&quot;He will not be coming because he is sick.&quot;)
* (&quot;It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.&quot;)

Another point of view is that the construction is not really an example of a &quot;double negative&quot; but simply a grammatical template for negation. The second cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (unlike in French, for example), and it cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical. The grammatical particle has no independent meaning and happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded , meaning &quot;not&quot;, by a historical accident.

The second is used if and only if the sentence or phrase does not already end with either or another negating adverb.
* (&quot;I don&#x27;t see you&quot;)
* (&quot;I never see you&quot;)

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive:
* (&quot;I don&#x27;t agree with you.&quot; )
* (&quot;I don&#x27;t &quot;not&quot; agree with you,&quot; i.e., I agree with you.)

Double negation is still found in the Low Franconian dialects of west Flanders (e.g., , &quot;I do not want to do that&quot;) and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as Garderen, but it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. Belgian Dutch dialects, however, still have some widely-used expressions like (&quot;never not&quot;) for &quot;never&quot;.

Like some dialects of English, Bavarian has both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. Beyond that, triple negation is also present. For example, the Bavarian (&quot;This have I yet never not heard&quot;) can be compared to the Standard German &quot;. The German emphatic &quot; (roughly &quot;never ever&quot;) corresponds to Bavarian &quot; or even &quot; in the Standard German pronunciation. &quot;Hat kaaner kaa Messer net do?&quot; (&quot;Has nobody no knife not here?&quot;) is an example of a triple negative. 

Another exception is Yiddish for which Slavic influence causes the double (and sometimes even triple) negative to be quite common.

A few examples would be:
* &quot;ikh hob keynmol nisht gesogt&quot; (&quot;I never didn&#x27;t say&quot;)
* &quot;ikh hob nisht keyn more far keynem nit&quot; (&quot;I have no fear of no one not&quot;)
* It is common to add (&quot;not&quot;) after the Yiddish word (&quot;nothing&quot;), i.e. (&quot;I haven&#x27;t said nothing&quot;)

==Latin and Romance languages==
In Latin a second negative word appearing along with turns the meaning into a positive one: means &quot;any&quot;, means &quot;no&quot;, () means &quot;some&quot;. In the same way, means &quot;ever&quot;, means &quot;never&quot;, () means &quot;sometimes&quot;. In many Romance languages a second term indicating a negative is required.

In French, the usual way to express simple negation is to employ two words, e.g. &quot; [verb] &quot;, &quot; [verb] &quot;, or &quot; [verb] &quot;, as in the sentences , , and . The second term was originally an emphatic; , for example, derives from the Latin , meaning &quot;step&quot;, so that French and Catalan originally meant &quot;I will not walk a single step.&quot; This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language to such a degree that is generally dropped entirely, as in . In Northern Catalan, may be omitted in colloquial language, and Occitan, which uses only as a short answer to questions. In Venetian, the double negation can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: (&quot;I eat not&quot;) and (&quot;I come not&quot;). These exemplify Jespersen&#x27;s cycle.

, , and (never, nothing, no one, nowhere) can be mixed with each other, and/or with (not anymore/not again) in French, e.g. to form sentences like (I didn&#x27;t say anything to anyone) or even (He never says anything to anyone anymore).

The Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian languages usually employ doubled negative correlatives. Portuguese , Spanish , Romanian and Italian (literally, &quot;I do not see nothing&quot;) are used to express &quot;I do not see anything&quot;. In Italian, a second following negative particle turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both (&quot;I want to eat&quot;) and (&quot;I don&#x27;t want not to eat&quot;) mean &quot;I want to eat&quot;, the latter phrase more precisely means &quot;I&#x27;d prefer to eat&quot;.

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In Asturian, an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: (&quot;I had not never seen him&quot;) means &quot;I have never seen him&quot; and (&quot;I neither do not like it&quot;) means &quot;I do not like it either&quot;. Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double &quot;no&quot; with other negatives, so or , respectively meant &quot;I have not seen her either&quot;. This practice is dying out.

==Welsh==
In spoken Welsh, the word (not) often occurs with a prefixed or mutated verb form that is negative in meaning: (word-for-word, &quot;Not-is she not here&quot;) expresses &quot;She is not here&quot; and (word-for-word, &quot;Not-will-get Aled not go&quot;) expresses &quot;Aled is not allowed to go&quot;.

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, &#x27; or &#x27;. The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: (word-for-word, &quot;[Not] not-knew nobody&quot;) means &quot;Nobody knew&quot; and (word-for-word, &quot;[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money&quot;) means &quot;Aled will not get much money&quot;. This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in Ancient Greek. With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, , &quot;no one&quot;) results in an affirmation: (&quot;No one was not suffering&quot;) means more simply &quot;Everyone was suffering&quot;. Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: (&quot;Do not permit no one to raise an uproar&quot;) means &quot;Let not a single one among them raise an uproar&quot;.

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: means &quot;It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him&quot;, and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In Modern Greek, a double negative can express either an affirmation or a negation, depending on the word combination. When expressing negation, it usually carries an emphasis with it. Native speakers can usually understand the sentence meaning from the voice tone and the context.

&quot;Examples&quot;

A combination of and has an affirmative meaning: &quot;&quot; translates &quot;Without that meaning that we can&#x27;t find it.&quot; i.e. We can find it.

A combination of and also has an affirmative meaning: &quot;&quot; translates &quot;Doesn&#x27;t mean that we can&#x27;t find it.&quot; i.e. We can find it.

A combination of and has a negative meaning: &quot;&quot; translates &quot;You won&#x27;t get any book.&quot;

==Slavic languages==
In Slavic languages, multiple negatives affirm each other. Indeed, if a sentence contains a negated verb, any indefinite pronouns or adverbs must be used in their negative forms. For example, in the Serbo-Croatian, (&quot;Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere&quot;) means &quot;Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere&quot;, and (&quot;Never I did not go there&quot;) means &quot;I have never been there&quot;. In Czech, it is (&quot;I have not seen never no-one nowhere&quot;). In Bulgarian, it is: [], lit. &quot;I have not seen never no-one nowhere&quot;, or (&quot;), lit. &quot;I don&#x27;t know nothing&quot;. In Russian, &quot;I know nothing&quot; is [], lit. &quot;I don&#x27;t know nothing&quot;.

Negating the verb without negating the pronoun (or vice versa), while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying &quot;I saw nobody&quot; in Polish () instead of the more usual &quot;I did not see nobody&quot; () might mean &quot;I saw an instance of nobody&quot; or &quot;I saw Mr Nobody&quot; but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in Slovenian, saying &quot;I do not know anyone&quot; () in place of &quot;I do not know no one&quot; () has the connotation &quot;I do not know just &quot;anyone&quot;: I know someone important or special.&quot;

In Czech, like in many other languages, a standard double negative is used in sentences with a negative pronoun or negative conjunction, where the verb is also negated ( &quot;nobody came&quot;, literally &quot;nobody didn&#x27;t come&quot;). However, this doubleness is also transferred to forms where the verbal copula is released and the negation is joined to the nominal form, and such a phrase can be ambiguous: (&quot;nobody unscathed&quot;) can mean both &quot;nobody healthy&quot; and &quot;all healthy&quot;. Similarly, (&quot;nobody absent&quot;) or (&quot;three tasks were planned, none uncompleted&quot;). The sentence, (&quot;all don&#x27;t were there&quot;) means not &quot;all absented&quot; but &quot;there were not all&quot; (= &quot;at least one of them absenteed&quot;). If all absented, it should be said (&quot;nobody weren&#x27;t there&quot;). However, in many cases, a double, triple quadruple negative can really work in such a way that each negative cancels out the next negative, and such a sentence may be a catch and may be incomprehensible to a less attentive or less intelligent addressee. E.g. the sentence, (&quot;I can&#x27;t never not indulge in inaction&quot;) contains 4 negations and it is very confusing which of them create a &quot;double negative&quot; and which of them eliminated from each other. Such confusing sentences can then diplomatically soften or blur rejection or unpleasant information or even agreement, but at the expense of intelligibility: (&quot;it can&#x27;t be not seen&quot;), (&quot;I&#x27;m not dissatisfied&quot;), (&quot;it/he is not uninteresting&quot;), (&quot;I can&#x27;t disagree&quot;).

==Baltic languages==
As with most synthetic &quot;satem&quot; languages double negative is mandatory in Latvian and Lithuanian. Furthermore, all verbs and indefinite pronouns in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement &quot;I have not ever owed anything to anyone&quot; would be rendered as . The only alternative would be using a negating subordinate clause and subjunctive in the main clause, which could be approximated in English as &quot;there has not ever been an instance that I would have owed anything to anyone&quot; (), where negative pronouns () are replaced by indefinite pronouns () more in line with the English &quot;ever, any&quot; indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in Hungarian with negative pronouns: (word for word: &quot;[doesn&#x27;t-exists] [nothing-of-mine]&quot;, and translates literally as &quot;I do not have nothing&quot;) means &quot;I do not have anything&quot;. Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes &quot;se-,&quot; &quot;sem-,&quot; and &quot;sen-&quot; to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in Finnish, which uses the auxiliary verb to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes &quot;-an,&quot; &quot;-än,&quot; &quot;-kaan,&quot; or &quot;-kään&quot; to interrogative pronouns: means &quot;No one called me&quot;. These suffixes are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with . This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example for (&quot;even&quot;), as in meaning &quot;even so much&quot;, and meaning &quot;not even so much&quot;.

==Turkish==

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in Turkish phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, (literally, word for word, &quot;Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not&quot;) means &quot;I don&#x27;t have anything&quot;. Likewise, (literally, &quot;Never satisfied not-I-am&quot;) means &quot;I&#x27;m never satisfied&quot;.

==Japanese==
Japanese employs litotes to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, (&#x27;, &quot;must&quot;, more literally &quot;if not done, [can] not be&quot;) means &quot;not doing [it] wouldn&#x27;t be proper&quot;. (&#x27;, also &quot;must&quot;, &quot;if not done, can not go&#x27;) similarly means &quot;not doing [it] can&#x27;t go forward&quot;.

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one&#x27;s rudeness as well. Whilst &quot;He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji&quot; can be phrased (&quot;&quot;), there is a harsher idea in it: &quot;Because he studied Japanese, there is no reason he can&#x27;t write Kanji&quot;.

==Chinese==
Mandarin Chinese and most Chinese languages also employ litotes in a likewise manner. One common construction is &quot;&quot; (Pinyin: &#x27;, &quot;mustn&#x27;t not&quot; or &quot;shalln&#x27;t not&quot;), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and convenable than that expressed by &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &quot;must&quot;). Compared with &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &quot;I must go&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &quot;I mustn&#x27;t not go&quot;) emphasizes that the situation is out of the speaker&#x27;s hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: &quot;Unfortunately, I have got to go&quot;. Similarly, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &quot;No one doesn&#x27;t know&quot;) or idiomatically &quot;无人不知&quot; (, &quot;There is no one who does not know&quot;) is a more emphatic way to express &quot;Every single one knows&quot;.

A double negative almost always resolves to a positive meaning and even more so in colloquial speech where the speaker particularly stresses the first negative word. Meanwhile, a triple negative resolves to a negative meaning, which bares a stronger negativity than a single negative. For example, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &quot;I do not think there is no one who does not know&quot;) ambiguously means either &quot;I don&#x27;t think everyone knows&quot; or &quot;I think someone does not know&quot;. A quadruple negative further resolves to a positive meaning embedded with stronger affirmation than a double negative; for example, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;, &quot;It is not the case that I do not know that no one doesn&#x27;t like him&quot;) means &quot;I do know that everyone likes him&quot;. However, more than triple negatives are frequently perceived as obscure and rarely encountered.

== Historical development ==
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as Jespersen&#x27;s cycle, where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. Old French → Modern Standard French → Modern Colloquial French &quot;I don&#x27;t say&quot;).

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative &quot;per se&quot; (thus in French &quot;step&quot;, originally &quot;not a step&quot; = &quot;not a bit&quot;). However, in Germanic languages such as English and German, the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives &quot;not&quot; and in these languages originally meant &quot;nothing&quot;: e.g. Old English &quot;I didn&#x27;t see&quot; » Middle English , lit. &quot;I didn&#x27;t see nothing&quot; » Early Modern English &quot;I saw not&quot;.

A similar development to a circumfix from double negation can be seen in non-Indo-European languages, too: for example, in Maltese, &quot;he ate&quot; is negated as &quot;he did not eat&quot;, where the verb is preceded by a negative particle - &quot;not&quot; and followed by the particle &quot;-x&quot;, which was originally a shortened form of &quot;nothing&quot; - thus, &quot;he didn&#x27;t eat nothing&quot;.

<text>Beaumaris Castle ( ; , ), in Beaumaris, Anglesey, Wales, was built as part of Edward I&#x27;s campaign to conquer north Wales after 1282. Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward&#x27;s invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete.

Beaumaris Castle was taken by Welsh forces in 1403 during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, but recaptured by royal forces in 1405.

In March 1592, the Welsh Roman Catholic priest and martyr William Davies was imprisoned in the castle, and was eventually hanged, drawn and quartered there on 27 July 1593.

Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies. Despite forming part of a local royalist rebellion in 1648, the castle escaped slighting and was garrisoned by Parliament, but fell into ruin around 1660, eventually forming part of a stately home and park in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the ruined castle is still a tourist attraction.

Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris Castle as Britain&#x27;s &quot;most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning&quot;. The fortification is built of local stone, with a moated outer ward guarded by twelve towers and two gatehouses, overlooked by an inner ward with two large, D-shaped gatehouses and six massive towers. The inner ward was designed to contain ranges of domestic buildings and accommodation able to support two major households. The south gate could be reached by ship, allowing the castle to be directly supplied by sea. UNESCO considers Beaumaris to be one of &quot;the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe&quot;, and it is classed as a World Heritage Site.

==History==

===13th–14th centuries===
The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of North Wales since the 1070s and the conflict had been renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward decided to permanently colonise North Wales and provisions for its governance were set out in the Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3 March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west, Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey. New towns with protective castles were established at Caernarfon and Harlech, the administrative centres of the first two shires, with another castle and walled town built in nearby Conwy, and plans were probably made to establish a similar castle and settlement near the town of Llanfaes on Anglesey. Llanfaes was the wealthiest borough in Wales and largest in terms of population, an important trading port and on the preferred route from North Wales to Ireland. The huge cost of building the other castles, however, meant that the Llanfaes project had to be postponed.
In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule. The revolt was bloody and amongst the casualties was Roger de Pulesdon, the sheriff of Anglesey. Edward suppressed the rebellion over the winter and once Anglesey was reoccupied in April 1295 he immediately began to progress the delayed plans to fortify the area. The chosen site was called Beaumaris, meaning &quot;fair marsh&quot;, whose name derives from the Norman-French &quot;Beau Mareys&quot;, and in Latin the castle was termed &quot;de Bello Marisco&quot;. This was about from Llanfaes and the decision was therefore taken to move the Welsh population of Llanfaes some south-west, where a settlement by the name of Newborough was created for them. The deportation of the local Welsh opened the way for the construction of a prosperous English town, protected by a substantial castle.

The castle was positioned in one corner of the town, following a similar town plan to that in the town of Conwy, although in Beaumaris no town walls were constructed at first, despite some foundations being laid. Work began in the summer of 1295, overseen by Master James of St George. James had been appointed the &quot;master of the king&#x27;s works in Wales&quot;, reflecting the responsibility he had in their construction and design. From 1295 onwards, Beaumaris became his primary responsibility and more frequently he was given the title &quot;magister operacionum de Bello Marisco&quot;. The work was recorded in considerable detail on the pipe rolls, the continuous records of medieval royal expenditure, and, as a result, the early stages of construction at Beaumaris are relatively well understood for the period.
A huge amount of work was undertaken in the first summer, with an average of 1,800 workmen, 450 stonemasons and 375 quarriers on the site. This consumed around £270 a week in wages and the project rapidly fell into arrears, forcing officials to issue leather tokens instead of paying the workforce with normal coinage. The centre of the castle was filled with temporary huts to house the workforce over the winter. The following spring, James explained to his employers some of the difficulties and the high costs involved:

The construction slowed during 1296, although debts continued to build up, and work dropped off further the following year, stopping entirely by 1300, by when around £11,000 had been spent. The halt was primarily the result of Edward&#x27;s new wars in Scotland, which had begun to consume his attention and financial resources, but it left the castle only partially complete: the inner walls and towers were only a fraction of their proper height and the north and north-west sides lacked outer defences altogether. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, but the unfinished castle had already fallen into a poor state of repair. Work recommenced on completing the outer defences, first under James&#x27; direction and then, after his death in 1309, Master Nicolas de Derneford. This work finally halted in 1330 with the castle still not built to its intended height; by the end of the project, £15,000 had been spent, a colossal sum for the period. A royal survey in 1343 suggested that at least a further £684 would be needed to complete the castle, but this was never invested.

===15th–21st centuries===
In 1400 a revolt broke out in North Wales against English rule, led by Owain Glyndŵr. Beaumaris Castle was placed under siege and captured by the rebels in 1403, being retaken by royal forces in 1405. The castle was ill-maintained and fell into disrepair and by 1534, when Roland de Velville was the castle constable, rain was leaking into most of the rooms. In 1539 a report complained that it was protected by an arsenal of only eight or ten small guns and forty bows, which the castle&#x27;s new constable, Richard Bulkeley, considered to be completely inadequate for protecting the fortress against a potential Scottish attack. Matters worsened and by 1609 the castle was classed as &quot;utterlie decayed&quot;.

The English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Beaumaris Castle was a strategic location in the war, as it controlled part of the route between the king&#x27;s bases in Ireland and his operations in England. Thomas Bulkeley, whose family had been involved in the management of the castle for several centuries, held Beaumaris for the king and may have spent around £3,000 improving its defences. By 1646, however, Parliament had defeated the royal armies and the castle was surrendered by Colonel Richard Bulkeley in June. Anglesey revolted against Parliament again in 1648, and Beaumaris was briefly reoccupied by royalist forces, surrendering for a second time in October that year.

After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to put them beyond military use, but Parliament was concerned about the threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.

Thomas Bulkeley, 7th Viscount Bulkeley bought the castle from the Crown in 1807 for £735, incorporating it into the park that surrounded his seat, Baron Hill. By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations for visiting painters and travellers, who considered the ivy-clad ruins romantic. Although not as popular as other sites in the region, Beaumaris formed part of this trend and was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835. Some of the castle&#x27;s stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol.

In 1925 Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley, 12th Baronet retained the freehold and placed the castle into the care of the Commissioners of Works, who then carried out a large scale restoration programme, stripping back the vegetation, digging out the moat and repairing the stonework. In 1950 the castle, considered by the authorities to be &quot;one of the outstanding Edwardian medieval castles of Wales&quot;, was designated as a Grade I listed building – the highest grade of listing, protecting buildings of &quot;exceptional, usually national, interest&quot;.

Beaumaris was declared part of the &quot;Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd&quot; World Heritage Site in 1986, UNESCO considering it one of &quot;the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe&quot;. In the 21st century Beaumaris Castle is managed by Cadw, the Welsh Assembly Government&#x27;s agency for historic monuments, as a tourist attraction, with 75,000 visitors during the 2007–08 financial year. The castle requires ongoing maintenance and repairs cost £58,000 over the 2002–03 financial year.

==Architecture==

Beaumaris Castle was never fully built, but had it been completed it would probably have closely resembled Harlech Castle. Both castles are concentric in plan, with walls within walls, although Beaumaris is the more regular in design. Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris as Britain&#x27;s &quot;most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning&quot; and for many years the castle was regarded as the pinnacle of military engineering during Edward I&#x27;s reign. This evolutionary interpretation is now disputed by historians: Beaumaris was as much a royal palace and symbol of English power as it was a straightforward defensive fortification. Nonetheless, the castle is praised by UNESCO as a &quot;unique artistic achievement&quot; for the way in which it combines &quot;characteristic 13th century double-wall structures with a central plan&quot; and for the beauty of its &quot;proportions and masonry&quot;.

Beaumaris Castle was built at around sea-level on top of the till and other sediments that form the local coastline, and was constructed from local Anglesey stone from within of the site, with some stones brought along the coast by ship, for example from the limestone quarries at Penmon. The stone was a mixture of limestone, sandstone and green schists, which was used fairly randomly within the walls and towers; the use of schists ceased after the pause in the building work in 1298 and as a result is limited to the lower levels of the walls.

The castle design formed an inner and an outer ward, surrounded in turn by a moat, now partially filled. The main entrance to the castle was the Gate next the Sea, next to the castle&#x27;s tidal dock that allowed it to be supplied directly by sea. The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period. The Gate next the Sea led into an outer barbican, protected by a drawbridge, arrow slits and murder-holes, leading on into the outer ward. 

The outer ward consisted of an eight-sided curtain wall with twelve turrets enclosing an area approximately across; one gateway led out to the Gate next the Sea, the other, the Llanfaes Gate, led out to the north side of the castle. The defences were originally equipped with around 300 firing positions for archers, including 164 arrow slits, although 64 of the slits close to the ground level have since been blocked in to prevent them being exploited by attackers, either in the early 15th century or during the Civil War. The outer gate had an innovation for its time: it is non-aligned with the inner gate meaning any intruder who penetrated the outer gate would be forced to transverse an open area on a predictable rightward path to attempt to reach the inner gate, exposed to intense defensive attacks the entire distance.
The walls of the inner ward were more substantial than those of the outer ward, high and thick, with huge towers and two large gatehouses, enclosing a area. The inner ward was intended to hold the accommodation and other domestic buildings of the castle, with ranges of buildings stretching along the west and east sides of the ward; some of the remains of the fireplaces for these buildings can still be seen in the stonework. It is uncertain if these ranges were actually ever built or if they were constructed but later demolished after the Civil War. If finished, the castle would have been able to host two substantial households and their followers, for example the king and queen, or the king, queen and a prince and his own wife.

The D-shaped north gatehouse in the inner ward was intended to be two storeys high, with two sets of five, large windows, of which only one floor was actually completed. It would have included a large hall on the first floor, around by across, divided into two with separate fireplaces for heating. The south gatehouse was designed to be a replica of that on the north side, but building work progressed even less far before finishing in 1330. Some of the stonework may since have been removed from the gatehouse, reducing its height even further.

The walls of the inner ward contain extensive first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using the water from the moat, but the system does not appear to have worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.

<text>Gorlice () is a town and an urban municipality (&quot;gmina&quot;) in south-eastern Poland with around 29,500 inhabitants (2008). It is situated south east of Kraków and south of Tarnów between Jasło and Nowy Sącz in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Nowy Sącz Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Gorlice County.

==History==
Gorlice was founded during the reign of Casimir the Great in 1354. In that year, the Stolnik of Sandomierz, Derslaw Karwacjan, received royal permission to found a town in a densely forested area of the Carpathian foothills. The existence of the town is mentioned in sources from 1388, 1404 and 1417. In the 15th century, Gorlice remained private property of the Karwacjan family.

The town quickly developed, becoming a regional center of crafts and trade. In 1504, Jan Karwacjan received royal permission for two fairs annually and a weekly market. During the Polish Golden Age, Gorlice prospered. Its artisans and merchants had contacts not only with other Polish towns, but also with merchants from Upper Hungary. In the second half of the 16th century, Gorlice became property of the Odrowaz family, which supported Protestant Reformation. Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–60) brought widespread destruction: the population of Gorlice fell from 1200 (in 1657) to only 284 (in 1662).

===Age of Partitions and first kerosene lamp===

As a result of the First Partition of Poland (Treaty of St-Petersburg dated 5 July 1772), the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire (for more details, read the article Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria). In 1806, the Austrian government sold the town to a local nobleman, Jan Nepomucen Stadnicki of Roznow.

Until 1918, the town remained part of Austria-Hungary (Cisleithania) after the compromise of 1867, head (since 1865) of the county with the same name, one of the 78 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Austrian Galicia province (Crown land). By mid-19th century, the population of Gorlice reached 4000. The town entered the period of its prosperity after its 1854–1858 resident Ignacy Łukasiewicz invented the kerosene lamp in 1853. In a few years, sprawling oil wells emerged in Gorlice, and the town was called the cradle of Polish oil industry; its rapid industrialization was spurred with the construction of a railroad (1883).

By early 20th century, the population of Gorlice grew to 6,000, but its development was halted by World War I. The city was the focal point of the German Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive during World War I, in May 1915. Extremely heavy and prolonged fighting took place here, Gorlice frequently changed hands, and as a result, the town was completely destroyed. Hence the &quot;Gorlice fair&quot; or &quot;Gorlice days&quot; held every year during the May Bank Holidays and adjoining days, which are enjoyed by many visitors both domestic and from abroad.

===20th century===

During the First World War, Gorlice played a strategically significant role in the 1915 Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive. On May 1, 1915, the combined forces of Austria-Hungary and Germany initiated artillery barrages against Russian soldiers stationed on the battle line stretching from Gorlice to Tarnow. The following day, Austro-German infantry units launched an unsuccessful attack near Tarnow. In Gorlice, the weakened Russian forces were unable to defend against the Austrian and German attackers. On May 6, General Radko-Dmitriev, commander of the Russian Third Army, ordered his troops to retreat. An attempt by General Radko-Dmitriev to counterattack on May 7 and 8 resulted in disaster for the Russians, as German reinforcements outnumbered the defenders. 
The following spring, General Alexei Brusilov, commander of the Russian Eighth Army, launched a counteroffensive that nearly destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Army. The Brusilov Offensive, as it is known, is regarded as one of the most successful operations in the First World War.
In the Second Polish Republic, Gorlice belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. Since local oil wells had been almost exhausted, the center of Polish oil industry moved eastwards, to Borysław. This resulted in widespread unemployment, street demonstrations and increased popularity of Communist ideology among local workers. On 1 May 1936, a May Day rally attracted 20,000 people.

The German occupation of Gorlice began on 7 September 1939 (see Invasion of Poland). During the war, the town&#x27;s Jewish community was first herded by Nazi Germans into the newly formed Gorlice Ghetto and then murdered at Belzec. On 16 January 1945, the Red Army liberated Gorlice.

=== History of Jews in Gorlice ===
When Gorlice was first founded there were not any Jewish communities. Most of the Jews in the area would live in villages or Polish landowners estates. There were a few reasons for Jews at this time to not live within Gorlice. One was the Magdeburg Rights, by living outside of Gorlice in villages or on estates, the Jewish communities did not have to follow the city&#x27;s laws. Some of the suburbs that Jews did live in were Ropica Polska, Siary, Strezeszyn, Marianpolski and Magdaleni. Another reason that Jews were not residing in Gorlice in earlier times was because of &quot;&quot;De non tolerandis Judaeis&quot;.&quot; This was a ruling that some cities had during the 16th century, forbidding Jews from living in them. (These were anti-Semitic edicts, used to prevent competition in business and other areas of work).

In the 18th century there were a few Jewish families living in Gorlice. When the Jews first settled in Gorlice they were mostly making a living through trading wine and corn. The first Jewish families also had a sawmill to process wood as well as trading items like wine, corn, and tobacco. Even though there were only a few Jewish families during the 18th century, when the 19th century came around there was already a Jewish community forming including their own cemetery and synagogue. It was not until the later half of the 19th century that Jewish people started really settling into the city. The Jews settling in Gorlice at that time were mostly settling in the area by the market square and its nearby streets. This area that most Jews were settling in would in the future, under German occupation, become the Gorlice Ghetto.

In the 19th century, when more Jews started settling inside of Gorlice, the current non-Jewish residents worked mostly in crafts and agriculture. At the time that the Jews were moving into Gorlice, there was also the discovery of oil in the Gorlice region in that later half of the 19th century. While the non-Jewish residents were working with agriculture, the Jews were prevailing in the oil industry with trade and development. In 1874, Jewish investors helped with the development of an oil refinery, along with another one nearby in 1883.
The population of the Jews in Gorlice is not well documented or reliable before the latter half of the 19th century. There are statistics on the Jewish population from 1880 to 1910 though. Looking first at the Gorlice district in 1880 there was a total of 74,072 residents and out of those 6.4% (4,755) were Jews. Just in the city of Gorlice itself, there were 2,257 Jews out of the around 5,000 residents of the city which is close to 50%. The population of Jews in Gorlice grew to 7.5% of the Gorlice district composed of Jews in 1910 and 51% of residents in the City of Gorlice were Jewish at that time (3,495 out of 6,600).

Because of World War I, the population did drop during the period of 1910 to 1921. In 1921, after the war, there were about 2,300 Jews left, which was about 41% of the population. During World War I, the Russian army was one of the main reasons for this drop in the number of Jews. There were rapes, robberies, and murders, and many Jews fled Gorlice to other countries and never came back after the war.

Even though the war affected the Jewish population, they were able to get back on their feet and restore their economic status to what it was pre-war. 90% of shops in Gorlice were Jewish and 30% of craft workshops. Jews contributed much to the Gorlice economy and their activity was an important part of the industrial and commercial life. They led in trade and other services. Jews were also represented in the Municipal Authorities at this time. There were 22 members of the Town Council who were Jewish in 1924 and during municipal elections that year there were 23 Jews elected. Not only were they thriving in the economy, the Jewish life was also ideal culturally and religiously at this time. Cultural and religious life was centered around two synagogues in the city, one on Mickiewicza Street and another newer one on Piekarska Street.

When World War II started in 1939, the population of the Jews in Gorlice was back up to around 5000 which was once again above half of the residents of the city. Approximately 3,400 persons were sent to the Gorlice Ghetto. When that was liquidated in September 1942 the remaining Jews were sent to Belzec, the first mass extermination camp, where the Nazis perfected their use of the gas chamber. It achieved an average kill rate of 50,000 a month.

<doc id="194149" wikidata="Q1681343" url="?curid=194149" title="James of Saint George">
<text>Master James of Saint George (–1309; French: , Old French: Mestre Jaks, Latin: Magister Jacobus de Sancto Georgio) was a master of works/architect from Savoy, described by historian Marc Morris as &quot;one of the greatest architects of the European Middle Ages&quot;. He was largely responsible for designing King Edward I&#x27;s castles in North Wales, including Conwy, Harlech and Caernarfon (all begun in 1283) and Beaumaris on Anglesey (begun 1295).

==Origin and early life==

There is little firm documentary evidence of James’ early life and origin. Circumstantial evidence, however, suggests that his place of birth was Saint-Prex in or around the year 1230. His father was also an architect mason, named John. This strong evidence related to his father, including year of death and architectural style, lead to the conclusion that John was Jean Cotereel the builder of Saint-Prex and Lausanne Cathedral. Of particular interest are the similarities of the rose windows at Canterbury Cathedral and Lausanne Cathedral and the similarity of the west window of Lausanne Cathedral to that of the eastern hall window later built at Conwy Castle.

The career of “Magistro Jacobo” began with the construction for Peter II, Count of Savoy of Yverdon-les-Bains Castle. At Yverdon, James was at first working with his father John, but by 1265 he is recorded as working alone, likely indicating the death of his father. From his apprenticeship to his father he went on to work under the guidance of an engineer from Gascony, who had previously worked for Henry III of England, Jean de Mézos. James worked at the at Salins-les-Thermes at works dictated by Mézos in 1267–68.

Following the death of Peter II, Count of Savoy in 1268 he went on to work for his successor, Philip I, Count of Savoy. Unlike Peter, who had preferred Chillon Castle as his main residence, Philip preferred the Viennois which was closer to his former see of Lyon. Philip began construction of a new palace castle at . Building the castle would be Magistro Jacobo; his name &quot;Saint George&quot;, only acquired after moving to England, may well be a reference to this castle of and/or his prior residence at the village of the same name. The first reference to this name in English records is Magistri Jacobi Di Sancto Georgio on 8 November 1280, two years after his arrival into England. His patron, King Edward I, probably met Master James of St George whilst returning from Crusade and visiting Savoy in 1273. It was 25 June 1273 that King Edward I of England visited so that his great-uncle Philip I, Count of Savoy might pay homage to him in fulfilment of an earlier 1246 treaty whereby the castles of Bard, Avigliana, the palace of Susa and town of Saint-Maurice had been enfeoffed to the King of England.


James was responsible for the castles constructed for Philip I, Count of Savoy in the between 1270 and 1275 at , , and . It is very possible that the simultaneous construction of these castles, three round tower castles and one octagonal tower palace castle, influenced Edward&#x27;s decision to hire him to construct the castles in north Wales. Perhaps his last work in Savoy was at in the Aosta Valley in the summer of 1275.

There is an archival gap of the career of Magistro Jacobo between 1275 when he is last recorded in Savoy and 1278 when first recorded in Britain. Marshall has suggested that during the &#x27;gap&#x27; he may have been working for the family of Otto de Grandson who was close to both Edward I of England and the comital family of Savoy, possibly including the construction of Grandson Castle and Lucens Castle.

Historian and author A. J. Taylor proposed in 1950 that and Master James of Saint George were one and the same man. Taylor travelled from Wales to Savoy, noting the similarities of their castles&#x27; architectural features, citing the garderobes at La Bâtiaz Castle, the windows at Chillon Castle along with the town walls at Saillon as examples.

==British works==

Following the short war of 1277 between Edward I of England and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, following the latter&#x27;s refusal to pay due homage, James was called from Savoy to England to the service of the king. The earliest references in the English records of James of St George are found in April 1278 describing him as &quot;&quot; translates as “going to Wales to put in order the works of the castles” there, that is the Mason charged with the design, technical direction and management of the works underway in Wales He is recorded as travelling to Wales, &quot;&quot; at which time four new castles were being built: Flint, Rhuddlan, Builth and Aberystwyth. Historian A. J. Taylor records that from 1277 until 1280 his main work was to supervise the building of Rhuddlan Castle and the canalisation of the River Clwyd before turning to Flint. Flint Castle is similar in concept to that built by Master James earlier at Yverdon-les-Bains

He was appointed Master of the Royal Works in Wales () around 1285, drawing a wage of 3&quot;s.&quot; a day. This appointment gave him control of construction in all its aspects of castles at Conwy, Caernarfon and Harlech, and primary sources link Master James to Susa as well (and reinforce the link with Conwy Castle).

An example of the way in which he brought the finer points of architecture from Savoy to north Wales are the three pinnacled merlons to be found at the :it:Castello di San Giorio di Susa and at Conwy Castle. Harlech Castle, begun in 1283, was effectively completed in 1289. On 3 July 1290, James of St George was appointed Constable of Harlech Castle, succeeding John de Bonvillars who had died in August 1287. He held this position until 14 December 1293.

His final Welsh castle was Beaumaris, on which work started in April 1295. Described by historian Marc Morris as Master James&#x27; &quot;most perfectly conceived castle&quot;, it remained unfinished on his death in 1309. Among other features introduced by James in this castle was an innovative defensive design: the outer gate was non-aligned with the inner gate meaning any intruder who penetrated the outer gate would be forced to transverse an open area on a predictable rightward path to attempt to reach the inner gate, exposed to intense defensive attacks the entire distance.

James of St George had joined Edward I in Scotland, probably around September 1298. In February 1302, James of St George was appointed to oversee to the new defences at Linlithgow. He had also worked at Stirling during the siege of 1304.

There is no record of James&#x27;s wife, Ambrosia, receiving a pension after his death, so it is probable she did not survive him. He would be survived by his two sons, Giles and Tassin of Saint George.

<text>Tabasco, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Tabasco, is one of the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 17 municipalities and its capital city is Villahermosa.

It is located in southeast Mexico and is bordered by the states of Campeche to the northeast, Veracruz to the west, and Chiapas to the south and the Petén department of Guatemala to the southeast. It has a coastline to the north with the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the state is covered in rainforest as, unlike most other areas of Mexico, it has plentiful rainfall year-round. The state is also home to La Venta, the major site of the Olmec civilization, considered to be the origin of later Mesoamerican cultures. It produces significant quantities of petroleum and natural gas.

==Geography==
The state is located in the southeast of Mexico, bordering the states of Campeche, Chiapas, and Veracruz, with the Gulf of Mexico to the north and the country of Guatemala to the south and east. The state covers , which is 1.3 percent of Mexico&#x27;s total. The northwestern portion is on the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico with the south and east as part of the mountain chain that extends into northern Chiapas. It is divided into seventeen municipalities. There are 36 communities designated as urban, with about 3,000 smaller towns and villages. 185 are classified as &quot;regional development centers&quot;. Tabasco has seventeen municipalities: Balancán, Cárdenas, Centla, Centro (Villahermosa), Comalcalco, Cunduacán, Emiliano Zapata, Huimanguillo, Jalapa, Jalpa de Méndez, Jonuta, Macuspana, Nacajuca, Paraíso, Tacotalpa, Teapa and Tenosique.

In 1994, the state was officially divided into two regions and five sub-regions for socioeconomic development and geographic documentation. The two major regions are called the Grijalva and the Usumacinta. The Grijalva Region is named after the river on which most of the municipalities here are dependent. It is the smaller of the two regions with a territory of or 48.94 percent of the state&#x27;s territory; however, it contains most of Tabasco&#x27;s urban population as well as of its socioeconomic and political activity. It is divided into three sub-regions called Chontalpa, Centro and Sierra; it includes the municipalities of Huimanguillo, Cárdenas, Comalcalco, Cunduacán, Paraíso, Jalpa de Méndez, Nacajuca, Centro, Jalapa, Teapa and Tacotalpa. The Usumacinta Region is named after the main river on which the Centla, Jonuta, Emiliano Zapata, Balancán and Tenosique municipalities depend. It is divided into the Pantanos and Ríos subregions, which are both more rural than the Grijalva Region.

The environment of the state consists of extensive low-lying floodplains, mountains and valleys. Most of the territory is covered with tropical rainforest and wetlands. There are also areas with savanna, beaches and mangrove forests. Much of the rainforest has suffered degradation due to over-logging and conversion of territory into farmland. The east is formed of low humid plains formed by sediment deposited by a number of rivers. In the Chontalpa zone and in parts of the municipalities of Centla and Jonuta, there are swampy depressions extremely vulnerable to flooding from both riverflow and from excessive rainfall. In the south there are some elevations which are part of the central mesa of Chiapas. The most important of these is El Madrigal, La Campana, La Corona, Pomaná, Coconá, Mono Pelado and El Tortuguero. However, most hills in the state do not exceed above sea level.

Tabasco has of shoreline, of estuaries, lakes and numerous rivers and streams. Flooding is a frequent occurrence, especially in September and November.
There are four principal ecosystems in the state: tropical rainforest, tropical savannah, beaches and wetlands. Tropical rainforest dominates most of the state due to the high levels of rainfall the area receives. However, what exists today is only a fraction of what used to be, as much of the forest area has been over-exploited by man, mostly through logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Most of the intact rainforest is found in the municipalities of Tenosique, Balancán, Macuspana, Teapa, Tacotalpa, Cárdenas and Huimanguillo.

These rainforests contain species such as mahogany, cedar, numerous types of palm, jacarandas, ceiba, Salix and many more. There are various types of orchids, bromeliads, tillandsia, ferns, and aroid plants native to the state, along with a variety of species of cactus, both terrestrial-arid and epiphytic-forest types. Examples include Epiphyllum anguliger, Schlumbergera, and Disocactus. This state also has one of the widest varieties of wildlife in the country, such as macaws, yellow-headed parrots, resplendent quetzal, numerous endemic hummingbirds, green iguana, and numerous species of snakes. Mammal species have declined because of deforestation, but still persist; one may encounter spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, jaguar, ocelot, coatimundi, jaguarundi, oncilla, coyote, margay, bobcat, puma, raccoon, northern tamandua, prehensile-tailed porcupine, agouti, paca, woolly and common opossums, brocket deer, white-tailed deer, collared peccary and tapir.

Tropical savannah is mostly found in the southern part of the state, mixed in with areas of rainforest. These areas are dominated by grasses and bushes along with some smaller trees such as jahuacte, cocoyol and small palm trees. The savannah has wildlife such as rabbits, deer, foxes, and various species of birds.

Along the coast the soil is sandier and while the vegetation is still tropical, species are different from in the interior rainforest. They include coconut palms, palo mulato, royal palm, and pimento de Tabasco. These areas have suffered the most from slash and burn agriculture.

Most of the wetlands of the state belong to the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve. The abundance of fresh water in wetlands and river areas supports a wide variety of aquatic life such as freshwater gar, mojarra, crocodiles, various species of turtles and frogs, and many species of native and migratory waterfowl. In larger bodies of water manatees can be found. In the brackish and salt water lagoons various ocean species are found, as well as shellfish and mollusks, and bird species such as seagulls and pelicans.

Tabasco has a hot tropical climate, with the Gulf of Mexico having significant influence on weather patterns. Over 95 percent of the state&#x27;s territory has a hot, wet climate. The rest is hot and semi-humid, located in the far northeast of the state. The average annual temperature is with high temperatures averaging , mostly in May, and lows of in January. Unlike many parts of Mexico, Tabasco has abundant year round precipitation. The state receives an average annual rainfall of . Rain occurs all year but is particularly heavy from June to October. The flat areas of the state are subject to frequent flooding. One reason for this is the rivers that flow from the Sierra region and the Usuamacinta River. Another is that there are a number of dams such as the Angostura, Chicoasén, Malpas and Peñitas; these are built for hydroelectricity and flood control, but can overflow.

The state has of state protected lands such as the Agua Blanca waterfalls and the Sierra State Park in Teapa. The Grutas de Coconá caves are classified as a natural monument with . The Centla Biosphere Reserve covers an area of . The Yumká Park and Laguna de las Ilusiones Ecological Reserves have . The Laguna de la Lima Reserve has . The Chontalpa Ecological Park has . The Laguna del Camarón Ecological Park has .

==History==

===Pre-Columbian period===

The origin of the name Tabasco is not definitively known, with a number of theories debated among linguists. The name appears in the chronicles of Bernal Díaz del Castillo during the conquest era, who mentions a river named after local ruler Tabscoob. One possible theory states that it is from Nahuatl with two possible derivations: one meaning &quot;place that has a lord&quot; and the other &quot;place where the land is moist&quot;. The state seal is that which was granted in 1598 to the town of Villahermosa, then called San Juan Bautista by Philip II of Spain. This is one of the oldest coats of arms in the Americas.

The Olmec civilization dominated much of what is now Tabasco 3,000 years ago, reaching a height around 800 BC. It was the oldest Mesoamerican culture, dominating what are now the states of Mexico, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Tabasco as well as parts of Central America, and is considered the founding culture for all of Mesoamerica. The main Olmec site in Tabasco is La Venta. The site covers an area of surrounded by swamps and marshes linked to the Tonalá River, from the Gulf of Mexico. Around 300 AD, the Mayans began to dominate part of the state. Mayan sites include Comalcalco, Pomoná, El Tortuguero and Jonuta (Prehispanic). The Mayans in Tabasco reached their peak between the 6th and 7th centuries.

===Colonial era===

In the early 16th century, the main ethnicities of Tabasco were the Mayas-Chontals, the Zoque people, and the Popolocas, living in small villages with the Chontales dominating. The first contact with the Spanish came in 1518 when an expedition headed by Captain Juan de Grijalva disembarked at the mouth of the river that now bears his name. Hernán Cortés came the following year and fought the natives here at the Battle of Centla. As conqueror, Cortés received twenty female slaves, one of whom was La Malinche.

Despite the early conquest and the foundation of Santa María de la Victoria (today Frontera), the territory was not fully subjugated because of the climate, terrain and lack of minerals. The Franciscans arrived in the 16th century to evangelize, but they did not stay. For this reason, the indigenous people of this area were not generally converted to Catholicism, unlike other parts of New Spain. Tabasco was a landing and crossing point for the conquest of southern Mexico and Guatemala, referenced by Hernán Cortés in one of his letters to the Spanish Crown. It was noted by him and by Bernal Díaz del Castillo for its abundance of cacao.

The introduction of European diseases decimated the local population, resulting in the Spanish bringing African slaves to work plantations. This led to some mixing among the three races which has affected the ethnic appearance of the people of the state. Significant agricultural production was not achieved until the 18th century, primarily in cacao and cattle. During this time the sea traffic to Villahermosa increased, which made it a relatively important port. For the rest of the colonial period, most of Tabasco would have no major events and no major commerce in comparison to the rest of the country.

The Spanish did not begin to pacify the area until the second half of the 16th century, when Santa María de la Victoria was secured, slightly inland from the original Frontera location. However, in the meantime, English pirates had taken possession of the nearby Isla del Carmen and other points in the Gulf for piracy. Santa María de la Victoria was attacked and sacked, forcing the settlement to move inland in 1598 to San Juan Bautista (today Villahermosa), renamed Villa Hermosa by the Spanish Crown, which gave it the oldest coat of arms on the American mainland, today the seal of the state of Tabasco. At the beginning of the 18th century, Tabasco and Veracruz united to combat the pirate threat, and succeeded in expelling them from the Isla del Carmen. The city returned to its original and current location in 1795. At that time, the entire state had a population of only 36,000 in two towns, two villages, and various ranches and farms. The province sent a delegate to Spain to complain about the marginalization of the area to the Crown.

===Independence and 19th century===
The first insurgent during the Mexican War of Independence in the state was José María Jiménez, who declared the state&#x27;s independence in 1815. However, Jiménez was soon jailed and local authorities proclaimed allegiance to the Crown. At the end of the war in 1821, Tabasco became one of the first fourteen states under the 1824 Constitution. The first state constitution was ratified in 1825. In 1883, the state was divided into seventeen municipalities.

Political instability in the state and an outbreak of cholera forced Tabasco to rejoin the federation. In 1836, a group of Conservatives took control of the federal government, but Tabasco Liberals decided to rebel against this government until they were defeated.
During the Mexican–American War, troops under Matthew C. Perry arrived in Tabasco in 1846. Other ships arrived soon after and took possession of the port of Frontera. On their first attempt to take Villahermosa upriver, they failed. The second attempt bombarded the city before successfully taking it. However, the Tabascans formed guerrilla groups and this along with the inhospitable climate forced the U.S. military to withdraw soon after.

After the Americans left, Tabasco governor Justo Santa Anna rebelled against Mexico City over its lack of support during the war. The Americans returned in 1847 to attack the capital. It was defended by local troops, but they did not have the necessary supplies. The Americans occupied the capital for another thirty-five days, causing great destruction.

During the French intervention in Mexico, the French took Villahermosa in 1862, installing a governor. Tabasco&#x27;s forces retreated into the mountains. Meanwhile, various Tabascans formed a newspaper called &quot;El Dissidente&quot;, which criticized the French-installed government. There were several insurrections against this government such as the one headed by Andrés Sánchez Magallanes in 1863. He raised a small army from various parts of the state and attacked the imperial army barracks in Comalcalco, then moved on to Villahermosa in November 1863. Here they encountered imperialist troops at what is now called the , where the insurgents won, expelling the French from the state.

The Porfirio Díaz period from the 1880s to 1910 was free from political violence and allowed the state to build infrastructure, but only slowly owing to its isolation. The capital, heavily damaged by decades of war, was reconstructed, with many old buildings torn down to make way for new ones. In 1879, the Instituto Juárez was inaugurated. In 1881, telegraph service connected Villahermosa with Mexico City. The capital received electricity in 1890, with the new state government palace opened in 1894 and the first bank in 1901. Tabasco experienced significant economic development during the Díaz period in the late 19th century, with cacao and other products shipped worldwide. However, this development led to widespread deforestation, which began in the latter decades of the 19th century when timber companies cut down large areas of rainforest.

While Díaz remained in power, Tabasco governor also remained from 1894 to 1910, re-elected to office sixteen times. Timber and agriculture made the elite in the state rich, with most of the rest of the population workers indebted to their employers. The technological progress was accompanied by poor and even slave-like conditions for many workers. This fueled resentment in the state and the rest of the country. This resentment led to the Mexican Revolution. In 1879, the first institute of higher education, the Instituto Juárez, was opened. During this time period, a woman by the name of Salomé Marín Virgilio founded schools in Balancán to teach workers to read and write along with liberal political ideas. Her work would later inspire José María Pino Suárez.

===Mexican Revolution to the present===

Anti-Díaz sentiment began in the decade of 1900 with efforts to keep Bandala from being re-elected. The first vocal opponent to the Díaz regime in Tabasco was local journalist Domingo Borrego. In Huimanguillo, Chontalpa, the first &quot;Club Anti reelection Melchor Ocampo&quot; was formed to oppose the government but it was disbanded quickly. By 1909, there were a number of large protests in the state which led to the formation of the Gutierrista Party, headed by Ignacio Gutiérrez Gómez along with his two brothers. These and others in the state joined forces politically with Francisco I. Madero and a new Club Anti-reelecionista was formed in Huimanguillo. These efforts succeeded in defeating Bandala and replacing him with Policarpo Valenzuela, calming the situation in the state for a short while. After Madero was assassinated, the politics of the state fractured, with various factions vying for the governor&#x27;s position leading to insurrection and frequent government changes who were allied with the various armies vying for power nationally.

Another important episode in the history of the state was the governorship of Tomás Garrido Canabal after the end of the Revolution. He was elected in 1922, allied with Mexican presidents Álvaro Obregón and later Plutarco Elías Calles. He implemented an ambitious socialist program, organizing unions and consolidating power though his Radical Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Radical). He reestablished the state&#x27;s teachers’ college and established a system of rural schools. Livestock-raising increased and general economic levels rose. He prohibited the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state. An atheist, he persecuted the Catholic Church, destroying various churches including the Tabasco Cathedral. Events relating to this were portrayed in the novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; by Graham Greene. He organized &quot;cultural assemblies with the aim of persuading people away from religion, sometimes burning images of saints. He even forbade the use of crosses on graves and changed the names of towns and ranches to rid them of religious references. Unlike other parts of the country, there was little resistance against this repression of the church and the success of Garrido&#x27;s dissuasion left a vacuum, which was later filled by missionaries from Protestant and Evangelical groups.&quot; His tenure as governor ended in 1935, when he was appointed the federal Secretary of Agriculture and he appointed to take over. Opponents of Garrido declared this a violation of due process and held their own elections. Supporters of Garrido tried to stop the election, resulting in shooting and twelve dead.

In the 1950s, Carlos A. Madrazo became governor; he promoted large public works, agricultural and industrial projects, and initiated exploration for petroleum. The highway along the Gulf Coast linking eastern Tabasco with Veracruz and the Yucatan Peninsula was completed in 1956. During the same decade, a museum dedicated to the La Venta archeological site was founded by Carlos Pellicer.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the educational system was modernized, instituting free breakfasts for students. Infrastructure projects improved or created docks, roads, monuments and sporting facilities mostly in the capital and municipal seats. Agriculture was the focus of programs called Plan Chontalpa and Plan Balacán-Tenosique and free health care clinics were built in rural areas.

Oil and natural gas were discovered at this time and in 1974, the development of these resources began. The petroleum boom produced great wealth, but there have been disputes over the money earned from the facilities owned by PEMEX, the nation&#x27;s oil company. The industry has put pressure on the state&#x27;s infrastructure, housing and supplies of basic necessities. New roads, bridges and a modern airport have been constructed with oil money, along with a Centro de Investigaciones de la Cultura Olmeca y Maya, the Teatro del Estado, a planetarium and a convention center in the capital. The PEMEX facilities have caused environmental damage, and damage to local farmers’ crops. There have been issues related to the breaking of environmental laws, but corruption and the lack of legal jurisdiction outside of the federal government, which owns PEMEX, has hampered efforts to sue for enforcement. In 1996, hundreds of blockades of installations were carried out by locals with the active support of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). The most notable was the blocking of the bridge to the Sen oil field. It was broken up by police but the following month 30,000 marched on Villahermosa to protest. The friction between the populace and the government over oil and other issues led to some political restructuring in the state. This was accompanied with general dissatisfaction with the ruling party, the PRI, nationwide. Reforms to decentralize power away from Villahermosa were undertaken but in the 1990s, political instability remained with farmers, ranchers and others continuing to complain about how PEMEX was affecting their economic activities.
Flooding has historically been an issue in the state, which has year-round heavy rainfall and various rivers flowing through it. Villahermosa was founded on a hill between the Sierra and Grijalva Rivers. The growth of the city from the 1970s on has brought development down from the hill onto the floodplains. Recent major flooding includes events in 1975, 1990 and 1999. The last prompted the creation of the Programa Integral de Control de Inundaciones (Integral Program for Flood Control) to build dams, dikes and other flood control measures. These were in process of construction when the 2007 floods hit. From October 28 to 30, unusually heavy rainfall caused the Grijalva River to rise, overflowing the Peñitas Dam, as well as other area rivers. This eventually covered about eighty percent of the state&#x27;s territory as deep as in places, affecting over a million people. The flood damage was made worse by the presence of human settlements on flood plains and the lack of hydraulic infrastructure on the Sierra and Usumacinta rivers. There was also a lack of warning systems and evacuation plans for those downriver.

In the 1990s, various technical colleges were established in the state along with the Universidad Popular de la Chontalpa and another in Tenosique. Hospitals in various municipalities and various historic centers were reconstructed, especially that of Villahermosa.

==Economy==

The state accounts for 3.4 percent of Mexico&#x27;s national GDP. Although the recent oil boom has helped to bring the state out of complete poverty, there are still areas in which this is a serious problem. In urban areas running water, sewerage and electricity is available to over ninety percent of the population; however, in rural areas, running water reaches about forty percent, sewerage under seventy percent and electricity under 85 percent. The state has about 150,000 families or about half a million people living in poverty, mostly due to lack of employment according to the Sedesol. Most of the state&#x27;s poor are concentrated in the Jonuta, Tacotalpa, Centla and Humanguillo municipalities as these lack any major industry.

The heavy rainfall in the state does not lend itself well to annual crops and frequent flooding is a problem as well. Despite this, there is significant production of corn, sorghum and beans. Most of the commercially important crops are perennials, such as cacao, coconut, oranges, bananas and sugar cane. There is also important pasture, both natural and seeded. The state has extensive areas of natural grasslands. Due to the climate, the Zebu breed of cattle does best and is mostly raised for meat. Cattle accounts for about three quarters of the meat produced in the state. Other livestock includes pigs, sheep, goats and domestic fowl. Most livestock is raised in the Villahermosa, Cárdenas and Emiliano Zapata municipalities.
Tabasco has salt water and fresh water fishing along its shoreline and in the many rivers and small lakes but they are not extensively exploited, providing less than two percent of Mexico&#x27;s total fish production. Commercial species include oysters, mojarra, shrimp, sea bass, shark, lobster and gar. Most fishing fleets are located in Frontera, with others in Sanchez Magallanes, Chilitepec, and Dos Bocas. The state has natural resources such as mahogany, cedar and other tropical hardwoods.

Mining, mostly of petroleum and natural gas, provides most of the state&#x27;s GDP. Only 14.6 percent of the working population is in mining. About 19 percent work in construction, transportation and manufacturing. Most manufacturing is food processing, bottling and tobacco products. About ninety percent of industrial establishments are family-owned, mostly dedicated to food processing in and around Villahermosa. The most important industry is petroleum refining, done by PEMEX in the Macuspana municipality. There are 860 wells in various municipalities extracting crude oil and natural gas. It produces 556,371 barrels of crude oil and of natural gas per day. It has deposits of gravel and sand, along with the Cementos Apasco factory.

Just over 61 percent of the working population is employed in services and commerce. There are 86 traditional public markets. The Tabasco Fair is the most important commercial event. It has its origins in 1880. It has been held on and off since then in various locations. Today, it is held in Villahermosa at Parque Tabasco 2000 where the various municipalities of the state demonstrate their products. It features cultural and sporting events as well.

==Tourism==

==Demographics==


Tabasco&#x27;s population has been growing rapidly: between 1990 and 2005 the population grew from 1,501,744 to 1,989,969. Tabasco&#x27;s population is mostly young, with an average age of 19 years and over 38 percent of the population is under 15 years of age.

The state&#x27;s population is more rural than the national average: 57 percent live in urban areas, in contrast to 78 percent of Mexico&#x27;s population in general. Those who leave the state mostly go to Quintana Roo, Campeche and Veracruz. Those that migrate to the state mostly come from Chiapas, Veracruz and Campeche. As of the 2000s, only about 2 percent of the population has left to live abroad, mostly to the United States. The national average is 16 percent. Three percent of the population speaks an indigenous language, which is lower than the national average of 6 percent. Most speak the Tabascan dialect of the Chontal Maya language. This is followed by Ch’ol, Tzeltal, Maya, Zapotec languages, Nahuatl and Tzotzil.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.56 percent of Tabasco&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

==Culture==
Traditional masculine dress consists of a white shirt and pants, with black boots or shoes, black belt, a hat in a style called &quot;chontal&quot; and a red handkerchief around the neck. This dress is based on an older type of clothing called &quot;traje choco&quot;, made of cotton cloth called manta, used to work in the fields.

The traditional female dress consists of a wide skirt trimmed with a ruffle. Under the skirt is a slip designed to fluff the skirt and make the waist look smaller. The blouse is white with an embroidered band in bright colors, often with flower and/or animal designs. It has short sleeves ending in a square form in the lower part. The woman often carried a small handkerchief and a shawl called a &quot;rebozo&quot; in bright colors, often complementing the skirt. The shoes are black.


The state has a number of unique traditional dances due to its relative isolation from the rest of the country. These include &quot;El Gigante&quot; of Nacajuca, performed on August 14. &quot;Baila Viejo&quot; is performed in Tucta and Guaytalpa in the municipality of Nacajuca as well as the Atasta de Serra in Villahermosa. &quot;El Pochó&quot; is of pre Hispanic origin and is performed during Carnival in Tenosique. &quot;Los Blanquitos&quot; is also performed in Tenosique and symbolizes the struggle of black slaves during the colonial period. &quot;El Caballito Blanco&quot; depicts the struggles of the indigenous against the Spanish at the Battle of Centla. Zapateo is said to be derived from the fandango, brought to the area by a conquistador called Ortíz de Séquito. It is considered to be the regional dance of the state.

Traditional music has its origins in the Olmec period with other indigenous influences such as those of the Maya, Mexicas and Nahuas. It is based on flute and percussion, including drums made of tortoise shells and flutes/whistles made of ceramic. Purely indigenous music has almost entirely disappeared, replaced by that of European influence. Fandango influence was the first to arrive, which was modified then called fandanguillo leading to songs called zapateos in the colonial period, played by small orchestras. These were mostly composed of wind instruments but the marimba and drums called temborileros were added. This music was accompanied by a dance of the same name. Later, short improvised rhymes called &quot;bombas&quot; were added varying by region often consisting of a man and woman answering each other.

The cuisine is based on the foods of the ancient Mayas and Chontals, using plants and animals native to the region such as achiote, chili peppers, chipilín (amashito) and banana leaves, with corn and beans serving as the base. (amashito) Traditionally, people in Tabasco eat seven times a day, these meals are called &quot;puntal&quot; (after getting out of bed), breakfast, &quot;refigerio,&quot; &quot;apertivo,&quot; &quot;comida,&quot; &quot;merienda&quot; and &quot;cena.&quot; This regime is based on rural work customs which required starting the day before the sun rose. Typical dishes include those with iguana meat, gar fish, beef puchero, smoked oysters, totopostes, pork with beans and tortillas made with banana and fresh corn. Chocolate is still found in preparations which have not changed since pre Hispanic times mostly as hot and cold beverages. The most common cold chocolate beverage is pozol, served fresh or fermented. Each of the regions has certain specialties. Teapa is known for its cheese and longaniza sausage. Jalpa de Méndez produces head cheese, longaniza sausage and another cured meat called butifarra. Macuspana&#x27;s dishes are often based on ingredients from the area&#x27;s rivers such as bass, turtle and gar. Paraíso is known for its oysters, often cooked in their shell over an open flame. Jalapa is known for its sweets such as sweetened fruits in corn husks, often accompanied by a cacao and corn beverage called chorote.

Tabasco is host to the boating marathon called the Mundo Maya on the Usumacinta and Grijalva rivers.

The state has sixteen important museums. Most are located in the Villahermosa area but others can be found in Comalcalco, Huimanguillo, Balancán, Emiliano Zapata, Jalpa de Méndez, Jonuta and Teapa.

There are also notable Carnival celebrations in Pochó, Tenosique and Villahermosa.

==Archaeology==

La Venta was the most important civic-religious center of the Olmec civilization, the first major culture of Mesoamerica. The site shows a number of the characteristics of Olmec culture, including depictions of jaguars, colossal heads and images of figures of rotund children. The site dates back to about 1000 BC and declined around 400 AD, replaced in importance by San Lorenzo. The museum associated with La Venta is in Villahermosa proper, and called Parque Museo de la Venta. It contains thirty three major pieces from the site and includes displays about Olmec customs, government, astronomy and writing. This park was created in the 1950s by writer Carlos Pellicer to protect the most important pieces of the archeological site. There are also exhibits on the flora and fauna of the area.

Comalcalco is a Maya archeological site near the modern city of the same name, on a bank of the Mezcalapa River. While it is not the only Mayan city whose monumental architecture is of adobe brick instead of stone, it is the only one which has had extensive reconstruction, and is open to the public. The Mayas here used adobe because of the lack of building stone in the area, instead using the abundant clay and lime extracted from shells. The Mayan city developed between 800 and 1100 AD, contemporary with Palenque and Yaxchilan. The name of the site comes from Nahuatl and means place of comals (a kind of cooking pan), but its Mayan name was Hoi Chan, which means &quot;cloudy sky&quot;. The site covers 577 hectares and with a total of 282 structures. The main monuments are La Plaza Norte, La Gran Acropolis and the Eastern Acropolis.

Pomoná is a Mayan site discovered in 1959. The city was established in the Classic period, achieving its height in the late Classic and falling in the early Post Classic. It is on the Usumacinta River, giving it an important role in the political and economic relations of the time, as many ocean products passed through here on their way to the Peten area. Its original name is not known and it is currently named after a nearby modern settlement. It has six important groups of buildings with residential areas extending over 175 hectares.

The main plazas with their ceremonial structures are similar to those found in Tikal and the towers of Río Bec. There are seven principal structures surrounded by numerous smaller ones. Many of the stele from the site can be found at the José Gómez Panaco Museum in the nearby city of Balancán.

In 2020, the largest and oldest Mayan temple yet discovered was uncovered using lidar at the Aguada Fénix site in Tabasco.

==Education==
The state&#x27;s population growth has put pressure on the educational system with about forty percent of its population school age. The average schooling in Tabasco has climbed from 2.7 years in 1970 to 6.7 years in 1995. In the same time period, the level percentage of the population which was illiterate fell from 25.7% to 11%. Today, the average schooling is 8.6 years or the third year of middle school, which is the national average.

== History ==
Founded officially on 24 June 1564 by the Spanish Diego de Quijada on the banks of the Grijalva River under the name of &quot;Villa Hermosa&quot;, in 1826 the village was raised to the rank of city under the name of &quot;San Juan Bautista de la Villa Hermosa&quot; (Saint John the Baptist). During the French intervention in Mexico, French troops occupied the city in 1863. In 1916, the governor of Tabasco, Francisco J. Múgica, ordered the restoration of the city&#x27;s name to &quot;Villahermosa&quot;.

===&quot;Colonial Age&quot;===
The Villa Carmona was later christened San Juan Bautista, and was divided into neighborhoods. The oldest of them was the neighborhood of Esquipulas, on the ridge of the hill of Esquipulas and around the Church of Our Lord of Esquipulas, with his image of Christ black, which had been brought from Esquipulas, Guatemala.

By 1596 he was Mayor of Tabasco Lazaro Suárez de Córdova who continued to dispatch in Santa Maria de la Victoria as the capital, and because the pirates had been attacking much the coasts of Tabasco, it commands to build in San Juan Bautista (today Villahermosa) the Fort House or Royal Warehouse. This was in order to defend the population and safeguard the flows Real. The Royal Warehouse was located in what are the current streets of Juárez, Reforma, Madero and Lerdo.

On July 24, 1598, the King granted the city of San Juan Bautista the title of &quot;Villa Hermosa de San Juan Bautista&quot; as well as a royal shield (which currently identifies the state of Tabasco) and which is one of the oldest in America.

In 1604, the Mayor of Tabasco Juan de Miranda requested the Viceroy Juan de Mendoza and Luna to authorize the powers to be changed from Santa Maria de la Victoria to Saint John the Baptist (now Villahermosa) in addition to requesting that the name of the city be changed to &quot;San Juan de Villahermosa&quot;, authorizing the change of name of the city, not so the transfer of powers.
The King Philip II of Spain gave the city the title of Villa Hermosa as well as a Coat of Tabasco&#x27;s Royal Shield.
As the pirate attacks did not cease, and they continually destroyed and ranted the village of Santa María de la Victoria, in the year 1619, the change of the powers of the province to San Juan Bautista before the Marquis de Guadalcázar Diego Fernández de Córdoba, authorizing it on December 3 of that same year. However, was re-established. The move was not made because many neighbors did not want to leave Saint Mary of Victory.

===Tabasco Capital for the first time===
In 1640 due to the continuous pirate attacks on the village of Santa María de la Victoria, the authorities of the Province requested the Viceroy Diego López Pacheco and Portugal to change the capital of the Province to San Juan de Villahermosa, which the Viceroy authorized on 3 February 1641. The transfer of powers took effect on June 24 of that same year, making Villahermosa the new capital of the Province of Tabasco. The &quot;Fortín de la Encarnación&quot; was immediately built in what is now the park of &quot;the birds&quot; on the corner that form the current streets of May 5 and Zaragoza at the foot of the hill of &quot;La Encarnación&quot;.

In 1677 as Mayor Diego de Loyola, the privateers fiercely attacked the capital Villahermosa de San Juan Bautista, forcing the authorities to leave the city and transfer the powers to the village of Tacotalpa, which was the capital of the province for 118 years. On June 21 of that year, the Mayor of Tabasco informed the Viceroy that the fear of pirate invasions had caused the depopulation of entire villages such as Cunduacán, and that Villahermosa, which was the capital, was had depopulated too.&quot;&#x27;

In 1688, lookouts, trenches and fortifications were built in Villahermosa to protect the desolated city from pirate attacks. However, in 1711 Villahermosa was again fiercely attacked by the English pirates, who set fire to the Royal Warehouse that was the Government House, and the defenders had to take refuge in the &quot;Fortín de la Encarnación&quot;, which withstood the attack, but the pirates burned down many houses leaving the town in ruins.
It was until July 16, 1717, when the then Mayor of Tabasco Alonso Felipe Andrade, at the head of an army of Tabasco and Veracruz forces, attacks the pirates on the Island of Tris (now the island of Carmen) that at that time belonged to Tabasco . Despite the death of [Alonso Felipe Andrade], the Tabasco forces expelled the pirates and founded that same day the military post of &quot;Nuesra Señora del Carmen&quot; (today [City of Carmen]). However, in 1757 the English pirates counterattacked the military post of Nuestra Señora del Carmen, setting it on fire and destroying it, and then re-attacking the Tabasco coasts.

Finally, in 1785, the Tabasco militias, commanded by Captain Juan de Amestoy and Lieutenant Francisco Interiano, defeated and permanently evicted the English from Carmen Island.

===Tabasco Capital for the second time===
In January 1795 the Viceroy Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca authorized the change of the powers of the Province of Tabasco from Tacotalpa to Villa Hermosa de San Juan Bautista, taking effect on Monday, August 15 of that year. Thus, after 118 years, Villahermosa is again the capital of Tabasco.

The neighborhood of La Punta or La Concepción was the next growth step of San Juan that transcended the first natural boundaries of the site. Developed around the church of the Immaculate Conception - &quot;La Conchita&quot;-, the neighborhood was also known as La Punta for being at the southern end of the city, on a hillside of the hill of La Eminence, between the Grijalva River, the lagoon of La Pólvora and the primary trace. The last district dating from the late colonial era, from the early years of the nineteenth century, was the neighborhood of La Santa Cruz, with its center in the church of the same name. This neighborhood was developed on marshy and grassland land north of the city center.

The city lived peacefully during the last years of the Colony, being an important river port.

The Civil War and the Separation of Tabasco
VT Tabasco Separation Federalist Revolution (Tabasco)
The succession of violent events began in 1833, when the civil war began in the state, between centralists and federalists with the victory of the centralists in 1834. Later in 1839, the Federalist Revolution which culminated in November 1840, with the takeover of the city and the victory of the Tabasque federalists led by the Cuban Francisco de Sentmanat, the jalisciense Juan Pablo Anaya and the Tabasqueño Fernando Nicolás Maldonado. After the federalist revolution, the Texan navy that had supported Juan Pablo Anaya demanded payment for collaborating in the victory, and in the end of achieving it, began a bombardment of the city of San Juan Bautista. The bombing was halted two days later thanks to negotiations by the governor Pedro Requena.
The triumph of the Tabasque federalists would annoy the president Anastasio Bustamante, who on February 11, 1841, ordered heavy economic sanctions for the state, taking the State Congress and the governor José Víctor Jiménez the decision to decreeing the Tabasco separation from Mexico on 13 February 1841. Granting the local Congress to the governor José Víctor Jiménez the functions of President. creating two departments: the Treasury department and the War and Navy department. The various revolts and seasoned military stakes between 1833 and 1841 left the city heavily destroyed.

===U.S. Invasion===

On October 23, 1846, U.S. forces invaded Tabasco, and on the 25 thresemonious day they arrived at the capital San Juan Bautista, which was defended by the Governor of the state and Military Commander John Baptist Traconis, who was in command of the Tabaquean militias and the Acayucan Battalion. The commander Matthew Perry demanded the surrender of the square, to which the governor John Baptist Traconis replied that &quot;the square would defend it with life, so they could initiate the attack&quot;, the bombing was not expected, it was 14:15. developed between 25 and 26 October, which is known as the First Battle of Tabasco.

Due to the resilience of the city, they indiscriminately bombed Saint John the Baptist, destroying their main buildings such as neighborhood churches, public prison, theater and room houses of the three neighborhoods but due to the fierce defense of the authorities and villagers, fail to take the city. This would be the only battle won by Mexican forces over the Americans, and was achieved thanks to the expertise of Colonel Traconis and to the value of the Tobacco military volunteering, headed among others by: Miguel Bruno, Manuel Escofié, José Julián Dueñas, Juan Duque de Estrada, [Simón Sarlat García], Manuel Plascencia, and many more. The Americans retreated to the port of Border where they set up an eight-month blockade, to prevent food and bastimento from reaching
Saint John the Baptist.

Faced with this, the governor John Bautista Traconis asked the federal government for help in the purchase of war equipment and materials, in order to protect the square from a second invasion, however, in the face of the federal government&#x27;s refusal, Traconis declares Tabasco separated from the Mexican nation. However his proposal was unresonated, and Traconis was removed from the office of governor, assuming the functions Justo Santa Anna.

On June 16, 1847, the Americans returned to Saint John the Baptist, staging the [Second Battle of Tabasco], in which the Americans re-bomb the city, which without bastimentos or food, falls into the hands of the invaders on June 15, having to flee the authorities to the village of Tacotalpa which is named state capital. The Americans take the city and appoint Commander Van Brunt governor of the state.

However, on July 22, the Tobacco guerrillas led by Miguel Bruno, which gave them no truce or respite, began performing in the city. On the 26th arrived in Saint John the Baptist, Commander Bigelow who replaced Van Brunt in government, and tried more reinforcements to defeat the Tobacco forces. Due to the strong Tobacco guerrillas, and the reckless courage of the Tabasqueños organized by Colonel John Bautista Traconis first, and the governor Justo Santa Anna afterwards, were the causes that gave the national weapons in [Tabasco] the triumph about the Americans, on July 22, 1847. Defeated, the Americans vacated the city in which they stayed for 35 days, after which they withdrew not without first setting fire and raving much of the city, leaving it completely destroyed and burned.

===French Invasion===

Also, in 1863 and 1864, both French interventionist forces and Mexican pro-imperialist forces again destroyed much of the buildings of San Juan. On 18 June 1863, the French army under the command of Eduardo González Arévalo, dawned before the capital of the state San Juan Bautista, initiating a heavy bombardment and landing with 150 men. A line of defense was established from the square of &quot;Ruiz&quot; to the stream &quot;El Jícaro&quot;, the bombardment was so intense that forced the retreat of the defenders to the outskirts of the city, taking control of the invaders of the city and establishing its barracks in the building called &quot;The Principal&quot; which had been the Royal Warehouse during the Colony. From the capital, the French invaders would begin the struggle to control the entire state of Tabasco. However, the Tobacco forces would gradually go back to the ground.

Six months later, on December 2, 1863, the Tabasque Republican forces under Colonel Gregorio Méndez Magaña begin bombing the city of San Juan Bautista. The prelude to the final assault began with the harassment of the capital, and was attacked from different flanks by Juan Morales, Lino Merino, Narciso Sáenz, and Pedro Fuentes who by the end of 1863 had closed the fence over the state capital.

The final assault on the capital began on 13 January 1864, and as the enemy became closer, various battles and skirmishes took place, in what is known as the [Saint John the Baptist&#x27;s Take] in a street-by-street fight. Republican forces gradually gained ground and by January 18 were in the center of the capital, causing French troops to retreat, entrenching themselves in the Royal Warehouse known as &quot;The Principal&quot;.
It was fought until February 25, when the &quot;Strong House&quot; or &quot;The Principal&quot; began to gun down, and on February 27, when the dawn broke, the French invaders undertook the retreat leaving the state capital, this glorious date for national weapons since this was the first region from which the French invaders were expelled from the national territory. Churches and buildings rebuilt after the French bombing had to be rebuilt after this new aggression.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
====Mexican Revolution in Tabasco====
The 1890s and 1900s witnessed the first notable expansions of this colonial city. However, during the [Mexican Revolution in Tabasco&#x27;, the political and social instability that characterized Mexico, was also reflected in the state capital, where in that period, there were 13 governors and in 1918 there were two governors and two state congresses at the same time. On June 28, 1911, he made his triumphant entrance to Saint John the Baptist, the revolutionary contingent of the Chontalpa under Sunday C. Magaña.

During the Revolution, on August 28, 1914 Luis Felipe Domínguez at the head of the &quot;Usumacinta Brigade&quot;, he entered the capital San Juan Bautista, taking office of the government on 31 August, which stunned the struggle between the defatuent factions Revolutionary. on September 2, the generals Carlos Greene, Pedro C. Colorado, [Ramón Sosa Torres], Isidro Cortés and [José Domingo Ramírez Garrido], entered the state capital, with the arrival of the chontalpa revolutionaries, there were suffoals and terrors in the city. The general Carlos Greene took office in government, however, the Donetists attacked the state capital, causing the authorities to leave Saint John the Baptist because they protested for &quot;electoral fraud&quot; formed their Congress and settled in Amatitan, recognizing Luis Felipe Domínguez as constitutional governor and brought before the Senate of the Republic, a case of conflict of powers, since there are two governors and two Congresses at the same time. In 1919 Carlos Greene with the help of [Tomás Garrido Canabal&quot; Tomás Garrido] defeats the Donetists and will recapture the state capital.

He had just finished the revolutionary movement, then there was a strong and transcendent re-arrangement of the socio-political and reorganization classes of the Mexican state. The war known as &quot;Christian&quot; spread throughout the country, and in [Tabasco] it had its own manifestations. By government decree of February 3, 1916, the city was renamed &quot;Villahermosa&quot;, stating that the name should be written together and not separated as it was in place.

====Delahuertista rebellion in Tabasco====
In 1923 the general Adolfo de la Huerta protested against the imposition of the presidential candidacy of [Plutarco Elías Calles], which caused the landowners to rise up in arms in various parts of the country. In Tabasco, in mid-December the homeless men rose in arms in the port of Frontera (Tabasco)&#x27; Frontera against the governor Tomás Garrido Canabal and Alvaro Obregón, while the general Carlos Greene joined the movement, rising in arms in the Chontalpa.

On January 10, 1924, at the head of 2,500 men, the generals Carlos Greene and Fernando Segovia besieged and took Villahermosa the capital of the state, without being contained by forces loyal to the President Alvaro Obreg&#x27;ón) Obregón, commanded by Generals Vicente González and Miguel Henríquez Guzmán, leading to the escape of the governor Tomás Garrido Canabal, who had to hide for a few days and then left the city at night in a cayuco. The delahuertists appointed as governor Manuel Antonio Romero who occupied the governorship from January 21 to June 7, 1924, when the rebellion ended when the state was attacked by federal forces and defeated the deserters.

====Garridism====
This time began in 1928 with the arrival of Tomás Garrido Canabal in the state government. Several times Governor of Tabasco, he created the organization &quot;red shirts&quot; which, in addition to his political activity of support, deployed a paramilitary battle against the Catholic Church in the state.
As authority he expelled the bishop, the priests and decreed several prohibitions concerning worship, religious feasts, Catholic funeral rites, including domestic worship and even the mere mention of God. He closed the temples and gave them a new use, turning them into &quot;rationalist&quot; schools, military barracks or libraries. Later, the temples, the center of the old quarters, were demolished. The images were burned, but the Christians hid several of them in the &quot;mountain&quot;, including the black Christ of Esquipulas and also the image of the Virgin Mary brought by Hernán Cortés&#x27; Courtesy. Life linked to worship and other religious celebrations virtually disappeared in Garrido&#x27;s years of authority, whose influence he left feeling even after his last governorship in 1934.

====Contemporary Era====
In the 1940s and 1950s, the expansion of Villahermosa was made up of developments by state governments and landowners who prepared and fractionated land that had previously had agricultural, grassland or grassland use forest, thus creating the first boroughs (colonial). On the other hand, the installation of drains, stormwater ducts, etc. began to change also the physiognomy of some old streets.
Juan Perez Arrollave Infantry Lieutenant who participated in the Mexican Revolution was as municipal president from 1946 to 1950, a personal friend of Plutarco Elias Calles

The old Saint John the Baptist now became the &quot;center&quot; of a larger city. The babbling of a new urban phenomenon began to manifest itself: metropolization.

When Tabasco entered the &quot;age of capital&quot;, that is, it fully integrated into the country&#x27;s economic development through oil exploitation and the construction of road, hydro-agricultural and hydroelectric infrastructure in the 1950s-1960s, Villahermosa began an important commercial development, towns such as Tamulté, Atasta, and Tierra Colorada became populous boroughs (colonias) of the new city.

By 1970, Villahermosa was considered a modern city due to its architectural dynamism that began in the last century, when the state of Tabasco became one of the main oil regions of the country, which changed the urban geography of Villahermosa.

Buildings and large recreation centers changed the physiognomy of the state capital, being the area called Tabasco 2000, the main area of progress, the best example of the rejuvenated city. 
In Tabasco 2000 reside the Municipal Powers, the Administrative Center of Government, office buildings, banks, hotels, restaurants, shopping squares, and residential areas.

===Urbanism===
VT Villahermosa&#x27;s Old Town
Despite being a very old city, Villahermosa has a modern physiognomy. The historic center of Villahermosa&#x27;old town guards the old colonial center of the city. It is an area of approximately 143 hectares containing the oldest buildings in the city, including the first painting where the Plaza de Armas de Villahermosa&#x27; is located Plaza de Armas or Main Park, where the Tabasco Government Palace is located; Government Palace, the headquarters of the executive branch of the State; the Legislative Palace, the headquarters of the H. Congress of the State; the High Court of Justice, the headquarters of the Judiciary, and the Church of the Conception, opened on 8 December 1800 but destroyed by the American bombing sprees in 1846 and 1847 and by the French in 1863 and 1864. There are other buildings of historical value in the area, such as the House of Tiles (now the Museum of History), the ancient Juarez Institute (now house of culture of the UJAT), the museum house of the poet Carlos Pellicer Camera and others buildings that are now art galleries or businesses.

The heart of the Historic Center of Villahermosa&#x27;s historic center is the so-called &quot;Light Zone&quot;&#x27;, formed by Juarez, Lerdo, Aldama, and Sáenz streets, Reforma, which are the oldest in the city and which have been transformed into pedestrian streets, where there are cafes, restaurants, neverías, clothing stores, etc., and they constitute the commercial heart of the city. Also within the Historic Center of Villahermosa&#x27;s old town are located the Park of the Corregidora, the Juarez Park, the Square of the Eagle and the Square Bicentennial, with a metallic obelísco of 30 meters high.

Outside the historic center, the city features modern architecture. Its rapid development since the 1970s caused it to overflow into areas that were formerly formed by lagoons, grasslands and swamps, and to absorb other communities, such as Atasta, Tamulté and Red Land, now populous boroughs (colonias).
Its most important roads that link the city of Villahermosa between different points are:
Av.Tabasco Walk: from the Gaviotas Bridge to the Peripheral Arco Noreste, crossing sites such as the Main Cemetery, the Cathedral of the Lord of Tabasco, crosses the Laguna de las Ilusions, the tourist complex Tabasco 2000, Gregorio[Gregorio Mendez Magaña Av.

<doc id="194158" wikidata="Q517975" url="?curid=194158" title="Otto Hahn (ship)">
<text>Otto Hahn was one of only four nuclear-powered cargo vessels built to date. Planning of a German-built trade and research vessel to test the feasibility of nuclear power in civil service began in 1960 under the supervision of German physicist Erich Bagge. Launched in 1964, her nuclear reactor was deactivated 15 years later in 1979 and replaced by a conventional diesel engine room. The ship was scrapped in 2009.

==History==
&quot;Otto Hahn&quot;″s keel was laid down in 1963 by Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft AG of Kiel. She was launched in 1964 and named in honour of Professor Otto Hahn, the German chemist and Nobel Prize-winner, who discovered the nuclear fission of uranium in 1938. The first captain of the &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; was Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, a German U-boat ace of World War II.

In 1968, the ship&#x27;s 38-megawatt nuclear reactor was taken critical and sea trials began. In October of that year, NS &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; was certified for commercial freight transport and research.

Configured to carry passengers and ore, &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; made her first port call in Safi, Morocco, loading a cargo of phosphate ores, in 1970. In 1972, after four years of operation, her reactor was refuelled. She had covered 250,000 nautical miles (463,000 km) on 22 kilograms of uranium.

In 1979 &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; was deactivated. Her nuclear reactor and propulsion plant were removed and replaced by a conventional diesel engine room. In nine years, she had travelled 650,000 nautical miles (1,200,000 km) on nuclear power, visiting 33 ports in 22 countries, most of them only once with special permissions. She had never been allowed to use the Panama or Suez canals. The containment vessel of the nuclear reactor is stored at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht – Zentrum für Material- und Küstenforschung GmbH and the nuclear fuel in the United States.

In 1983, &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; was recommissioned as the container ship &quot;Trophy&quot; and leased into commercial service. On 19 November, she was renamed &quot;Norasia Susan&quot;. She became the &quot;Norasia Helga&quot; in 1985, &quot;Hua Kang He&quot; in 1989, &quot;Anais&quot; in 1998, &quot;Tal&quot; in 1999, and finally &quot;Madre&quot; later that year. Her last owner, from 2006, was Liberian-based Domine Maritime Corporation, under the management of Alon Maritime Corporation of Athens, Greece. The ship was scrapped at Alang, India, in 2009.

Her original funnel is preserved at the Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum (German Maritime Museum) in Bremerhaven.

==Operation and research ==
The &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; was commissioned on 11 October 1969, and she was a research ship as its primary purpose. She contained cabins for the group of about 36 scientists. She also contained a conference room, a meeting room, and two laboratories. Her main purpose was to gain experience of future nuclear ships, which could be used for transport. As the &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; did not receive enough permissions from harbours, the experiments ended in 1979, 10 years after commissioning.

Until her decommissioning, the &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; visited 33 ports in 22 countries, most of them in South America and Africa. She did not receive permission to pass through the Suez Canal and her last journey was to Durban.

Her last captain was Ralf Matheisel.

<doc id="194161" wikidata="Q540964" url="?curid=194161" title="Harlech Castle">
<text>Harlech Castle (; ) in Harlech, Gwynedd, Wales, is a Grade I listed medieval fortification built onto a rocky knoll close to the Irish Sea. It was built by Edward I during his invasion of Wales between 1282 and 1289 at the relatively modest cost of £8,190. Over the next few centuries, the castle played an important part in several wars, withstanding the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn between 1294 and 1295, but falling to Prince Owain Glyndŵr in 1404. It then became Glyndŵr&#x27;s residence and military headquarters for the remainder of the uprising until being recaptured by English forces in 1409. During the 15th century Wars of the Roses, Harlech was held by the Lancastrians for seven years, before Yorkist troops forced its surrender in 1468, a siege memorialised in the song &quot;Men of Harlech&quot;. Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1647 when it became the last fortification to surrender to the Parliamentary armies. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw, the Welsh Government&#x27;s historic environment service, as a tourist attraction.

UNESCO considers Harlech, with three others at Beaumaris, Conwy and Caernarfon, to be one of &quot;the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe&quot;, and it is classed as a World Heritage Site. The fortification is built of local stone and concentric in design, featuring a massive gatehouse that probably once provided high-status accommodation for the castle constable and visiting dignitaries. The sea originally came much closer to Harlech than in modern times, and a water-gate and a long flight of steps leads down from the castle to the former shore, which allowed the castle to be resupplied by sea during sieges. In keeping with Edward&#x27;s other castles in the north of Wales, the architecture of Harlech has close links to that found in the County of Savoy during the same period, an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of the main architect, James of Saint George.

==History==

===13th–14th centuries===
In local mythology, the site of Harlech Castle in North Wales is associated with the legend of Branwen, a Welsh princess, but there is no evidence for a native Welsh fortification having been built there. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of North Wales since the 1070s and the conflict was renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. English forces advanced down the Conwy valley and through Dolwyddelan and Castell y Bere, onto Harlech, which Sir Otton de Grandson took with 560 infantry in May.
Edward ordered the construction of a castle at Harlech, one of seven built across North Wales in the wake of the 1282 campaign. Money to pay for the initial phase arrived in mid-May and carpenters and 35 stonemasons were dispatched in June and July to commence work. By the winter of 1283, the first of the inner walls had been constructed, allowing the castle to be defended in the event of an attack, and a small, planned town had been founded alongside the castle. John de Bonvillars was appointed the constable of the castle in 1285; after his death in 1287 his wife, Agnes, took up the role until 1290.

Construction continued under the overall direction of James of Saint George, a Savoy architect and military engineer. In 1286, at the height of the construction, the workforce comprised 546 general labourers, 115 quarriers, 30 blacksmiths, 22 carpenters and 227 stonemasons, and the project was costing nearly £240 a month. The castle was essentially complete by the end of 1289, having cost an estimated £8,190, around 10 percent of the £80,000 that Edward spent on castle-building in Wales between 1277 and 1304.

Harlech was established with a garrison of 36 men: a constable, 30 men, including 10 crossbowmen, a chaplain, a smith, carpenter and stonemason, and Master James was rewarded by being made the constable of Harlech from 1290 to 1293. In 1294, Madog ap Llywelyn began an uprising against English rule that spread quickly through Wales. Several English-held towns were razed and Harlech, along with Criccieth Castle and Aberystwyth Castle, were besieged that winter. Fresh supplies were sent from Ireland by sea, arriving via Harlech&#x27;s water gate, and the uprising was quashed. In the aftermath of the revolt, additional defences were built around the route down to the sea. Further work was undertaken between 1323 and 1324, following the Despenser War; Edward II was threatened in the region by the Mortimer Marcher Lord family, and ordered his sheriff, Sir Gruffudd Llwyd, to extend the defences leading up to the gatehouse with additional towers.

===15th–17th centuries===

In 1400 a revolt broke out in North Wales against English rule, led by Owain Glyndŵr. By 1403 only a handful of castles, including Harlech, still stood against the rebels, but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege, the garrison having just three shields, eight helmets, six lances, ten pairs of gloves, and four guns. At the end of 1404, the castle fell to Glyndŵr. Harlech became his residence, family home and military headquarters for four years; he held his second parliament in Harlech in August 1405. In 1408 English forces under the command of the future Henry V placed Harlech and its commander, Edmund Mortimer, under siege, conducting a bombardment with cannon, probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls. When this failed to take the castle, Henry left John Talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with Aberystwyth Castle. Supplies finally ran short, Mortimer and many of his men died of exhaustion, and Harlech fell in February 1409.

In the 15th century, Harlech was involved in the series of civil wars now known as the Wars of the Roses that broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and House of York. In 1460, following the Battle of Northampton, Queen Margaret of Anjou fled to the castle and between 1461 and 1468 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, under the command of Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and as other fortresses fell, eventually became the last major stronghold still under Lancastrian control. The castle became a base for their operations across the region: there were planned operations in 1464, Sir Richard Tunstall mounted attacks from Harlech in 1466 and Jasper Tudor landed there with French reinforcements in 1468, before then raiding the town of Denbigh. Tudor&#x27;s arrival caused Edward IV to order William Herbert to mobilise an army, possibly up to 10,000 strong, to finally seize the castle. After a month&#x27;s siege, the small garrison surrendered on 14 August. This siege is credited with inspiring the song &quot;Men of Harlech&quot;.

The English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Harlech apparently had not been repaired following the 1468 siege, and had become completely dilapidated, with the exception of the gatehouse, which was used for the local assizes. In 1644 Prince Rupert appointed a local Royalist, Colonel William Owen, as the castle&#x27;s constable, and Owen was entrusted with repairing the fortifications. A long siege ensued from June 1646 until 15 March 1647, when the garrison of 44 men surrendered to Major-General Thomas Mytton. The castle was the last mainland royal fortress to surrender in the war, and the date marked the end of the first phase of the war. The castle was no longer required for the security of North Wales and, to prevent any further use by the Royalists, Parliament ordered its slighting, or destruction. The orders were only partially carried out, however, and the gatehouse staircases were destroyed and the castle rendered generally unusable, but it was not totally demolished. Stone from the castle was reused to build houses in the local town.

===18th–21st centuries===

In the late-18th and 19th centuries, the picturesque ruins of Harlech began to attract visits from prominent artists, including John Cotman, Henry Gastineau, Paul Sandby, J. M. W. Turner and John Varley. In 1914 it was transferred from the Merioneth Crown Estate to the control of the Office of Works, who commenced a major restoration project after the end of World War I. In 1969 the castle was transferred to the Welsh Office and then to Cadw, who manage the property in the 21st century as a tourist attraction. Harlech was declared part of the &quot;Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd&quot; World Heritage Site in 1986, UNESCO considering Harlech one of &quot;the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe&quot;.

==Architecture==

Harlech Castle rests upon part of the Harlech Dome, a spur of rock almost high; the land falls away sharply on the north and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle. The castle has a concentric design, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today. Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls. A softer yellow sandstone is used for the decorative work in the castle, possibly quarried from around Egryn Abbey near Barmouth.

The main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down to the foot of the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.
The gatehouse follows the design, sometimes termed the Tonbridge-style, that became popular during the 13th century, with two massive &quot;D-shaped&quot; defensive towers flanking the entrance. The passage into the castle was guarded by three portcullises and at least two heavy doors. The gatehouse has two upper floors, broken up into various rooms. Each floor has three large windows overlooking the inner ward; the second floor has two additional grand windows on the sides of the gatehouse; the gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys. The use of these rooms has been the subject of academic debate: historian Arnold Taylor argued that the first floor of the gatehouse was used by the constable as living accommodation, with the second floor used by senior visitors; Jeremy Ashbee has since challenged this interpretation, suggesting the high status accommodation may instead have been in the inner ward, and the gatehouse used for other purposes.

The inner ward is guarded by four large circular towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, clockwise from the north-east, they were called Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors&#x27;, Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer&#x27;s Towers respectively. Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials in a similar fashion to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era.

The architecture of Harlech has close links to that found in the Savoy in the same period. These include semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. The links between the Harlech and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Harlech project.

<text>Gardez ( / ; &quot;Gardēz&quot;, meaning &quot;mountain fortress&quot; in Middle Persian) is the capital of the Paktia Province of Afghanistan. The population of the city was estimated to be ca. 10,000 in the 1979 census and was estimated to be 70,000 in 2008. The majority of the city&#x27;s native population is Pashtun. The city of Gardez is located at the junction between two important roads that cut, through a huge alpine valley. Surrounded by the mountains and deserts of the Hindu Kush, which boil up from the valley floor to the north, east and west, it is the axis of commerce for a huge area of eastern Afghanistan and has been a strategic location for armies throughout the country&#x27;s long history of conflict. Observation posts built by Alexander the Great are still crumbling on the hilltops just outside the city limits.
The city of Gardez has a population of 70,641 (in 2015). It has 13 districts and a total land area of . The total number of dwellings in this city is 7,849.

On 14 August 2021, Gardez was seized by Taliban fighters, becoming the nineteenth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.

==History==
Gardez is an ancient settlement, located within a large intramountainous depression in the Sulaiman Mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Archaeological discoveries, including Greek, Sassanid, Hephthalite, and Hindu Shahi coins give an insight into the rich history of Gardez.

During 8th century, the Lawik rulers of the region adopted Islam. They formerly practiced either Hinduism or Buddhism, since they were associated with the Buddhist Kabul Shahis, and later with the Hindu Shahis (based in Gandhara, in present-day north-west Pakistan). Gardez later became a center of Kharijism and suffered several attacks by anti-Kharijite military chiefs. According to &quot;Zayn al-Akhbar&quot;, written by historian Abu Sa&#x27;id Gardezi, Abu Mansur Aflah Lawik was reduced to a tributary status in Gardez by Emir Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar in 877. However, the city remained under Lawik rule for about a century more. Around 975, Samanid-appointed governor Bilgetegin besieged Gardez but was killed by Lawiks during the attack. In 1162, the city fell to the Ghurid dynasty.

During the 16th-century, Gardez was renowned for its multi-storied houses—as mentioned by Baburs in his &quot;Baburnama&quot;—and was the headquarter of the Mughal &quot;tūmān&quot; of &quot;Zurmut&quot;, whose people were &quot;Afghān-Shāl&quot;.

Today, Gardez is the administrative center of a district of the Paktiā province, which covers 650 km2 and had a total population of 44,000 inhabitants in 1979, but was almost totally depopulated during the Soviet–Afghan War.

In 1960, the German government had their biggest rural development project with a budget of 2.5 million Deutsch Marks for the development of Paktiā (&quot;Paktiā Development Authority&quot;, see above). This led to an economic boom in the 1970s. The number of shops in the bazar increased from 117 in 1965 to more than 600 in 1977. The project was unsuccessful as the communist regime came to power in 1979. The communists lost control of most of Paktiā during the 1980s as the country plunged into war with only Gardez remaining in government control. In 2002, the city and surroundings was attacked by local warlord Pacha Khan Zadran, who was chosen as Paktia governor by Hamid Karzai&#x27;s administration only to be refused by tribal elders.

On January 4, 2002, the first American soldier to die in the War in Afghanistan, Sergeant First Class Nathan Chapman, was killed in Gardez.

On 14 May 2020, a suicide truck bomber killed five civilians and injured at least 29 others near a court in Gardez. The Taliban claimed this as a revenge attack against the Afghan government, after President Ashraf Ghani blamed the group for the attack at a maternity hospital in Kabul two days earlier; the Taliban denied responsibility for the hospital attack.

== Geography ==
Gardez is located at 2,308 m above sea level, making it the third-highest provincial capital in Afghanistan, and is not far from the Tora Bora region of caves and tunnels. The &quot;old town&quot;, located at the foot of the &quot;Bālā Hesār&quot; fortress. The city is watered by the upper course of the Gardez River, which flows into the Ab-i Istada lake. Gardez is located at a junction between two important roads, one connecting Kabul with Khost, the other linking Ghazni with Parachinar in Pakistan&#x27;s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Gardez is northwest of Khost and south of Kabul.

=== Climate ===

Gardez has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) with dry summers and cold, snowy winters. Precipitation is low, and mostly falls in winter and spring.
== Land use ==
Gardez is located in eastern Afghanistan close to Ghazni and Khost. Gardez is predominately non-built up area with agriculture as the largest land use at 39%. Residential area accounts for almost half of built-up area and Districts 1-4 consist of the densest housing.

==Demographics==
As of 2008, the population of Gardez was estimated to be around 73,131. Pashtuns make up ca. 70% of the population while the Tajik community accounts for ca. 30%.

Majority of the people living in Gardez are pashtuns primarily of the Ahmadzai tribe.

The Encyclopaedia Iranica states that the population of the city was 9,550 in 1979 and that &quot;They were mainly Fārsīwān Tājīks, Gardīz belonging to a network of old isolated Tājīk settlements sparsely distributed in southeastern Afghanistan that are remnants of a time when Pashto had not yet reached the area. There was also a significant community of Hindu and Sikh shopkeepers who altogether ran 9% of the shops in the bāzār, mostly specializing in jewellery and cloth&quot;

== Economy and administration ==

The city of Gardez is also a major fuel wood market for Kabul. Many of its natural forests are being cut down to provide fuel wood especially during winter.

During the 1970s, Gardez experienced a significant economic boom, primarily attributable to substantial financial support from Germany. This infusion of funds catalyzed rapid growth in various sectors, such as infrastructure development, industrial expansion, and education initiatives. As a consequence, the city saw a surge in job opportunities, improved living standards, and a thriving business environment, marking a pivotal period in its history. &quot;Paktiā Development Authority&quot;, established in 1965, and of the asphalting of the road to Kabul. Social services included three schools for boys, one school for girls, a hospital, one teacher training institute, the &quot;Madrasaye Roshānī&quot;, two hotels, and forty mosques. Most of these buildings were destroyed during the civil war in the 1980s.

After the fall of the Taliban, the first Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan was established in Paktiā near Gardez in early March 2003, headed by the US Army along with a U.S. Agency for International Development representative, Randolph Hampton. There are now over 30 PRTs in Afghanistan. The continuing challenge to bring electricity, medical clinics, schools and water to the more remote villages in Paktia are a result of ongoing security issues.

==Security and politics==
Gardez was the former home of the 3rd Corps of the Afghan Army. By the Afghan Militia Forces period (c.2002), the corps &#x27;theoretically incorporated 14th Division, 30th Division, 822nd Brigade, Border Brigades, and approximately 800... in the Governor&#x27;s Force in Paktya, Ghazni, Paktika, and Khost Provinces. 
The corps was disbanded around 2003-2005 and replaced in the new Afghan National Army by the 203rd Corps.

According to local Police Chief Brigadier General Aziz Ahmad Wardak, six people were arrested on 19 August 2009 for distributing night letters threatening people with attacks if they participated in the election.

<doc id="194163" wikidata="Q272787" url="?curid=194163" title="Katherine Harris">
<text>Katherine Harris (born April 5, 1957) is an American politician from Florida. A Republican, she served in the Florida Senate from 1994 to 1998, as Secretary of State of Florida from 1999 to 2002, and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Florida&#x27;s 13th congressional district from 2003 to 2007. Harris lost her 2006 campaign for a United States Senate seat from Florida to incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson.

In the 2000 presidential election, she received international attention for her role as the elected Florida Secretary of State during the state&#x27;s election recount, certifying George W. Bush&#x27;s narrow victory (537 votes) over Al Gore and awarding him the Florida electors, which gained him the national election.

==Early life and education==
Harris was born in Key West, Florida, to one of the state&#x27;s wealthiest and most politically influential families. She is the daughter of Harriett (Griffin) and George W. Harris Jr., who owned Citrus and Chemical Bank in Lakeland, Florida. Her maternal grandfather was Ben Hill Griffin Jr., a successful businessman in the citrus and cattle industries and a powerful figure in the state legislature. Shortly before his death in 1990, he was ranked as the 261st richest American on the Forbes 400 list. Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at the University of Florida is named for him.

Harris graduated from Bartow High School in Bartow, Florida, in 1975 , after attending Santa Fe Catholic High School in Lakeland, Florida, from 1972 to 1974. She attended the University of Madrid in 1978. Harris received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, in 1979. She studied under Christian theologian Francis Schaeffer at the L&#x27;Abri community in Huemoz, Switzerland. While in college, she interned for U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles and U.S. representative Andy Ireland.

Before entering politics, Harris worked as a marketing executive at IBM and a vice president of a commercial real estate firm. Harris earned a M.P.A. from Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in International Trade and Negotiations in 1996.

==Career==
Harris ran for the Florida Senate as a Republican in 1994 in one of the most expensive state races in Florida history to that time.

===Florida senate and Riscorp===
Harris played a prominent role in introducing William Griffin, the CEO of Riscorp, to various Florida legislators. In the 1994 state senate election, Sarasota-based Riscorp, Inc. made illegal contributions totaling $400,000 to dozens of political candidates and committees, including $20,600 to the Harris campaign.

Two years later, in 1996, Harris sponsored a bill &quot;to block Riscorp competitors from getting a greater share of Florida workers&#x27; compensation market, [and] also pushed a proposal that would hurt a particular competitor.&quot; This issue later emerged during her campaign for Florida Secretary of State in 1998.

William Griffin eventually pleaded guilty to illegal campaign donations, among allegations of other serious wrongdoing at Riscorp, and served prison time in 1998. According to a &quot;Sun-Herald&quot; column from June 2005, &quot;Harris denied any knowledge of the scheme, was never charged with any crime and was cleared of wrongdoing by a state investigator.&quot;

===Florida secretary of state===
Harris was elected Florida Secretary of State in 1998. She defeated then-incumbent Sandra Mortham in the Republican primary and won the general election against Democratic candidate, Karen Gievers, an attorney from Miami. A state constitutional change was passed in the same year, making the Secretary of State an appointed office. This change made Harris the last person to be elected Secretary of State in Florida.

Harris abruptly resigned in August 2002 while campaigning for Congress when it was discovered that she had violated Florida&#x27;s &quot;resign to run&quot;, which stated &quot;...No officer may qualify as a candidate for another public office, whether state, district, county or municipal, if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other, without resigning from the office he or she presently holds.&quot; Since the start of her Congressional term (January 3, 2003) would overlap with the end of her term as Secretary of State (January 7, 2003), she was required to submit a letter of recognition. The law allowed candidates to have the resignation be effective up until the term for the new office began. Since Harris failed to do so, she was required to resign immediately. Harris said the oversight was unintentional. She said that she thought because Florida voters had approved a constitutional amendment that made the position of Secretary of State an appointed office rather than an elected office, the law did not apply to her situation.

===International travel===
During her first 22 months in office, Harris spent more than $106,000 for travel, more than the governor or any other cabinet officer. She visited eight countries on ten foreign trips.

In early 2001, the Florida Senate leaders eliminated the $3.4 million that Harris had budgeted for international relations for the year, assigning it instead to &quot;Enterprise Florida&quot;, the state&#x27;s economic development agency. However, Tom Feeney, the Speaker of the Florida House of representatives at the time, said that he disagreed with the Senate and believed that Harris was an able advocate to foreign countries. After the House refused to agree with the proposed budget action, the Senate agreed to restore the money; however, it insisted on a review committee, appointed by Senate President John McKay, Feeney, and Governor Jeb Bush, to evaluate all of Harris&#x27; expenditures on international affairs since July 1, 1999, and produce a report.

===2000 U.S. presidential election===

As Secretary of State of Florida (and co-chair of Republican George W. Bush&#x27;s election efforts in Florida), Harris was a central figure in the 2000 US presidential election in Florida. She was involved in purging 173,000 individuals from the state&#x27;s voter rolls, the results of hiring a firm, &quot;Choice Point&quot;, that provided Florida with an extremely inaccurate list of those supposed felons who became disenfranchised via misidentification. The list was derived from, for instance, a Texas felons&#x27; list which included common names that were used to strike Florida voters from the rolls. Thousands, including a disproportionate number of Blacks, were prevented from casting ballots.

The Florida election between Bush and Democrat Al Gore was so close, separated by only 537 votes, that a recount of the votes was demanded.

After several recounts were inconclusive, Harris halted the recounting process, arguing that the laws governing recounts were unclear. The official vote totals showed Bush as the narrow winner of the statewide popular vote in Florida, so Harris certified the Republican slate of electors. This victory in Florida allowed Bush to obtain a narrow majority in the Electoral College and thereby prevail in the election. Her certification was upheld in the state circuit court, but subsequently overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court. The Florida Supreme Court decision was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; (2000). In a &quot;per curiam&quot; decision, by a 7–2 vote, the Court held that the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s method for recounting ballots was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Furthermore, it held, by a 5–4 vote, that no alternative method for a recount could be established within the time limits set by the State of Florida. Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s vote to stop the recount was crucial. This decision allowed Harris&#x27; previous certification of Bush as the winner of Florida&#x27;s electoral votes to stand. Florida&#x27;s 25 electoral votes gave Bush, the Republican candidate, 271 electoral votes, thus defeating Gore, who ended up with 266 electoral votes (one D.C. elector abstained).

Harris later published &quot;Center of the Storm,&quot; her memoir of the 2000 election controversy. It was later revealed that, unimpressed with her performance in the media spotlight of the recount, the Bush Campaign had assigned a staff member to her, essentially as a handler.

===United States congresswoman===

In 2002, Harris ran against Sarasota Attorney Jan Schneider for the congressional district vacated by retiring Republican representative Dan Miller, winning by 10 percentage points in this solidly Republican district, a victory helped with one of the biggest first term campaign fund raising efforts in the history of this district and substantial support from the Bush family.

In the 2002 U.S. House elections, Harris ran for Florida’s 13th congressional district seat, facing Sarasota attorney Jan Schneider. This seat was left open by retiring Republican Representative Dan Miller. Harris secured a decisive victory, winning by a margin of 10 percentage points in the strongly Republican district. Her campaign was bolstered by one of the largest first-term fundraising efforts in the district’s history and significant backing from the Bush family.

Harris considered running for the seat of retiring Senator Bob Graham in 2004 but was reportedly dissuaded by the Bush White House to allow Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Mel Martinez to run instead. Martinez went on to narrowly beat challenger Betty Castor. Harris ran for re-election to her House seat in 2004; she was re-elected with a margin almost identical to her first win.

In a 2004 speech in Venice, Florida, Harris claimed that a &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; man was arrested for attempting to blow up the power grid in Carmel, Indiana; Carmel Mayor James Brainard and a spokesman for Indiana governor Joe Kernan said they had no knowledge of such a plot. Brainard said he had never spoken to Harris.

During a 2004 campaign stop in Sarasota, a local resident, Barry Seltzer, &quot;tr[ied] to &#x27;intimidate&#x27; a group of Harris supporters&quot; by menacing Harris and her supporters with his automobile. Witnesses described Seltzer as having swerved off the road and onto the sidewalk, directing it at Harris and her supporters. Nobody was injured in the incident. Seltzer, who claimed he was &quot;exercising [his] political expression,&quot; was eventually arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon.

===MZM incident===
In 2005 and 2006, a major corporate campaign donor to Harris, Mitchell Wade (founder of defense contractor MZM), was implicated in several bribery scandals. Wade had bundled together and donated to Harris&#x27;s campaign $32,000 in contributions from his employees at MZM, Inc., then reimbursed those employees for the contributions. Regarding this issue, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Wainstein said that Harris did not appear to know the donations were obtained illegally. Harris has maintained she had no personal knowledge that her campaign was given illegal contributions. Wade acknowledged that the donations to the Harris campaign were illegal and were part of an attempt to influence Harris to MZM&#x27;s benefit.

Documents filed with Wade&#x27;s plea say that he took Harris to dinner in March 2005, a year after the illegal contributions, where they discussed the possibility of another fundraiser and the possibility of getting funding for a Navy counterintelligence program placed in Harris&#x27;s district. Harris sent a letter on April 26, 2005, to defense appropriations subcommittee Chairman C. W. Bill Young, in which Harris sought $10 million for a Navy project backed by Wade. In the letter, Harris emphasized the importance of the project, asking that it be added to her list of five priorities and identifying it as her new No. 3. Harris later released the April 26, 2005, letter for legal scrutiny, but neither she nor Young would turn over the request form (RFP) used for the proposal.

&quot;CQPolitics&quot; noted &quot;Harris&#x27;s former political strategist, Ed Rollins, spoke on the record about the dinner and detailed a meal that cost $2,800, far in excess of the $50 limit on gifts that members of Congress are allowed to accept&quot; at the Washington restaurant Citronelle. Wade and Harris discussed MZM&#x27;s desire for a $10 million appropriation, and Wade offered to host a fundraiser for Harris&#x27;s 2006 Senate campaign. Regarding the MZM contributions, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; article goes on to say &quot;The Justice Department has said Wade, who personally handed many of the checks to Harris, did not tell Harris the contributions were illegal&quot;. Regarding the expensive meal, the article quotes Harris as saying that she personally had only a &quot;beverage and appetizer&quot; worth less than &quot;$100&quot;.

Rollins said that he had conducted a thorough internal investigation into Harris&#x27;s ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges. Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, &quot;her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don&#x27;t tell the same story twice ... Maybe you don&#x27;t think you did anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may perjure yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don&#x27;t think she set out to violate the law, but I think she was very careless. She heard whatever she wanted to hear, but we could find no evidence whatsoever that this was a project going into her district.&quot;

Although Rollins recalled discussing the $2,800 meal with Harris, Harris told the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; on April 19, 2006, that the cost of the meal was &quot;news to me&quot;, and that her campaign had since &quot;reimbursed&quot; the restaurant for the cost of the meal. According to the reporter, when questioned as to why she would reimburse the restaurant for a meal that had been paid for by MZM, Harris abruptly terminated the interview, and her spokesman later called and requested unsuccessfully that the story not be printed. The next day, Harris&#x27;s campaign issued a statement that she had believed her campaign had reimbursed the restaurant, and that she had donated $100 &quot;which will more than adequately compensate for the cost of my beverage and appetizer&quot;. Harris also asserted that most of the cost of the meal was from Wade ordering several unopened bottles of wine to take home, although the management of the restaurant denies ever allowing anyone to take unopened bottles of wine off the premises, saying &quot;Why would we jeopardize our liquor license for the sake of selling a couple bottles of wine?&quot;

In the weeks following the expensive meal, former senior Harris staffers claimed that &quot;they initially rejected a defense contractor&#x27;s $10 million appropriation request last year but reversed course after being instructed by Harris to approve it.&quot; In May 2006, Harris&#x27;s campaign spokesman Christopher Ingram acknowledged that she had also had a previous dinner with Wade in the same restaurant in March 2004, when the $32,000 in illegal donations had been given to her campaign. Ingram told the press that he did not know how much that meal cost, but that a charitable donation of an unknown amount had been given to a charity whose name he did not know, equivalent to her share of the meal. &quot;She takes responsibility for the oversight that there was no reimbursement,&quot; he said.

Mona Tate Yost, an aide to Harris, left to work for MZM during the time Wade was pressing Harris to secure federal funding (April or May 2005). On July 17, 2006, Ed Rollins confirmed that Justice Department lawyers and FBI agents had recently questioned her about the $32,000 in donations. Rollins noted: &quot;I assume more [interviews] will be coming, though. They were very serious.&quot; On September 7, 2006, Federal investigators questioned Jim Dornan, who quit as Harris&#x27;s campaign manager the previous November.

===2006 Senate race===
====Overview====
On June 7, 2005, with support from her new campaign advisors of Ed Rollins and Jim Dornan, Harris announced her candidacy for the United States Senate election, challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson. Both lackluster fundraising relative to Nelson and controversy over campaign contributions from MZM caused Harris to fall far behind in all polls by May 2006.
Late in the primary race, Republican contender Will McBride polled 31 points behind Nelson in a hypothetical election against him, while Harris polled 33 points behind Nelson in the same poll. Harris was still popular among Republican voters and won the September 5 primary over McBride and two other challengers with approximately 50% of the total vote.

Despite Harris&#x27;s support of many Republican causes and her previous statewide victories, some party leaders expressed doubt about her statewide appeal:

* In May 2006, Florida governor Jeb Bush questioned Harris&#x27;s ability to win the general election and encouraged others to challenge her in the primary.
* Karl Rove expressed doubts about her statewide appeal.
* National Republicans openly criticized her campaign and tried to convince other GOP candidates to challenge Harris in the primary.
* Florida state House of Representatives Speaker Allan Bense declined the candidacy on May 11 despite public courting by many leaders including Governor Bush.
* Then-conservative pundit and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough was also unsuccessfully recruited to enter the race. Departing Harris aides claim that Harris called potential Scarborough supporters and raised the death of an aide in order to prevent his entry into the race. Scarborough later told Nelson that drawing Harris as an opponent in the race made him &quot;the luckiest man in Washington&quot;.

By late July 2006, Harris had gone through three campaign managers and her campaign was floundering. At that time, it was disclosed that state Republican Party leaders had told Harris they would not support her because she could not win in the general election.

Financial problems plagued Harris&#x27; Senate campaign from the start. During the primary, it was clear that the incumbent Senator Nelson had a substantial financial advantage.

On the March 15, 2006, episode of Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, Harris announced her commitment to invest $10 million of her own inheritance into her Senate campaign. She described this amount as her entire inheritance and dedicated her campaign to the memory of her late father, George W. Harris Jr., who had been the chairman and president of Citrus &amp; Chemical Bank, a prominent institution in Florida.

Despite her promise, the $10 million never materialized. Reports surfaced that Harris would not actually receive the inheritance from her father, who instead left his entire estate to her mother. She donated $3 million to her campaign, but later took back $100,000, fueling speculation that she would be unable to donate the promised amount.

In October, Harris announced that she was trying to sell her house in Washington to raise money for her campaign, but the home was not publicly listed for sale and no sale was ever announced.

Nelson defeated Harris by more than one million votes. Harris received less than 39% of the vote.

====Staff resignations====
In late February 2006, in the midst of revelations surrounding Mitchell Wade&#x27;s illegal contributions, Harris&#x27;s campaign finance director and her campaign treasurer both resigned. On April 1, 2006, Harris&#x27;s top campaign advisor, pollster and campaign manager all resigned with a half-dozen other staffers. Republican pollster and consultant David Johnson said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen staffers go like this. It&#x27;s just imploding.&quot;

In early April 2006, Harris told the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; that some of her ex-campaign staffers and the national Republican party were deliberately sabotaging her campaign by &quot;putting knives in her back&quot; and had warned her that if she did not back out of the campaign, she would get an &quot;April surprise&quot;. Former campaign staffer Ed Rollins said &quot;They were all good professionals ... There was no backstabbing. It&#x27;s insulting that she would even say that. If she wants to know what went wrong with the campaign, maybe she needs to take a good look in the mirror.&quot;

In June, the Harris campaign received a legal bill for thousands of dollars that contained a reference to &quot;DOJ subpoena&quot;. Later, an ex-aide told the Associated Press that Harris had received a grand jury subpoena from federal investigators, but kept it from her top advisers, prompting several staff members to quit when they found out. On June 8, 2006, Harris&#x27;s fourth chief of staff, Fred Asbell, left in order to pursue a &quot;business opportunity&quot;. Asbell said he&#x27;d &quot;greatly enjoyed&quot; his time with the campaign and he would remain in a consultant position.

On July 12, 2006, Harris&#x27;s campaign spokesman Chris Christopher Ingram left the campaign. The next day, Harris received resignations from Campaign Manager Glenn Hodas, Field Director Pat Thomas, Political Director Brian Brooks and Deputy Field Director John K. Byers, while Travel Aide Kyle Johnson and Field Director Mike Norris declined to leave, citing loyalty to Harris. Hodas cited Harris&#x27;s &quot;tantrums&quot; and &quot;increasingly erratic behavior&quot; as his reasons for leaving. An anonymous campaign worker described Harris as &quot;very difficult to work with. The more that we put her out there, the more she shot herself in the foot.&quot;

In late August, Harris lost another key staffer, Rhyan Metzler, in the wake of a disastrous political rally at Orlando Executive Airport. Only 40 people showed up for the event, and Harris blamed the paltry turnout in part on a last-minute change in location. She claimed that a tree fell on the hangar that was originally scheduled to hold the rally, forcing her campaign to switch to another hangar. Airport officials, however, stated that not only had no trees fallen, but also that there are no trees as they get in the way of the airplanes; further adding that the event in fact took place in the hangar that Harris&#x27;s campaign had originally booked. Harris&#x27;s campaign blamed Metzler for the comments Harris made after the rally. On August 31, 2006, Harris was interviewed on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, where she responded to the criticisms from her former staffers with &quot;We have their email traffic, we know what was behind all that, we know who&#x27;s been paid and who isn&#x27;t.&quot;

====Lack of Republican support====
The &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; suggested that Harris might withdraw from the Senate race after winning a primary victory, thereby allowing the Republicans to nominate another candidate, such as Tom Gallagher, to run against Bill Nelson.

In August, Katherine Harris touted political endorsements from fellow Republican lawmakers on her campaign web site. However, some of those cited claim that they never endorsed her. This conflict resulted in several Republican congressmen calling the Harris campaign to complain after the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; notified them of the endorsements listed on Harris&#x27;s Web site. A short time later, their names were removed without comment from Harris&#x27;s Web site.

Of Harris&#x27;s three primary opponents, only Will McBride endorsed her candidacy for the general election. In the first few days after the primary, a number of Republican nominees such as Charlie Crist and Tom Lee went on a statewide unity tour with Governor Bush. Harris was not invited; Republicans said the tour was only for nominees to statewide offices. Harris claimed Bush would campaign with her sometime in the two months before the election, but the governor&#x27;s office denied this.

President Bush did not make public appearances or private meetings with Harris before the primary. He did, however, appear with her at a fundraiser on September 21 in Tampa. When it came time for newspapers to make their op-ed endorsements, all 22 of Florida&#x27;s major daily newspapers supported Senator Nelson. The only endorsement Harris received was from the &quot;Polk County Democrat&quot;, a newspaper in Bartow which publishes four days out of the week.

===Replacements in the 13th Congressional District===
Vern Buchanan was the Republican nominee and Christine Jennings the Democratic nominee to replace Harris in the 2006 election. The race had been ranked as &quot;leaning Democratic&quot; by CQ Politics, but Buchanan scored a very narrow victory, winning the election by a few hundred votes.

==Religious positions==
Harris was a headline speaker at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church&#x27;s &quot;Reclaiming America for Christ&quot; conference held in Ft. Lauderdale on March 17–18, 2006. The conference web site invited attendees to attend in order to &quot;reclaim this nation for Christ.&quot; The stated mission of ReclaimAmerica.org is &quot;To inform, equip, motivate, and support Christians; enabling them to defend and implement the Biblical principles on which our country was founded.&quot; As part of her speech, Harris urged conferees to &quot;win back America for God.&quot; Her appearance was noted in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article covering the conference.

In an interview with the &quot;Florida Baptist Witness&quot; on August 24, 2006, Harris called for Christians to vote on religious lines. She said,

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) said she was &quot;disgusted&quot; by the comments &quot;and deeply disappointed in Representative Harris personally,&quot; adding that Harris&#x27;s statement &quot;clearly shows that she does not deserve to be a representative.&quot; Two of Harris&#x27; primary opponents denounced her statements, Republican Will McBride (an attorney and son of a pastor) stated &quot;I&#x27;m a Christian, and I&#x27;m a Republican, and I don&#x27;t share her views. There are people of other faiths and backgrounds of outstanding integrity who know how to tell the truth.&quot; Real estate developer Peter Monroe, another GOP primary opponent, called on her to quit the race and resign from Congress. He called her suggestion that non-Christian voters are ignorant of morality when voting as &quot;contemptible, arrogant and wicked.&quot;

On August 26, 2006, Harris&#x27;s campaign released a &quot;Statement of Clarification&quot;, that stated, &quot;In the interview, Harris was speaking to a Christian audience, addressing a common misperception that people of faith should not be actively involved in government. Addressing this Christian publication, Harris provided a statement that explains her deep grounding in Judeo-Christian values.&quot; The press release went on to mention her past support of Israel and quoted her Jewish campaign manager Bryan G. Rudnick, who stated &quot;As the grandson of Holocaust survivors, I know that she encourages people of all faiths to engage in government so that our country can continue to thrive on the principles set forth by our founding fathers, without malice towards anyone.&quot; At an appearance at an Orlando gun show that same day, she said &quot;it breaks my heart&quot; to think people understood her comments as bigoted. When asked if she thought the Founding Fathers intended the nation to have secular laws she replied,

On October 3, 2006, Harris participated in a prayer service via phone call. In one instance, she called for the elimination of the separation of church and state when she said,

Harris then went on and prayed for Jews to be converted to Christianity.

==Political positions and voting record==
Harris was conservative on most issues. She is anti-abortion and voted against embryonic stem cell research. Harris supported reforming Social Security to include private accounts. She voted in favor of granting legal status to fetuses via the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. She supported tax cuts and the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which restricts bankruptcy filings by consumers. Harris was in favor of welfare reform, school vouchers, the Patriot Act, the Flag Desecration Amendment, the Federal Marriage Amendment, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In a televised debate with Nelson on November 1, however, she repeatedly declined to say whether she would still support the Iraq War Resolution knowing that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. In an earlier debate with Nelson, Harris was asked to comment on trade of arms with foreign nations and the potential threat of their acquisition by terrorist groups. Harris responded that &quot;we know we don&#x27;t want to have arms going to the rogue nations like China.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Katherine Harris was the subject of some skits on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in which she was played by Ana Gasteyer; and she was played by Mo Collins on &quot;MADtv&quot; and she was also portrayed by actress Laura Dern in the 2008 film &quot;Recount&quot;, for which Dern won a Golden Globe. She was mentioned in Family Guy, Season 5, Episode 16 &#x27;No Chris Left Behind&#x27;. Harris was also referenced in one of filmmaker Kevin Smith&#x27;s monologues for the DVD &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder&quot;. Harris was satirically portrayed by comedian Janeane Garofalo as &quot;Senator Katherine Harris&quot; on the Internet talk radio and podcast show &quot;The Majority Report with Sam Seder&quot;.

==Personal life==
Harris&#x27;s extended family has been active in Christian evangelism. Her grandfather was a Christian missionary in Africa, while her aunt and uncle were missionaries in India. They headed the Arab World Missions . Harris studied under Dr. Francis Schaeffer at a L&#x27;Abri Fellowship International center. Harris attended Greystone, an all-girls Christian camp at Asheville, North Carolina. She has said her faith is &quot;the most important thing in my life.&quot; Harris has criticized the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) for being too liberal; she was reared in the more conservative Presbyterian Church in America. She attended Calvary Chapel, a non-denominational charismatic church in Sarasota, Florida .

Harris married Swedish businessman Sven Anders Axel Ebbeson in 1996 and has one stepdaughter, Louise. Sven Ebbeson committed suicide in November 2013 at their home in Sarasota; he had reportedly been suffering a serious illness. In 2017, after admitting she&#x27;d become &quot;a near recluse&quot; since Ebbeson&#x27;s death, she married Texas banker Richard Ware.

<text>The Church of Norway (, , , ) is an evangelical Lutheran denomination of Protestant Christianity and by far the largest Christian church in Norway. Christianity became the state religion of Norway around 1020, and was established as a separate church intimately integrated with the state as a result of the Lutheran reformation in Denmark–Norway which broke ties with the Holy See in 1536–1537; the Norwegian monarch was the church&#x27;s titular head from 1537 to 2012. Historically, the church was one of the main instruments of state authority, and an important part of the state&#x27;s administration. Local government was based on the church&#x27;s parishes with significant official responsibility held by the parish priest.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Church of Norway gradually ceded most administrative functions to the secular civil service. The modern Constitution of Norway describes the church as the country&#x27;s &quot;people&#x27;s church&quot; and requires the monarch to be a member. It is by far the largest church in Norway; until the mid 19th century the state church had a near-total monopoly on religion in Norway. It was the only legal church in Norway, membership was mandatory for every person residing in the kingdom and it was forbidden for anyone other than the official priests of the state church to authorise religious meetings. After the adoption of the 1845 Dissenter Act, the state church retained its legally privileged position, while minority religious congregations such as Catholics were allowed to establish themselves in Norway and were legally termed &quot;dissenters&quot; (i.e. from the government-sanctioned Lutheran state religion). Church employees were civil servants from the Reformation until 2017, when the church became a legal entity separate from the state administration. The Church of Norway is mentioned specifically in the 1814 constitution and is subject to the Church Act. Municipalities are required by law to support activities of parishes and to maintain church buildings and churchyards. Other religious communities are entitled to the same level of government subsidies as the Church of Norway.

The church is led by ordained deacons, priests and bishops. Deacons focus on serving those in need and assist the priests. Priests are traditionally and primarily divided into the ranks chaplain, parish priest () who was traditionally the head of a parish (; literally area that owes allegiance to a priest), and provost (). Bishops are elected and consecrated from the priesthood and are the leaders of dioceses. The Church of Norway preserved the apostolic succession of its bishops at the Reformation. Today, most priests may hold the title of parish priest, while some priests who work directly under a provost are known as provostship priest (). All priests and bishops were appointed by the King-in-Council until the late 20th century and thus held the status of (higher civil servant appointed by the King). Prior to 2000, ordination required the theological civil servant examination (cand.theol.) that required six years of university studies, but from 2000 other equivalent degrees may also be accepted for certain applicants over the age of 35 with relevant experience.

==Overview==

Norway was gradually Christianized beginning at the end of the Early Middle Ages and was part of Western Christianity, acknowledging papal authority until the 16th century. The Roman Catholic Church exercised a significant degree of sovereignty in Norway and essentially shared power with the King of Norway as the secular ruler. The Lutheran reformation in Denmark–Norway in 1536–1537 broke ties with the Holy See, around two decades after the start of the Protestant Reformation. It later resulted in the separation of dioceses in Norway and throughout the Nordic countries from the Catholic Church. These Lutheran state churches were integrated with the state and subject to royal authority. The Norwegian monarch, although a layperson, was deemed the head of the church until 2012, although in practice the bishops remained the spiritual leaders. Until the modern era, the Church of Norway was not only a religious organisation but also one of the most important instruments of state authority, and an important part of the state administration, especially at the local and regional levels.

The church professes to be &quot;truly Catholic, truly Reformed, truly Evangelical&quot; in the Evangelical Lutheran tradition of Western Christian faith, with its foundation on the &quot;Bible&quot;″s &quot;Old&quot; and &quot;New Testaments&quot; and occasionally including the &quot;Apocrapha&quot;, along with the three historic creeds of faith in the Apostles&#x27;, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds, Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism, Luther&#x27;s Large Catechism, the Smalcald Articles and the Augsburg Confession of 1530, along with several other seminal documents in the &quot;Book of Concord: Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church&quot; published in 1580. All Evangelical Lutheran clergy (bishops, priests/pastors, deacons and other ministers) are required to read and assent to the Book of Concord. The church is a member of Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe, having signed the Leuenberg Agreement with other Lutheran and Reformed churches in 1973. It is also a member of the Porvoo Communion with 12 other churches, among them, the Anglican churches of Europe. It has also signed other ecumenical texts, including the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification with the Roman Catholic Church and the Joint Declaration of Pope Francis and Bishop Munib Younan in the city of Lund, Sweden, in 2016.

As of 2017 the church is legally independent of the government. According to the constitution it serves as the &quot;people&#x27;s church&quot; in the Kingdom of Norway. Until 1969, the church&#x27;s name for administrative purposes was simply the &quot;State Church&quot; or sometimes just &quot;the Church&quot;, whereas the constitution described it as the &quot;Evangelical-Lutheran Church&quot;. A constitutional amendment of 21 May 2012 designates the church as &quot;Norway&#x27;s people&#x27;s church&quot; (), with a new provision that is almost a verbatim copy of the provision for the Danish state church () in the Constitution of Denmark; the Minister of Church Affairs Trond Giske stressed that the reform meant that &quot;the state church is retained&quot;, On 27 May 2016 Stortinget (Parliament of Norway) approved a new legislative act to establish the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity rather than a branch of the civil service, and the law took effect on 1 January 2017. The church remains state funded.

== Organization ==


===State and church===
Until 1845 the Church of Norway was the only legal religious organization in Norway and it was not possible for a person to end membership in the Church of Norway. The Dissenter Act () was approved by the Storting on 16 July 1845 to allow the establishment of alternative religious (Christian) bodies. This act was replaced in 1969 by &quot;.&quot;

Until 2012, the constitutional head of the church was the King of Norway, who is still obliged to profess himself a Lutheran. After the constitutional amendment of 21 May 2012, the church is self-governed with regard to doctrinal issues and appointment of clergy.

The Church of Norway was subject to legislation, including its budgets, passed by the Storting, and its central administrative functions were carried out by the Royal Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs until 2017. Bishops and priests were civil servants also after the 2012 constitutional reform. Each parish has an autonomous administration. The state itself does not administer church buildings; buildings and adjacent land instead belong to the parish as an independent public institution. The Minister of Church Affairs, Trond Giske, was responsible for proposing the 2012 amendments, explaining that &quot;the state church is retained&quot;.

An act approved in 2016 created the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity, effective from 1 January 2017.

===Structure===
The church has an episcopal-synodal structure, with 1,284 parishes, 106 deaneries, 11 dioceses and, since 2 October 2011, one area under the supervision of the Preses. The dioceses are, according to the rank of the five historic sees and then according to age:

===Governing bodies===
The General Synod of the Church of Norway, which convenes once a year, is the highest representative body of the church. It consists of 85 representatives, of whom seven or eight are sent from each of the dioceses. Of these, four are lay members appointed by the congregations; one is a lay member appointed by church employees; one is a member appointed by the clergy; and the bishop. In addition, one representative from the Sami community in each of the three northernmost dioceses, representatives from the three theological seminaries, representatives from the youth council. Other members of the national council are also members of the general synod.

The national council, the executive body of the synod, is convened five times a year and comprises 15 members, of whom ten are lay members, four are clergy and one is the presiding bishop. It prepares matters for decision-making elsewhere and puts those decisions into effect. The council also has working and ad hoc groups, addressing issues such as church service, education and youth issues.

The Council on Ecumenical and International Relations deals with international and ecumenical matters, and the Sami Church Council is responsible for the Church of Norway&#x27;s work among the country&#x27;s indigenous Sami people.

The Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Church of Norway convenes three times a year, and consists of the twelve bishops in the church (the 11 diocesan bishops and the Preses). It issues opinions on various issues related to church life and theological matters.

The church also convenes committees and councils both at the national level (such as the Doctrinal Commission (), and at diocesan and local levels, addressing specific issues related to education, ecumenical matters, the Sami minority and youth.

There are 1,600 Church of Norway churches and chapels. Parish work is led by a priest and an elected parish council. There are more than 1,200 clergy (in 2007, 21% were women ministers) in the Church of Norway. The Church of Norway does not own church buildings, which are instead owned by the parish and maintained by the municipality.

== Worship ==
The focus of church life is the Sunday High Mass (høymesse) where the Eucharist is celebrated. The main service is most commonly celebrated at 11:00 a.m. The liturgy is similar to that in use in the Roman Catholic Church. The language is entirely Norwegian, apart from the Kyrie Eleison, and the singing of hymns accompanied by organ music is central. A priest (often with lay assistants) celebrates the service, wearing an alb and stole. In addition, a chasuble is worn by the priest during the Eucharist and, increasingly, during the whole service.

The Church of Norway baptises children, usually infants, and usually as part of ordinary Sunday services.

This is a summary of the liturgy for High Mass:
* Praeludium
* Opening Hymn
* Greeting
* Confession of Sin
* Kyrie
* Gloria (This may be omitted during Lent)
* Collect of the Day
(If there is a baptism it together with the Apostles&#x27; Creed may take place here or after the Sermon)
* First Lesson (Old Testament, an Epistle, the Acts of the Apostles or the Revelation to John)
* Hymn of Praise
* Second Lesson (An Epistle, the Acts of the Apostles, the Revelation to John or a Gospel)
* Apostles&#x27; Creed
* Hymn before the Sermon
* Sermon (concluding with the Gloria Patri)
* Hymn after the Sermon
* Church Prayer (i.e., Intercessions)
(If there is no Communion, i.e., the Eucharist, the service concludes with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, an optional Offering, the Blessing and a moment of silent prayer)
* Hymn before the Communion
* Threefold Dialogue and Proper Preface
* Sanctus
* Prayer before the Lord&#x27;s Supper,
* Lord&#x27;s Prayer
* Words of Institution
* Agnus Dei
* Reception of Communion
* Prayer of Thanksgiving after Communion
* Blessing
* Silent Prayer (as the church bell is toned nine – 3x3 – times)
* Postludium

== History ==
===Origin===
The Church of Norway traces its origins to the introduction of Christianity to Norway in the 9th century. Norway was Christianized as a result of missions from both the British Isles (by Haakon I of Norway and Olaf I of Norway), and from the Continent (by Ansgar). It took several hundred years to complete the Christianization, culminating on 29 July 1030 with the Battle of Stiklestad, when King Olaf II of Norway was killed. One year later, on 3 August 1031, he was canonised in Nidaros by Bishop Grimkell, and a few years later enshrined in Nidaros Cathedral. The cathedral with its shrine to St. Olav became the major Nordic place of pilgrimage until the Lutheran reformation in 1537. The whereabouts of Saint Olaf&#x27;s grave have been unknown since 1568.

Saint Olaf is traditionally regarded as being responsible for the final conversion of Norway to Christianity, and is still seen as Norway&#x27;s patron saint and &quot;eternal king&quot; (&quot;Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae&quot;). The Nordic churches were initially subordinate to the Archbishop of Bremen, until the Nordic Archdiocese of Lund was established in 1103. The separate Norwegian Archdiocese of Nidaros (in today&#x27;s Trondheim) was created in 1152, and by the end of the 12th century covered all of Norway, parts of present Sweden, Iceland, Greenland, the Isle of Man, the Orkney Islands, the Shetland Islands, the Faroe Islands and the Hebrides.
Another site of medieval pilgrimage in Norway was the island of Selja on the northwest coast, with its memories of Saint Sunniva and its three monastery churches with Celtic influence, similar to Skellig Michael.

===Reformation===
The Reformation in Norway was accomplished by force in 1537 when Christian III of Denmark and Norway declared Lutheranism as the official religion of Norway and Denmark, sending the Roman Catholic archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, into exile in Lier in the Netherlands (now in Belgium). Catholic priests were persecuted, monastic orders were suppressed, and the crown took over church property, while some churches were plundered and abandoned, even destroyed. Bishops (initially called superintendents) were appointed by the king. This brought forth tight integration between church and state. After the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660 all clerics were civil servants appointed by the king, but theological issues were left to the hierarchy of bishops and other clergy.

When Norway regained national independence from Denmark in 1814, the Norwegian Constitution recognized the Lutheran church as the state church.

The pietism movement in Norway (embodied to a great extent by the Haugean movement fostered by Hans Nielsen Hauge) has served to reduce the distance between laity and clergy in Norway. In 1842, lay congregational meetings were accepted in church life, though initially with limited influence. In following years, a number of large Christian organizations were created; they still serve as a &quot;second line&quot; in Church structure. The most notable of these are the Norwegian Missionary Society and the Norwegian Lutheran Mission.

During World War II, after Vidkun Quisling became Minister President of Norway and introduced a number of controversial measures such as state-controlled education, the church&#x27;s bishops and the vast majority of the clergy disassociated themselves from the government in the &quot;Foundations of the Church&quot; () declaration of Easter 1942, stating that they would function only as pastors for their congregations, not as civil servants. The bishops were interned with deposed clergy and theological candidates from 1943, but congregational life continued more or less as usual. For three years the Church of Norway was a church free of the State.

Since World War II, a number of structural changes have taken place within the Church of Norway, mostly to institutionalize lay participation in the life of the church.

== Current issues ==

Norwegians are registered at baptism as members of the Church of Norway, and many remain members, using services such as baptism, confirmation, marriage and burial, rites which still have cultural standing in Norway.

68.7% of Norwegians were members of the state Church of Norway as of the end of 2019, a 1.2% drop compared to the year before and down about 11% from ten years earlier. However, only 20% of Norwegians say that religion occupies an important place in their life (according to a recent Gallup poll), making Norway one of the most secular countries of the world (only in Estonia, Sweden and Denmark were the percentages of people who considered religion to be important lower), and only about 3% of the population attends church services or other religious meetings more than once a month. Baptism of infants fell from 96.8% in 1960 to 51.4% in 2019, while the proportion of confirmands fell from 93% in 1960 to 54.4% in 2019. The proportion of weddings to be celebrated in the Church of Norway fell from 85.2% in 1960 to 31.3% in 2019. In 2019 85.5% of all funerals took place in the Church of Norway. A survey conducted by Gallup International in 65 countries in 2005 found that Norway was the least religious among the Western countries surveyed, with only 36% of the population considering themselves religious, 9% considering themselves atheist, and 46% considering themselves &quot;neither religious nor atheist&quot;.

By law, all children with at least one parent-member become members of the church. This has been controversial, because many become members without knowing, and this favours the Church of Norway over other churches. This law remained unchanged even after the separation of church and state in 2012.

In 2000, the Church of Norway appointed the first openly partnered gay priest. In 2007, a majority in the general synod voted in favour of accepting people living in same-sex relations into the priesthood. In 2008, the Norwegian Parliament voted to establish same-sex civil marriages, and the bishops allowed prayers for same-sex couples. Traditionalist clergy and laity from the Church of Norway established the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Norway, a nonterritorial ecclesiastical province that only ordains men to holy orders and does not perform same-sex marriages in 2013. The Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Norway is a member of the International Lutheran Council, which represents Confessional Lutheran bodies around the globe. In 2014, a proposed liturgy for same-sex marriages was rejected by the general synod. This question created much unrest in the Church of Norway. In 2015, the Church of Norway voted to allow same-sex marriages. The decision was ratified on 11 April 2016. The first same-sex marriage ceremony in the church occurred on 1 February 2017 just after midnight.

== Legal status ==

On 21 May 2012, the Norwegian Parliament passed a constitutional amendment for the second time (such amendments must be passed twice in separate parliaments to come into effect) that granted the Church of Norway increased autonomy, and states that &quot;the Church of Norway, an Evangelical-Lutheran church, remains Norway&#x27;s people&#x27;s church, and is supported by the State as such&quot; (&#x27;people&#x27;s church&#x27; or &quot;folkekirke&quot; is also the name of the Danish state church, ), replacing the earlier expression which stated that &quot;the Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State.&quot; The constitution also says that Norway&#x27;s values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage, and according to the Constitution, the king is required to be Lutheran. The government still provides funding for the church as it does with other faith-based institutions, but the responsibility for appointing bishops and provosts now rests with the church instead of the government. Prior to 1997, the appointments of parish priests and residing chaplains was also the responsibility of the government, but the church was granted the right to hire such clergy directly with the new Church Law of 1997. The 2012 amendment implies that the church&#x27;s own governing bodies, rather than the Council of State, appoints bishops. The government and the parliament no longer have an oversight function with regard to day-to-day doctrinal issues, although the Constitution states that the church is to be Evangelical-Lutheran.

After the changes in 1997 and 2012, until the change in 2017, all clergy remained civil servants (state employees), and the central and regional church administrations remained a part of the state administration. The Church of Norway is regulated by its own law () and all municipalities are required by law to support the activities of the Church of Norway and municipal authorities are represented in its local bodies. The amendment was a result of a compromise from 2008. Minister of Church Affairs Trond Giske then emphasized that the Church of Norway remains Norway&#x27;s state church, stating that &quot;the state church is retained. Neither the Labour Party nor the Centre Party had a mandate to agree to separate church and state.&quot; Of the government parties, the Labour Party and the Centre Party supported a continued state church, while only the Socialist Left Party preferred a separation of church and state, although all parties eventually voted for the 2008 compromise.

The final amendment passed by a vote of 162–3. The three dissenting votes, Lundteigen, Ramsøy, and Toppe, were all from the Centre Party.

Though still supported by the state of Norway, the church ceased to be the official state religion on 1 January 2017 and its approximately 1250 active clergy therefore simultaneously ceased to be employed by the Norwegian government.

<text>The Darien scheme was an unsuccessful attempt, backed largely by investors of the Kingdom of Scotland, to gain wealth and influence by establishing New Caledonia, a colony in the Darién Gap on the Isthmus of Panama, in the late 1690s. The plan was for the colony, located on the Gulf of Darién, to establish and manage an overland route to connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The backers knew that the first sighting of the Pacific Ocean by Vasco Núñez de Balboa was after crossing the isthmus through Darién. The expedition also claimed sovereignty over &quot;Crab Isle&quot; (modern day Vieques, Puerto Rico) in 1698, yet sovereignty was short-lived. The attempt at settling the area did not go well; more than 80 percent of participants died within a year, and the settlement was abandoned twice.

There are many explanations for the disaster. Rival claims have been made suggesting that the undertaking was beset by poor planning and provisioning; divided leadership; a lack of trade with local indigenous tribes or neighbouring Dutch and English colonies; epidemics of tropical disease; widespread opposition to the scheme from commercial interests in England; and a failure to anticipate a military response from the Spanish Empire. It was finally abandoned in March 1700 after a siege by Spanish forces, which also blockaded the harbour.

As the Company of Scotland was backed by approximately 20 per cent of all the money circulating in Scotland, its failure left the entire Scottish Lowlands in financial ruin. This was an important factor in weakening resistance to the Act of Union (completed in 1707).

The land where the Darien colony was built is located in the modern territory of Guna Yala, an autonomous indigenous territory home to the Guna people.

==Origins==
The late 17th century was a difficult period for Scotland, as it was for much of Europe; the years 1695-97 saw catastrophic famine in present-day Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden, plus an estimated two million deaths in France and Northern Italy. The 1690s were Scotland&#x27;s coldest decade in the past 750 years as documented in tree ring records.

Scotland&#x27;s economy was relatively small, its range of exports was limited, and it was in a weak position in relation to England, its powerful neighbour (with which it was in personal but not yet political union). In an era of economic rivalry in Europe, Scotland was incapable of protecting itself from the effects of English competition and legislation. The kingdom had no reciprocal export trade and its once-thriving industries such as shipbuilding were in deep decline; goods that were in demand had to be bought from England for sterling. Moreover, the Navigation Acts further increased economic dependence on England by limiting Scotland&#x27;s shipping, and the Royal Scots Navy was relatively small. Though the unusual cold affected much of the Northern Hemisphere, Scotland suffered disproportionately and lost 10-15% of its entire population, possibly due to its political isolation. A series of domestic conflicts, including the 1639–51 Wars of the Three Kingdoms and unrest related to religious differences between 1670-1690 exhausted the people and diminished their resources. The so-called &quot;seven ill years&quot; of the 1690s saw widespread crop failures and famine, while Scotland&#x27;s deteriorating economic position led to calls for a political or customs union with England. However, the stronger feeling among Scots was that the country should become a great mercantile and colonial power like England.

In response, several solutions were enacted by the Parliament of Scotland: in 1695 the Bank of Scotland was established; the Act for the Settling of Schools created a parish-based system of public education throughout Scotland; and the Company of Scotland was chartered with capital to be raised by public subscription to trade with &quot;Africa and the Indies&quot;.

In the face of opposition by English commercial interests, the Company of Scotland raised subscriptions in Amsterdam, Hamburg and London for the scheme. For his part, King William II of Scotland and III of England had given only lukewarm support to the whole Scottish colonial endeavour. England was at war with France and hence did not want to offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of New Granada.

One reason for English opposition to the Scheme was the then prevalent economic theory of mercantilism, a concept as widespread and accepted then as capitalism is today. Modern economics generally assumes a constantly growing market but mercantilism viewed it as static; that meant increasing one&#x27;s market share required taking it from someone else. This meant the Darien Scheme was not simply competition but an active threat to English merchants.

England was also under pressure from the London-based East India Company (EIC), who were keen to maintain their monopoly over English foreign trade. It therefore forced the English and Dutch investors to withdraw. Next, the EIC threatened legal action on the grounds that the Scots had no authority from the king to raise funds outside the English realm, and obliged the promoters to refund subscriptions to the Hamburg investors. This left no source of finance but Scotland itself. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company of Scotland for Trading to Africa raised £400,000 sterling in a few weeks (equivalent to roughly £ today), with investments from every level of society, and totalling about a fifth of the wealth of Scotland. It was, for Scotland, a massive amount of capital.

Scottish-born trader and financier William Paterson had long promoted a plan for a colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Essentially the intention was to tame, occupy and administer the land of the Darién Gap, later known to be virtually untraversable. The colony was to be situated on a gateway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans permitting trade between them – the same principle which, much later, led to the construction of the Panama Railroad, and then the Panama Canal. Paterson was instrumental in getting the company off the ground in London. He had failed to interest several European countries in his project but, in the aftermath of the English reaction to the company, he was able to get a hearing for his ideas. The Duke of Hamilton, a major supporter of the scheme, planned to import slaves &quot;to be worked to death&quot; at local gold mines in the region after a Scottish colony had been established in Panama.

The Scots&#x27; original aim of emulating the East India Company by breaking into the lucrative trading areas of the Indies and Africa was forgotten, and the highly ambitious Darien scheme was adopted by the company. Paterson later fell from grace when a subordinate embezzled funds from the company, took back Paterson&#x27;s stock and expelled him from the Court of Directors; he was to have little real influence on events after this point. Historian Stephen Mullen referred to the scheme as a &quot;mercantilist venture designed to improve personal fortunes and Scotland’s balance of trade through colonisation and exploitation&quot;.

==First expedition (1698)==
Many former officers and soldiers, who had little hope of other employment, eagerly joined the Darien project. Many of them were acquainted from serving in the army and several – Thomas Drummond, for example – were notorious for their involvement in the Massacre of Glencoe. In some eyes they appeared to be a clique, and this was to cause much suspicion among other members of the expedition. The first Council (appointed in July 1698), which was to govern the colony until a parliament was established, consisted of Major James Cunningham of Eickett, Daniel Mackay, James Montgomerie, William Vetch, Robert Jolly, Robert Pinkerton and Captain Robert Pennecuik (commodore of the expedition fleet).

The first expedition of five ships (&quot;Saint Andrew&quot;, &quot;Caledonia&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Dolphin&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot;) set sail from the east coast port of Leith to avoid observation by English warships in July 1698, with around 1200 people on board. The journey around Scotland for those kept below deck was so traumatic that some colonists thought it comparable to the worst parts of the whole Darien experience. Their orders were &quot;to proceed to the Bay of Darien, and make the Isle called the Golden Island ... some few leagues to the leeward of the mouth of the great River of Darien ... and there make a settlement on the mainland&quot;. The fleet called at Madeira and the West Indies, and took possession of Crab Isle which would be taken over by the Danish after the failure of the colony. Employing ex-buccaneer Robert Allison as a pilot, the fleet made landfall off the coast of Darien on 2 November.

The settlers christened their new home &quot;Caledonia&quot; declaring &quot;we do here settle and in the name of God establish ourselves; and in honour and for the memory of that most ancient and renowned name of our Mother Country, we do, and will from henceforward call this country by the name of Caledonia; and ourselves, successors, and associates, by the name of Caledonians&quot;. With Drummond in charge, they dug a ditch through the neck of land that divided one side of the harbour in Caledonia Bay from the ocean, and constructed Fort St Andrew, which was equipped with fifty cannons, but no source of fresh water. This ditch is the only identifiable remnant of Caledonia. A watchhouse on a mountain completed the fortifications. Although the harbour appeared to be a natural one, it later proved to have tides that could easily wreck a vessel trying to leave. The colony was a potential threat to the Spanish Empire by being located near routes used for silver shipments. The feasibility of the scheme, especially for a country of Scotland&#x27;s limited resources, has often been considered doubtful, although some modern authorities consider that it might have possessed good prospects of success if it had been given the support of England.

The chosen site was only 80 km by beeline from the Pacific Ocean, although until today the terrain was unsuitable for transportation.

===New Edinburgh===
Close to the fort, the settlers began erecting the huts of the main settlement, New Edinburgh (until 2011 known as Puerto Escocés (&quot;Scottish Harbour&quot;), now Puerto Inabaginya, in Guna Yala Province, Panama), and clearing land to plant yams and maize. Letters sent home by the expedition created a misleading impression that everything was going according to plan. This seems to have been by agreement, as certain optimistic phrases kept recurring. However, it meant the Scottish public would be completely unprepared for the coming disaster.

Agriculture proved difficult and the natives, though hostile to Spain, were unwilling to trade for the combs and other trinkets offered by the colonists. Most serious was the near-total failure to sell any goods to the few passing traders who put into the bay. With the onset of summer the following year, malaria and fever led to many deaths. Eventually, the mortality rate rose to ten settlers a day. Natives brought gifts of fruit and plantains, but these were appropriated by the leaders and sailors, who mostly remained on board ships. The only luck the settlers had was in giant turtle hunting, but fewer and fewer men were fit enough for such strenuous work. The situation was exacerbated by the lack of food, mainly due to a high rate of spoilage caused by improper stowing. At the same time, King William instructed the Dutch and English colonies in America not to supply the Scots&#x27; settlement, so as not to incur the wrath of the Spanish Empire. The only reward the council had to give was alcohol, and drunkenness became common, even though it sped the deaths of men already weakened by dysentery, fever and the rotting, worm-infested food.

After just eight months, the colony was abandoned in July 1699, except for six men who were too weak to move. The deaths continued on the ships, and only 300 of the 1200 settlers survived. A desperate ship from the colony had called in at the Jamaican city of Port Royal, but it was refused assistance on the orders of the English government, who feared antagonising the Spanish. Those on the single ship that returned home found themselves regarded as a disgrace to their country, and were even disowned by their families. The &quot;Caledonia&quot;, with 250 survivors, including William Paterson and the Drummond brothers, made a desperate passage to New York, then just a small town of 5000, landing on 10 August. Four days later, &quot;Unicorn&quot; (commanded by Captain John Anderson) limped into New York harbour. In a letter to Hugh Montgomerie, a Glasgow merchant, Robert Drummond reported that sickness and mortality continued to afflict the remnant of the colonists. When the Scots were told that two ships, the &quot;Olive Branch&quot; and &quot;Hopeful Beginning&quot;, had already sailed to re-supply the now deserted colony, Thomas Drummond commissioned two sloops to aid their efforts in Darien.

==Re-supply (1699)==
In August 1699, the &quot;Olive Branch&quot; and &quot;Hopeful Beginning&quot; with 300 settlers arrived in Darien to find ruined huts and 400 overgrown graves. Expecting a bustling town, the ship&#x27;s captains debated their next move. When the &quot;Olive Branch&quot; was destroyed by an accidental fire, the survivors fled to Jamaica in the &quot;Hopeful Beginning&quot;, and landed in Port Royal harbour. The Scots were not allowed ashore, and illness struck the crowded ship.

On 20 September, Thomas E. Drummond set sail from New York in the sloop &quot;Ann of Caledonia&quot;, (formerly the &quot;Anne&quot;), picking up another fully supplied vessel (the &quot;Society&quot;) on the way. They arrived in Darien to find the burnt timbers of the &quot;Olive Branch&quot; rotting on the shore.

==Second expedition (1699)==
Word of the first expedition did not reach Scotland in time to prevent a second voyage of more than 1000 people.

After the perilous route round the north of Scotland taken by the previous ships, William Paterson wrote to the Directors; &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, .. be sure to send the next fleet from the Clyde, for the passage north about is worse than the whole voyage to the Indies.&quot; A new company flagship, &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;, boasting 38 cannon, was supported by &quot;The Duke of Hamilton&quot;, the &quot;Hope of Bo&#x27;ness&quot;, and a smaller vessel, the &quot;Hope&quot;.

The expedition had the blessing of the Church of Scotland who had appointed Alexander Shields as the senior of the four ministers (including Archibald Stobo and Francis Borland).

The second expedition arrived in Caledonia Bay on 30 November 1699 and found Thomas Drummond&#x27;s New York sloops already there. Some men were sent ashore to rebuild the huts, which caused others to complain that they had come to join a settlement, not build one.

Morale was low and little progress was made. Drummond insisted there could be no discussion, and the fort must be rebuilt as a Spanish attack would surely come soon.

Drummond clashed with the merchant James Byres, who maintained that the Counsellors of the first expedition had now lost that status and had Drummond arrested. Initially bellicose, Byres began to send away all those he suspected of being offensively minded – or of being allegiant to Drummond. He outraged a kirk minister by claiming it would be unlawful to resist the Spanish by force of arms, as all war was unchristian. Byres then deserted the colony in a sloop.

The colonists sank into apathy until the arrival of Alexander Campbell of Fonab, sent by the company to organise a defence. He provided the resolute leadership which had been lacking and took the initiative by driving the Spanish from their stockade at Toubacanti in January 1700. However, Fonab was wounded in the daring frontal attack and then became incapacitated with a fever.

The Spanish force – who were also suffering serious losses from fever – closed in on Fort St Andrew and besieged it for a month. Disease was still the main cause of death at this time. The Spanish commander Juan Pimienta called for the Scots to surrender and avoid a final assault, warning that if they did not, no quarter would be given.

After negotiations, the Scots were allowed to leave with their guns, and the colony was abandoned for the last time. Only a handful of those from the second expedition returned to Scotland. Of the total 2500 settlers that set off, just a few hundred survived.

==Reactions to the disaster==
The failure of the colonisation project provoked tremendous discontent throughout Lowland Scotland, where almost every family had been affected. Some held the English responsible, and others believed that they could and should assist in yet another effort at making the scheme work. The company petitioned the king to affirm their right to the colony. However, he declined, saying that although he was sorry the company had incurred such huge losses, reclaiming Darien would mean war with Spain. The continuing futile debate on the issue served to further increase bitter feelings. An estimated 15-40% of all the actual capital in Scotland was invested in this project.

Hoping to recoup some of its capital by a more conventional venture, the company sent two ships from the Clyde, the &quot;Speedy Return&quot; and the &quot;Continent&quot;, to the Guinea coast laden with trade goods. Sea captain Robert Drummond was the master of the &quot;Speedy Return&quot;; his brother Thomas, who had played such a large part in the second expedition, was supercargo on the vessel. Instead of trying to sell for gold as the company&#x27;s directors intended, however, the Drummond brothers had exchanged the goods for slaves, whom they sold in Madagascar. Carousing with the buccaneers for whom the island was a refuge, the Drummonds fell in with pirate John Bowen, who offered them loot if they would lend him their ships for a raid on homeward bound Indiamen.

Drummond backed out of the agreement, only to have Bowen appropriate the ships while Drummond was ashore. Bowen burnt the &quot;Continent&quot; on the Malabar coast when he decided she was of no use to him, and he later scuttled the &quot;Speedy Return&quot; after transferring her crew to a merchant ship that he had taken. The Drummonds apparently decided against returning to Scotland, where they would have had to explain the loss of the ships they had been entrusted with, and no more was ever heard of them.

The company sent out another ship, but she was lost at sea. Unable to afford the cost of fitting out yet another vessel, the company hired the &quot;Annandale&quot; in London to trade in the Spice Islands. However, the East India Company had the ship seized on the grounds that it was in contravention of their charter. That provoked an uproar in Scotland, greatly aided by the inflammatory rhetoric of the company&#x27;s secretary, Roderick MacKenzie, a relentless enemy of the English. Fury at the country&#x27;s impotence led to the scapegoating and hanging of three innocent English sailors.

In July 1704, Thomas Green, the 25-year-old master of the &quot;Worcester&quot;, an English merchant ship, arrived at Leith. Mackenzie convinced himself that the ship was an East India Company ship that should be seized in reprisal for the &quot;Annandale&quot;. He succeeded in getting legal authority and Green, who had been given the command at 21, watched as his ship&#x27;s cargo was impounded and the sails, guns and rudder were removed over the next three months.

In December, the crew was arrested for piracy. Although many in Scotland were delighted, it soon became clear to the directors of the Darien company that Mackenzie&#x27;s charges were not supported by any proof, and it seemed the men would be released. However, Mackenzie suddenly claimed to have ascertained from the crew of the &quot;Worcester&quot; that Green had drunkenly boasted of taking the &quot;Speedy Return&quot;, killing the Drummonds and burning the ship. Green and two of his crew, John Madden and James Simpson, were sent for trial in Edinburgh. Mackenzie produced several witnesses including members of Green&#x27;s crew; their statements contradicted one another and none of them could accurately describe the dates, locations, or descriptions of the supposed victims of the &quot;Worcester&quot;. The prosecution case, which was made in medieval Latin and legal Doric, was unintelligible to jury and accused alike. The defence advocates&#x27; objections were dismissed by court officials and they fled after the trial. Some jurors resisted bringing in a verdict of guilty, but the men were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging.

The Queen advised her 30 privy councillors in Edinburgh that the men should be pardoned, but the common people demanded for the sentence to be carried out. Nineteen councillors made excuses to stay away from the deliberations on a reprieve, fearing the wrath of a huge mob that had arrived in Edinburgh to demand the sailors be put to death. Even though they had affidavits from London by two of the crew of the &quot;Speedy Return&quot;, who testified that Green and his crew had no knowledge or involvement in the fate of the ship, the remaining councillors refused to pardon them.

Green, Madden and Simpson were subjected to derision and insults by the mob before they were hanged. Green had complete faith that as an innocent man, he would be reprieved, and he was still looking to the Edinburgh road for a messenger as the hangman placed the hood over his head. The remainder of Green&#x27;s crew were quietly pardoned and released.

==Consequences of failure==
The failure of the Darien colonisation project has been cited as one of the motivations for the 1707 Acts of Union. According to this argument, the Scottish establishment (landed aristocracy and mercantile elites) considered that their best chance of being part of a major power would be to share the benefits of England&#x27;s international trade and the growth of the English overseas possessions and so its future would have to lie in unity with England. Furthermore, Scotland&#x27;s nobles were almost bankrupted by the Darien fiasco.

Some Scottish nobility petitioned Westminster to wipe out the Scottish national debt and stabilise the currency. Although the first request was not met, the second was, and the Scottish shilling was given the fixed value of an English penny. Personal Scottish financial interests were also involved. Scottish commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien project and believed that they would receive compensation for their losses. The 1707 Acts of Union, Article 15, granted £398,085 10s sterling to Scotland to offset future liability towards the English national debt. That amount equates to about £100 million in 2020 money. This outcome was and remains controversial: see article

<text>Conwy Castle (; ) is a fortification in Conwy, located in North Wales. It was built by Edward I, during his conquest of Wales, between 1283 and 1287. Constructed as part of a wider project to create the walled town of Conwy, the combined defences cost around £15,000, a massive sum for the period. Over the next few centuries, the castle played an important part in several wars. It withstood the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn in the winter of 1294–95, acted as a temporary haven for Richard II in 1399 and was held for several months by forces loyal to Owain Glyndŵr in 1401.

Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies. In the aftermath, the castle was partially slighted by Parliament to prevent it being used in any further revolt, and was finally completely ruined in 1665 when its remaining iron and lead was stripped and sold off. Conwy Castle became an attractive destination for painters in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Visitor numbers grew and initial restoration work was carried out in the second half of the 19th century. In the 21st century, the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction.

UNESCO considers Conwy to be one of &quot;the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe&quot;, and it is classed as a World Heritage Site. The rectangular castle is built from local and imported stone and occupies a coastal ridge, originally overlooking an important crossing point over the River Conwy. Divided into an Inner and an Outer Ward, it is defended by eight large towers and two barbicans, with a postern gate leading down to the river, allowing the castle to be resupplied from the sea. It retains the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain and what historian Jeremy Ashbee has described as the &quot;best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales&quot;. In keeping with other Edwardian castles in North Wales, the architecture of Conwy has close links to that found in the Savoy during the same period, an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of the main architect, James of Saint George.

==History==

===13th century===
Before the English built the town of Conwy, Aberconwy Abbey, the site was occupied by a Cistercian monastery favoured by the Welsh princes, as well as the location of one of the palaces (called llys) of the Welsh princes. From Conwy: &quot;the oldest structure is part of the town walls, at the southern end of the east side. Here one wall and the tower of a llys [palace/court house] belonging to Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffydd have been incorporated into the wall. Built on a rocky outcrop, with an apsidal tower, it is a classic, native, Welsh build and stands out from the rest of the town walls, due to the presence of four window openings. It dates from the early 13th century and is the most complete remnant of any of his Llys.&quot;

The location also controlled an important crossing point over the River Conwy between the coastal and inland areas of North Wales, that Deganwy Castle for many years had defended. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s and the conflict had resumed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282.

Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward captured Aberconwy in March 1283 and decided that the location would form the centre of a new county: he would relocate the abbey eight miles up the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan, establishing Maenan Abbey, and build a new English castle and walled town on the monastery&#x27;s former site. The ruined castle of Deganwy was abandoned and never rebuilt. Edward&#x27;s plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on top of such a high-status native Welsh site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power.

Work began on cutting the ditch around Conwy Castle within days of Edward&#x27;s decision. The work was controlled by Sir John Bonvillars and overseen by master mason James of St. George, and the first phase of work between 1283 and 1284 focused on creating the exterior curtain walls and towers. In the second phase, from 1284 and 1286, the interior buildings were erected, while work began on the walls for the neighbouring town. By 1287, the castle was complete. The builders recruited huge numbers of labourers from across England for the task. At each summer building season, the labourers massed at Chester and then walked into Wales. Edward&#x27;s accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, but the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.

The castle&#x27;s constable was, by a royal charter of 1284, also the mayor of the new town of Conwy (to this day, the Mayor is ex-officio Constable of the Castle), and oversaw a castle garrison of 30 soldiers, including 15 crossbowmen, supported by a carpenter, chaplain, blacksmith, engineer and a stonemason. The first constable of the castle was Sir William de Cicon who had previously been the first constable of Rhuddlan Castle. In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule. Edward was besieged at Conwy by the Welsh between December and January 1295, supplied only by sea, before forces arrived to relieve him in February. Chronicler Walter of Guisborough suggested that given the austere conditions Edward refused to drink his own private supply of wine, and instead had it shared out amongst the garrison. For some years afterwards, the castle formed the main residence for visiting senior figures, and hosted Edward&#x27;s son, the future Edward II in 1301 when he visited the region to receive homage from the Welsh leaders.

===14th–15th centuries===
Conwy Castle was not well maintained during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took over control of the castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall and other parts of the castle. After the death of the Black Prince, however, Conwy fell into neglect again.

At the end of the 14th century, the castle was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12 August 1399, after returning from Ireland, Richard made his way to the castle where he met Bolingbroke&#x27;s emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.

Henry Bolingbroke took the English throne to rule as Henry IV in 1399, but rebellion broke out in North Wales shortly afterwards under the leadership of Owain Glyndŵr. In April 1401, on Good Friday, Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym, cousins of Owain Glyndŵr, undertook a surprise attack on Conwy Castle. Pretending to be carpenters repairing the castle, the two gained entry, killed the two watchmen on duty and took control of the fortress. Welsh rebels then attacked and captured the rest of the walled town. The brothers held out for around three months, before negotiating a surrender; as part of this agreement the pair were given a royal pardon by Henry.

During the War of the Roses between 1455 and 1485, fought by the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, Conwy was reinforced but played little part in the fighting. Henry VIII conducted restoration work in the 1520s and 1530s, during which time the castle was being used as a prison, a depot and as a potential residence for visitors.

===17th–21st centuries===
Conwy Castle fell into disrepair again by the early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward&#x27;s son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles&#x27; royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, took charge of the castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege. The Trevor family petitioned Mytton for the return of property in the castle that they had lent to the Archbishop.

In the aftermath of the siege, Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out. In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted, or put beyond military use: the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Conway was returned to Edward Conway, the Earl of Conway, but five years later Edward decided to strip the remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell it off. The work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway&#x27;s overseer William Milward, despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy, and turned the castle into a total ruin.

By the end of the 18th century, the ruins were considered picturesque and sublime, attracting visitors and artists, and paintings of the castle were made by Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Caesar Ibbetson, Paul Sandby and J. M. W. Turner. Several bridges were built across the River Conwy linking the town and Llandudno during the 19th century, including a road bridge in 1826 and a rail bridge in 1848. These improved communication links with the castle and further increased tourist numbers. In 1865 Conwy Castle passed from the Holland family, who had leased it from the descendants of the Conways to the civic leadership of Conwy town. Restoration work on the ruins then began, including the reconstruction of the damaged Bakehouse tower. In 1953 the castle was leased to the Ministry of Works and Arnold Taylor undertook a wide range of repairs and extensive research into the castle&#x27;s history. An additional road bridge was built to the castle in 1958. Already protected as a scheduled monument, in 1986 it was also declared part of the World Heritage Site of the &quot;Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd&quot;.

In the 21st century the castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction and 186,897 tourists visited the castle in 2010; a new visitor centre was opened in 2012. The castle requires ongoing maintenance and repairs cost £30,000 over the 2002–03 financial year.

Conwy Castle was twinned with Himeji Castle, Hyogo prefecture, Japan at a formal ceremony in Himeji on 29 October 2019.

In December 2023, Condé Nast voted the castle as the most stunning in Europe, beating the likes of Eilean Donan in Scotland, and Kylemore Abbey in Ireland.

==Architecture==
The castle hugs a rocky coastal ridge of grey sandstone and limestone, and much of the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared. The local stone was not of sufficient quality to be used for carving details such as windows, however, and accordingly sandstone was brought in from the Creuddyn peninsula, Chester and the Wirral. This sandstone was more colourful than the local grey stone, and was probably deliberately chosen for its appearance.

The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an Inner and Outer Ward, separated by a cross-wall, with four large, tall towers on each side; originally the castle would have been white-washed using a lime render. The outside of the towers still have the putlog holes from their original construction, where timbers were inserted to create a spiralling ramp for the builders. Although now somewhat decayed, the battlements originally sported triple finial designs and featured a sequence of square holes running along the outside of the walls. It is uncertain what these holes were used for – they may have been drainage holes, supports for defensive hoarding or for displaying ornamental shields.

The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. When first built, the barbican was reached over a drawbridge and a masonry ramp that came up sharply from the town below; the modern path cuts east along the outside of the walls. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain, and the gate would originally have been protected by a portcullis.

The gate leads through to the Outer Ward which, when first built, would have been full of various administrative and service buildings. The north-west tower was reached through the porter&#x27;s lodge and contained limited accommodation and space for stores. The south-west tower may have been used either by the castle&#x27;s constable, or by the castle&#x27;s garrison, and also contained a bakehouse. On the south side of the ward is a range of buildings that included the great hall and chapel, sitting on top of the cellars, which are now exposed. The stubs and one surviving stone arches from the 1340s can still be seen. Behind the great hall was the tower used by the constable for detaining prisoners; this included a special room for holding prisoners, called the &quot;dettors chambre&quot; (&quot;debtors&#x27; chamber&quot;) in the 16th century, and an underground dungeon. On the north side of the ward was a range of service buildings, including a kitchen, brewhouse and bakehouse, backed onto by the kitchen tower, containing accommodation and storerooms.

The Inner Ward was originally separated from the Outer Ward by an internal wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. The ditch was filled in during the 16th century and the drawbridge removed. The spring-fed castle well built alongside the gate survives, and today is deep. Inside, the ward contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and service facilities; today, historian Jeremy Ashbee considers them to be the &quot;best-preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales&quot;. They were designed to form a royal palace in miniature, that could, if necessary, be sealed off from the rest of the castle and supplied from the eastern gate by sea almost indefinitely, although in practice they were rarely used by the royal family.

The royal rooms were positioned on the first floor of a range of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally similar to that of the 13th century &quot;Gloriette&quot; at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.

On the east side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a lawn and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.

The architecture of Conwy has close to links to that found in the County of Savoy in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. Notably the three pinnacled merlons are a feature seen at the Savoyard Castello San Giorio di Susa which had been visited by Edward on his way back from crusade in 1273.

==Constable of the Castle==
The official roles of the Constable were - Governor of the castle, governor of the fortified borough, keeper of the castle gaol (prison), Mayor () and extraordinary duties.

During 1283 the castle was recorded to have a garrison of : 30 men (), 15 cross-bowmen (), 1 superintendent at arms (), 1 Chaplain (), 1 Stone mason (), 1 Carpenter (), 1 Artisan (), 10 residents (), William De Sikun was the constable with a yearly fee of £190 ().

<text>Tuxtla Gutiérrez, or Tuxtla, (, ) is the capital and the largest city of the Mexican southeastern state of Chiapas. It is the seat of the municipality of the same name, which the most developed and populous in the state. A busy government, commercial and services-oriented city, Tuxtla had one of the fastest-growing rates in Mexico over the last 40 years. Unlike many other areas in Chiapas, it is not a major tourist attraction, but a transportation hub for tourists coming into the state, with a large airport and a bus terminal.

==History==
The Zoques made the first pre-Hispanic settlement at the site. They named the valley area name &quot;Coyatoc&quot;, which means &#x27;land or house of rabbits&#x27;. The Aztecs intruded into the area between 1486 and 1505 and named it &quot;Tuchtlan&quot;, which means the same thing in their language.

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and the subjugation of the local Chiapan people in 1528, the Dominicans constructed a monastery in nearby Tecpatán. There is no official founding date for Tuxtla, but it is known that the Dominican monks gathered dispersed Zoques into communities organized around churches in the 16th century. A church dedicated to San Marcos (Saint Mark) was founded by the Dominicans for one of these communities in 1560. While Tuxtla is less discussed in regional history as compared to Comitán Domínguez and San Cristóbal, it boasts a large number of adobe houses, including Spanish colonial buildings in the downtown and western areas around the Señor del Cerrito Hermitage, from the 19th century within the downtown area and far southern and northern areas, and vestiges of Zoquean migration during the 19th century in the western and far southwestern areas. Tuxtla is home to around 800 adobe houses, many times much more than any officially declared historic site in Chiapas.

The existence of the town of San Marcos Tuxtla was first recorded in 1748, and by 1768 it became the seat of a mayoralty in Chiapas.

The village was officially recognized as a villa by King of Spain in 1813 with a population of about 5,000, three quarters of whom were Zoques. In 1821, the authorities of the villa proclaimed independence from both Spain and the regional colonial government of Guatemala, along with other areas in what would become Chiapas. However, this declaration was not accepted by either Guatemala or Mexico. Tuxtla, along with the state of Chiapas, became part of Mexico by popular vote on .

Tuxtla was officially renamed as Tuxtla Gutiérrez on by governor Fernando Nicolás Maldonado to honor Joaquín Miguel Gutiérrez, a former governor of Chiapas that promoted the state&#x27;s annexation to Mexico. The municipality was first incorporated as a on . It replaced San Cristóbal de las Casas as the capital of Chiapas on . The first library in the state was founded in Tuxtla in 1910.

During the Mexican Revolution, a battalion called &quot;The Sons of Tuxtla&quot; was formed in 1911, and its member Captain Julio Miramontes was assassinated in 1912. Troops supporting Venustiano Carranza took over in 1914, led by Agustín Castro. Chiapas was reorganized into the municipality system in 1915, with Tuxtla Gutiérrez becoming the head of a municipality and Noé Vázquez the first municipal president. The city remained the state capital. The reaction against Carranza&#x27;s policies was headed by the Mapaches (&quot;Raccoons&quot;), a group of landholders in the state who objected to the loss of their privileges and the redistribution of their lands. They burned the state government building, destroying its archives in 1915. General Salvador Alvarado and 2500 troops fought the Mapaches commanded by General . Catholic churches were closed and images of saints were burned in the city in 1934.

In 1941, the municipal government moved from the old building on El Triunfo Street in the Santo Domingo neighborhood to the corner of Avenida Central and Calle 2ª Poniente on lands that belonged to the city&#x27;s first municipal president. A new municipal palace was built there in the Neoclassical style. However, the municipal palace was moved again to its current location in 1982, and the Neoclassical building was given to the .

The Diocese of Tuxtla was created in 1965, which elevated the parish of San Marcos (Saint Mark) to a cathedral. It was subsequently elevated to an archdiocese in 2010. The city experienced high rates of population growth from the 1970s, resulting in the annexation of the municipality of Terán in 1973. The first was held in 1980, and Pope John Paul II visited the city in 1990.

During the 1990s, some areas of the state of Chiapas were affected by the EZLN or Zapatista uprising. While most of this group&#x27;s activity was in rural areas of the state, Tuxtla was also affected by it. As many as 10,000 Zapatista sympathizers protested in the city in 1998 to push federal officials to honor the 1994 San Andrés Accords and to push for new gubernatorial elections and other demands. The political instability pushed many indigenous into the municipality from more rural areas in the latter half of the decade. In 1998, PRD politician, EZLN activist and leader of the Ruiz Gamboa was assassinated in the city. It is thought the act was in response to Ruiz Gamboa&#x27;s work in land redistribution in the state&#x27;s region.

In the 1990s, Mexicana Airlines stopped service to Tuxtla, and a major crash killing nineteen people led to protests and the reinstatement of service to the city by Mexicana in 2000. In 2011, the government of Guatemala announced that it would open a consulate in the city to support its nationals who cross through Mexican territory or reside there. The government noted the problems that many Guatemalans, especially those who enter Mexico illegally, have had in the country. A tractor trailer with 219 illegal immigrants was stopped in the municipality in early 2011. Most were Guatemalan and almost all from Central America, but there were also people from Sri Lanka and Nepal. The migrants were detected by using portable X-ray on the passing truck.

==The city==
Tuxtla is the largest and most developed city in the state of Chiapas, and has an accelerated population growth rate. It is clean and mainly business oriented. The city has wide busy avenues, filled with cars, taxis, and buses. Shopping ranges from modern commercial plazas and malls to popular markets and open air tianguis.

In 2011, the city was the first in Mexico to be certified as a &quot;safe city&quot; by the federal government and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm due to its very low crime rate, crime prevention programs and other factors. According to the Financial Times and FDi magazine, Tuxtla is one of a number of cities worldwide considered to be &quot;cities of the future.&quot; It was evaluated based on its economic potential, human resources, cost-benefit ratio, quality of life, infrastructure and business environment.

The city is centered on a large square called the Plaza Cívica, which is surrounded by government buildings such as the municipal and state government offices (called &quot;palaces&quot;) . On one side of this plaza is the city&#x27;s most important landmark, the Catedral de San Marcos (Saint Mark&#x27;s Cathedral), named after the patron saint of the city, Mark the Evangelist . The church was founded in the second half of the 16th century, as a Dominican parish and has had significant changes to the structure since it was built. Its apse is the only one conserved in Chiapas from the colonial era, on which remnants of frescos can be seen. The current interior is Neoclassical. It has a single nave with a Latin cross layout with two side chapels. Its current façade and tower is modeled somewhat along colonial lines, with Doric columns. The structure&#x27;s current appearance, mostly in plain white, is a result of its last remodeling which was done in the 1980s. The best known feature of this church is the forty eight bells that ring out each hour, accompanied by a &quot;parade&quot; of statues of the Apostles that appear on the bell tower.

The city has a number of notable parks and other green spaces. Madero Park is located on Avenue where it crosses about six blocks from the . It is a green area which is cut by a street called . Along this corridor, there are various museums and cultural centers which include the Dr. Faustino Miranda Botanical Garden, which occupies four hectares along the Sabinal River. Across from the garden is the botanical museum which has a large exhibition of the various wood trees of the state. There is also a natural history museum with a number of preserved species of animals and plants as well as artifacts and maps of the historical indigenous peoples of the state. (Marimba Park) is located is eight blocks from the First Square on Central West Avenue ( in Spanish) and Octave North West Street () and named after the most characteristic musical instrument of the state. The park was established in 1993 to be a meeting place for families with numerous trees, colonial style benches, lighting at night and a central kiosk. Here, marimba bands play, which often attracts older couples who come to dance. It also hosts larger musical and other events, usually related to the marimba.
On the edge of the city is the El Zapotal Ecological Reserve, best known as the home of the Zoológico Miguel Alvarez del Toro Zoo, often referred to as the ZooMAT. The zoo covers 100 hectares and was founded by Miguel Alvarez del Toro in 1942. He was also the director for over fifty years. ZooMAT is considered to be one of the best zoos of its kind in Latin America. It exhibits, studies, protects and preserves the native species of Chiapas, which have suffered severe stress due to human activities. The zoo has programs for research, environmental education and wildlife conservation. The zoo is especially known for its work in preserving the quetzal, being the first to breed the bird in captivity in the 1970s. The design of the zoo respects the topography of the zone and only exhibits regional wildlife. It contains 1,400 animals from 220 species including jaguars, tapirs, macaws, spider monkeys, howler monkeys and quetzals. Over 150 of the species freely roam in natural enclosures and in some areas, animals such as deer, iguanas, small reptiles and birds come very close to the areas where humans pass. Sixty of the species exhibited here are in danger of extinction, including the jaguar, the ocelot, the macaw, the quetzal, and howler monkey.
The largest museum in the city is the Museo Regional de Antropología e Historia (Regional Museum of Anthropology and History), which one of the most important of its kind in Mexico. The building was constructed in modern style between 1979 and 1982, designed by architect Juan Miramontes Nájera. This design received first prize at the Third Biennial Architecture Contest in Bulgaria in 1985. Its permanent collection covers the history of the state and is divided into two halls: one for archeology and the other for history starting from the Spanish conquest. Next to it, there is the which was inaugurated in 2002 and is the only museum of its type in the state. It contains exhibits of over 200 fossils, all from Chiapas, with range in age from 300 million to 10,000 years old. The main hall is centered on a reconstruction of a Megatherium. There is also a display dedicated to the amber of the state with pieces containing insects and spiders.

The Chiapas Museum of Science and Technology is an interactive museum for children and adults demonstrating advances in modern times in three halls: Earth and Universe, Life and Humans, and Communications and Tools.

The is a large traditional market southeast of the center of the city near the zoo. It offers fresh flowers, meat, seafood, clothes, household goods and more. It has an outdoor café under a big red tent, and serves its dishes prepared from the items available in the market. These include shrimp dishes, chicken, fried whole fish, carne asada (grilled beef) and tacos. The (Institute of Handcrafts and Products of Chiapas), also called the , opened in 1980, is a large purple building on the main boulevard of the city, run by the government to promote the state&#x27;s traditional products. These include the best of Chiapas handcrafts including textiles, clothing, toys, ceramics and wood sculptures as well as genuine amber jewelry. It also contains an Ethnographic Museum which shows scenes representing the lifestyles of the various indigenous groups of Chiapas with dioramas of rural villages and how crafts are made. There are also mannequins displaying indigenous dress. It also sells coffee and regional candies from the state. In his time, was a great museum that stored the largest collection of photos, crafts and recreations of life of native villages in the depths of the state, but was almost entirely consumed by fire in 2001.

The of the city is located at . Two other important churches are the Santo Domingo Parish and the Santo Niño de Atocha Temple.

The city is the local government authority for eighty three other communities which cover a territory of 334.90 km2. It borders the municipalities of San Fernando, Osumacinta, Chiapa de Corzo, Suchiapa, Ocozocoautla and Berriozábal.

==Metropolitan area==

According to Mexico&#x27;s National Council on Population (CONAPO), the metropolitan area of Tuxtla Gutiérrez is formed by five municipalities, two core and three peripheral. It is anchored by the contiguous urban area of the cities of Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Chiapa de Corzo. Berriozábal was added in 2010, and San Fernando and Suchiapa in 2015.

The zone spans through two economic regions of Chiapas (Metropolitan and Mezcalapa) and three federal electoral districts (Chiapas IV, VI and IX).

With a population of 848,274 in 2020, it is the 25th most populated area in the country. Gross domestic product is , 0.5% of the national GDP, and its economy has a low level of competitiveness.

==Demographics==

According to the 2020 Census, the municipality had a total population of 604,147. The city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, with 578,830 residents, is the 31st most populated city in the country. The municipality had 125 localities, the largest of which were Copoya (9,868) and El Jobo (5,798), classified as urban.

Over half of the population of the Central Valley region of Chiapas lives in the city. Most are young, with 66% under the age of thirty and the average age of twenty three. The rate of population growth is about four percent, with the population expected to double in less than twenty years. 99.56% of the municipality&#x27;s population lives in three urban areas with the rest scattered among 81 other rural communities. The population density is 1,053/km2 well above the regional average of 75/km2 and state 52/km2. The average woman has 2.27 children, below the regional average of 2.87 and the state average of 3.47. There is some immigration into the city, mostly from Veracruz, State of Mexico and Mexico City.

The population growth of the municipality has exceeded that of the state for the last five decades. From 1990 to 2000, the municipality has a growth rate of 3.95%, almost double the state average. However, the greatest rate of growth was between 1970 and 1980 when it was 8.6%. This population growth has led to high demands for lands, housing, infrastructure and services, with many not able to keep up, especially in low income areas, which is about 40% of the city. There are an estimated 15,000 cases of illegally tapping into the city&#x27;s water distribution system, with an estimated loss of millions of pesos. This is done by industries, small business and homes. The evasion of payment has made it difficult for the city to finance expansion of the system into new neighborhoods.

Just under eighty percent are Catholic with just over thirteen percent belonging to Protestant or other Christian groups.

Most of the population is mestizo with a significant population of ethnic Zoques. Although about 25% of the state&#x27;s population speaks an indigenous language, the percentage is much lower in the municipality of Tuxtla. As of 2005, there were 8,256 people who spoke an indigenous language out of a total population of 434,143. The percentage of indigenous language speakers rose somewhat from 1995 to 2000 as many rural people moved into the area as a consequence of the Zapatista rebellion. This has added languages such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Zapotec and Ch&#x27;ol to the native Zoque.

==Culture and gastronomy==

The two most important local celebrations are Saint Mark&#x27;s Day and the Feria Chiapas. The (Saint Mark&#x27;s Fair) occurs each April in the center of the city, honoring the patron saint of Mark the Evangelist. It includes offerings, fireworks in frames called (castles), and pilgrimages for four days starting on the 25th. The Feria Chiapas includes bullfights, horse racing, cockfights and exhibitions of the many products of the state, including crafts, manufactured goods and agricultural products. It is held on the next to last Sunday of November through the first Sunday of December.

The Zoque Carnival reflects the area&#x27;s Zoque heritage. It includes a ritual called the &quot;Virgin Mary&#x27;s Descent&quot; in Copoya: on January 30, local statues of the Virgin Mary are carried by foot from the Copoya church down to the Valley of Tuxtla. After staying in the city for two months, the statues are carried back up to the Copoya plateau.

Other important religious festivities in the municipality include San Roque, San Jacinto, San Pascualito, San Francisco, Santo Domingo and the Virgin of Guadalupe.

Much of the cuisine of the municipality reflects that of the rest of the state and includes (a sweet corn tamale), (beef with chickpeas and cabbage), (pork with mole sauce), (bread with broth and vegetables), (pork in adobo sauce), (lamb innards with rice), a legume called , and traditional Chiapas tamales made with chipilín. Local drinks include &quot;pozol&quot;, &quot;taxcalate&quot;, and .

Other local specialties include , an edible ant that comes out at night during the rainy season, rich in proteins; , grilled meat platters; and , spicy ground meat cooked in lime juice with onions, tomatoes and cilantro, usually eaten in tostadas.

==Climate==
Tuxtla features a tropical wet and dry climate under the Köppen climate classification. With its relatively low altitude, the area has a hot and relatively humid climate with most rain falling in the summer. Except for a rainy and dry season (summer-fall and winter-spring respectively) there is little variation in the climate during the year. Even the distinction between the rainy and dry season is one of quantity of rain. Air conditioning is rare as most homes and offices use fans and most rooms and offices open into streets or courtyards. Most businesses close in the late afternoon from between 2:00 until 4:30 or 5:00 when it can get hot. Although it is not on the coast, it is close enough that hurricanes and tropical storms can affect it at time. In 2003, Tropical Storm Larry caused flooding in the city, forcing the evacuation of 7,000 people.

==Environment==

The city has an altitude of 600 meters above sea level and sits in the long narrow Tuxtla Valley, which is part of the larger Central Valley region of the state. On the north and south sides of the municipality, the land rises into mountainous terrain as one heads out of the valley.

There are three main rivers in the municipality, the Grijalva or Grande de Chiapa, the Suchiapa and the Sabinal. The last is severely polluted.

The natural vegetation of the area is lowland rainforest; however much has been cut down by logging and clearing for farmland and pasture. Most of the municipality&#x27;s forest and wildlife is found in a number of reserves including the Centro Ecological Recreativo El Zapotal, the Cerro Mactumatzá State Reserve, the Vedada Villa Allende Protected Forest Zone, and the Sumidero Canyon National Park. The largest of these is Sumidero Canyon, established in 1980, which spreads out over 21,789.41 hectares in three other municipalities besides Tuxtla.

El Zapotal was created in 1990 and extends over 192.57 hectares completely within the municipality. It contains lowland rainforest, subtropical forest and some highland rainforest. All of these contain deciduous and perennial species. Cerro Mactumatzá was established in 1997 and with an area of 613.70 hectares within the municipality. It contains oak, holm oak and tropical forests and with some areas still containing old growth. Because of the rapid growth of the city, these green areas are under pressure. In 2011, over 200 illegal squatters were evicted from an area called , inside an ecological reserve in the municipality. This settlement covered an area of ten hectares.

==Education==
According to the 2010 Census, the rate of illiteracy was 5.4%, down from 7.66% in 2000 and 10.68% in 1990. This is lower than the state average of 17.8%. Of those over the age of fifteen, just under fourteen percent have not finished primary school, just over fifteen percent have only completed primary school and the rest have gone beyond this level.

==Economy==

The municipality is the only one in the state with a very low rate of economic marginalization. As of 2005, there were 121,312 residences, with 111,567 owned by their occupants. On average, there are 4.25 occupants per household, slightly lower than the regional and state averages of 4.52 and 4.85. Most homes have some kind of flooring, with less than ten percent having packed earth. Over 84% of homes have block sides. Over 70% have concrete slab roofs, with less than 15% having asbestos roofs. Over 98% have electricity, over 78% have running water, and about 94% have sewerage service.

Over 75% of the city&#x27;s population is employed in commerce and services, which includes government. This is above the regional level of 53.36% and state level of 37.31%. Government at the state, federal and local levels has been one of the main sources of employment in the city since the 1970s. Although the city has 68 hotels with 2,874 rooms, it is not a major tourist attraction. Most visitors to the city are there on business or Mexican nationals. However, it is a main transportation hub for those going to other parts of the state, with its first class bus station and new airport. Tourism during Holy Week adds over 150 million pesos to the state&#x27;s economy, much of which passes through the city, with occupancy rates that rise fifty percent. Most foreign visitors through the city are young, especially from European countries such as France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and England, who pass through the bus station. However, most of them do not explore the city itself, because tour guides often state there is nothing here to see.

Just over 19% of the population is dedicated to industry, manufacturing, construction and transportation. Just over two percent of the municipality&#x27;s population is dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry compared to 26.14 of the region and 47.25% of the state. Economic activities include commerce and the agricultural production of corn, beans, fruit, dairy cattle and domestic fowl.

The most affluent parts of the city are usually located to the west, along with shopping centers and suburban neighborhoods. Downtown is mostly a business location, while the poorest areas are spread throughout the north and east.

==Transportation==

The city is a transportation hub for the whole short infrastructured state of Chiapas. Tuxtla is connected by road, bus and air to the rest of the country and Central America; there is no railroad access.

===Roads===

The municipality has 54.25 km of highways, over half are rural roads (28.75 km). The Panamerican Highway is the main access way, crossing the city as Federal Highway 190 from west to east; the stretch from Ocozocoautla to Chiapa de Corzo has been upgraded to a 4-lane highway. A new bypass to the south of the city (Nuevo Libramiento Sur) was completed in 2018 to alleviate the heavy traffic.

A-road, two-lane toll motorways connect the Tuxtla area with San Cristóbal (45 minutes), Arriaga (1 hour) and Minatitlán (2.5 hours). Other paved state highways link the city with Suchiapa/Villaflores (Hwy 133), the airport/La Angostura (Hwy 157) to the south, and San Fernando/Chicoasén (Hwy 102) to the north.

===Buses===
A new First Class bus station was opened in the northwest of the city, serving many Mexican travelers as well as backpackers especially from Europe. The bus station is served by the Cristobal Colon, Maya de Oro, ADO and Rapidos del Sur lines. Main destinations are Mexico, Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Tapachula, San Cristóbal, Villahermosa, Mérida and Cancún.

===Air===

In the past, the city had two airports but none of them were fully functional due to weather and location issues. Today, Ángel Albino Corzo International Airport, IATA code TGZ, serves the city and the central region of the state, 35 km from the center of the city. Since opening in 2006, it has become one of the top airports in the country and the busiest in Southwestern Mexico, with 1,590,178 passengers traveling in 2022. It is also one of the most modern facilities in the country, covering 740 hectares. It cost about one billion pesos to build and was funded by government and private investors. There is taxi service from the airport to Chiapa de Corzo and the city and bus service to the First Class station and to San Cristóbal de las Casas. The new facility can receive direct flights from the United States and Central/South America. As of November 2023, there are direct flights to Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Cancún, Tijuana, Mérida, Mexicali, León/El Bajío, Villahermosa, and Guatemala City. Interjet former service to Mexico City included an &quot;Ecojet&quot; modified to be more fuel efficient.

==Sports==
Each major event held in the city is estimated to bring in about 40 million pesos of business. The fourth event of the NASCAR Corona Series in 2011 was held in Tuxtla. The Carrera Panamericana begins in Tuxtla and ends in Zacatecas six days later for a distance of 3,261 km. The race has featured historic cars such as the Volvo 257 and the Studebaker, as the competition is divided into categories such as Tourist, Sport, Historical and Original Panamericana. The race has a long history but its current incarnation began in 1988 as a rally. The original ran from Ciudad Juárez to Tuxtla in the 1950s.

===Chiapas F.C.===
Tuxtla was home to association football club Chiapas F.C., nicknamed (Jaguars), who played in Mexico&#x27;s top professional league, Liga MX. Chiapas played their home matches at Estadio Víctor Manuel Reyna, which has a capacity of 28,900. The team was relegated to the second tier Ascenso MX however the Chiapas FC franchise dissolved shortly thereafter. A new club named Tuxtla FC playing in the 3rd division will be Jaguares&#x27; replacement.

<text>Jeanne Bécu, Comtesse du Barry (28 August 1744 – 8 December 1793) was the last &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; of King Louis XV of France. She was executed by guillotine during the French Revolution on accusations of treason—particularly being suspected of assisting &quot;émigrés&quot; to flee from the Revolution. She is also known as &quot;Mademoiselle Vaubernier&quot;. 

In 1768, when the king wished to make Jeanne &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot;, etiquette required her to be the wife of a high courtier, so she was hastily married on 1 September 1768 to Comte Guillaume du Barry. The wedding ceremony was accompanied by a false birth certificate created by Jean-Baptiste du Barry, the comte&#x27;s older brother. The certificate made Jeanne appear younger by three years and obscured her poor background. Henceforth, she was recognized as the king&#x27;s official paramour.

Her arrival at the French royal court scandalized some, as she had been a courtesan and came from humble beginnings. She was shunned by many including Marie Antoinette, whose contempt for Jeanne caused alarm and dissension at court. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1772, Marie Antoinette deigned to speak to Jeanne; her remark, &quot;There are many people at Versailles today&quot;, was enough to take the edge off the dispute, though many still disapproved of Jeanne.

Decades later, during the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, Jeanne was imprisoned over accusations of treason by her servant Zamor. She was executed by guillotine on 8 December 1793. Her body was buried in the Madeleine cemetery. The fabulous gems which she had smuggled to London were sold at auction in 1795.

==Early years==

Marie-Jeanne Bécu was the illegitimate daughter of Anne Bécu, a 30-year-old seamstress. Jeanne&#x27;s father remains unidentified; however, it is possible that her father was Jean Jacques Gomard, a friar known as &quot;frère Ange&quot;. One of her mother&#x27;s acquaintances and presumed brief lover Monsieur Billiard-Dumonceaux took 3-year-old Jeanne and her mother into his care when they traveled from Vaucouleurs to Paris. There, Anne worked as cook to Dumonceaux&#x27;s mistress Francesca, who pampered Jeanne. Her education began at the Convent of St. Aure, in the outskirts of Paris.

When she came of age at fifteen, Jeanne left the convent. Around that time, she and her mother Anne were evicted from Monsieur Dumonceaux&#x27;s household and returned to Anne&#x27;s husband Nicolas Rançon. Needing an income, Jeanne first hawked trinkets for sale on the streets of Paris. In 1758 she found a job assisting a young hairdresser named Lametz, with whom she had a brief relationship, as well as a daughter according to some rumors. She was soon employed as a reader and companion (&quot;dame de compagnie&quot;) to an elderly widow, Madame de la Garde, but was sent away when she drew the attentions of la Garde&#x27;s two married sons and one of their wives. From 1763 Jeanne worked as a milliner&#x27;s assistant and &quot;grisette&quot; in the fashionable haberdashery shop called &quot;La Toilette&quot; of Madame Labille and her husband. Labille&#x27;s daughter, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, became a good friend of Jeanne.

As painted at the time, Jeanne was a beautiful blonde with thick ringlets and almond-shaped blue eyes. In 1763, when she was visiting the brothel-casino of Madame Quisnoy, her beauty attracted the notice of the owner, Jean-Baptiste du Barry. He installed Jeanne in his household as his mistress, calling her &quot;Mademoiselle Lange&quot;. From 1766 du Barry helped establish Jeanne&#x27;s career as a courtesan in the highest circles of Parisian society, including the aristocracy.

==Mistress of Louis XV: 1768–1774==
Jeanne quickly became a sensation in Paris, building up a large aristocratic clientele. She had many customers, including government ministers and royal courtiers, the most prominent being the Maréchal de Richelieu. Though the Duc de Choiseul found her rather ordinary, in 1768 he took her to Versailles, where King Louis XV caught sight of her. The king took a great interest and sent for her through his valet and procurer Dominique Lebel. The popular Queen Marie Leszczyńska was dying, and Jeanne was escorted to the king&#x27;s boudoir so frequently as to cause Lebel concern for his position. After weeks of sincerely mourning the queen&#x27;s death in June 1768, Louis XV was ready to resume his affairs. As a woman of low birth as well as a prostitute, Jeanne could not qualify as &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot;; but the king ordered she be married to a man of good lineage and brought to court. On 1 September 1768 she was married to Count Guillaume du Barry, the younger brother of her former lover Jean-Baptiste du Barry. The marriage ceremony included a false birth certificate created by Jean-Baptiste du Barry, making Jeanne appear younger by three years and of fictitious noble descent.

Jeanne was installed above the king&#x27;s quarters in Lebel&#x27;s former rooms. She lived a lonely life, unable to be seen with the king since no formal presentation had taken place. Very few, if any, of the nobility deigned to acknowledge her, a woman of the street who presumed above her station. Jeanne had to be presented at court, but Louis XV required her to find a proper sponsor. For this, the Duke of Richelieu eventually found Madame de Béarn, who was bribed by the settlement of her huge gambling debts.

On the first attempt at the presentation, Madame de Béarn panicked and feigned a sprained ankle. The second occasion was cancelled when the king fell off his hunting horse and broke his arm. Finally, Jeanne was presented at court on 22 April 1769, amid a cacophony of gossip among the crowds outside the palace and the courtiers in the Hall of Mirrors. She wore a silvery white gown brocaded with gold, bedecked in jewels sent by the king the night before, and with huge side panniers, whose like had never been seen. Her spectacular &quot;coiffure&quot; was worked up even as she kept the court waiting.

Jeanne first befriended her husband&#x27;s sister, a cultured spinster, Claire Françoise du Barry, who was brought from Languedoc to instruct her in etiquette. Later on, she also befriended the Maréchale de Mirepoix, and other noblewomen were bribed into her entourage. Jeanne quickly accustomed herself to living in luxury. Louis XV gave her a young Bengali slave named Zamor, whom she dressed in elegant clothing. Jeanne developed a liking for Zamor and began to educate him. In his trial testimony in 1793, Zamor gave Chittagong as his birthplace; he was probably of Siddi origin. According to Stanley Loomis&#x27; biography &quot;Du Barry&quot;, Jeanne&#x27;s everyday routine began at 9.00 am, when Zamor would bring her a morning cup of chocolate. She would select a gown and jewellery and be dressed; then her hairdresser Berline (or Nokelle for special occasions) would come to do her powder and curls. She would then receive friends, as well as tradesmen such as dressmakers, jewellers, and artists offering her their finest stock. 

She was extravagant but good natured. When the old Comte and Comtesse de Lousene were forcibly evicted from their château for heavy debts, they were sentenced to death because the comtesse had shot dead a bailiff and a police officer while resisting. When Madame de Béarn told Jeanne of their situation, she begged the king to pardon them, refusing to rise from her knees until he agreed. Louis XV was moved: &quot;Madame, I am delighted that the first favour you should ask of me should be an act of mercy!&quot; Jeanne was visited by a Monsieur Mandeville who asked a pardon for a young girl condemned to the gallows for infanticide after concealing the birth of a stillborn child. Jeanne&#x27;s letter to the Chancellor of France saved the girl.

As the king&#x27;s &quot;maîtresse déclarée,&quot; Jeanne was the center of all eyes at court. She wore costly, extravagant gowns, and diamonds covered her neck and ears, straining the treasury all the more. She made both friends and enemies. Her most bitter rival was Béatrix, Duchesse de Gramont, who had in vain tried her best to acquire the place of the king&#x27;s previous mistress, the late Marquise de Pompadour. Since the beginning, Béatrix had plotted with her brother for Jeanne&#x27;s removal, even writing libelous pamphlets against her as well as the king.

In time Jeanne became acquainted with the Duc d’Aiguillon, who sided with her against the Duc de Choiseul. As Jeanne&#x27;s power in court grew stronger, Choiseul began feeling his was waning. Though the king believed his country exhausted after the Seven Years&#x27; War, Choiseul decided that France was capable of war again and supported Spain against Britain in their struggle for possession of the Falkland Islands. Du Barry exposed his plot to the king on Christmas Eve 1770, and Choiseul was dismissed from his ministry and exiled from court.

Despite this intrigue, Jeanne, unlike her predecessor Madame de Pompadour, had little interest in politics, reserving her passion for new gowns and jewellery. However, the king went so far as to let her participate in state councils. An anecdote recounts that the king said to the Duc de Noailles that Madame du Barry introduced him to new pleasures; &quot;Sire&quot; – answered the duke – &quot;that&#x27;s because your Majesty has never been in a brothel.&quot; While Jeanne was known for her good nature and support of artists, she grew increasingly unpopular because of the king&#x27;s financial extravagance towards her. She was forever in debt despite her huge monthly income—at one point up to 3,000 livres. She retained her position until the death of Louis XV, despite the attempt to depose her by the Duc de Choiseul and the Duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, who tried to arrange a secret marriage between the king and Madame Pater.

===Diamond necklace affair===
In 1772, the infatuated Louis XV requested that Parisian jewellers Boehmer and Bassenge create a necklace for Jeanne of unprecedented extravagance, at an estimated cost of two million livres. The necklace, still unfinished and unpaid when Louis XV died, would eventually trigger a scandal involving Jeanne de la Motte-Valois, in which Queen Marie Antoinette was accused of bribing Cardinal de Rohan to purchase it for her, accusations which would figure prominently in the onset of the French Revolution.

==Exile: 1774–1792==
In time, King Louis XV started to think of death and repentance and began missing appointments in Jeanne&#x27;s boudoir. During a stay at the Petit Trianon with her, Louis felt the first symptoms of smallpox. He was brought back to the palace at night and put to bed, where his daughters and Jeanne stayed beside him. On 4 May 1774 the king suggested to Madame du Barry that she leave Versailles, both to protect her from infection and so that he could prepare for confession and last rites. She retired to the Duc d&#x27;Aiguillon&#x27;s estate near Rueil. Following the death of the king and his grandson&#x27;s ascension to the throne as Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette had Jeanne exiled to the Abbey du Pont-aux-Dames near Meaux-en-Brie. At first she was met coldly by the nuns, but soon enough they softened to her timid ways and opened up to her, most of all the abbess Madame de la Roche-Fontenelle.

After a year at the convent, Jeanne was granted permission to visit the surrounding countryside provided she return by sundown. A month later, she was allowed out farther, but not to venture within of Versailles, including to her beloved Château de Louveciennes. Two years later, she was allowed to move to Louveciennes.
In the following years, she had a liaison with Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé-Brissac. She later also fell in love with Henry Seymour of Redland, whom she met when he moved with his family to the neighborhood of the Château. In time, Seymour became fed up with his secret love affair and sent a painting to Jeanne with the words &#x27;leave me alone&#x27; written in English at the bottom, which the painter Lemoyne copied in 1796. The Duc de Brissac proved the more faithful in this &quot;ménage-a-trois&quot;, having kept Jeanne in his heart despite Seymour.

During the French Revolution, Brissac was captured while visiting Paris and lynched by the mob. Late that night, Jeanne heard a drunken crowd approaching the Château, and through the opened window where she looked came a blood-stained cloth with Brissac&#x27;s head, at which sight she fainted.

==Imprisonment, trial and execution: 1792–93==

Jeanne&#x27;s slave Zamor, along with another member of du Barry&#x27;s domestic staff, had joined the Jacobin club. He became a follower of the revolutionary George Grieve and then an office-bearer in the Committee of Public Safety. Jeanne found out about this in 1792 and questioned Zamor about his connections with Grieve. Upon realising the depth of his involvement, she gave him three days&#x27; notice to quit her service. Zamor promptly denounced his mistress to the committee.

Based largely on Zamor&#x27;s testimony, Madame du Barry was suspected of financially assisting &quot;émigrés&quot; who had fled the revolution, and she was arrested in 1793. When the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris accused her of treason and condemned her to death, she vainly attempted to save herself by revealing the location of the gemstones she had hidden.

On 8 December 1793 Madame du Barry was beheaded by the guillotine on the Place de la Révolution. On the way to the guillotine, she collapsed in the tumbrel and cried, &quot;You are going to hurt me! Why?!&quot; Terrified, she screamed for mercy and begged the watching crowd for help. Her last words to the executioner are said to have been: «De grâce, monsieur le bourreau, encore un petit moment!» – &quot;One more moment, Mr. Executioner, I beg you!&quot; She was buried in the Madeleine Cemetery with many other victims including Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.

Although her French estate went to the &quot;Tribunal de Paris&quot;, the jewels she had smuggled out of France to England were sold at an auction at Christie&#x27;s in London in 1795. Colonel Johann Keglevich took part in the Battle of Mainz with Hessian mercenaries paid by the British with money from this sale.

==Relationship with Marie Antoinette==
Jeanne&#x27;s relationship with Marie Antoinette was contentious. They first met at a family supper at the Château of La Muette on 15 May 1770—the day before Marie Antoinette&#x27;s wedding with the Dauphin Louis-Auguste. Jeanne had been the king&#x27;s mistress for little over a year, and many thought she would not be included at the occasion. It ended up being otherwise, to the disgust of most of those present. Marie Antoinette noticed Jeanne, who stood out from the crowd with her extravagant appearance and a high voice. The comtesse de Noailles informed Marie Antoinette that Jeanne pleased the king, and the 14-year-old archduchess innocently said that she would rival her. The Comte de Provence soon disillusioned the new princess, who was outraged at such open immorality. Their rivalry continued, especially since the Dauphine supported Choiseul in favor of the alliance with Austria.

Marie Antoinette defied court protocol by refusing to speak to Madame du Barry. She not only disapproved of Jeanne&#x27;s background, but felt insulted when she heard from the Comte de Provence of Jeanne&#x27;s laughter at a salacious story told by the Cardinal de Rohan about Marie Antoinette&#x27;s mother, Empress Maria Theresa. Jeanne furiously complained to the king, who then complained to the Austrian ambassador Mercy, who in turn did his best to appease Marie Antoinette. Eventually, during a ball on New Year&#x27;s Day 1772, Marie Antoinette spoke indirectly to Jeanne, casually observing; &quot;There are many people at Versailles today&quot;, giving her the option to respond or not.

==In popular culture==
===Food===

Many dishes, such as soup du Barry, are named after Jeanne. A common characteristic of dishes bearing the name &quot;du Barry&quot; have a creamy white sauce. Many have cauliflower, perhaps an allusion to her powdered hair with curls piled like cauliflower florets.

<text>San Cristóbal de las Casas (), also known by its native Tzotzil name, Jovel (), is a town and municipality located in the Central Highlands region of the Mexican state of Chiapas. It was the capital of the state until 1892, and is still considered the cultural capital of Chiapas.

The municipality is mostly made up of mountainous terrain, but the city sits in a small valley surrounded by hills. The city’s center maintains its Spanish colonial layout and much of its architecture, with red tile roofs, cobblestone streets and wrought iron balconies often with flowers. Most of the city’s economy is based on commerce, services and tourism.

Tourism is based on the city’s history, culture and indigenous population, although the tourism itself has affected the city, giving it foreign elements. Major landmarks of the city include the cathedral, the Santo Domingo church with its large open air crafts market and the Casa Na Bolom museum. The municipality has suffered severe deforestation, but it has natural attractions such as caves and rivers.

==The town and municipality==


San Cristóbal de las Casas is a city and municipality located in the Central Highlands region of Chiapas. As a municipality, the city functions as the governmental authority for 83 other rural communities outside the city proper, which cover a territory of 484 km2. Of these communities, the most important include La Candelaria, San Antonio del Monte, Mitziton, San José Yashitinin, El Pinar, Buenavista, Pedernal, Corazon de Maria and Zacualpa Ecatepec. The municipality borders the municipalities of Chamula, Tenejapa, Huixtán, Teopisca, Totolapa, Chiapilla, San Lucas and Zinacantán.

The city, especially the historic center, has maintained its Spanish colonial layout, with narrow cobblestone streets, roofs covered in red clay tile and wrought iron balconies with flowers. The facades of the buildings vary from Baroque to Neoclassical and Moorish, painted in various colors. Milk delivery from local dairy farms still use canisters on donkeys, and farmers typically still use horses and donkeys for hauling wood and farmed goods within their own properties. The city subdivides into three sections but the majority of the population lives in the central section near the city center. Many of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, in part due to cutting firewood and logging operations which feed the local manufacturing and construction industries.

Although the political capital of Chiapas was moved to Tuxtla at the end of the 19th century, San Cristóbal is considered to be the “cultural capital” of the state. Designated a “Pueblo Mágico” (Magical Village) in 2003, it was further recognized as “The most magical of the Pueblos Mágicos” by President Felipe Calderón in 2010. Much of this culture is associated with the city’s and municipality’s large indigenous population, which is mostly made up of Tzotzils and Tzeltals. One aspect of traditional culture associated with these indigenous groups is the making of textiles, especially weaving, with amber another important product. Ceramics, wrought iron and filigree jewelry can be found as well. The best known area for crafts is the tianguis at Santo Domingo. The city hosts an annual Amber Expo at the Centro de Convenciones Casa de Mazariegos. The event exhibits and sells amber and amber pieces from the area of the state. A more traditional Mexican market is located just north of the Santo Tomas Church. It is open each day except Sunday, when its vendors go to the surrounding communities in the municipality to sell at their markets. On the days that it is open, the large building, which mostly houses traditional butcher shops, is surrounded by stalls which crowd the nearby streets. There are very few tourists here, except for the occasional backpacker. Markets like this serve traditional dishes such as saffron tamales, sopa de pan, asado coleto, atole de granillo and a drink called posh made from sugar cane.

The city’s attraction for tourists has also led to a number making San Cristobal their permanent home, which has had an effect of the local culture, especially in the historic center. Many foreign residents have opened up restaurants with Italian, French, Thai, Indian, Chinese and more options, such as vegetarian. An older foreign influence is the city’s noted cured meat tradition, which can be traced back to both the Spanish and the Germans. These are featured in a number of dishes including chalupas. Foreign influence can also be seen in the city’s nightlife which offers reggae, salsa, techno and more.

Fireworks are common as there are many religious festivals which use them. Important celebrations include those dedicated to the Dulce Niño de Jesús, the Señor de Esquipulas, Saint Anthony, Corpus Christi, San Cristóbal and the Holy Family. This is in addition to the various neighborhood saint celebrations in their respective churches around town. However, the most elaborate rituals are performed during Holy Week. Holy Week processions include both silent and chanting marchers. A number are dressed in pointed hoods and carry heavy platforms with religious figures. They go from house to house, stopping at those homes that have erected small shrines. There they say prayers and bless the house and its occupants before moving on. They finally come to rest in a gigantic open house where an inner shrine has been erected lit by thousands of candles, and where a large potluck supper takes place. All, even passersby, are welcome to partake. Passion plays depicting the crucifixion of Jesus are common events with one large one centered in the open plaza behind the municipal palace. After dark, there is the Burning of Judas. The figures burned are plentiful and include, as well as Judas, government bureaucrats, church officials, army officers, US political figures, Spanish conquistadors, and popular celebrities. They are lit by local firemen who try to keep people back at a safe distance, but fireworks occasionally fall among the crowds anyway.

The Feria de la Primavera y la Paz (Spring and Peace Fair) runs concurrent with Holy Week, especially on Holy Saturday with music and costumes. It terminates with the burning of Judas. A queen is elected to be crowned the next day. Bullfights are held.

The Festival Cervantino Barroco is held each year in the historic center featuring invited artists from various parts of Mexico and abroad. It is held in various forums in the city and includes concerts, plays, exhibitions and conferences.

The center of the city is its main plaza. This plaza’s official name is Plaza 31 de marzo, but it is more often simply called the Zócalo. In the colonial era, the city’s main market was here as well as the main water supply. Today, it is centered on a kiosk which was added in the early 20th century. The corners of this structure have inscriptions marking the major events of San Cristóbal’s history. The rest of the plaza is filled with gardens and surrounded by the most important buildings and finest homes from the history of the city. Surrounding this plaza are the city’s most important buildings such as the cathedral and the city hall.

The cathedral is to the north of the main plaza and it is the most emblematic symbol of the city. However, the main facade does not face the Zócalo, rather it faces its own atrium which is called the Cathedral Plaza. The cathedral began as a modest church dedicated to the Virgin of the Assumption built in 1528. When Chiapas became a diocese in the 17th century, with San Cristóbal as its seat, this church was torn down to build the current structure, dedicated to Saint Christopher, the patron of the city. The overall structure contains European Baroque, Moorish and indigenous influences. The main facade was finished in 1721 and some final touches were added in the 20th century. The main feature of the church is its main facade, which was finished in 1721. It is Baroque painted yellow with ornamental columns and niches in which are various saints. It is divided into three horizontal and three vertical levels marked off by pairs of Solomonic columns and meant to resemble an altarpiece. It is further decorated with intricate raised stucco work mostly in white which show Oaxacan and Guatemalan influences. The layout of the interior shows Moorish influence. The main altar is dedicated to both the Virgin of the Assumption and Saint Christopher. The wood pulpit is from the 16th century and gilded. The side walls have two Baroque altarpieces, one to the Virgin of the Assumption and the other to John of Nepomuk. There is also a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe on the north side. The sacristy has a large colonial era paintings of Jesus in Gethsemane by Juan Correa as well as paintings by Miguel Cabrera and Eusebio de Aguilar. It is common to see older indigenous women in the cathedral, with some even traversing the entire nave on their knees to approach the large image of Jesus handing above the Baroque altar.

At the back of the cathedral, there is an affixed church called the San Nicolás Temple. It was constructed between 1613 and 1621 in Moorish design by Augustinian monks for use by the indigenous population. It is the only church in the city which has not been significantly altered since its construction. The roof is pitched and pyramid shaped built with wood and tile, and its facade is made of stone and brick with little ornamentation. Two of its images, the Señor de la Misericordia and the Virgen de los Dolores are both from Guatemala.

The city hall, often called the Palacio de Gobierno, is a Neoclassical construction which was built in the 19th century by architect Carlos Z. Flores. It contains a series of arches supported by Tuscan columns. In front of the city hall at night, young men and women promenade past each other in opposite directions around the gazebo. The city hall is scene to fairly frequent protests, some directly associated with the Zapatistas and others are held by student activists from UNAM in Mexico City. These protests are generally accompanied by lines of riot police.

When Dominicans came to San Cristóbal from Seville, Spain, they were given an area of land to construct their church and monastery. The first stone was laid in 1547 by Francisco Marroqui, then Bishop of Guatemala. The monastery was finished in 1551. It is one of the most ornate structures in Latin America, both due to the stucco work on the main facade and the gilded altarpieces which completely cover the length on the church’s interior. The facade of the main church is Baroque with Salomonic columns heavily decorated in stucco forms to mimic an altarpiece. The interior has a pulpit carved of wood and covered in gold leaf. The walls are covered in Baroque altarpieces includes those dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The La Caridad Temple was constructed on the site in 1712, established as part of the first hospital for the indigenous. The main facade of this church is designed as an altarpiece with two levels, a central bell tower and Tuscan columns and pilasters. Its design is derived from the Baroque that developed in Lima, Peru. There is an image of the Virgen de la Caridad (Virgin of Charity) carrying a baton like a military general. There is also a notable sculpture of Saint James on horseback. The complex contains two museums. The Museo de la Historia de la Ciudad covers the history of the city until the 19th century. Of this collection, the two most important pieces are some petals of a pomegranate flower, from a receptacle for the Host in the cathedral. It is one of the most important works of Chiapas silversmithing. The rest of the piece has been lost. The other is a part of the original choir seating of the same Cathedral. The Centro Cultural de los Altos has a collection of some of the area’s textiles from each ethnicity and exhibits on how they are made. It has a store associated with it called the Sna-Jolobil, which means house of weaving in Tzotzil

Casa Na Bolom (House of the Jaguar) is a museum, hotel and restaurant located outside the city’s historic center. The structure was built as part of a seminary in 1891, but it became the home of Frans Blom and Gertrude Duby Blom in the 20th century. Franz was an explorer and archeologist and Gertrude was a journalist and photographer. The couple spent over fifty years in Chiapas collecting tools, crafts, archeological pieces and clothing, especially related to the Lacandon Jungle and people. The museum is dedicated to this collection along with keeping some of the old household rooms intact, such as Franz’s study. It also contains a library with more than 10,000 volumes dedicated to the history, culture and anthropology of the region. There are also magazine and sound libraries as well as the old chapel which contains colonial era religious art. The back of the structure contains a botanical garden.

The La Merced monastery was the first in the city founded by the Mercedarians from Guatemala in 1537. It was built as a fortress with barracks for soldiers and space for citizens in case of attack. The church entrance has a massive wooden door with wrought iron hinges and fastenings. There are very few windows and those that exist are built to allow muskets to fire on attackers. The entire structure is built with extensions and abutments to provide for interlocking fields of fire. Entry to the fortifications is denied as too dangerous. The church still functions as such. It consists of a single nave, with interior remodeled in Neoclassical design during the Porfirio Díaz era. The oldest part of the structure is an arch and columns located in the interior of the sacristy, which is decorated in stucco of various colors with floral and vegetative motifs. At the foot of the column, there are two lions symbolizing Spanish domination. In the latter half of the 19th century, the structure was used as a military barracks and in 1960, it was converted into the city jail which it remained until 1993. In 2000 the former monastery was further converted into the Museum of Amber, which has a collection of over three hundred pieces and is the only one of its kind in the Americas.

The Carmen Temple and the Arco Torre, both in Moorish style, are located on Andador . The Carmen Temple is all that remains of the former La Encarnación convent which was founded in 1597 with the first nuns arriving between 1609 and 1610. The complex includes the old cloister, nuns’ cells and other structures. The original church building burned and it was restored conserving its simple facade. One unusual feature of the church is that its layout is L-shaped, covering the south and west sides of a small plaza. Inside, the walls have carved wood panels and a Neoclassical altar which has been recently restored. In the colonial period, the convent and church served as one of the main entrances into the city. An arch with tower was constructed next to the convent in 1680, now simply called the Arco del Carmen. This arch is in pure Moorish style, with three levels of decoration. It is the only one of its style in Mexico. This arch with its accompanying tower has been adopted as one of the symbols of San Cristóbal.

The San Cristóbal Church is atop a long staircase up the hill. It is often closed but it offers panoramic views of the city. At the San Cristóbal church the patron saint is celebrated on 25 July with marimbas, food and fireworks. For ten days previously, each of the main neighborhoods has a pilgrimage to the top of the hill.

The San Francisco Church was built by the Franciscans in 1577 as a monastery but only the church survives. The current church was built in the 18th century with a single nave covered in a wood and tile roof. The main facade has three levels and two side towers. Inside, it has six Baroque altarpieces. The upper part of the nave has fourteen oil paintings. The atrium has a sculpted stone baptismal font.

The Guadalupe Church is located on the Cerro de Guadalupe. It was constructed in 1834. To reach it, there are seventy nine stairs up the hill. The church has a single nave with a side chapel. The main altar has an oil painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the side chapel contains a sculpture of the Virgin from 1850. The atrium affords panoramic views of the city. The feast of this Virgin is celebrated annually with a parade on the main street with fireworks, rockets and candlelight vigils.

The Santo Tomas Church is just north of the historic center. It has a museum in the back, in a building which was the barracks and parade grounds built when the city was founded.

The Santa Lucía Church was constructed in 1884 by architect Carlos Z. Flores over what was a dilapidated chapel. It consists of a single nave with pilasters on its walls and pointed arches. The main altar is Gothic with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau elements.

The Museo Mesoamericano del Jade has jade pieces from the Olmec, Teotihuacan, Mixtec, Zapotec, Maya, Toltec and Aztec cultures. There is also a life-sized replica of the burial chamber of Pakal of Palenque as it looked when the king was buried. The Maya Medicine Museum is dedicated to the various techniques and practices of indigenous medicine, many of which are still practiced today. The Museo de las Culturas Populares de Chiapas (Museum of Popular Cultures of Chiapas) is located on Diego de Mazariego Street. It is mostly dedicated to the indigenous cultures of the state with the aim of recuperating, valuing and promoting knowledge of these cultures in Chiapas and beyond. The museum has exhibits of many of these cultures and also sponsors live events related to its mission as well.

Casa de las Sirenas is one of the most notable domestic structures from the colonial era. It was built by Andrés de la Tovilla in Plateresque style and dates from the 16th century. It is named after a mermaid that appears on its crest in one of the corners. The Antiguo Colegio de San Francisco Javier today houses the Faculty of Law of the state university. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1681 for the education of the Spanish elite. Its current facade is two levels in Neoclassical style. The interior contains murals about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire.

==History==

The city was founded as Villa Real de Chiapa in 1528 by Diego de Mazariegos in what was called the Hueyzacatlán Valley, which means “pasture” in Nahuatl. From then on, the city went through a number of name changes: to Villa Viciosa in 1529, to Villa de San Cristóbal de los Llanos in 1531, and to Ciudad Real in 1536. It was changed to Ciudad de San Cristóbal in 1829. “de las Casas” was added in 1848 in honor of Bartolomé de las Casas. There were some modifications in the early 20th century to the name but it returned to San Cristóbal de las Casas in 1943. In the Tzotzil and Tzeltal languages the name of the area is Jovel, “the place in the clouds”.

The area did not have a pre-Hispanic city. After defeating the Zoques in the Northern Mountains and the Chiapans of this area, Diego de Mazariegos founded the city as a military fort. This city and much of what would be the state of Chiapas came under the Captaincy General of Guatemala in 1532 headed by Pedro de Alvarado. San Cristóbal received its coat of arms in 1535 from Carlos V and it was officially declared a city in 1536. The city gained the rank of Alcadía Mayor in 1577 which gave it authority over much of Chiapas north of it. The intendencia of Chiapas was created in 1786 combining San Cristóbal’s territory with that of Tuxtla and Soconusco, with the government in San Cristóbal. In 1821, the city followed the Comitán de Domínguez’ declaration of independence from Spain and the Captaincy General of Guatemala. However, the city and the rest of Chiapas became a part of Mexico in 1824, with the capital established here.

In 1829, the name Ciudad Real was changed to San Cristóbal. In the 19th century, the state government would shift back and forth between San Cristóbal, in the highlands dominated by Conservatives, and Tuxtla, dominated by Liberals. Independent tendencies arose again in 1853, when the Plan of Yalmús was announced declaring the then Mexican Constitution null. Conservative forces attacked the city in 1857 but were dislodged shortly thereafter by Liberal Angel Albino Corzo. The last of French forces were expelled from the city in 1864. The state government was moved from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla for good in 1892 by the Liberal government. There was a failed attempt in 1911 by Conservatives in San Cristóbal and neighboring San Juan Chamula to force the return of the capital.

In 1915, the state went to the municipality system with San Cristóbal becoming a municipality. Originally, it had jurisdiction over communities such as San Lucas, Zinacantán, San Felipe Ecatepec, Tenejapa, San Miguel Mitontic, Huixtan and Chanal, but these would later separate to become municipalities in their own right.
In the 20th century, the outskirts of the city become filled with open pit mines for gravel and sand. There was even one opened on a hill in the San Diego and La Florecilla neighborhoods, near the historic center called Salsipuedes. These prompted environmental and local community organizations to protest, stating that the valley is a closed water basin and the mining negatively affects potable water supplies. Salsipuedes was closed in the 2000s.

The city was declared a national historic monument in 1974.

San Cristóbal became the center of political activism with the election of Samuel Ruiz as bishop of Chiapas in 1960. In the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional Catholic Church was losing indigenous adherents to Protestant and other Christian groups. To counter this, Ruiz supported and worked with Marist priests and nuns following an ideology called liberation theology. In 1974 he organized a statewide Indian Congress with representatives from 327 communities of the Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal and Ch&#x27;ol peoples as well as Marists and the Maoist People’s Union. This congress was the first of its kind with the goal of uniting the indigenous peoples politically. These efforts were also supported by leftist organizations from outside Mexico, especially to form unions of ejido organizations. These unions would later form the base of the EZLN organization. These efforts would also create a “new” type of Catholic in the state called “Word of God” Catholic. These would shun the “traditionalist” Catholic practice mixed with indigenous rites and beliefs. It would also create a split in many communities as the “Word of God” Catholics were loyal directly to the bishop in San Cristóbal, with traditionalists loyal to local cacique leaders.

Activism and resentment continued from the 1970s to the 1990s. During this decade, the Mexican federal government adopted neoliberalism, which clashed with the leftist political ideas of liberation theology and many of the indigenous activist groups. Despite the activism, economic marginalization among indigenous groups remained high, with resentment strongest in the San Cristóbal region and in migrant communities living in the Lacandon Jungle.

The grievances of these activists would be taken up by a small guerrilla band led by a man called only “Subcomandante Marcos.” His small band, called the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN), came to the world’s attention when on January 1, 1994, the day the NAFTA treaty went into effect. On this day, EZLN forces occupied and took over the towns of San Cristóbal de las Casas, along with six other Chiapas communities. They read their proclamation of revolt to the world and then laid siege to a nearby military base, capturing weapons and releasing many prisoners from the jails. Ruiz negotiated between the EZLN and authorities even though his leftist activism made him suspect to many authorities. This would undermine efforts and eventually the Catholic Church would split from the Zapatista movement. However, the negotiations would lead to the San Andrés Accords and ended the rebellion peacefully. By the time he died in 2011, Ruiz was locally given the name of “Tatic”, which means “father” in Tzotzil, and received numerous distinctions including the Simón Bolívar Prize from UNESCO and the International Human Rights Award in Nuremberg.

==Geography==

The city and municipality are located in a region called the Chiapas Highlands or Central Highlands. Two thirds of the municipality is made up of mountainous terrain with the rest valley floor. The city proper is located at 2,200 meters above sea level in a small valley surrounded by hills. The most important of these hills include Cerro Huitepec, San José Bocomtenelté, Cerro San Felipe, Cerro El Extranjero, Cerro Cruz Carreta, El Arcotete and Cerro Tzontehuitz. While it is in a tropical zone, its climate is temperate due to the altitude. The climate is also humid, with cloud cover in the winter months that keeps temperatures down and can produce cold nights. Average temperature between December and April is 18 °C. The area receives most of its rain in the summer to early fall. However, the cloud cover that exists in winter is generally absent and daytime temperatures can go up to 35 °C with high humidity.

Due to its high altitude the city temperatures can reach temperatures below 0 °C. Many homes burn firewood for warmth in cold weather. This can give the city a slightly smoky smell although the number of homes burning firewood for warmth has dropped in the last two decades as more homes are integrating climate-control systems under city recommendations.

The natural vegetation of the area is pine–oak forest. However, most of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, with deforestation rates at 80%, losing 15,000 hectares just since 1980. Reasons for this include cutting for firewood, urban development, poor resource management, fires and agriculture. The deforestation has led to erosion problems blocking rivers and streams and affecting underground recharge of the area&#x27;s freshwater springs. It has also negatively affected endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler (&quot;Setophaga chrysoparia&quot;), which winters here.

The main rivers are the Amarillo and Fogótico along with a number of streams such as the Chamula, Peje de Oro and Ojo de Agua. There are also two lakes called the Chapultepec and Cochi. The city had twenty-five natural fresh water springs, but deforestation has dried up seven and twelve flow only during the rainy season, leaving six for the city year round. These and the remaining surface lakes were declared protected in 2008.

The municipality has a number of ecological features. The Gruta de San Cristóbal is one of a number of caves in the mountains around the city just off Federal Highway 190 heading towards Comitán. This particular cave was discovered by Vicente Kramsky in 1947. The cave has only one entrance with lateral chambers. It has a total length of 10.2 km and a depth of 550 meters. The Rancho Nuevo cave has a path which extends 750 meters into the interior and is lit in various colors. Around the caves, there are campsites and horseback riding.

The municipality contains two ecological reserves called the Cerro Huitepec Private Reserve and the Rancho Nuevo Ecological Conservation Zone. Another protected area is the El Arcotete Forest located 15 km northeast of the city. It contains a natural bridge which was part of an ancient cave that was worn away.

The Humedales de Montaña La Kisst is an urban wetland located southwest of the historic center. Springs in the area are an important source of water for the city, and the wetland helps capture, store, and filter clean water as well as provide habitat to aquatic life. In 2008 a 110-hectare area around the wetlands was designated an ecological conservation area, and 35 hectares were designated a wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention in the same year. The wetland remains under threat from over-pumping of groundwater and encroachment by urban development. Humedales de Montaña María Eugenia is a wetland in the southeastern portion of the city. It supports populations of fish, amphibians, and resident and migratory birds, and helps reduce flood risk and recharge drinking water aquifers for the city. The wetlands was designated a 115-hectare ecological conservation area in 2008, and it was designated a Ramsar Site in 2012. Gertrude Duby Biotic Reserve is a 64-hectare reserve in the mountains immediately east of the city. It was designated in 1994 and named for Gertrude Duby Blom, a journalist, anthropologist, environmentalist, and San Cristóbal resident.

===Climate===
San Cristóbal de las Casas has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) moderated by its altitude. The dry season, which runs from November to April is cool with a January average of . Owing to its altitude and the relative aridity of the dry season, San Cristóbal de las Casas has a fairly high diurnal temperature range and nighttime temperatures are cool. Extended periods of frosts are rare, occurring only 2 or 3 days per year in December to February. Humidity is high (around 78 percent), even during the winter months, but fog or mist is quite common during the dry months, occurring on 13 to 17 days. Usually, this clears off during the day. The wet season, which runs from May to October is warmer, with a June average of and precipitation is much higher during these months. Fog is less common during this time. Average annual precipitation is most of it concentrated in the wet season. The wettest month recorded was September 1998 when of precipitation was recorded, and the wettest day recorded was on October 4, 2005, with . Extremes range from a low of .

==Infrastructure==

==Demographics==

In 2010 the municipality of San Cristóbal de las Casas had a total population of 185,917, and the city of 158,027. Other than the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas, the municipality had 110 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: San Antonio del Monte (2,196), La Candelaria (1,955), Mitzitón (1,293), and San José Yashitinín (1,109), all classified as rural.

As of 2010, 59,943 people in the municipality spoke an indigenous language. The two most important ethnic groups in the area are the Tzotzil and Tzetzal.

About 85% of the municipal population lives in the city proper with the rest in rural communities. The population density is 274/km2, well above the regional average of 190/km2 and state average of 52/km2. Most of the population is young, with about 68% under the age of thirty and an average age of twenty. Population growth is about 4.10%, above the regional and state averages of 2.37 and 2.06% respectively. The population is expected to double within twenty years.

In 2000 the municipality had an illiteracy rate of just under 18%, down from just under 25% in 1990. Of these over 15, just over 16% have not finished primary school, about 17% have only primary school completed and about 48% have finished some level above that. Just under 78% of the population is Catholic with about 15% belonging to Protestant, Evangelical or other Christian sects.

==Economy and tourism==

San Cristóbal has the second-lowest rate of economic marginalization in the state of Chiapas following Tuxtla Gutiérrez. Only 4.5% of workers do not receive a salary or a regular income. Approximately 9% are employed in agriculture, compared to 54.86% regionally and 47.25% in the state. 21% are employed in construction, energy and transportation. The most important sector by economic output is mining. About 600 truckloads of jade, gravel, stone and metals are exported from San Cristóbal daily. Most of the material is destined to other municipalities in the region, although some goes to other cities in Chiapas and to states such as Tabasco and Campeche. This heavy strip mining has gradually eaten away at the natural landscape of some areas and has negatively affected the recharge of surface and subsurface water.

The most important economic sector is commerce, services and tourism, which employs almost 67% of the workforce compared to 29% for the region and 37% for the state. The city has become a renowned tourist location for its preserved colonial architecture and retention of indigenous culture and traditions. Many residents of the city wear indigenous clothing regularly. Market vendors in the city are known for being very aggressive when trying to secure a sale.

The municipality contains over 80 hotels with more than 2,000 rooms. The city government serves tourists through traditional information booths with guided tours and also offers “iPod tours” where tourists may rent an iPod which uses a GPS system to identify where any given tourist is and provide them with information regarding their surroundings. These tours allow visitors to roam the city and listen/read about the areas in which they are located.

Since the Zapatista uprising in 1994, the city has developed a type of cult tourism focusing around the EZLN. This tourism attracts those interested in both leftist political beliefs and indigenous activism who come to see where the events of the 1990s happened as well as what is going on now. This tourism has spurred the creation of Zapatista-themed shops which sell EZLN shirts and other souvenirs. This tourism has been given the name of “Zapaturismo” or “Zapatourism”. The term originally was derogatory and referred to the large number of leftist activists which converged on the city after the EZLN uprising began. Since then, the term receives mixed reviews with some finding humor in it.

The most important manufactured goods produced in the city are jade, textiles and amber, although others such as ceramics, metal works, carved wood products, clothing and filigree jewelry can be found as well. There is a large tianguis or open air market at Santo Domingo which specializes in selling these locally produced products.

There has been a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is extracted from the town of Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, do not know how to determine what is real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.

<text>Comitán (; formally: Comitán de Domínguez, for Belisario Domínguez) is the fourth-largest city in the Mexican state of Chiapas. It is the seat of government of the municipality of the same name.

It is located in the east-central part of Chiapas, near the border with Guatemala at . The municipality has an area of 797.8 km2. Its largest other community is the town of Villahermosa Yalumá.

Comitán is also a popular tourist destination, mostly for Mexican nationals, though some foreign visitors can also be seen. The town possesses colonial architecture, narrow avenues, and clean streets. The climate is cool most of the year, and can get quite chilly from October to March.

==History==
The old town was founded in a swamp by a group of Tzeltal people. The original name given by the local population was Balún Canán (which means &quot;Nine stars&quot;). As part of the Spanish colonization, the town of Comitan was founded in February 1528 and elevated to the city in 1556 by Dominican friars, belonging to the captaincy of Guatemala. It was later changed to Comitán de las Flores and, in 1915, to Comitán de Domínguez, after Dr. Belisario Domínguez, who gave a memorable speech in Congress against the dictator Victoriano Huerta for which he was murdered.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Comitán had a marginal subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) a little below a tropical savanna climate. Afternoons are very warm with fairly high humidity almost throughout the year, whilst mornings are cool in the dry season and mild during the rainy season. The dry season gradually warms up between March and May, before the rainy season begins during May and continues with higher humidity until October, following which the coolest and most pleasant weather of the year prevails.
==Demographics==
As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 141,013, up from 121,263 as of 2005.

As of 2010, the city of Comitán had a population of 97,537, up from 83,571 as of 2005. Other than the city of Comitán, the municipality had 340 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Villahermosa Yalumá (2,368), San José Yocnajab (1,809), La Floresta (1,743), Los Riegos (1,740), Francisco Sarabia (1,673), Cash (1,429), Señor del Pozo (1,353), Zaragoza la Montaña (1,263), Efraín A. Gutiérrez (1,153), and Chacaljocom (1,056), classified as rural.

==Tourism==

Tourists in Comitán can see many touristic sights, including Mayan ruins, the Lagunas de Montebello, El Chiflon which is a series of waterfalls (this costs a few pesos to enter), Tenam Puente which is an archeological Mayan Cultural place, and others. Comitán is approximately 2 hours away from San Cristobal by bus and approximately 3 hours away from Tuxtla. It is common for locals to travel 2 hours on the bus to see San Cristobal and then travel an additional hour in order to reach Tuxtla.

<doc id="194187" wikidata="Q2738884" url="?curid=194187" title="Radburn, New Jersey">
<text>Radburn is an unincorporated community located within the borough of Fair Lawn in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

Radburn was founded in 1929 as &quot;a town for the motor age&quot;. Its planners, Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, and its landscape architect Marjorie Sewell Cautley aimed to incorporate modern planning principles, which were then being introduced into England&#x27;s Garden Cities, following ideas advocated by urban planners Ebenezer Howard, Sir Patrick Geddes and Clarence Perry. Perry&#x27;s neighborhood unit concept was well-formulated by the time Radburn was planned, being informed by Forest Hills Gardens, Queens, New York City (1909–1914), a garden-city development of the Russell Sage Foundation.

Radburn was explicitly designed to separate traffic by mode, with a pedestrian path system that does not cross any major roads at grade level. Radburn introduced the largely residential &quot;superblock&quot; and is credited with incorporating some of the earliest culs-de-sac in the United States. It was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2005, in recognition of its history in the development of the garden city movement in the 20th century.

==Statistics==
There are approximately 3,100 people in 670 families residing in Radburn. They live in 469 single-family homes, 48 townhouses, 30 two-family houses, and a 93-unit apartment complex. An additional 165-unit townhouse development is under construction.

Radburn&#x27;s include of interior parks, four tennis courts, three baseball fields, two softball fields, two swimming pools, and an archery plaza. Young children and their parents can make use of two toddler playgroup areas, two playgrounds, and a toddler bathing pool.

There is also a community center which houses administrative offices, library, gymnasium, clubroom, pre-school, and maintenance shops.

For census purposes, Radburn is mostly a subset of Census Tract 171 in Bergen County, New Jersey.

==A community within a community==
The Radburn Community, governed by a distinct board of directors, enjoys much autonomy within the Borough of Fair Lawn. Pursuant to enabling laws passed in the 1920s and covenants included in the original deeds for the development, the Radburn Association is a private association which is empowered to administer Radburn&#x27;s common properties and to collect from the owners of properties quarterly association fees to cover the Association&#x27;s maintenance and operation of communal facilities. The Association is also empowered to restrict development and decoration of Radburn properties in order to maintain a consistent &quot;look&quot; to the community. Use of Radburn Association facilities is limited to residents (though the parks themselves are ungated and the walkways are public property of the Borough.) Radburn&#x27;s border with the rest of Fair Lawn is the Bergen County Line to the West; southeast of Fernwood Drive, Fulton Place, and Franciscan Way but northwest of Owen Avenue to the northwest; Radburn Road to the northeast; one block of Howard Avenue to the southeast; Alden Terrace to the northeast and east; one block of High Street to the South; Craig Road and its extension through Scribner Road to the East; and Berdan Avenue to the South. Radburn&#x27;s other full-length east-west cross street is Fair Lawn Avenue, and its sole north-south cross street is Plaza Road.

==Governance==
Radburn residents vote for a volunteer Board of Trustees to govern the Association. Nine board seats are open to nomination and election on a rotating schedule. Any homeowner in good standing may self-nominate, or be nominated by any other homeowner in good standing. However, this was not the case before State law was amended in July 2017.

In November 2006, a group of Radburn residents opposed to the current system of governance filed a lawsuit against the Radburn Association. The plaintiffs claim that Radburn&#x27;s governance violates New Jersey state law and the New Jersey State Constitution. The residents are represented by two public interest legal organizations: the New Jersey Appleseed Public Interest Law Center and The Community Law Clinic of The Rutgers School of Law–Newark.

On April 1, 2008, the New Jersey Superior Court awarded summary judgements for both sides in the democracy lawsuit. Judge Contillo found that Radburn&#x27;s governance was legal as well as its membership. The Court ordered the Association to comply with the law by providing full financial disclosure to residents and amending its bylaws to support open trustee meetings four times each year.

New Jersey Constitutional expert Frank Askin of the Rutgers University School of Law at Newark, and his Clinic on Constitutional Law, joined the plaintiffs&#x27; &quot;pro bono&quot; legal team for the appeals process, intending to affirm through the courts that the PREDFDA statute guarantees free elections in planned community government

On June 17, 2010, the &quot;Moore v. Radburn&quot; litigation was finally put to rest by the New Jersey Supreme Court. The petition for certification filed by the 16 litigants was denied.

In July 2017, Senate bill S2492 was signed into law by Governor Chris Christie, having passed unanimously in both the Senate and Assembly. The new law guarantees membership to all homeowners in New Jersey common interest communities, and requires that self-nomination must be allowed in executive board elections. The Radburn Association voted to adopt revised by-laws at a meeting in May 2017, some of which are inconsistent with several parts of the new law and other existing statutes. The 2017 by-laws revisions were later rescinded for irregularities in their adoption.

==Facilities==

The Radburn School, an elementary school located on the edge of the &quot;B&quot; park, is operated by the Fair Lawn Public Schools. While many of its students are Radburn residents, it serves a larger district. The school, built in 1929, was designed by the architecture firm of Guilbert and Betelle. The building was expanded in 1955 and again in 2005.

In 2016, the elementary school aged students of The Radburn School surpassed their fundraising goal of $60,000 through lemonade stands, rainbow bracelets sales, and a 5k race, but were denied permission to build the playground by The Radburn Association for aesthetic reasons.

Several prominent Fair Lawn businesses exist in Radburn&#x27;s business district, which is at the intersection of Fair Lawn Avenue and Plaza Road, two important arteries in Fair Lawn. Many of these businesses are within the Radburn Plaza (clock tower) building, a signature landmark of Radburn and Fair Lawn itself. (The building suffered a severe fire several years ago and was recently restored in its prior image.) Nearby stands the Old Dutch House, a tavern built during the time of Dutch colonization of the Americas.

Facing the Plaza Building is the Radburn railroad station, built by the Radburn developers along the Erie Railroad line (later Conrail) and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Passenger service operates there today on the New Jersey Transit Bergen County Line.

==Radburn Design Housing==

The &#x27;Radburn design&#x27; has been formalised in the Radburn design for public housing. The design has been used in the US, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

The design was an influence on Walt Disney&#x27;s design for Disney World.

==Notable people==

People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Radburn include:
* Steven Ehrlich (born 1946), architect who is the founding partner of the practice Ehrlich Yanai Rhee Chaney Architects, formerly known as Ehrlich Architects
* Philip Plotch (born 1961), professor, author, and urban planner.

<text>Tapachula de Córdova y Ordóñez, simply known as Tapachula, is a city and municipality located in the far southeast of the state of Chiapas, Mexico, near the Guatemalan border and the Pacific Ocean. Economically, it is one of the most important cities in Chiapas; as capital of the agriculturally-rich Soconusco region, Tapachula also serves as a key port for trade between Mexico and Central America. The area was originally inhabited by the Mam, as a region under the control of the Mam state of Xelaju, but was first established as a city by the Aztecs in the 13th century. Most of its economic importance has come since the late 19th century, with the establishment of coffee plantations. This practice initiated a steady stream of migration and immigration into the area, which continues to this day, and has left the city with a significant Asian and German cultural presence. There is a large Mayan and Nahua population.

==Background==
The city of Tapachula is the capital of the Soconusco region of Chiapas, commonly called the “pearl of the Soconusco”. The name “Tapachula” comes from Nahuatl and means “between the waters”, due to the area&#x27;s frequent flooding. It is located on a low-lying coastal plain, fed by various small rivers, about 120 meters (393’) above sea level.

Tapachula is Mexico&#x27;s main border city with Guatemala in the Pacific coast region, even though it is located some kilometers away from the border itself. The main commercial border crossing is in Ciudad Hidalgo, about 40 km (24 mi) away. Nonetheless, it is the principal port for the shipment of goods and for people traveling between Mexico and the rest of Central America further south, making it economically and socially similar to cities on the US southern border such as Laredo, Texas or San Diego, California. The flow of goods through the area combined with local agricultural output makes Tapachula one of the most important cities in the state, socioeconomically, with one of the highest per capita incomes in the state of Chiapas. As its wealth is relatively recent, since the late 19th century, Tapachula is mostly a modern-developed city. Like border cities of the United States, Tapachula and other communities in the area have experienced their share of problems with illegal immigration, human trafficking, drug smuggling and violence, with most illegal aliens coming from Central America. This has led to a strong and very visible police presence in the city, along with special security measures for major events (such as the Feria Internacional Tapachula).

The city has had a strong Chinese presence since around 1900, when a number of people from the country came to Mexico to work for the coffee businesses of the area. Most of the descendants of these first immigrants have since dispersed throughout the Soconusco region, but there is still Asian immigration to Tapachula to this day. Most modern immigrants work in commerce rather than in agriculture or hard labor. The most visible evidence of Asian presence is the significant number of Chinese and other Asian restaurants in the city, especially in the downtown. A number of businesses selling Chinese food and imported items are concentrated in the San Juan market. The Casa de la Comunidad China (Chinese Community House) is located Cuarta Avenida Sur. The structure is dedicated to education about Chinese culture and was reopened in 2012 after renovations. Tapachula signed a sister city agreement with Dongying, China in 2011.

Most of the city&#x27;s monumental structures in the historic center were built in the first decades of the 20th century, although there are a number of significant large homes near this same area built in the 1960s in Art Deco style such as the La Portaviandas building. Outside the city downtown, the structures just about all date from the latter 20th century on due to recent growth. The historic center is marked by a large, tree-lined plaza called Parque Miguel Hidalgo. The center of this plaza contains an octagon kiosk with Baroque ironwork with some Moorish influence. Parque Miguel Hidalgo is the center of the city surrounded by the old and new municipal palaces, the Perez Porta and the Teatro al Aire Libre (Open Air Theater), which often has marimba concerts. The main monumental buildings of the area surround this plaza and include the old and new municipal palaces, the Perez Portal and the Teatro al Aire Libre (Open Air Theater).

The San Agustín parish church dates from the 18th century, established to honor the patron saint of the city, Augustine. It is a simple construction with a red Spanish tile roof, supported by wood beams. The facade is a simple Neoclassical with six Ionic order columns, three on each side of the entrance, joined by false arches. The top of the facade has two bell towers. This design is based on the Teopisca church. The church became a cathedral in 1958, shortly after the Tapachula diocese was established but that status has since been ceded to the San José Cathedral, consecrated in 2009.

The Soconusco Archeological Museum faces Parque Hidalgo. This building houses a number of pieces from the various archeological sites of the region, especially Izapa and several coastal sites. One special piece is a skull covered in gold and incrusted with turquoise. Another is a stele called Number 25, because of the quality of its engravings.

The Casa de Cultura was built in 1929 as the municipal palace when the city was prosperous because of the surrounding coffee plantations. Although the style is Art Deco, the facade is decorated with Oaxacan style fretwork, images of Aztec warriors and stylized serpents along with the Mexican and state coats of arms. Today, the building functions as a cultural center for the city.

The municipal cemetery is notable as a testament to the immigrant past of the area, with gravestones with German names and Chinese characters. The best examples of both date from the late 19th to early 20th century.

One of Tapachula&#x27;s most famous natives is the actress and singer Bibi Gaytan, who first achieved stardom in the 1990s.

==Demographics==
The city of Tapachula is the governmental authority for a number of other communities which cover a combined area of 303 km2. It borders the municipalities of Motozintla, Cacahoatán, Tuxtla Chico, Frontera Hidalgo, Suchiate, Tuzantán, Huehuetán and Mazatán with the Pacific on the south and Guatemala to the northwest.

As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 320,451.

The municipality had 574 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Tapachula (Tapachula de Córdova y Ordóñez) (202,672), Puerto Madero (San Benito) (9,557), Vida Mejor I (6,460), Álvaro Obregón (5,717), Los Cafetales (3,054), Raymundo Enríquez (3,049), Carrillo Puerto (2,676), classified as urban, and Veinte de Noviembre (2,184), El Encanto (1,726), José María Morelos (1,717), Viva México (1,691), Llano de la Lima (1,579), Nuevo Pumpuapa (Cereso) (1,431), Cebadilla 1ra. Sección (1,384), Los Palacios (1,217), Congregación Reforma (1,132), Octavio Paz (1,124), Acaxman (1,099), San Nicolás Lagartero (1,071), Tinajas 1ra. Sección (1,055), Cantón Villaflor (1,046), Pavencul (1,039), and Cebadilla 2da. Sección (1,000), classified as rural.

The cuisine of the municipality varies greatly as the topography extends from the ocean into the mountains. Main annual events include Chinese New Year, San Benito, the Feria Tapachula, San Agustín, Jesús de la Buena Esperanza and San Miguel.

The population of the municipality represents about forty percent of the entire population of the Socunusco region. Over sixty percent of the population is under the age of thirty and the average age is twenty two years. The average rate of population growth is just over two percent, about on par with that of the state. Population density is only 3.17 people per square kilometer, far under the 52 per square km for the state. Because of its proximity to neighboring Guatemala, the Tapachula area has absorbed a number of ethnicities from this country but the main indigenous group remains the Mam. About sixty three percent of the municipality&#x27;s population is Catholic with about 19 percent professing some other type of Christianity. Most of the rest state that they have no faith. This is about average for the state.

Of those over age fifteen, about twenty percent have not finished primary school, about sixteen percent have only a primary school education, with about 49% with some level higher than this. As of 2000, the municipality had an illiteracy rate of 12.36%, down from 16.32% in 1990.

There are 578.84 kilometers of highway most of which are rural roads maintained by state and federal authorities. The main highway in the area is Federal Highway 200 which follows the coastline of Chiapas.

==History==
The name comes from the Nahuatl phrase “Tapachollan” which means ”between the waters”. The official name of the city was changed to &quot;Tapachula de Córdova y Ordóñez&quot; in 1997 in honor to priest Fray Matías de Córdova y Ordóñez.

The first people to settle in the area migrated from the south in Central America and most likely are the ancestors of today&#x27;s Mam people. The Olmecs dominated the area, driving many Mam to migrate back south. The Toltecs arrived next but never completely subjugated the native peoples. However, these conquests resulted in the Mam never developing major civilization. The city of Tapachula was founded as a tribute collection center for the Aztecs in 1486 by a military leader named Tiltototl, sent by Ahuitzotl to conquer the Soconusco.

The Soconusco region has produced cacao since 2000 BC. After the Spanish conquest, it was administered under the Kingdom of Guatemala. This region was larger than it is today, with the very south of the old extension now part of Guatemala. As such, Tapachula became a border area, first among the Spanish colonial authorities of New Spain, Chiapas and the Captaincy General of Guatemala. For example, when the Diocese of Chiapas was created in 1539, it included the Tapachula area. However, the Soconusco region had political differences with all of these authorities at one time or another. Tapachula became the capital of Soconusco region in 1794, replacing Escuintla. In 1809, shortly before the start of the Mexican War of Independence, Tapachula protested the high rate of taxation to Spanish authorities to no avail. During the war, it was officially declared a town in 1813, and a parish in 1818, with the San Agustín parish church established in 1819. At the end of the war, Tapachula, as capital of the Soconusco, declared its own independence from Spain and Guatemala in 1821, and away from Mexico in 1824. However, for most of the rest of the 19th century, the Soconusco would be disputed territory between Mexico (as part of Chiapas) and Guatemala, until a final border was drawn between the two countries in 1888. In the meantime, Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna declared Tapachula a city as he fought to force the region back under Mexican control. The city was occupied by French troops during the French Intervention in Mexico until 1865 when they were expelled by Sebastián Escobar.

The current municipality was created in 1915, with Tapachula as the governing entity. It was declared the provisional capital of Chiapas by forces loyal to Victoriano Huerta in 1924.

The first air route to the city was established in 1929, connecting it with Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Mexico City.

Tapachula became a diocese separate from Chiapas in 1957 covering the entire Chiapas coast area.

It was reaffirmed as the capital of the Soconusco region in 1983.

In 1984, a coat of arms was chosen for the city, designed by Edgar José Cabrera Arriaga.

The growth of the city and its economy has presented problems in the early 21st century. The city during this time has grown outward, surrounding industrial structures such as petroleum storage facilities belonging to PEMEX and a terminal of the Chiapas-Mayab railroad. This raised questions of safety until both were moved further outside of the city limits in 2011. (PEMEX is still inside the city; it has never been moved outside of the city.)

In September 2019, the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Chiapas unveiled a monument in a ceremony to commemorate the Bible at Los Cerritos Park. Dozens of local government officials, religious leaders, and church members attended the ceremony. The project and the monument were applauded as a community achievement and a historical moment that marks religious freedom. The intent of the project by the church was to recognize the Bible as the guide to the society and to bring awareness to the public in the reading of the Scriptures. The monument was the eighth memorial built by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Chiapas. Monuments were previously unveiled since 2018 in the following cities: Palenque, Hiuxtla, Malpaso, Pichucalco, Cintalapa, and Usumacinta.

Since Tapachula is a major border crossing between Mexico and Guatemala, it contains a substantial population of undocumented migrants from the Northern Triangle of Central America who are fleeing violence or unemployment in their home countries. The presence of this vulnerable population has made Tapachula a hub of human trafficking, both sex trafficking and labor trafficking.

==Sports==
From 2015, the Cafetaleros de Tapachula have represented the city in the Ascenso MX, the second division of Mexican football.

==Geography==
The municipality stretches over a section of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and west onto the coastal plain to the Pacific with an average altitude of above sea level. The main ecosystems in the municipality include low growth rainforest, medium growth rainforest and oak-pine forests. Many of these forest areas have been over exploited with significant loss of both plant and animal life. Ecological reserves include El Cabildo-Amatán, El Gancho-Murillo and part of the Tacaná Volcano.

===Climate===
The climate varies by altitude from hot in the low coastal areas to temperate in the higher elevations. There is a small area with a cold climate as part of the Tacaná Volcano. Precipitation also varies by altitude. The climate of the city area is hot and humid most of the year. The area is one of the rainiest in the world with annual rainfall in the mountains of about drained by a number of rivers and streams that flow from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas over the coastal plain to the Pacific Ocean. The main rivers are the Huehuetán, the Coatán and the Cuilco. There are eighty-two communities considered to be at high risk to natural disasters due to flooding of rivers and insufficient roadways to evacuate. Fifty-two of these located on riverbanks of three rivers: Coatán, Texcuyuapan and Cahoacán. Much of the flood control of the area was damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Stan in 2005.

==Economy==

The municipality is considered to have a medium level of socioeconomic marginalization. As of 2000, there were 61,444 residences, of which over 72% were the property of the residents. The average household size was 4.36 inhabitants. About one quarter of the homes have dirt floors, thirteen percent have wood floors and about sixty two with cement or stone floors. Walls generally consist of cement block with about fourteen percent having wood walls. About sixty percent of the roofs are made with metal/asbestos laminate.

Tapachula accounts for much of Chiapas&#x27; economic activities as the economic center of the Soconusco economic region and as a port for commerce between Mexico and Central America. Hurricane Stan severely damaged the rail line through here connecting Oaxaca and Chiapas with Guatemala, with repairs still ongoing as of 2011. Tapachula is served by commercial airlines using the Tapachula International Airport.

The first Feria Internacional Tapachula was held in 1963 with the name of Primera Gran Exposición Agrícola, Ganadera, Comercial e Industrial del Soconusco. It has been held yearly since then with participants from the region, the state of Chiapas, Mexico and other countries. The purpose of the fair is to promote the products of the region along with its cultural heritage.

About eighteen percent of the working population works in agriculture and livestock. About twenty three percent of these workers are not paid a salary. About sixteen and a half percent work in mining and manufacturing. The municipality is part of a region dedicated to the growing and export of cash crops, especially coffee and tropical fruit. The harvest cycles, along with the usual boom and bust economic cycles associated with such farming has spurred a worker migration pattern which has been studied.

About 63% of the municipality&#x27;s workforce is in commerce and services, well above the averages for the region and the state. This sector includes tourism. The city&#x27;s main attractions are in and around its main square called the Parque Miguel Hidalgo, with the rest of attractions located in or near the municipality. Most foreign visitors to the city are from Guatemala, which include those who come to visit the area&#x27;s beaches. Others mostly consist of those on their way to or from the same country. Despite the area&#x27;s economic connection with Guatemala, most businesses here do not accept the quetzal for payment. Area attractions within reach of the city and municipality include the Izapa archeological site, El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, the La Encrucijada Reserve, the Cuilco River cascades and the Tacaná Volcano.

Aside from the city, the other major economic center in the municipality is the new major port of Port Chiapas, with cruise ships beginning to stop here in 2007. This is part of a state and region led effort to attract visitors to area attractions, especially the Coffee Route. This has attracted German and other European visitors to see plantations started by their countrymen over a century ago. Other attractions marketed to cruise ship tourists include the city of Tapachula and the mangrove sanctuaries on the coast. About 45 cruise ships visited the port in 2011.

<doc id="194191" wikidata="Q202553" url="?curid=194191" title="Than Shwe">
<text>Than Shwe (; ; born 2 February 1933) is a retired Burmese army general who held influential positions within Myanmar&#x27;s government. Serving as the chairman of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) from 1992 to 2011, he played a significant role in shaping the country&#x27;s political landscape. During his tenure, he exercised considerable authority, contributing to a centralized power structure. His governance saw the implementation of various policies aimed at economic development, modernization and infrastructure improvements. Than Shwe was also involved in efforts to stabilize the country and manage internal conflicts. While his leadership was marked by significant achievements, it also faced scrutiny and criticism, particularly regarding allegations of human rights abuses and restrictions on political freedoms. Than Shwe&#x27;s tenure coincided with a period of political transition and international scrutiny, with Myanmar experiencing both internal and external challenges.

Occupying key positions, including Prime Minister of Myanmar, Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar Defence Services, and head of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), Than Shwe has elicited various perspectives on his governance. In March 2011, he officially stepped down as head of state, facilitating the transition to his chosen successor, Thein Sein. As the head of the Armed Forces, he was succeeded by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Than Shwe continues to wield significant influence within the military.

==Early life and education==
Than Shwe was born on 2 February 1933, in Minzu village, near Kyaukse, British Burma (now Myanmar), to his parents, Lay Myint and Seinn Yin. His early education led him to Government High School in Kyaukse, where he completed his studies in 1949. Following his education, he began his career as a postal clerk at the Meikhtila Post Office. However, his path shifted towards the military when he enlisted in the Burmese Army, joining the ninth intake of the Officers Training School, Bahtoo.

==Military career and rise to power==
After graduating from the Officer Training School, Second Lieutenant Than Shwe assumed the role of a squad leader in No. 1 Infantry Battalion on 11 July 1953. Progressing through the ranks, he was promoted to platoon commander in 1955 with the rank of lieutenant. On 21 February 1957, he advanced to the position of company commander within the same battalion, holding the rank of captain. He demonstrated early leadership and strategic capabilities during military operations in Karen State, Southern Shan State, and the Eastern Thanlwin area conducted by No. 1 Infantry Battalion.

On 26 February 1958, Than Shwe&#x27;s career took an international turn as he was assigned to the newly established Directorate of Education and Psychological warfare within the War Office. Between April 1958 and November 1958, he underwent specialized army officers&#x27; training in the Soviet Union, conducted by the KGB. Subsequently, on 9 December 1961, he assumed the role of a company commander in No. 1 Psychological Warfare Battalion under Northern Regional Military Command on 9 December 1961. He later became the psychological warfare officer of the 3rd Infantry Brigade on 4 December 1961. On 18 December 1963, he was transferred to Central Political College as an instructor. He was then posted to 101 Light Infantry Battalion as a temporary company commander for the battalion headquarters unit.

Promoted to the rank of major, Than Shwe joined the 77th (LID) Light Infantry Division on 27 January 1969. Between 1969 and 1971, he successfully completed the Higher Command and Staff Course at the Frunze Military Academy in the Soviet Union. During the tenure with the 77th LID, he actively participated in military operations across Karen State, Irrawaddy Delta region and Bago Hills. He was transferred to Operations Planning Department within the Office of Chief of Staff (Army) as a General Staff Officer (G2) on 16 December 1969. Than Shwe was nicknamed &#x27;the bulldog&#x27; in the military.

He assumed the role of a No. 1 Infantry Battalion on 23 August 1971 and earned a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel on 7 September 1972. As the commanding officer of No. 1 Infantry Battalion, he actively participated in offensive operations against various insurgents carried out by the 88th Light Infantry Division (LID) in the Bhamo region, Northern Shan State, Southern Shan State, and Eastern Shan State. Than Shwe was then transferred back to the Operations Planning Department within the Office of Chief of Staff (ARMY) as a General Staff Officer (G1) on 4 August 1975. On 26 March 1977, he attained the rank of a colonel and assumed the position of deputy commander of the 88th LID Light Infantry Division on 2 May 1978.

In March 1980, Than Shwe became commanding officer of the 88th LID. He oversaw various operations, including Operation Ye Naing Aung, Operation Nay Min Yang, and Operation Min Yan Aung, carried out by the 88th LID. In 1981, he was elected as a member of the ruling Burma Socialist Programme Party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee during the fourth session of the Party&#x27;s conference.

He took on the role of commanding officer at the Southern Western Regional Military Command on 22 July 1983 and subsequently became the chairman of Irrawaddy Division Party Committee on 5 August 1983. Than Shwe was promoted to brigadier general on 16 August 1984 and assumed the position of vice chief of staff (Army) on 4 November 1985.

Promoted to major general on 4 November 1986 and to lieutenant general on 4 November 1987, he assumed the position of Deputy Minister of Defence on 27 July 1988.

After the military coup on 18 September 1988, following the democracy uprising of 1988, Than Shwe became vice-chairman of State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), a 21-member military cabinet headed by Senior General Saw Maung. He was promoted to the rank of full general and assumed the positions of vice-commander in chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Army on 18 March 1990.

On 23 April 1992, Senior General Saw Maung unexpectedly resigned, citing health reasons. Than Shwe elevated himself to the rank of senior general and replaced Saw Maung as the head of the State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces.

==Style of leadership==

Than Shwe relaxed some state control over the economy, and was a supporter of Burma&#x27;s participation in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). He also oversaw a large crackdown on corruption, which saw the sackings of a number of cabinet ministers and regional commanders in 1997.

The convention for the &quot;Discipline Democracy New Constitution&quot; was convened from 9 January 1993 to 3 September 2007, a period of more than 14 years and 8 months. Although the main opposition party, National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won the multi-party democracy general election in 1990, did not participate, the chairman of National Convention Lieutenant General Thein Sein announced that the creation of the &quot;Constitution&quot; had been accomplished.

Than Shwe has continued the suppression of the free press in Burma, and has overseen the detention of journalists who oppose his regime. While he oversaw the release of Aung San Suu Kyi during the late 1990s, he also oversaw her return to detention in 2003. Despite his relaxation of some restrictions on Burma&#x27;s economy, his economic policies have been often criticized as ill-planned.

He maintains a low profile, often perceived as reserved and serious, with a reputation as a hardliner and a skilled manipulator. Some observers note that he opposes the democratization of Burma. He marks national holidays and ceremonies with messages in the state-run newspapers but rarely engages with the press. The lavish wedding of his daughter, involving diamonds and champagne, was particularly controversial in a country whose people continue to suffer enormous poverty and enforced austerity.

Power struggles have plagued Burma&#x27;s military leadership. Than Shwe has been linked to the toppling and arrest of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt in 2004, which has significantly increased his own power. The former premier, who said he supported Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s involvement in the National Convention, was seen as a moderate at odds with the junta&#x27;s hardliners.

Than Shwe is said to rely heavily on advice from his soothsayers, a style of ruling dating back to General Ne Win, a leader who once shot his mirror to avoid bad luck.

In May and November 2006 he met with the United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari in the newly built capital of Naypyidaw, which had replaced Yangon in the previous year, and permitted Gambari to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. However, Than Shwe refused to meet Gambari when he visited Burma in November 2007 and again on 10 March 2008.

In early May 2008, Than Shwe refused many foreign aid workers from entering the country in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis (2 May 2008). This led to many criticisms from the UN as well as the international community.

In early July 2009, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon visited Burma and held talks with Senior General Than Shwe. The military junta rejected UN Secretary General&#x27;s request to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. Than Shwe also commented on the upcoming 2010 Burmese election, saying that by the time the UN chief next visits Burma, &quot;I will be an ordinary citizen, a lay person, and my colleagues will too because it will be a civilian government.&quot;

On 27 August 2010, rumours surfaced that Than Shwe and his deputy, Vice-Senior General Maung Aye, along with six other top military officers, had resigned their military posts, and that he was expected to remain head of state until at least the end of the 2011 fiscal year, when he would transfer his position to the elected president. The rumor was proven false as the Burmese state media referred to him as &quot;Senior General&quot; three days later.

===Human rights controversies===
Than Shwe&#x27;s leadership has faced criticism for violence and human rights abuses. According to Amnesty International, human rights violation in Myanmar were described as &quot;widespread and systematic.&quot; Reports suggested that a significant number of Burmese individuals, potentially reaching up to a million, were allegedly subjected to forced labor in &quot;jungle gulags&quot;. The absence of free speech and intolerance towards dissent were notable characteristics of the government. In 2007, during the Saffron Revolution, mass demonstrations led by Buddhist monks were suppressed by security forces, resulting in casualties and detentions. Persistent rumors circulated that thousands of monks and others being rounded up and summarily executed, with their bodies reportedly dumped in the jungle.

In 1998 Than Shwe ordered the execution of 59 civilians living on Christie Island. The local commander initially hesitated, expressing concerns about the issuing commander&#x27;s alleged intoxication, but was informed that the instruction came from &quot;Aba Gyi&quot; or &quot;Great Father&quot;—a term used to refer to Senior General Than Shwe.

==Health and family==
Than Shwe&#x27;s wife, Kyaing Kyaing, is of Chinese and Pa&#x27;O descent. They have five daughters, Aye Aye Thit Shwe, Dewa Shwe, Khin Pyone Shwe, Kyi Kyi Shwe, and Thandar Shwe, and three sons, Kyaing San Shwe, Thant Zaw Shwe and Htun Naing Shwe.
Than Shwe is known to be a diabetic, and he is rumored to have intestinal cancer. Little else is known about his private life as he rarely makes public appearances or discloses personal information.

Than Shwe flew to Singapore on 31 December 2006. Concerns about Than&#x27;s health intensified after he failed to appear at an official Independence Day dinner for military leaders, officials, and diplomats on 4 January 2007. It was the first time since he took power in 1992 that Shwe did not host the annual dinner. Than Shwe had checked out of the Singapore General Hospital, where he had been receiving treatment, and returned to Burma two weeks later.

In 2006, a home video footage of the wedding of Than Shwe&#x27;s daughter, Thandar Shwe, was leaked on the Internet, which sparked controversy and criticism from Burmese and foreign media for the lavish and seemingly ostentatious reception. After days of Saffron Revolution, there were unconfirmed reports that Than Shwe&#x27;s wife and pets fled the country on 27 September 2007, possibly to Laos.

In January 2009, Than Shwe was talked into buying one of the world&#x27;s most popular football clubs, Manchester United, for $1 billion by his favourite grandson Nay Shwe Thway Aung. However, he reportedly abandoned the plan, because such an investment only months after nearly 150,000 people were killed by Cyclone Nargis was deemed inappropriate.

In August 2021, Than Shwe and his wife tested positive for COVID-19. They have been warded at the 1,000-bed military-owned hospital in Thaik Chaung.

On 23 October 2024, a significant event unfolded when Nay Soe Maung, Than Shwe&#x27;s son-in-law married to Kyi Kyi Shwe, was detained by Myanmar&#x27;s current military government in Pyigyidagun Township, Mandalay. A medical doctor and former military officer, Nay Soe Maung is also the father of Nay Shwe Thway Aung, Than Shwe&#x27;s grandson. The authorities cited concerns over his social media activities, claiming they disrupted public order and incited unrest. This arrest has drawn attention, particularly given Nay Soe Maung&#x27;s previous criticisms of the military’s response to civil resistance after the 2021 coup.

The incident reflects the ongoing tensions within Myanmar’s military elite and raises questions about the enduring influence of Than Shwe&#x27;s legacy. Despite his past ties to the current leadership, Nay Soe Maung&#x27;s situation highlights that familial connections do not guarantee protection in the current political landscape.

In a show of support for his father, Nay Shwe Thway Aung posted on his Facebook story on 26 October 2024: &quot;Doing such things makes the people suffer... Let&#x27;s think carefully,&quot; and in Burmese: &quot;အဲ့လိုတွေလုပ်လေပြည်သူကနာကျည်းလေ.. စဉ်းစားချင့်ချိန်လုပ်ကြပါ..&quot; This statement underscores the challenges facing those within the former ruling elite as they navigate the complexities of the current military regime.

==&quot;Yadaya&quot; rituals==
Than Shwe often performed superstitious &quot;yadaya&quot; rituals to maintain his power and followed the advice of astrologers and shamans. A seated jade Buddha statue that Than Shwe had carved in his image was erected in 1999 at the southern entrance of Shwedagon pagoda. It is on a list of unorthodox statues drawn up by the religious affairs ministry. Former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and Chinese president Xi Jinping are among those who have paid respects at the statue during visits to Yangon.

As a notoriously superstitious, the unusual clothing choices, namely the wearing of traditional female &quot;acheik&quot;-patterned longyi (sarongs) by Than Shwe and other military generals at public appearances, including Union Day celebrations in February 2011 and at the reception of the Lao Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh in June 2011 have also been attributed to yadaya, as a way to divert power to neutralize Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s power.

<text>Clare Short (born 15 February 1946) is a British politician who served as Secretary of State for International Development from 1997 to 2003.

Short began her career as a civil servant. A member of the Labour Party until 2006, she was Member of Parliament for Birmingham Ladywood from 1983 to 2010. For most of this period, she was a Labour Party MP.

Following the 1997 United Kingdom general election, Short was made the first cabinet-level Secretary of State for International Development. She resigned from the cabinet over the Iraq War. She also resigned the party whip in 2006 and served the remainder of her term as an independent politician, leaving parliament at the 2010 general election.

==Early and personal life==
Short was born in Birmingham in 1946 to Irish Catholic parents from County Armagh, Northern Ireland. She attended St Paul&#x27;s School for Girls in Birmingham.

She was later supportive of peaceful Sinn Féin initiatives, but never a supporter of IRA violence, some of the worst of which was inflicted in a 1974 bombing of her home city of Birmingham.

Completing her degree in political science at the University of Leeds, she became a civil servant working for the Home Office. Working as Private Secretary to the Conservative minister Mark Carlisle gave her the idea that she &quot;could do better&quot; than many of the MPs she dealt with, and at the 1983 general election she was elected as MP for the Birmingham Ladywood constituency, the area where she had grown up.

Short is a paternal cousin of Canadian actor Martin Short.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===

At the start of her career, she was firmly on the left-wing of the Labour Party. She gained some notoriety shortly after her election in 1983 when she implied the government&#x27;s Employment minister Alan Clark was drunk at the despatch box. Clark&#x27;s colleagues on the government benches in turn accused Short of using unparliamentary language and the Deputy Speaker, Ernest Armstrong, asked her to withdraw her accusation. Clark later admitted in his diaries that Short had been correct in her assessment.

In 1986, Short introduced a Private Members Bill in the House of Commons which proposed banning &quot;Page 3&quot; photographs of topless models featured in &quot;The Sun&quot; and other British tabloid newspapers. In order to ensure her motion would be tabled, she slept in Parliament overnight. For this Private Members Bill, she was nicknamed by The Sun &quot;killjoy Clare&quot; and &quot;Crazy Clare.&quot; One paper bought and published alleged photographs of Short in her nightwear from her ex-husband. She stated they were pictures of somebody else&#x27;s body with her face superimposed. The Sun also sent a busload of Page 3 models to her home where she lived with her elderly mother. Clare gave a definitive account of her attitude towards tabloid nudity and the negative role that pornography plays more generally in society in her introduction to the book &quot;Dear Clare&quot; (1991), which presents a selection of the many letters of support she received from women in response to her campaign.

She supported John Prescott in the Labour Party deputy leadership election in 1988 (against Eric Heffer and the incumbent Roy Hattersley), leaving the Socialist Campaign Group, along with Margaret Beckett, as a result of Tony Benn&#x27;s decision to challenge Neil Kinnock for the party leadership. She supported Margaret Beckett for the Labour leadership in 1994 against Tony Blair and John Prescott. She also called for the withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland.

In 1989 she raised the issue of abuse of police procedure and fabrication of evidence at the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, relaying concerns of Birmingham solicitors that many miscarriages of justice had taken place.

She rose through the ranks of the Labour Front Bench, despite twice resigning from it – over the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 1988, and over the Gulf War in 1990. She became Shadow Minister for Women (1993–1995), Shadow Transport Secretary (1995–1996) and Opposition Spokesperson for Overseas Development (1996–1997). Clare was also a member of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) from 1988 to 1997 and Chair of the NEC&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Committee (1993–1996). At the 1995 Labour Party conference, Short denounced Liz Davies as &quot;unsuitable&quot; after Davies had been selected as a Parliamentary candidate by a constituency Labour Party in Leeds North-East. This was seen as an attempt to win the favour of the right-wing of the party, especially then-leader Tony Blair. However, in 1996, Short was moved to the Overseas Development portfolio, a move which she saw as a demotion. Short also called for the legalisation of cannabis.

===Secretary of State for International Development===
Following the 1997 general election, the Overseas Development Administration was given full departmental status as the Department for International Development, with Short as the first cabinet-level Secretary of State for International Development. She retained this post throughout the first term of the Labour government, and beyond the 2001 general election into the second.

On her appointment to the DfID, journalists asked Short whether she would be &quot;good&quot; (in other words, not cause embarrassment to the government). She replied &quot;I&#x27;m going to try to be good but I can&#x27;t help it, I have to be me.&quot; A few months later, the island of Montserrat (one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s few remaining overseas territories) was devastated by a volcanic eruption which rendered half the island uninhabitable; when the 4,500 islanders asked for more help from the DfID, Short was reported to have remarked &quot;they will be asking for golden elephants next&quot; and refused to visit the island. This remark caused great offence to the Montserratians and others; Labour MP Bernie Grant said that &quot;She sounds like a mouthpiece for an old nineteenth century colonial and Conservative government.&quot;

====Land reform in Zimbabwe====
On 6 November 1997, Short sent a letter to Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Agriculture of Zimbabwe, in which she stated that &quot;we do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe.&quot; She went on to write &quot;We are a new government from diverse backgrounds, without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and, as you know, we were colonised, not colonisers.&quot; In the same letter she did, however, offer qualified support for land reform: &quot;We do recognise the very real issues you face over land reform... we would be prepared to support a programme of land reform that was part of a poverty eradication strategy, but not on any other basis.&quot; This letter caused a rift with the Zimbabwean government, which asserted that the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 had contained a pledge from the United Kingdom government to assist in land reform.

====Position on the arms trade====
In December 1997, Short signed the UK into the Ottawa Convention, banning the production, handling and use of anti-personnel mines.

In 2001, she wrote that the &quot;ready availability of small arms has a direct and negative impact upon levels of crime and conflict in developing countries. We (the DFID) are supporting various peace building and disarmament initiatives.&quot; The following year, she claimed that Britain was &quot;committed to combating small arms availability and misuse.&quot;

====Kosovo bombing====
Short approved of the 1999 NATO bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state television, in which sixteen media workers were killed and sixteen others wounded, because the station was, as she put it, &quot;a source of propaganda&quot;.

====Resignation====
On 9 March 2003, Short repeatedly called Tony Blair &quot;reckless&quot; in a BBC radio interview and threatened to resign from the Cabinet in the event of the UK Government going to war with Iraq without a clear mandate from the United Nations. This looked set to be a reprise of her previous resignation as party spokesperson during the Gulf War of 1991 as a protest against the Labour Party&#x27;s stance, although in 1999 she had publicly supported the NATO attack on Serbia. However, on 18 March she announced that she would remain in the Cabinet and support the government&#x27;s resolution in the House of Commons.

Short remained in the Cabinet for two months following her decision to back the 2003 Iraq War. She resigned on 12 May. In her resignation statement in the House of Commons the following day she stated: &quot;In both the run-up to the war and now, I think the UK is making grave errors in providing cover for the US mistakes rather than helping an old friend... American power alone cannot make America safe... But undermining international law and the authority of the UN creates the risk of instability, bitterness and growing terrorism that will threaten the future for all of us.&quot;

Her later, Conservative, successor in the post, Andrew Mitchell, described her as &quot;a brilliant development secretary&quot;.

===Backbenches===
====Bugging of the UN====

On 26 February 2004, Short alleged on the BBC &quot;Today&quot; radio programme that British spies regularly intercept UN communications, including those of Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General. The claim was made the day after the unexplained dropping of whistleblowing charges against former GCHQ translator Katharine Gun. Reacting to Short&#x27;s statement, Tony Blair said &quot;I really do regard what Clare Short has said this morning as totally irresponsible, and entirely consistent [with Short&#x27;s character].&quot; Blair also claimed that Short had put British security, particularly the security of its spies, at risk. The same day, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme, Short called Blair&#x27;s response &quot;pompous&quot; and said that Britain had no need to spy on Kofi Annan. Blair did not explicitly deny the claims, but Robin Cook, the former Foreign Secretary, wrote that in his experience he would be surprised if the claims were true.

A few days later, on 29 February, Short appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Dimbleby&quot; programme, on which she revealed that she had been written to by Britain&#x27;s most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Andrew Turnbull. Turnbull&#x27;s confidential letter (which Short showed to Dimbleby, and which was quoted on the programme) formally admonished her for discussing intelligence matters in the media, and threatened &quot;further action&quot; if she did not desist from giving interviews on the issue. Turnbull wrote that she had made claims &quot;which damage the interests of the United Kingdom&quot;, and that he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot;. The &quot;further action&quot; referred to in the letter has been interpreted as threatening either Short&#x27;s expulsion from the Privy Council or legal action under the Official Secrets Act. Either course of action have been without recent precedent; at the time, no Privy Counsellor had been expelled since Sir Edgar Speyer was accused of collaborating with the Germans during the First World War. On 1 March 2004, a Downing Street spokesman refused to rule out such a step.

However, in the same interview with Jonathan Dimbleby, Short backtracked on her claim about British agents bugging Annan. She admitted that the transcripts she saw of Annan&#x27;s private conversations might have related to Africa and not to Iraq.
Asked whether she could confirm that the transcripts related to Iraq, she said: &quot;I can&#x27;t, but there might well have been ... I cannot remember a specific transcript in relation, it doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t there.&quot; Short also admitted that her original claim, on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, that Britain had eavesdropped on Annan, may have been inaccurate. Asked whether the material could have passed to the British by the Americans, she said: &quot;It could. But it normally indicates that. But I can&#x27;t remember that.&quot;

====Book====
Clare Short&#x27;s book, &quot;An Honourable Deception?: New Labour, Iraq, and the Misuse of Power&quot;, was released by Free Press in November 2004. It was an account of her career in New Labour, most notably her relationship with Prime Minister Tony Blair, the relationship between Blair and Gordon Brown and the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The book won Channel 4&#x27;s Political Book of the Year Award for 2004.

In December 2004, Short was reportedly critical of US efforts to dispense aid to countries devastated by a tsunami caused by a massive earthquake in the Indian Ocean. She was quoted as stating that the formation of a group of countries led by the United States for this purpose was a challenge to the role of the United Nations, which she believed was uniquely qualified for the task.

====Statements on Israel====

Short has condemned Israel as being guilty of &quot;bloody, brutal and systematic annexation of land, destruction of homes and the deliberate creation of an apartheid system.&quot; She has also stated that &quot;the EU and Britain are colluding in this operation and the building of a new apartheid regime&quot; because they give Israel privileged trade access.
Short has expressed support for a boycott of Israel, stating at the 2007 United Nations International Conference of Civil Society in Support of Israeli-Palestinian Peace that &quot;The boycott worked for South Africa, it is time to do it again&quot;. She also told the conference that Israel is &quot;much worse than the original apartheid state&quot; and that Israel &quot;undermines the international community&#x27;s reaction to global warming&quot;.

====Relationship with al-Manar Television====

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Short accepted £1,580 worth of flights, hotel accommodation, food and travel expenses from al-Manar Television in Lebanon in 2008. Al-Manar is described by the US government as &quot;the media arm of the Hezbollah terrorist network&quot;, and was classed as a specially designated terrorist entity by the US in 2006.

Short said her trip had been registered with Commons authorities and that the visit allowed her to see how reconstruction in southern Lebanon was proceeding after the country&#x27;s conflict with Israel in 2006.

====Announced retirement====
On 12 September 2006, Short announced that she would not be standing at the next general election. In a brief statement, Short said she was &quot;ashamed&quot; of Tony Blair&#x27;s government and backed proportional representation, which she hoped would be achieved through a hung parliament. The Labour Party Chief Whip referred the matter to the Labour Party National Executive Committee to consider disciplinary action. On Friday 20 October, Short resigned the Labour whip and announced that she would sit as an Independent Labour MP. Short received a written reprimand from Labour&#x27;s Chief Whip shortly before the news of her resignation of the party whip was announced.

After Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair as Prime Minister, Short said that the change offered &quot;a new beginning&quot;, and hinted that she might re-join the parliamentary Labour Party if Brown changed the policies that had caused her to leave.

====Chilcot Inquiry====
On 2 February 2010, Short appeared before the Chilcot Inquiry into Iraq. During this she repeatedly criticised Tony Blair, Attorney General Peter Goldsmith and others in the UK Government for allegedly deceiving her and other MPs in an attempt to obtain consent for the invasion of Iraq.

==After Parliament==
=== Chairwoman of the EITI ===
On 1 March 2011, she was elected as Chairwoman of the EITI (the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) at the EITI Global Conference in Paris.

=== Policy work with Cities Alliance ===
Since 2006, Short has been a member of the Cities Alliance Policy Advisory Board and subsequently chaired the Policy Advisory Forum, described as a &quot;platform for public discussion, debate and knowledge sharing&quot; on urban poverty and the role of cities.

=== Birmingham Mayoral candidate consideration ===
In January 2011, Short expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for the Mayor of Birmingham, pending the outcome of a referendum on the creation of a directly-elected mayoralty in the city. Ultimately, the proposal was defeated at a public vote in May 2012.

=== Ebor Lectures ===
On 21 May 2008, Short gave a lecture as part of the Ebor Lectures 2008 Series entitled &quot;Apocalypse Now – Global Equity and Sustainable Living, the Preconditions for Human Survival&quot;. She spoke of the need to end the &quot;throw-away society&quot;. She considered the changing conception of the world since the 1960s and emphasised the need for us to consider the consequences of today&#x27;s environmental concerns for the generations of the future.

==Cultural collaborations==
Since 2018, Short has collaborated with public artist Martin Firrell. Firrell has quoted Short on billboards displayed across the UK. For the artist&#x27;s &quot;Power and Gender&quot; series (2019), Short contributed the text, &#x27;Distorted Power and Great Inequality Are Evil&#x27;.

The &quot;Union City&quot; series (2019) included Short&#x27;s observation that &#x27;Socialism Is A Moral Idea&#x27;. Short explained: &quot;People want to make socialism mean the Soviet Union and so on, but it also meant Clement Attlee becoming British Prime Minister in 1945, and the development of the welfare state across Europe after the war: actions that produced the best and most civilised time we have ever experienced. And what has capitalism meant? The Chilean dictator Pinochet, slavery, famine! My point is that socialism is first and foremost a moral idea not an economic system.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Short was briefly married to a fellow Keele University student at 18 after they had a baby when she was 17. The couple&#x27;s son was given up for adoption, and did not make contact with his mother until 1996. She then discovered that her son, Toby, was a Conservative supporter who worked as a solicitor in the City of London, and had three children.

In 1981, Short married Alex Lyon, a Labour MP and minister she had worked with whilst at the Home Office. Two years later, she was elected in Birmingham Ladywood, on the same day that Lyon lost his seat.

In 1993, Short was called away from the Labour party conference to hear that her husband was very ill and likely to die. In her book &quot;An Honourable Deception&quot;, she describes how &quot;after losing his parliamentary seat, he moved from being a senior Labour MP to running my constituency office where he gave me enormous support as well as bringing great experience to the task. Later he decided to return to the Bar, but after a time got himself into various difficulties and I began to suspect that either he was suffering a deep depression or mental deterioration. The next few years were very difficult as he engaged in strange, inexplicable behaviour. He gradually fell out with family and friends and stayed home with our St Bernard called Fred and would deal with no one but Fred and me.&quot; Lyon died in Milton Keynes that year from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease aged 61 and was survived by his two sons Marcus and Adrian, and a daughter, Rebecca, all from a previous marriage.

Short is paternal first cousins with actor Martin Short.

==Awards==
In June 2009, Short received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Ulster in recognition of her services to international development. In 2013, she was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 women&quot;.
