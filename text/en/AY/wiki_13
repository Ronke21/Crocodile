<text>RV &quot;Calypso&quot; is a former British Royal Navy minesweeper converted into a research vessel for the oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau, equipped with a mobile laboratory for underwater field research. She was severely damaged in 1996 and was planned to undergo a complete refurbishment in 2009–2011 that has not been accomplished. The ship is named after the Greek mythological figure Calypso.

==World War II British minesweeper (1941–1947)==
&quot;Calypso&quot; was originally a minesweeper built by the Ballard Marine Railway Company of Seattle, Washington, United States for the United States Navy for loan to the British Royal Navy under lend-lease. A wooden-hulled vessel, she is built of Oregon pine.

She was a British yard minesweeper (BYMS) Mark 1 class motor minesweeper, laid down on 12 August 1941 with yard designation &quot;BYMS-26&quot; and launched on 21 March 1942. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy in February 1943 as HMS &quot;J-826&quot; and assigned to active service in the Mediterranean Sea, based in Malta, and was reclassified as BYMS-2026 in 1944. Following the end of World War II, she was decommissioned in July 1946 and laid up at Malta. On 1 August 1947 she was formally handed back to the US Navy and then struck from the US Naval Register, remaining in lay-up.

==Maltese ferry (1949–1950)==
In May 1949 she was bought by Joseph Gasan of Malta, who had secured the mail contract on the ferry route between Marfa, in the north of Malta, and Mġarr, Gozo, in the south of Malta, in 1947. She was converted to a ferry and renamed &quot;Calypso G&quot; after the nymph Calypso, whose island of Ogygia was mythically associated with Gozo, entering service in March 1950. After only four months on the route, Gasan received an attractive offer and sold her.

==Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s &quot;Calypso&quot; (1950–1997)==
The British millionaire and former Member of Parliament (MP), Thomas Loel Guinness bought &quot;Calypso&quot; in July 1950. He leased her to Cousteau for a symbolic one franc a year. He had two conditions: that Cousteau never ask him for money and that he never reveal his identity, which only came out after Cousteau&#x27;s death. Cousteau restructured and transformed the ship into an expedition vessel and support base for diving, filming and oceanographic research. One of the more unusual expeditions involving the vessel was a survey of Abu Dhabi waters conducted by Cousteau on behalf of British Petroleum (BP) in 1954 the first and last time it was used for an oil survey.

&quot;Calypso&quot; carried advanced equipment, including one- and two-man mini submarines developed by Cousteau, diving saucers, and underwater scooters. The ship was also fitted with a see-through &quot;nose&quot; and an observation chamber below the waterline, and was modified to house scientific equipment and a helicopter pad. The Calypso underwater camera is named after this ship.

On 8 January 1996, a barge accidentally rammed &quot;Calypso&quot; and sank her in the port of Singapore. On 16 January, she was raised by a crane, patched, and pumped dry before being put in a shipyard.

==Restoration (1997–present)==

&quot;Calypso&quot; was later towed to the Maritime Museum of La Rochelle in 1998 to be an exhibit.

A legal dispute between Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s widow, Francine Cousteau, and Loel Guinness, the grandson of the original owner, delayed restoration work. During this time the city of La Rochelle withdrew its funding for the restoration. &quot;Calypso&quot; remained in disrepair.

In 2002, Alexandra Cousteau, Cousteau&#x27;s granddaughter from his first marriage, tried to become involved in the restoration. The Cousteau Society, controlled by Francine Cousteau, reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend Francine&#x27;s exclusive use of the name and to prevent Alexandra&#x27;s participation in the restoration of &quot;Calypso&quot;.

In 2006 Loel Guinness transferred ownership of &quot;Calypso&quot; to the Cousteau Society for the sum of one euro. In October 2007 the ship was began at the Piriou Shipyard. Work on &quot;Calypso&quot; stopped in 2009 because of the non-payment of bills by Francine Cousteau. Piriou claimed to be owed €850,000 for work already done. The Cousteau Society counter-sued for defective work. In 2015 a French court ordered Francine Cousteau to settle outstanding yard bills and remove &quot;Calypso&quot; from a Brittany shipyard or allow the shipyard to sell the vessel.

The Cousteau Society announced in 2016 that a solution had been found to allow the ship to return to service with new engines. In 2017 a fire damaged new wooden parts of the Calypso at a shipyard near Istanbul, Turkey, where her refitting had been in progress.

==&quot;Calypso&quot; in popular culture==
* &quot;Calypso&quot; was the main ship in all three feature documentary films that Cousteau directed in his career: &quot;The Silent World&quot; (1956, awarded with the Academy Award for Documentary Feature and the 1956 Palme d&#x27;Or), &quot;World Without Sun&quot; (1964, which also won the Academy Award for Documentary Feature) and &quot;Voyage to the Edge of the World&quot; (1976).
* John Denver wrote a 1975 hit song &quot;Calypso&quot; as a tribute to &quot;Calypso&quot; and her crew. Additionally, he gave all the royalties for the song to the Cousteau Society.
* Jean Michel Jarre wrote a three part composition in tribute to the ship included on the album &quot;Waiting for Cousteau&quot; (1990).
* American heavy metal band GWAR wrote a song entitled &quot;Je M&#x27;Appelle J. Cousteau&quot;, which was featured on their album &quot;Hell-O&quot;, originally released in 1988. It is not entirely clear whether this song is in tribute or slander, but the song is entirely about Jacques Cousteau and his ship &quot;Calypso&quot;.
* The Captain&#x27;s yacht of the USS &quot;Enterprise-D&quot;, on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, was named &quot;Calypso&quot; by actor Patrick Stewart. He also gave the name &quot;Cousteau&quot; to the captain&#x27;s yacht of the USS &quot;Enterprise-E&quot; in homage to the &quot;Calypso&quot;″s famous former captain.
* Wes Anderson directed a film homage of Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s life called &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. In the movie, Zissou travels the seas in a ship called &quot;Belafonte&quot;. This is an oblique reference to Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s ship &quot;Calypso&quot;. Harry Belafonte is a noted musician who is arguably the best known exponent of calypso music; his 1956 album &quot;Calypso&quot; is the first LP record to sell one million copies. While in the film, &quot;Belafonte&quot; is described as a &quot;long-range sub-hunter&quot;, like &quot;Calypso&quot; she was also a former British minesweeper, the Ton-class .
* NASA astronaut Sunita Williams bestowed the name &quot;Calypso&quot; on the third Boeing Starliner space capsule built for the Commercial Crew Program after the ship.
* The character Rebecca from the television series &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot; is based on &quot;Calypso&quot;.

<doc id="188359" wikidata="Q11109" url="?curid=188359" title="John Paul Stevens">
<text>John Paul Stevens (April 20, 1920 – July 16, 2019) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1975 to 2010. At the time of his retirement, he was the second-oldest justice in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court and the third-longest-serving justice. At the time of his death in 2019 at age 99, he was the longest-lived Supreme Court justice ever. His long tenure saw him write for the Court on most issues of American law, including civil liberties, the death penalty, government action, and intellectual property. Despite being a registered Republican who throughout his life identified as a conservative, Stevens was considered to have been on the liberal side of the Court at the time of his retirement.

Born in Chicago, Stevens served in the United States Navy during World War II and graduated from Northwestern University School of Law. After clerking for Justice Wiley Rutledge, he co-founded a law firm in Chicago, focusing on antitrust law. In 1970, President Richard Nixon appointed Stevens to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Five years later, President Gerald Ford successfully nominated Stevens to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Justice William O. Douglas. He became the senior associate justice after the retirement of Harry Blackmun in 1994. After the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Stevens briefly acted in the capacity of Chief Justice before the appointment of John Roberts. Stevens retired in 2010 during the administration of President Barack Obama and was succeeded by Elena Kagan.

Stevens&#x27;s majority opinions in landmark cases include &quot;Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council&quot;, &quot;Apprendi v. New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, &quot;NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.&quot;, &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot;, &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, &quot;U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton&quot;, and &quot;Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency&quot;. Stevens is also known for his dissents in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, &quot;Bethel v. Fraser&quot;, &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, &quot;Printz v. United States&quot;, and &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and education (1920–1947) ===
Stevens was born on April 20, 1920, in Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois, to a wealthy family. His paternal grandfather had formed an insurance company and held real estate in Chicago, and his granduncle owned the Chas A. Stevens department store. His father, Ernest James Stevens (1884–1972), was a lawyer who later became an hotelier, owning two hotels: the La Salle and the Stevens Hotel. The family lost ownership of the hotels during the Great Depression, and Stevens&#x27;s father, grandfather, and an uncle were charged with embezzlement; the Illinois Supreme Court later overturned the conviction, criticizing the prosecution. His mother, Elizabeth Street Stevens (1881–1979), was a high school English teacher. Two of his three older brothers also became lawyers.

A lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, Stevens was 12 when he attended the 1932 World Series between the Yankees and the Cubs in Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field, in which Babe Ruth allegedly called his shot. Stevens later recalled: &quot;Ruth did point to the center-field scoreboard. And he did hit the ball out of the park after he pointed with his bat, so it really happened.&quot; He also had the opportunity to meet several notable people of the era, including the famed aviators Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh, the latter of whom gave him a caged dove as a gift.

The family lived in Hyde Park, and Stevens attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools where he graduated in 1937. He later attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in English, was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated with highest honors in 1941. While in college, Stevens also became a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity.

He began work on his master&#x27;s degree in English at the university in 1941 but soon decided to join the United States Navy. He enlisted on December 6, 1941, one day before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and served as an intelligence officer in the Pacific Theater from 1942 to 1945. Stevens was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in the codebreaking team whose work led to the downing of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s plane in 1943 (Operation Vengeance). He also earned the World War II Victory Medal and later received the highest United States civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from former President Barack Obama.

Stevens married Elizabeth Jane Shereen in June 1942. Divorcing her in 1979, he married Maryan Mulholland Simon that December; that marriage lasted until Simon&#x27;s death in 2015 following complications from hip surgery. He had four children: John Joseph (who died of cancer in 1996), Kathryn (who died in 2018), Elizabeth, and Susan.

With the end of World War II, Stevens returned to Illinois, intending to return to his studies in English, but was persuaded by his brother Richard, who was a lawyer, to attend law school. Stevens enrolled in the Northwestern University School of Law in 1945, with the G.I. Bill paying most of his tuition. Stevens graduated in 1947 ranked first in his class with a J.D. &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, having earned the highest GPA in the school&#x27;s history.

=== Legal career, 1947–1970 ===
After receiving high recommendations from several Northwestern faculty members, Stevens served as a law clerk to Supreme Court justice Wiley Rutledge during the 1947–48 term.

Following his clerkship, Stevens returned to Chicago and joined the law firm of Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson &amp; Raymond (now Jenner &amp; Block). Stevens was admitted to the bar in 1949. He determined that he would not stay long at the Poppenhusen firm after being docked his pay for the day he took off to travel to Springfield to swear his oath of admission. During his time at the firm, Stevens began his practice in antitrust law.

In 1951, he returned to Washington, DC, to serve as associate counsel to the Subcommittee on the Study of Monopoly Power of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. During this time, the subcommittee worked on several highly publicized investigations in many industries, most notably Major League Baseball.

In 1952, Stevens returned to Chicago and, together with two other young lawyers with whom he had worked at Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson &amp; Raymond, formed his own law firm: Rothschild, Stevens, Barry &amp; Myers. It soon developed into a successful practice, with Stevens continuing to focus on antitrust cases. His growing expertise in antitrust law led to an invitation to teach the &quot;Competition and Monopoly&quot; course at the University of Chicago Law School, and from 1953 to 1955, he was a member of the Attorney General&#x27;s National Committee to Study Antitrust Laws. At the same time, Stevens was making a name for himself as a first-rate antitrust litigator and was involved in a number of trials. He was widely regarded by colleagues as an extraordinarily capable and impressive lawyer with a fantastic memory and analytical ability, and authored a number of influential works on antitrust law.

In 1969, the Greenberg Commission, appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court to investigate Sherman Skolnick&#x27;s corruption allegations leveled at former chief justice Ray Klingbiel and then-current chief justice Roy Solfisburg, named Stevens as its counsel, meaning that he essentially served as the commission&#x27;s special prosecutor. The commission was widely thought to be a whitewash, but Stevens proved them wrong by vigorously prosecuting the justices, forcing them from office in the end. As a result of the prominence he gained during the Greenberg Commission, Stevens became the second vice president of the Chicago Bar Association in 1970.

=== Judicial career, 1970–2010 ===

Stevens&#x27;s role in the Greenberg Commission catapulted him to prominence and was largely responsible for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s decision to appoint Stevens as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 1970. His nomination was put forth by a former University of Chicago classmate, Illinois Senator Charles H. Percy.

On November 28, 1975, President Gerald Ford nominated Stevens as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to a seat vacated by William O. Douglas. Again, it was Percy who suggested Stevens; the nomination was also strongly supported by Attorney General Edward Levi, former president of the University of Chicago. He was sworn into office December 19, 1975, after being confirmed 98–0 by the U.S. Senate two days before.

When Harry Blackmun retired in 1994, Stevens became the senior associate justice and thus assumed the administrative duties of the Court whenever the post of Chief Justice of the United States was vacant or the chief justice was unable to perform his duties. Stevens performed the duties of chief justice in September 2005, between the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the swearing-in of his replacement, John Roberts, and presided over oral arguments on a number of occasions when the chief justice was ill or recused. Also in September 2005, Stevens was honored with a symposium by Fordham Law School for his 30 years on the Supreme Court, and President Ford wrote a letter stating his continued pride in appointing him.

In a 2005 speech, Stevens stressed the importance of &quot;learning on the job&quot;; for example, during his tenure on the Court, Stevens changed his views on affirmative action (which he initially opposed), as well as on other issues. President Ford praised Stevens in 2005: &quot;He is serving his nation well, with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.&quot;

Additionally, he participated actively in questioning during oral arguments. Stevens was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. That same year he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

On January 20, 2009, Stevens administered the oath of office to Vice President Joe Biden at Biden&#x27;s request. It is customary for the vice president to be inaugurated by the person of their choice.

On April 9, 2010, Stevens announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court; he subsequently retired on June 29 of that year. Stevens said that his decision to retire from the Court was initially triggered when he stumbled on several sentences when delivering his oral dissent in the 2010 landmark case &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;. Stevens said &quot;I took that as a warning sign that maybe I&#x27;ve been around longer than I should.&quot;

=== Tenure and age ===

Stevens retired on June 29, 2010, as the third-longest-serving justice in the history of the Supreme Court with 34 years and six months of service and just three days short of tying the tenure of the second-longest serving justice in history, Stephen Johnson Field, who had retired on December 1, 1897. The longest-serving justice is Stevens&#x27;s immediate predecessor, Justice William O. Douglas, who served 36 years and retired on November 12, 1975. He was the last sitting Supreme Court justice to serve on the Burger Court.

Stevens was also the second-oldest justice, at age 90 years and two months at retirement, behind Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. who retired at the age of 90 years and 10 months on January 12, 1932. On July 23, 2015, Stevens became the longest-lived retired justice, surpassing Stanley Forman Reed who died at age 95 years and 93 days on April 2, 1980.

On June 26, 2015, Stevens attended the Court&#x27;s announcement of the opinion in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, in which the Court ruled 5–4 that recognition of same-sex marriage is protected under the Constitution&#x27;s Fourteenth Amendment.

=== Political affiliation ===
When he was appointed to the Supreme Court, Stevens was a registered Republican. In September 2007, he was a sitting Justice when he was asked if he still considered himself a Republican. Stevens replied, &quot;That&#x27;s the kind of issue I shouldn&#x27;t comment on, either in private or in public.&quot; Stevens was generally considered to be one of the last-surviving Rockefeller Republicans.

Abner Mikva, a close friend, said that as a judge, Stevens refused to discuss politics. &quot;He was more particular about it than a lot of them,&quot; Mikva stated.

In October 2018, Stevens said that Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s performance during his confirmation hearings should disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court, citing the potential for political bias. Kavanaugh was nominated by Republican president Donald Trump.

Shortly before Stevens&#x27; death in 2019, he said he was &quot;not a fan&quot; of Donald Trump, and when asked about Trump&#x27;s effect on the country, he stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been favorable.&quot;

== Judicial philosophy ==
On the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Stevens had a moderately conservative record. Early in his tenure on the Supreme Court, Stevens had a relatively moderate voting record. He voted to reinstate capital punishment in the United States and opposed race-based admissions programs, such as the program at issue in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot;, . However, on the more conservative Rehnquist Court, Stevens joined the more liberal justices on issues such as abortion rights, gay rights and federalism. His Segal–Cover score, a measure of the perceived liberalism/conservatism of Court members when they joined the Court, places him squarely on the conservative side of the Court. However, a 2003 statistical analysis of Supreme Court voting patterns found Stevens the most liberal member of the Court. President Ford expressed no regrets about Stevens&#x27;s drift toward liberalism, writing in a 2005 letter to &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Justice Stevens has made me, and our fellow citizens, proud of my three decade old decision to appoint him to the Supreme Court.&quot;

Stevens&#x27;s jurisprudence has usually been characterized as idiosyncratic. Stevens, unlike most justices, reviewed petitions for certiorari within his chambers instead of having his law clerks participate as part of the cert pool and usually wrote the first drafts of his opinions himself; when asked to explain why, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m the one hired to do the job.&quot; He further explained that he continued to learn about cases and legal theories as he drafted his opinions and re-evaluates his positions on cases while writing.

He was not an originalist (such as Antonin Scalia) nor a pragmatist (such as Justice Stephen Breyer), nor did he pronounce himself a cautious liberal (such as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg). He was considered part of the liberal bloc of the Court starting in the mid-1980s, and was dubbed the &quot;chief justice of the liberal Supreme Court&quot;, though he publicly called himself a judicial conservative in 2007.

In &quot;Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center&quot;, , Stevens argued against the Supreme Court&#x27;s famous &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; doctrine for laws involving &quot;suspect classifications&quot;, putting forth the view that all classifications should be evaluated using the &quot;rational basis&quot; test as to whether they could have been enacted by an &quot;impartial legislature&quot;. In &quot;Burnham v. Superior Court of California&quot;, , Stevens demonstrated his independence with a characteristically pithy concurrence.

Stevens was once an impassioned critic of affirmative action; in addition to the 1978 decision in &quot;Bakke&quot;, he dissented in the case of &quot;Fullilove v. Klutznick&quot;, , which upheld a minority set-aside program. He shifted his position over the years and voted to uphold the affirmative action program at the University of Michigan Law School challenged in &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;, .

Stevens wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; in 2006, in which he held that certain military commissions had been improperly constituted. He also wrote a lengthy dissenting opinion in &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, arguing the majority should not make a decision so broad that it would overturn precedents set in three previous Supreme Court cases. When reviewing his career at the Supreme Court in his 2019 book, &quot;The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years&quot;, Stevens lamented being unable to persuade his colleagues against the decision in &quot;Citizens United&quot;, which he described as &quot;a disaster for our election law.&quot;

=== Freedom of speech ===
Stevens&#x27;s views on obscenity under the First Amendment changed over the years. He was initially quite critical of constitutional protection for obscenity, rejecting a challenge to Detroit zoning ordinances that barred adult theaters in designated areas in &quot;Young v. American Mini Theatres&quot;, , (&quot;[E]ven though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society&#x27;s interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate&quot;), but later in his tenure adhered firmly to a libertarian free speech approach on obscenity issues, voting to strike down a federal law regulating online obscene content considered &quot;harmful to minors&quot; in &quot;ACLU v. Ashcroft&quot;, . In his dissenting opinion, Stevens argued that, while &quot;[a]s a parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent&quot;, he endorsed the legislative goal of protecting children from pornography &quot;without reservation&quot;, &quot;[a]s a judge, I must confess to a growing sense of unease when the interest in protecting children from prurient materials is invoked as a justification for using criminal regulation of speech as a substitute for, or a simple backup to, adult oversight of children&#x27;s viewing.&quot;

Perhaps the most personal and unusual feature of his jurisprudence was his continual referencing of World War II in his opinions. For example, Stevens, a World War II veteran, was visibly angered by William Kunstler&#x27;s flippant defense of flag-burning in oral argument in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, and voted to uphold a prohibition on flag-burning against a First Amendment argument. Stevens wrote, &quot;The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible force in motivating leaders like Patrick Henry, Susan B. Anthony, and Abraham Lincoln, schoolteachers like Nathan Hale and Booker T. Washington, the Philippine Scouts who fought at Bataan, and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha Beach. If those ideas are worth fighting for—and our history demonstrates that they are—it cannot be true that the flag that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of protection from unnecessary desecration.&quot;

Stevens generally supported students&#x27; right to free speech in public schools. He wrote sharply-worded dissents in &quot;Bethel v. Fraser&quot;, and &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot;, , two decisions that restricted students&#x27; freedom of speech. However, he joined the Court&#x27;s ruling on &quot;Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier&quot;, which upheld a principal&#x27;s censorship of a student newspaper.

=== Establishment Clause ===
In &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot;, , striking down an Alabama statute mandating a minute of silence in public schools &quot;for meditation or silent prayer&quot;, Stevens wrote the opinion for a majority that included justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Lewis Powell. He affirmed that the Establishment Clause is binding on the States via the Fourteenth Amendment, and that: &quot;Just as the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of a broader concept of individual freedom of mind, so also the individual&#x27;s freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed of the majority. At one time, it was thought that this right merely proscribed the preference of one Christian sect over another, but would not require equal respect for the conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.&quot;

Stevens wrote a dissent in &quot;Van Orden v. Perry&quot;, , in which he was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; he argued that the ten commandments displayed in the Texas Capitol grounds transmitted the message: &quot;This State endorses the divine code of the &#x27;Judeo-Christian&#x27; God.&quot; The Establishment Clause, he wrote, &quot;at the very least ... has created a strong presumption against the display of religious symbols on public property&quot;, and that it &quot;demands religious neutrality—Government may not exercise preference for one religious faith over another&quot;. This includes a prohibition against enacting laws or imposing requirements that aid all religions as against unbelievers, or aid religions that are based on a belief in the existence of God against those founded on different principles.

=== Commerce clause and states&#x27; rights ===
When interpreting the Interstate Commerce Clause, Stevens consistently sided with the federal government. He dissented in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot;, and &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot;, , two prominent cases in which the Rehnquist court changed direction by holding that Congress had exceeded its constitutional power under the Commerce Clause. He then authored &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, , which permits the federal government to arrest, prosecute, and imprison patients who use medical marijuana regardless of whether such use is legally permissible under state law.

=== Fourth Amendment ===
Stevens had a generally libertarian voting record on the Fourth Amendment, which deals with search and seizure. Stevens authored the majority opinion in &quot;Arizona v. Gant&quot;, which held that &quot;police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant&#x27;s arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.&quot; He dissented in &quot;New Jersey v. T. L. O.&quot;, and &quot;Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton&quot;, , both involving searches in schools. He was a dissenter in &quot;Oliver v. United States&quot;, , a case relating to the open-fields doctrine. However, in &quot;United States v. Montoya De Hernandez&quot;, , he sided with the government, and he was the author of &quot;United States v. Ross&quot;, , which permits the police to search closed containers found in the course of searching a vehicle. He also authored the dissent in &quot;Kyllo v. United States&quot;, , which held that the use of thermal imaging requires a warrant.

In a 2009 paper, Ward Farnsworth argued that Stevens&#x27;s &quot;dissents against type&quot; (in Stevens&#x27;s case, votes in dissent in favor of the government&#x27;s position and against the accused, such as the one in &quot;Kyllo&quot;) suggest that while Stevens &quot;[believed] strongly in laying out resources for the sake of accuracy and opportunities to protest an unfair trial, [he is] not nearly as concerned about restraining the government at the front end of the process, when it is gathering evidence—for the costs of invaded rights then are to &quot;liberty&quot; rather than to &quot;accuracy&quot;&quot;.

=== Death penalty ===
Stevens joined the majority in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, , which overruled &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, and again allowed the use of the death penalty in the United States. In later cases such as &quot;Thompson v. Oklahoma&quot;, and &quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot;, , Stevens held that the Constitution forbids the use of the death penalty in certain circumstances. Stevens opposed using the death penalty on juvenile offenders; he dissented in &quot;Stanford v. Kentucky&quot;, and joined the Court&#x27;s majority in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot;, , overturning &quot;Stanford&quot;. In &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;, , Stevens voted with the majority in upholding Kentucky&#x27;s method of lethal injection, because he felt bound by &quot;stare decisis&quot;. However, he opined that &quot;state-sanctioned killing is ... becoming more and more anachronistic&quot; and agreed with former justice Byron White&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes ... would be patently excessive&quot;, in violation of the Eighth Amendment (quoting from White&#x27;s concurrence in &quot;Furman&quot;). Soon after his vote in &quot;Baze&quot;, Stevens told a Sixth Circuit conference that one of the drugs (pancuronium bromide) in the three-drug cocktail used by Kentucky to execute death row inmates is prohibited in Kentucky for euthanizing animals. He questioned whether Kentucky Derby second-place finisher Eight Belles died more humanely than those on death row. He explained that his death penalty decisions were influenced, in part, by an increasing awareness through DNA testing of the fallibility of death sentences, and the fact that death-qualified juries come with a set of biases. Stevens, at the time of his opinion in &quot;Baze&quot;, was one of four justices—the others being Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun—who had concluded that post-&quot;Gregg&quot; capital punishment is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. After his retirement, Stevens stated that his vote in &quot;Gregg&quot; was the only vote he regretted.

== Other significant opinions ==
=== &quot;Chevron&quot; ===
Stevens authored the majority opinion in &quot;Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&quot;, . The opinion stands for how courts review administrative agencies&#x27; interpretations of their organic statutes. If the organic statute unambiguously expresses the will of Congress, the court enforces the legislature&#x27;s intent. If the statute is unclear (and is thus thought to reflect a Congressional delegation of power to the agency to interpret the statute), and the agency interpretation has the force of law, courts defer to an agency&#x27;s interpretation of the statute unless that interpretation is deemed to be &quot;arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute&quot;. This doctrine is now generally referred to as &quot;&quot;Chevron&quot; deference&quot; among legal practitioners.

Unlike some other members of the Court, Stevens was consistently willing to find organic statutes unambiguous and thus overturn agency interpretations of those statutes. (See his majority opinion in &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Cardoza-Fonseca&quot;, , and his dissent in &quot;Young v. Community Nutrition Institute&quot;, .) Although &quot;Chevron&quot; has come to stand for the proposition of deference to agency interpretations, Stevens, the author of the opinion, was less willing to defer to agencies than the rest of his colleagues on the Court.

=== &quot;Crawford v. Marion County Election Board&quot; ===
Stevens wrote the lead opinion in &quot;Crawford v. Marion County Election Board&quot;, a case where the Court upheld the right of states to require an official photo identification card to help ensure that only citizens vote. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy joined this opinion, and justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito agreed with them on the outcome. Edward B. Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said the Stevens opinion might represent an effort to &quot;depoliticize election law cases.&quot; Stevens&#x27;s vote in &quot;Crawford&quot; and his agreement with the Court&#x27;s conservative majority in two other cases during the 2007–2008 term (&quot;Medellin v. Texas&quot;, and &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;) led University of Oklahoma law professor and former Stevens clerk Joseph Thai to wonder if Stevens was &quot;tacking back a little bit toward the center.&quot;

Despite his vote in Crawford, Stevens expressed disagreement with &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot;, a case that struck down preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act.

=== &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; ===
In &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, , Stevens wrote a scathing dissent on the Court&#x27;s ruling to stay the recount of votes in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. He believed that the holding displayed &quot;an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed&quot;. He continued, &quot;The endorsement of that position by the majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today&#x27;s decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year&#x27;s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation&#x27;s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.&quot;

=== Second Amendment ===
Stevens wrote the primary dissenting opinion in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; , a landmark case which addressed the interpretation of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. &quot;Heller&quot; struck down provisions of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 and held that the Second Amendment protects an individual&#x27;s right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. His dissent was joined by justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer; the majority opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia.

Stevens stated that the Court&#x27;s judgment was &quot;a strained and unpersuasive reading&quot; which overturned longstanding precedent, and that the Court had &quot;bestowed a dramatic upheaval in the law.&quot; Stevens also stated that the amendment was notable for the &quot;omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self-defense&quot; which was present in the Declarations of Rights of Pennsylvania and Vermont. Stevens&#x27; dissent seems to rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders would have made the individual right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the &quot;militia&quot; preamble and exact phrase &quot;to keep and bear arms&quot; demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts&#x27; later &quot;collective-right&quot; reading of the &quot;Miller&quot; decision constitutes , which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the National Firearms Act) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, &quot;The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons. ... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice.&quot;

On March 27, 2018, days after the March for Our Lives demonstrations in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation, Stevens wrote an essay for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating that the demonstrators should be demanding the outright repeal of the Second Amendment. He wrote:

== Books ==

In 2011, Stevens published a memoir entitled &quot;Five Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir&quot;, which detailed his legal career during the tenure of five of the Supreme Court&#x27;s chief justices. In &quot;Five Chiefs&quot;, Stevens recounts his time as a law clerk during the tenure of Chief Justice Vinson; his experiences as a private attorney during the Warren era; and his experience while serving as an associate justice on the Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts Courts.

In 2014, Stevens published &quot;Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution&quot;, where he proposed that six amendments should be added to the U.S. Constitution to address political gerrymandering, anti-commandeering, campaign finance reform, capital punishment, gun violence, and sovereign immunity.

In 2019, at age 99 and shortly before his death, Stevens published &quot;The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Stevens married Elizabeth Sheeren in 1942. He was on the high court when the couple divorced thirty-seven years later in 1979. Later that same year, he married Maryan Simon; they remained married until her death in 2015. Stevens had four children, two of whom predeceased him. Stevens was a Protestant, and upon his retirement, the Supreme Court had no Protestant members for the first time in its history. He was one of only two Supreme Court justices who divorced while on the Court—the first was William O. Douglas, whom he coincidentally succeeded as an associate justice.
Stevens was also an avid bridge player and belonged to the Pompano Duplicate Bridge Club Florida.

=== Death ===

On July 16, 2019, Stevens died at the age of 99 at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from complications of a stroke. He received hospice care and was with his two surviving children, Elizabeth and Susan, when he died.

He lay in repose at the Supreme Court on July 22, 2019 before a planned burial at Arlington National Cemetery the following day. The service was attended by all the justices on the court, as well as retired justices Anthony Kennedy and David Souter. President Donald Trump ordered flags to fly at half-staff as a mark of respect on Tuesday, July 23, until sundown.

== In popular culture ==
Stevens was portrayed by the actor William Schallert in the 2008 film &quot;Recount&quot;. He was portrayed by David Grant Wright in two episodes of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; in which Alan Shore and Denny Crane appear before the Supreme Court. Stevens appeared in interviews in two episodes of Ken Burns&#x27;s 2011 PBS documentary miniseries &quot;Prohibition&quot;, recalling his childhood in Chicago in the 1920s and 30s.

According to an April 2009 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; Stevens &quot;rendered an opinion on who wrote Shakespeare&#x27;s plays,&quot; proclaiming himself an Oxfordian. That is, he believes the works ascribed to William Shakespeare actually were written by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. As a result, he was appointed &quot;Oxfordian of the Year&quot; by the Shakespeare Oxford Society. According to the article, Antonin Scalia and Harry Blackmun shared Stevens&#x27;s belief.

Stevens was 12 years old when he was at Wrigley Field for the 1932 World Series game at which Babe Ruth hit his &quot;called shot&quot; home run. Eighty-four years later, he attended Game 4 of the 2016 World Series, also at Wrigley Field, wearing a red bowtie with a Chicago Cubs jacket.

<doc id="188369" wikidata="Q4383251" url="?curid=188369" title="Electronic Privacy Information Center">
<text>The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) is an independent nonprofit research center established in 1994 to protect privacy, freedom of expression, and democratic values in the information age. Based in Washington, D.C., their mission is to &quot;secure the fundamental right to privacy in the digital age for all people through advocacy, research, and litigation.&quot; EPIC believes that privacy is a fundamental right, the internet belongs to people who use it, and there&#x27;s a responsible way to use technology.

EPIC pursues a wide range of civil liberties, consumer protection, and human rights issues. EPIC has pursued several successful consumer privacy complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning Snapchat (faulty privacy technology), WhatsApp (privacy policy after acquisition by Facebook), Facebook (changes in user privacy settings), Google (roll-out of Google Buzz), Microsoft (Hailstorm log-in), and Choicepoint (sale of personal information to identity thieves). EPIC has also prevailed in significant Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) cases against the CIA, the DHS, the Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency (NSA), the ODNI, and the Transportation Security Administration. EPIC has also filed many &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs on law and technology, including &quot;Riley v. California&quot; (2014), which concerne cell phone privacy. They have also litigated important privacy cases, including &quot;EPIC v. DHS&quot; (D.C. Cir. 2011), which led to the removal of the x-ray body scanners in US airports, and &quot;EPIC v. NSA&quot; (D.C. Cir. 2014), which led to the release of the NSA&#x27;s formerly secret cybersecurity authority. Additionally, EPIC challenged the NSA&#x27;s domestic surveillance program in a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. &quot;In re EPIC&quot;, (U.S. 2013) after the release of the &quot;Verizon Order&quot; in June 2013. One of EPIC&#x27;s current cases concerns the obligation of the Federal Aviation Administration to establish privacy regulations prior to the deployment of commercial drones in the United States.

EPIC works closely with a distinguished advisory board, who have expertise in law, technology and public policy.

== EPIC program areas ==
=== EPIC Open Government project ===
The EPIC Open Government Project is one of the nation&#x27;s leading government transparency programs. Combining decades of expertise in the Freedom of Information Act with experienced litigation attorneys, EPIC obtains important government records to promote accountability and safeguard civil liberties.

The EPIC Open Government Project pursues four distinct program activities. First, the project actively pursues secret government documents through the FOIA. Second, the EPIC Open Government Project recommends improvements to agency rulemakings concerning transparency, privacy, and civil liberties. Third, EPIC trains law school students on utilizing the FOIA to promote open government. Fourth, EPIC participates in coalitions with other government transparency organizations. EPIC&#x27;s extensive press outreach and popular website allow EPIC to make FOIA documents widely available to the press and the public.

=== Public Voice project ===
The Public Voice coalition was established in 1996 by EPIC to promote public participation in decisions concerning the future of the Internet. The Public Voice has pursued issues ranging from privacy and freedom of expression to consumer protection and Internet governance. Through international conferences, reports and funding for travel the Public Voice project seeks to increase the presence of NGOs at meetings across the globe. In cooperation with the OECD, UNESCO, and other international organizations, the Public Voice project brings civil society leaders face to face with government officials for constructive engagement about current policy issues. Public Voice events have been held in Buenos Aires, Cancun, Cape Town, Dubai, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Ottawa, Paris, Seoul, Washington, and Wroclaw.

The Public Voice project is made possible, in part, by support from the Ford Foundation, the Markle Foundation, the Open Society Institute, and EPIC. The Public Voice has provided support for several organizations, including the Center for International Media Action, CPSR, EDRi, People for Internet Responsibility, Privacy International, CPSR-Peru, and the TransAtlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD).

The Public Voice helped establish the Civil Society Information Society Advisory Council (CSISAC) which is the &quot;voice of civil society&quot; at the OECD. CSISAC&#x27;s mission is set out in the Seoul Declaration adopted at the OECD Ministerial Meeting in Seoul, 2008. CSISAC contributes to the OECD&#x27;s work on Digital Economy Policy and promotes the exchange of information between the OECD and civil society. The OECD provides civil society participants with substantial empirical analysis that enable informed policy assessments; CSISAC provides the OECD with the essential perspectives of experts and NGOs leaders. CSISAC strengthens the relationship between civil society and the OECD and promotes better-informed and more widely accepted policies for the IT sector.

&quot;There is an increasing recognition that we must involve all stakeholders including the voice of civil society. The Public Voice meeting and its contributions to the Forum have been constructive and positive.&quot;—OECD Under Secretary General

=== EPIC Amicus project ===
The EPIC Amicus Project seeks to promote privacy and government oversight by filing &quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs in federal and state courts. The EPIC Amicus Program is one of the most prolific appellate advocacy programs in the United States, filing almost 100 amicus briefs on emerging privacy and civil liberties issues, including more than 20 briefs for the US Supreme Court. The EPIC Project brings together experts in the fields of law, technology, and privacy policy with a team of in-house litigators to identify and file in cutting edge privacy cases. EPIC&#x27;s amicus briefs have been cited by judges and justices in significant Fourth Amendment, consumer privacy, communications privacy, medical privacy, workplace privacy, and open government cases. EPIC continues to expand the scope of the Amicus Program, including arguing cases before the New Jersey Supreme Court, the New Mexico Supreme Court, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. EPIC&#x27;s amicus participation has also been requested by judges in both federal and state cases. And EPIC attorneys frequently speak at judicial conferences, both in the United States and around the world, about emerging privacy issues and the role of the judiciary.

=== EPIC AI &amp; Human Rights project ===
The EPIC Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Human Rights Project advocates for the adoption of transparent, equitable, and commonsense development of AI policy and regulations. EPIC pursues this goal through a combination of public education, direct legislative advocacy, freedom of information requests, comments to decision-makers at the state, federal, and international levels, and more.

=== EPIC Consumer Privacy project ===
The EPIC Consumer Privacy Project advocates for the rights of consumers and Internet users, and works to protect consumers&#x27; personal information and autonomy in the digital marketplace. EPIC promotes the implementation and enforcement of Fair Information Practices and the enactment of the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, so that consumers do not have to choose between engaging in modern society and retaining their right to privacy.

=== EPIC Surveillance Oversight project ===
EPIC&#x27;s Project on Surveillance Oversight focuses public attention on merging technologies used to conduct domestic surveillance. As federal Judge Chutkan explained in a case brought by EPIC, &quot;There can be little dispute that the general public has a genuine, tangible interest in a system designed to store and manipulate significant quantities of its own biometric data, particularly given the great numbers of people from whom such data will be gathered.&quot;

EPIC&#x27;s Project on Surveillance Oversight looks also at drone surveillance, social media monitoring, police body-worn cameras, passenger profiling, vehicle tracking and cyber-surveillance. The Project pursues several activities to inform the public and to advocate for better privacy protections. EPIC uses FOIA to obtain documents about government surveillance programs. EPIC also files comments with federal agencies, leads coalition advocacy efforts, and testifies before state and federal legislatures for better privacy protections. EPIC has filed numerous amicus briefs in important court cases that address surveillance issues.

=== EPIC Administrative Law project ===
Through the Administrative Law Project, EPIC aims to compel federal agencies to adopt practices that safeguard privacy and promote transparency. EPIC has pursued this mission through extensive comments to agencies, and subsequent lawsuits in instances where agencies fail to adopt EPIC&#x27;s recommendations. Over the last twenty years, EPIC has successfully advocated for individual privacy rights in agency rulemaking proceedings. EPIC has also successfully sued the government to force an agency to conduct a public rulemaking as required under the APA.

==Publications and web sites==
EPIC maintains and publishes its monthly newsletter, the &quot;EPIC Alert&quot;.

EPIC also publishes several books on privacy and open government, including &quot;Privacy in the Modern Age: The Search for Solutions, Privacy Law Sourcebook, Privacy and Human Rights, Litigation Under the Federal Open Government Laws, Filters and Freedom, The Public Voice WSIS Sourcebook,&quot; and &quot;The Consumer Law Sourcebook&quot;.

EPIC maintains web sites for the Privacy Coalition, the Public Voice coalition, and the National Committee for Voting Integrity.

== EPIC Champion of Freedom Award ==
EPIC established the Champions of Freedom Award in 2004 to recognize individuals and organizations that have helped safeguard the right of privacy, promote open government, and protect democratic values with courage and integrity.

<text>Reconfigurable computing is a computer architecture combining some of the flexibility of software with the high performance of hardware by processing with flexible hardware platforms like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The principal difference when compared to using ordinary microprocessors is the ability to add custom computational blocks using FPGAs. On the other hand, the main difference from custom hardware, i.e. application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is the possibility to adapt the hardware during runtime by &quot;loading&quot; a new circuit on the reconfigurable fabric, thus providing new computational blocks without the need to manufacture and add new chips to the existing system.

==History==

The concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s, when Gerald Estrin&#x27;s paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of &quot;reconfigurable&quot; hardware. The main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware. The latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task, such as image processing or pattern matching, as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware. Once the task was done, the hardware could be adjusted to do some other task. This resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware.

In the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia, such as: Copacobana, Matrix, GARP, Elixent, NGEN, Polyp, MereGen, PACT XPP, Silicon Hive, Montium, Pleiades, Morphosys, and PiCoGA. Such designs were feasible due to the constant progress of silicon technology that let complex designs be implemented on one chip. Some of these massively parallel reconfigurable computers were built primarily for special subdomains such as molecular evolution, neural or image processing. The world&#x27;s first commercial reconfigurable computer, the Algotronix CHS2X4, was completed in 1991. It was not a commercial success, but was promising enough that Xilinx (the inventor of the Field-Programmable Gate Array, FPGA) bought the technology and hired the Algotronix staff. Later machines enabled first demonstrations of scientific principles, such as the spontaneous spatial self-organisation of genetic coding with MereGen.

==Theories==

===Tredennick&#x27;s Classification===

The fundamental model of the reconfigurable computing machine paradigm, the data-stream-based anti machine is well illustrated by the differences to other machine paradigms that were introduced earlier, as shown by Nick Tredennick&#x27;s following classification scheme of computing paradigms (see &quot;Table 1: Nick Tredennick&#x27;s Paradigm Classification Scheme&quot;).

===Hartenstein&#x27;s Xputer===

Computer scientist Reiner Hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an &quot;anti-machine&quot; that, according to him, represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von Neumann machine. Hartenstein calls it Reconfigurable Computing Paradox, that software-to-configware (software-to-FPGA) migration results in reported speed-up factors of up to more than four orders of magnitude, as well as a reduction in electricity consumption by up to almost four orders of magnitude—although the technological parameters of FPGAs are behind the Gordon Moore curve by about four orders of magnitude, and the clock frequency is substantially lower than that of microprocessors. This paradox is partly explained by the Von Neumann syndrome.

== High-performance computing ==
High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (HPRC) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with CPUs or multi-core processors.

The increase of logic in an FPGA has enabled larger and more complex algorithms to be programmed into the FPGA. The attachment of such an FPGA to a modern CPU over a high speed bus, like PCI express, has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral. This has brought reconfigurable computing into the high-performance computing sphere.

Furthermore, by replicating an algorithm on an FPGA or the use of a multiplicity of FPGAs has enabled reconfigurable SIMD systems to be produced where several computational devices can concurrently operate on different data, which is highly parallel computing.

This heterogeneous systems technique is used in computing research and especially in supercomputing.
A 2008 paper reported speed-up factors of more than 4 orders of magnitude and energy saving factors by up to almost 4 orders of magnitude.
Some supercomputer firms offer heterogeneous processing blocks including FPGAs as accelerators.
One research area is the twin-paradigm programming tool flow productivity obtained for such heterogeneous systems.

The US National Science Foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing (CHREC).
In April 2011 the fourth Many-core and Reconfigurable Supercomputing Conference was held in Europe.

Commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of IBM integrating FPGAs with its IBM Power microprocessors.

==Partial re-configuration==
Partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration. Field programmable gate arrays are often used as a support to partial reconfiguration.

Electronic hardware, like software, can be designed modularly, by creating subcomponents and then higher-level components to instantiate them. In many cases it is useful to be able to swap out one or several of these subcomponents while the FPGA is still operating.

Normally, reconfiguring an FPGA requires it to be held in reset while an external controller reloads a design onto it. Partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the FPGA or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module. Partial reconfiguration also can be used to save space for multiple designs by only storing the partial designs that change between designs.

A common example for when partial reconfiguration would be useful is the case of a communication device. If the device is controlling multiple connections, some of which require encryption, it would be useful to be able to load different encryption cores without bringing the whole controller down.

Partial reconfiguration is not supported on all FPGAs. A special software flow with emphasis on modular design is required. Typically the design modules are built along well defined boundaries inside the FPGA that require the design to be specially mapped to the internal hardware.

From the functionality of the design, partial reconfiguration can be divided into two groups:
* &quot;dynamic partial reconfiguration&quot;, also known as an active partial reconfiguration - permits to change the part of the device while the rest of an FPGA is still running;
* &quot;static partial reconfiguration&quot; - the device is not active during the reconfiguration process. While the partial data is sent into the FPGA, the rest of the device is stopped (in the shutdown mode) and brought up after the configuration is completed.

== Current systems ==

===Computer emulation ===

With the advent of affordable FPGA boards, students&#x27; and hobbyists&#x27; projects seek to recreate vintage computers or implement more novel architectures. Such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware (C-One).

=== COPACOBANA ===
A fully FPGA-based computer is the COPACOBANA, the Cost Optimized Codebreaker and Analyzer and its successor RIVYERA. A spin-off company SciEngines GmbH of the COPACOBANA-Project of the Universities of Bochum and Kiel in Germany continues the development of fully FPGA-based computers.

=== Mitrionics ===

Mitrionics has developed a SDK that enables software written using a single assignment language to be compiled and executed on FPGA-based computers. The Mitrion-C software language and Mitrion processor enable software developers to write and execute applications on FPGA-based computers in the same manner as with other computing technologies, such as graphical processing units (&quot;GPUs&quot;), cell-based processors, parallel processing units (&quot;PPUs&quot;), multi-core CPUs, and traditional single-core CPU clusters. (out of business)

=== National Instruments ===

National Instruments have developed a hybrid embedded computing system called CompactRIO. It consists of reconfigurable chassis housing the user-programmable FPGA, hot swappable I/O modules, real-time controller for deterministic communication and processing, and graphical LabVIEW software for rapid RT and FPGA programming.

=== Xilinx ===
Xilinx has developed two styles of partial reconfiguration of FPGA devices: &quot;module-based&quot; and &quot;difference-based&quot;. &quot;Module-based partial reconfiguration&quot; permits to reconfigure distinct modular parts of the design, while &quot;difference-based partial reconfiguration&quot; can be used when a small change is made to a design.

=== Intel ===
Intel supports partial reconfiguration of their FPGA devices on 28 nm devices such as Stratix V, and on the 20 nm Arria 10 devices. The Intel FPGA partial reconfiguration flow for Arria 10 is based on the hierarchical design methodology in the Quartus Prime Pro software where users create physical partitions of the FPGA that can be reconfigured at runtime while the remainder of the design continues to operate. The Quartus Prime Pro software also support hierarchical partial reconfiguration and simulation of partial reconfiguration.

== Classification of systems ==
As an emerging field, classifications of reconfigurable architectures are still being developed and refined as new architectures are developed; no unifying taxonomy has been suggested to date. However, several recurring parameters can be used to classify these systems.

===Granularity===

The granularity of the reconfigurable logic is defined as the size of the smallest functional unit (configurable logic block, CLB) that is addressed by the mapping tools. High granularity, which can also be known as fine-grained, often implies a greater flexibility when implementing algorithms into the hardware. However, there is a penalty associated with this in terms of increased power, area and delay due to greater quantity of routing required per computation. Fine-grained architectures work at the bit-level manipulation level; whilst coarse grained processing elements (reconfigurable datapath unit, rDPU) are better optimised for standard data path applications. One of the drawbacks of coarse grained architectures are that they tend to lose some of their utilisation and performance if they need to perform smaller computations than their granularity provides, for example for a one bit add on a four bit wide functional unit would waste three bits. This problem can be solved by having a coarse grain array (reconfigurable datapath array, rDPA) and a FPGA on the same chip.

Coarse-grained architectures (rDPA) are intended for the implementation for algorithms needing word-width data paths (rDPU). As their functional blocks are optimized for large computations and typically comprise word wide arithmetic logic units (ALU), they will perform these computations more quickly and with more power efficiency than a set of interconnected smaller functional units; this is due to the connecting wires being shorter, resulting in less wire capacitance and hence faster and lower power designs. A potential undesirable consequence of having larger computational blocks is that when the size of operands may not match the algorithm an inefficient utilisation of resources can result. Often the type of applications to be run are known in advance allowing the logic, memory and routing resources to be tailored to enhance the performance of the device whilst still providing a certain level of flexibility for future adaptation. Examples of this are domain specific arrays aimed at gaining better performance in terms of power, area, throughput than their more generic finer grained FPGA cousins by reducing their flexibility.

===Rate of reconfiguration===

Configuration of these reconfigurable systems can happen at deployment time, between execution phases or during execution. In a typical reconfigurable system, a bit stream is used to program the device at deployment time. Fine grained systems by their own nature require greater configuration time than more coarse-grained architectures due to more elements needing to be addressed and programmed. Therefore, more coarse-grained architectures gain from potential lower energy requirements, as less information is transferred and utilised. Intuitively, the slower the rate of reconfiguration the smaller the power consumption as the associated energy cost of reconfiguration are amortised over a longer period of time. Partial re-configuration aims to allow part of the device to be reprogrammed while another part is still performing active computation. Partial re-configuration allows smaller reconfigurable bit streams thus not wasting energy on transmitting redundant information in the bit stream. Compression of the bit stream is possible but careful analysis is to be carried out to ensure that the energy saved by using smaller bit streams is not outweighed by the computation needed to decompress the data.

===Host coupling===

Often the reconfigurable array is used as a processing accelerator attached to a host processor. The level of coupling determines the type of data transfers, latency, power, throughput and overheads involved when utilising the reconfigurable logic. Some of the most intuitive designs use a peripheral bus to provide a coprocessor like arrangement for the reconfigurable array. However, there have also been implementations where the reconfigurable fabric is much closer to the processor, some are even implemented into the data path, utilising the processor registers. The job of the host processor is to perform the control functions, configure the logic, schedule data and to provide external interfacing.

===Routing/interconnects===

The flexibility in reconfigurable devices mainly comes from their routing interconnect. One style of interconnect made popular by FPGAs vendors, Xilinx and Altera are the island style layout, where blocks are arranged in an array with vertical and horizontal routing. A layout with inadequate routing may suffer from poor flexibility and resource utilisation, therefore providing limited performance. If too much interconnect is provided this requires more transistors than necessary and thus more silicon area, longer wires and more power consumption.

== Challenges for operating systems ==
One of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts. One way of doing this is to provide standardization and abstraction, usually supported and enforced by an operating system.

One of the major tasks of an operating system is to hide the hardware and present programs (and their programmers) with nice, clean, elegant, and consistent abstractions to work with instead. In other words, the two main tasks of an operating system are abstraction and resource management.

Abstraction is a powerful mechanism to handle complex and different (hardware) tasks in a well-defined and common manner. One of the most elementary OS abstractions is a process. A process is a running application that has the perception (provided by the OS) that it is running on its own on the underlying virtual hardware. This can be relaxed by the concept of threads, allowing different tasks to run concurrently on this virtual hardware to exploit task level parallelism. To allow different processes and threads to coordinate their work, communication and synchronization methods have to be provided by the OS.

In addition to abstraction, resource management of the underlying hardware components is necessary because the virtual computers provided to the processes and threads by the operating system need to share available physical resources (processors, memory, and devices) spatially and temporarily.

<doc id="188377" wikidata="Q7338126" url="?curid=188377" title="Riverdale (Archie Comics)">
<text>Riverdale is a fictional town in the United States where most of the characters live and appear in Archie Comics. Conflicting details on its geographic location have been given over the years. It is located near the fictional town of Greendale, home of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; comic book series. In the television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, it is located near Greendale related to the television series &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;.

==Overview==
Riverdale is the setting of the stories in the Archie Comics universe. It is usually depicted as a medium-sized town (possibly a suburb of a bigger city), with all the usual amenities of shopping malls, restaurants, and parks. In the first Archie stories in the 1940s, it was identified as Riverdale, New York, a real neighborhood in The Bronx. In &quot;Jackpot Comics&quot; #5 (Spring 1942), a story written by Bob Montana has the gang going on a river trip. One panel says &quot;...the good ship &#x27;Peter Stuyvesant&#x27; settles into the Hudson, as Riverdale High clambers aboard for a happy trip to Bear Mountain.&quot; Riverdale has been shown to have beaches, lakes, rivers, deserts, farmland, woodland, mountains, plains, a transit system, and four distinct seasons with changes in climate.

Archie Comics publisher John L. Goldwater and initial &quot;Archie&quot; artist Bob Montana differed on the inspiration for Riverdale, with Goldwater saying it was based on his hometown of Hiawatha, Kansas, and Montana saying the town&#x27;s high school was based on his own in Haverhill, Massachusetts, where as in the comics a replica of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s famous statue The Thinker stands.

In one issue of &quot;Archie and Jughead Digest&quot;, when one of the readers asked in a letter, &quot;Where is Riverdale located?&quot;, the editor replied, &quot;Riverdale is more of a state of mind than an actual physical location. It could be anywhere that kind people live and just have fun, like Archie and his friends. It could be in the Midwest, or along the Eastern Seaboard, or even a town in Canada, Mexico, or England.&quot;

==Riverdale High School==
Riverdale High School is the local educational institution of Riverdale where Archie and his friends attend the 11th grade. Its school colors are blue and gold, and its school newspaper is the &quot;Blue and Gold&quot;.

Only a few of Riverdale High&#x27;s staff appear regularly in the comics; these include the school principal Mr. Weatherbee, homeroom teacher Miss Grundy, chemistry teacher Mr. Flutesnoot, history teacher Miss Haggly, physical education teachers Coach Kleats and Coach Clayton, cafeteria cook Miss Beazley, custodian Mr. Svenson, secretary Miss Phlips, and superintendent of schools Mr. Hassle.

In the TV show, the staff frequently shown/mentioned in Riverdale are Mr. Weatherbee (principal), Miss Grundy (former, deceased music teacher), Coach Clayton (football coach) and Mr. Svenson (caretaker)

In the five-issue miniseries &quot;Faculty Funnies&quot; (cover-dated June 1989May 1990) by writer George Gladir and penciler Stan Goldberg, faculty members Mr. Weatherbee, Mr. Flutesnoot, Miss Grundy and Coach Clayton secretly become the superhero team the Awesome Foursome after a lab accident involving Archie&#x27;s science project. They lose their powers after putting out a chemical fire.
The series &quot;Archie at Riverdale High&quot; ran 113 issues (August 1972February 1987). This was followed by &quot;Riverdale High&quot;, which ran six issues (AugustJune 1990). After a brief hiatus, it was retitled &quot;Archie&#x27;s Riverdale High&quot; and then canceled with issue #8 (AugustOctober 1991).

==Places==
Places in Riverdale besides the high school include the following:
*Pop Tate&#x27;s Chocklit Shoppe, the soda shop frequented by the teenaged cast.
*Pickens Park, the community park named for the fictional Civil War hero General Pickens.
*The Lodge Mansion, the large and luxurious home of wealthy Veronica Lodge and her parents.
*Homes of other members of the gang, including the Andrews residence, Jones residence and Cooper residence.
*Dilton Doiley&#x27;s science lab, a home-based setup where Dilton invents and conducts experiments.
*Chuck Clayton&#x27;s studio, where Chuck draws his cartoons at home.
*The beach, where Archie and the gang spend much of their time in the summer.
*The Riverdale Mall, a source of shopping and entertainment, particularly for the girls.
* The Blossom Mansion, the larger and luxurious home where wealthy Cheryl Blossom and her family live.
* Riverdale High, where all the teens go to school, and where all the dances and some parties are hosted, like homecoming.
* Bunker , Adventure and meeting place for all characters as well as connections with Rivervale

==Nearby towns==
Some nearby towns include Greendale and Midvale. Greendale is the home of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, who once lived in Riverdale but eventually moved. Characters who appear in Josie and the Pussycats come from Midvale.

Riverdale High School&#x27;s main scholastic and athletic rival is Central High School, located in another nearby community. Central High seems to consist of nothing but villainous types. The males are generally thuggish, conniving brutes, and the females are usually lecherous, scheming vamps. In most of their encounters, Central students seldom compete without using unsportsmanlike conduct, if not out-and-out cheating. The coaches and teachers often are not only aware of this skullduggery, but encourage it. In most cases, Central&#x27;s team colors are bright red and silver-white.

In the fourth season of the iconic show, Stonewall Prep is heavily mentioned as one of the nearby rival schools. Student often dress in rabbit memorabilia and carry fake looking axes to intimidate unwanted newcomers. In a rather charming episode, Betty and Jughead have relations in Jughead&#x27;s dorm during the winter months. As Jughead courageously ventures outside their cozy abode to buy them an extravagant meal of vending machine memorabilia, he is nearly attacked by one of these bunny loving students. 

Pembrooke Academy is a private school attended by siblings Cheryl and Jason Blossom and their snobbish friends Bunny and Cedric. They look down on Riverdale students as &quot;townies&quot; and will not (except for the Blossom twins) willingly associate with them. Other schools that have been featured as Riverdale rival schools include Hadley High and Southside High. In one comic, a letter sent to Riverdale has &quot;U.&quot; where the state should be, and a ZIP code of 10543 (which in real life is Mamaroneck, New York, the home of Michael Silberkleit, an Archie Comics editor).

==Related media==
* In the pilot of the 2017 series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, the town is described as being located in &quot;Rockland County.&quot; Only one county in the US has that name, Rockland County, New York, close to Archie Comics&#x27; headquarters in Pelham, New York. Whereas the real Rockland County has a heavily suburban character and is only about 40 miles from New York City, the TV version of Riverdale is much more isolated, is not home to anyone who regularly commutes to New York, and features several plots that depend on the town being located close to the Canadian border. This suggests that the fictional Rockland County on the show is not the same as its real-life counterpart and is instead in far Upstate New York.

==Cultural references==
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot; (Episode 2F02), several Archie Comics characters, including Archie Andrews, Reggie Mantle, Moose Mason and Jughead Jones have a cameo. The episode also features a copy of &quot;Archie Comics&quot;. 
*In &quot;Marge the Lumberjill&quot; (Episode ZABF02) from the same series, Springfield Elementary students perform dramatic scenes that they write themselves, based on TV shows and YouTube, including one from &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

<doc id="188378" wikidata="Q184782" url="?curid=188378" title="Phosphoric acid">
<text>Phosphoric acid (orthophosphoric acid, monophosphoric acid or phosphoric(V) acid) is a colorless, odorless phosphorus-containing solid, and inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is commonly encountered as an 85% aqueous solution, which is a colourless, odourless, and non-volatile syrupy liquid. It is a major industrial chemical, being a component of many fertilizers.

The compound is an acid. Removal of all three ions gives the phosphate ion . Removal of one or two protons gives dihydrogen phosphate ion , and the hydrogen phosphate ion , respectively. Phosphoric acid forms esters, called organophosphates.

The name &quot;orthophosphoric acid&quot; can be used to distinguish this specific acid from other &quot;phosphoric acids&quot;, such as pyrophosphoric acid. Nevertheless, the term &quot;phosphoric acid&quot; often means this specific compound; and that is the current IUPAC nomenclature.

==Production==
Phosphoric acid is produced industrially by one of two routes, wet processes and dry.

=== Wet process ===
In the wet process, a phosphate-containing mineral such as calcium hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite are treated with sulfuric acid.
:

Calcium sulfate (gypsum, ) is a by-product, which is removed as phosphogypsum. The hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas is streamed into a wet (water) scrubber producing hydrofluoric acid. In both cases the phosphoric acid solution usually contains 23–33% (32–46% ). It may be concentrated to produce &quot;commercial-&quot; or &quot;merchant-grade&quot; phosphoric acid, which contains about 54–62%  (75–85% ). Further removal of water yields &quot;superphosphoric acid&quot; with a concentration above 70% (corresponding to nearly 100% ). The phosphoric acid from both processes may be further purified by removing compounds of arsenic and other potentially toxic impurities.

=== Dry process===
To produce food-grade phosphoric acid, phosphate ore is first reduced with coke in an electric arc furnace, to give elemental phosphorus. This process is also known as the thermal process or the electric furnace process. Silica is also added, resulting in the production of calcium silicate slag. Elemental phosphorus is distilled out of the furnace and burned with air to produce high-purity phosphorus pentoxide, which is dissolved in water to make phosphoric acid. The thermal process produces phosphoric acid with a very high concentration of (about 85%) and a low level of impurities.

However, this process is more expensive and energy-intensive than the wet process, which produces phosphoric acid with a lower concentration of (about 26-52%) and a higher level of impurities. The wet process is the most common method of producing phosphoric acid for fertilizer use. Even in China, where the thermal process is still used quite widely due to relatively cheap coal as opposed to the sulfuric acid, over 7/8 of phosphoric acid is produced with wet process.

== Purification ==
Phosphoric acids produced from phosphate rock or thermal processes often requires purification. A common purification methods is liquid-liquid extraction, which involves the separation of phosphoric acids from water and other impurities using organic solvents, such as tributyl phosphate (TBP), methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), or &quot;n&quot;-octanol. Nanofiltration involves the use of a premodified nanofiltration membrane, which is functionalized by a deposit of a high molecular weight polycationic polymer of polyethyleneimines. Nanofiltration has been shown to significantly reduce the concentrations of various impurities, including cadmium, aluminum, iron, and rare earth elements. The laboratory and industrial pilot scale results showed that this process allows the production of food-grade phosphoric acid.

Fractional crystallization can achieve highest purities typically used for semiconductor applications. Usually a static crystallizer is used. A static crystallizer uses vertical plates, which are suspended in the molten feed and which are alternatingly cooled and heated by a heat transfer medium. The process begins with the slow cooling of the heat transfer medium below the freezing point of the stagnant melt. This cooling causes a layer of crystals to grow on the plates. Impurities are rejected from the growing crystals and are concentrated in the remaining melt. After the desired fraction has been crystallized, the remaining melt is drained from the crystallizer. The purer crystalline layer remains adhered to the plates. In a subsequent step, the plates are heated again to liquify the crystals and the purified phosphoric acid drained into the product vessel. The crystallizer is filled with feed again and the next cooling cycle is started.

==Properties==
===Acidic properties===
In aqueous solution phosphoric acid behaves as a triprotic acid.
:, p&quot;K&quot;a1 = 2.14 
:, p&quot;K&quot;a2 = 7.20
:, p&quot;K&quot;a3 = 12.37
The difference between successive p&quot;K&quot;a values is sufficiently large so that salts of either monohydrogen phosphate, or dihydrogen phosphate, , can be prepared from a solution of phosphoric acid by adjusting the pH to be mid-way between the respective p&quot;K&quot;a values.

===Aqueous solutions===
Aqueous solutions up to 62.5% are eutectic, exhibiting freezing-point depression as low as -85°C. When the concentration of acid rises above 62.5% the freezing-point increases, reaching 21°C by 85% (w/w; the monohydrate). Beyond this the phase diagram becomes complicated, with significant local maxima and minima. For this reason phosphoric acid is rarely sold above 85%, as beyond this adding or removing small amounts of moisture risks the entire mass freezing solid, which would be a major problem on a large scale. A local maximum at 91.6% which corresponds to the hemihydrate 2H3PO4•H2O, freezing at 29.32°C. There is a second smaller eutectic depression at a concentration of 94.75% with a freezing point of 23.5°C. At higher concentrations the freezing point rapidly increases. Concentrated phosphoric acid tends to supercool before crystallization occurs, and may be relatively resistant to crystallisation even when stored below the freezing point.

===Self condensation===
Phosphoric acid is commercially available as aqueous solutions of various concentrations, not usually exceeding 85%. If concentrated further it undergoes slow self-condensation, forming an equilibrium with pyrophosphoric acid:
Even at 90% concentration the amount of pyrophosphoric acid present is negligible, but beyond 95% it starts to increase, reaching 15% at what would have otherwise been 100% orthophosphoric acid.

As the concentration is increased higher acids are formed, culminating in the formation of polyphosphoric acids. It is not possible to fully dehydrate phosphoric acid to phosphorus pentoxide, instead the polyphosphoric acid becomes increasingly polymeric and viscous. Due to the self-condensation, pure orthophosphoric acid can only be obtained by a careful fractional freezing/melting process.

==Uses==
The dominant use of phosphoric acid is for fertilizers, consuming approximately 90% of production.
Food-grade phosphoric acid (additive E338) is used to acidify foods and beverages such as various colas and jams, providing a tangy or sour taste. The phosphoric acid also serves as a preservative. Soft drinks containing phosphoric acid, which would include Coca-Cola, are sometimes called phosphate sodas or phosphates. Phosphoric acid in soft drinks has the potential to cause dental erosion. Phosphoric acid also has the potential to contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in those who have had kidney stones previously.

Specific applications of phosphoric acid include:
* in anti-rust treatment by phosphate conversion coating or passivation
* to prevent iron oxidation by means of the Parkerization process
* as an external standard for phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance
* in phosphoric acid fuel cells
* in activated carbon production
* in compound semiconductor processing, to etch Indium gallium arsenide selectively with respect to indium phosphide
* in microfabrication to etch silicon nitride selectively with respect to silicon dioxide
* in microfabrication to etch aluminium
* as a pH adjuster in cosmetics and skin-care products
* as a sanitizing agent in the dairy, food, and brewing industries
Phosphoric acid may also be used for chemical polishing (etching) of metals like aluminium or for passivation of steel products in a process called phosphatization.

== Safety ==
Phosphoric acid is not a strong acid. However, at moderate concentrations phosphoric acid solutions are irritating to the skin. Contact with concentrated solutions can cause severe skin burns and permanent eye damage.

A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake and osteoporosis in later middle age in women (but not men).

<text>An operant conditioning chamber (also known as a Skinner box) is a laboratory apparatus used to study animal behavior. The operant conditioning chamber was created by B. F. Skinner while he was a graduate student at Harvard University. The chamber can be used to study both operant conditioning and classical conditioning.

Skinner created the operant conditioning chamber as a variation of the puzzle box originally created by Edward Thorndike. While Skinner&#x27;s early studies were done using rats, he later moved on to study pigeons. The operant conditioning chamber may be used to observe or manipulate behaviour. An animal is placed in the box where it must learn to activate levers or respond to light or sound stimuli for reward. The reward may be food or the removal of noxious stimuli such as a loud alarm. The chamber is used to test specific hypotheses in a controlled setting.

== Name ==
Skinner was noted to have expressed his distaste for becoming an eponym. It is believed that psychologist Clark Hull and his Yale students coined the expression &quot;Skinner box&quot;. Skinner said that he did not use the term himself; he went so far as to ask Howard Hunt to use &quot;lever box&quot; instead of &quot;Skinner box&quot; in a published document.

== History ==

In 1898, American psychologist, Edward Thorndike proposed the &#x27;law of effect&#x27;, which formed the basis of operant conditioning. Thorndike conducted experiments to discover how cats learn new behaviors. His work involved monitoring cats as they attempted to escape from puzzle boxes. The puzzle box trapped the animals until they moved a lever or performed an action which triggered their release. Thorndike ran several trials and recorded the time it took for them to perform the actions necessary to escape. He discovered that the cats seemed to learn from a trial-and-error process rather than insightful inspections of their environment. The animals learned that their actions led to an effect, and the type of effect influenced whether the behavior would be repeated. Thorndike&#x27;s &#x27;law of effect&#x27; contained the core elements of what would become known as operant conditioning. B. F. Skinner expanded upon Thorndike&#x27;s existing work. Skinner theorized that if a behavior is followed by a reward, that behavior is more likely to be repeated, but added that if it is followed by some sort of punishment, it is less likely to be repeated. He introduced the word reinforcement into Thorndike&#x27;s law of effect. Through his experiments, Skinner discovered the law of operant learning which included extinction, punishment and generalization.

Skinner designed the operant conditioning chamber to allow for specific hypothesis testing and behavioural observation. He wanted to create a way to observe animals in a more controlled setting as observation of behaviour in nature can be unpredictable.

== Purpose ==

 An operant conditioning chamber allows researchers to study animal behaviour and response to conditioning. They do this by teaching an animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli. When the correct action is performed the animal receives positive reinforcement in the form of food or other reward. In some cases, the chamber may deliver positive punishment to discourage incorrect responses. For example, researchers have tested certain invertebrates&#x27; reaction to operant conditioning using a &quot;heat box&quot;. The box has two walls used for manipulation; one wall can undergo temperature change while the other cannot. As soon as the invertebrate crosses over to the side which can undergo temperature change, the researcher will increase the temperature. Eventually, the invertebrate will be conditioned to stay on the side that does not undergo a temperature change. After conditioning, even when the temperature is turned to its lowest setting, the invertebrate will avoid that side of the box.

Skinner&#x27;s pigeon studies involved a series of levers. When the lever was pressed, the pigeon would receive a food reward. This was made more complex as researchers studied animal learning behaviours. A pigeon would be placed in the conditioning chamber and another one would be placed in an adjacent box separated by a plexiglass wall. The pigeon in the chamber would learn to press the lever to receive food as the other pigeon watched. The pigeons would then be switched, and researchers would observe them for signs of cultural learning.

== Structure ==

The outside shell of an operant conditioning chamber is a large box big enough to easily accommodate the animal being used as a subject. Commonly used animals include rodents (usually lab rats), pigeons, and primates. The chamber is often sound-proof and light-proof to avoid distracting stimuli.

Operant conditioning chambers have at least one response mechanism that can automatically detect the occurrence of a behavioral response or action (i.e., pecking, pressing, pushing, etc.). This may be a lever or series of lights which the animal will respond to in the presence of stimulus. Typical mechanisms for primates and rats are response levers; if the subject presses the lever, the opposite end closes a switch that is monitored by a computer or other programmed device. Typical mechanisms for pigeons and other birds are response keys with a switch that closes if the bird pecks at the key with sufficient force. The other minimal requirement of an operant conditioning chamber is that it has a means of delivering a primary reinforcer such as a food reward.A simple configuration, such as one response mechanism and one feeder, may be used to investigate a variety of psychological phenomena. Modern operant conditioning chambers may have multiple mechanisms, such as several response levers, two or more feeders, and a variety of devices capable of generating different stimuli including lights, sounds, music, figures, and drawings. Some configurations use an LCD panel for the computer generation of a variety of visual stimuli or a set of LED lights to create patterns they wish to be replicated.

Some operant conditioning chambers can also have electrified nets or floors so that shocks can be given to the animals as a positive punishment or lights of different colors that give information about when the food is available as a positive reinforcement.

== Research impact ==
Operant conditioning chambers have become common in a variety of research disciplines especially in animal learning. The chambers design allows for easy monitoring of the animal and provides a space to manipulate certain behaviours. This controlled environment may allow for research and experimentation which cannot be performed in the field.

There are a variety of applications for operant conditioning. For instance, shaping the behavior of a child is influenced by the compliments, comments, approval, and disapproval of one&#x27;s behavior. An important factor of operant conditioning is its ability to explain learning in real-life situations. From an early age, parents nurture their children&#x27;s behavior by using reward and praise following an achievement (crawling or taking a first step) which reinforces such behavior. When a child misbehaves, punishment in the form of verbal discouragement or the removal of privileges are used to discourage them from repeating their actions.

Skinner&#x27;s studies on animals and their behavior laid the framework needed for similar studies on human subjects. Based on his work, developmental psychologists were able to study the effect of positive and negative reinforcement. Skinner found that the environment influenced behavior and when that environment is manipulated, behaviour will change. From this, developmental psychologists proposed theories on operant learning in children. That research was applied to education and the treatment of illness in young children. Skinner&#x27;s theory of operant conditioning played a key role in helping psychologists understand how behavior is learned. It explains why reinforcement can be used so effectively in the learning process, and how schedules of reinforcement can affect the outcome of conditioning.

== Commercial applications ==
Slot machines, online games, and dating apps are examples where sophisticated operant schedules of reinforcement are used to reinforce certain behaviors.

Gamification, the technique of using game design elements in non-game contexts, has also been described as using operant conditioning and other behaviorist techniques to encourage desired user behaviors.

<text>Hiram P. Lodge is a fictional character in the Archie Comics series. He is a father to the series&#x27; protagonist, Veronica Lodge and a husband to her mother, Hermione Lodge. 

He is the owner and CEO of his own multi-billion dollar conglomerate, Lodge Industries. As the richest man in Riverdale, he has risen to becoming a successful businessman who has presided as the town&#x27;s most prominent industrialist. 

The family name was inspired by the Lodges, a Massachusetts Brahmin political family that previously commissioned a mural from Archie Comics creator Bob Montana.

Hiram is portrayed by Mark Consuelos in the television series &quot;Riverdale&quot; and &quot;Katy Keene&quot;.

== Background ==
Hiram Lodge dislikes Archie Andrews especially for Veronica, leading him to disapprove the idea of the two dating. Hiram tries to avoid Archie from visiting their household, because every time he does, something goes wrong, such as Archie accidentally breaking something valuable in the household or injuring him. He allows the pair to continue dating, however, as he understands how well Archie treats Veronica. In multiple stories, Archie saves Mr. Lodge from thieves, blackmailers, and underhanded business rivals, causing Hiram to begin softening up to Archie. On one occasion, he asks Archie and Jughead to act like they are his sons in order to secure a business deal with clients, which are from a culture that do not respect a person without sons. Taking advantage, the teens drive away in Lodge&#x27;s new car and boss around Veronica and Smithers. However, a typhoon breaks out just in time when the clients attempt to leave, causing a tree to break and almost fall. Archie and Jughead save the day, enabling Lodge to secure the deal, and in his joy says, &quot;You did great, &quot;sons&quot;!&quot;, much to Veronica and Smithers&#x27; chagrin.

In one story, Veronica claims that his &quot;Daddy has billions&quot;, despite Hiram Lodge only being a multimillionaire. This is likely due to the extreme rise of wealth in the real world since the introduction of the Archie Comics, which means that Hiram would have to be a billionaire to keep up the pretense that he is one of the richest men in the world. In the comics, this is explicated by the take-over of the Blossom corporation, owned by Cheryl Blossom&#x27;s father. 

Lodge is usually portrayed as a successful and wealthy businessman, rather than a financier or banker, who is frequently involved in international business ventures. He has a keen eye for unusual business opportunities that others overlook. In one story, a rival businessman thought that he had outmaneuvered Mr. Lodge by selling him a garbage dump for $2,000, yet Lodge easily retorted that he had covered the dump with artificial snow and turned it into a ski resort, which made him realize a windfall profit of over $2 million USD in its initial year of operation. 

The stories about his childhood are contradictory as some suggest he was born into old money and is descended from the founders of Riverdale, while others state that he built his fortune from that of his in-laws. Lodge had also served in the Army at some point in his life.

Although political matters in the Archie comics are rarely mentioned, one storyline hinted that Hiram was a conservative. In the storyline, Archie had been shrunken and was forced to use a paper airplane to fly to the other side of the room. When it was suggested that they lean to the left, Veronica quipped that her dad hated anyone who leaned to the left.

Note: In some &#x27;Archie&#x27; stories dating from the 1960s, he is referred to as J. P. Lodge, and in his first appearance in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #31, he is referred to as Burton K. Lodge. One story gives his name as Mark.

Despite his old age, he remains physically fit and healthy, which in one story, Lodge attributes his strong physical fitness in having successfully chased Archie away.

== In other media ==
=== Animation ===
* Hiram appears sporadically in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot; (1999–2000), voiced by John Michael Lee. His dislike of Archie is notably toned down, as they don&#x27;t interact much on-screen. In the episode &quot;Teen Out of Time&quot;, it is revealed that Mr. Lodge was the one who gave Pop Tate a bank loan to open his diner.
* Hiram appears briefly in the direct-to-video film, &quot;The Archies in JugMan&quot; (2002), with Lee reprising his role. Notably, his wife appears in the film too despite not being present in the TV series.

=== Live action ===
* Hiram appears in the 1990 television film, &quot;&quot;, portrayed by James Noble. He is the main antagonist and anti-hero who wants to evict Pop Tate from his soda shop, under the pretext of expanding Reggie Mantle&#x27;s gym. Just like in the comic books, he doesn&#x27;t want Veronica dating Archie, as he finds them incompatible, and seeing his daughter flirt with him only emboldens him to go through with his plans.
* Hiram appears as a major antagonist on the CW series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, portrayed by Mark Consuelos. The pilot episode establishes that he is in New York City on trial for fraud and embezzlement, leading Hermione and Veronica to move to Riverdale to escape his notoriety. He and Fred Andrews were rivals in school, as Hiram stole Hermione from Fred and later married her. Hermione continues to help Hiram run his business and criminal empire from behind bars. In the second season, Hiram is released and returns to Riverdale, establishing himself as a threatening and powerful presence in the town. Just like the comic books and animated series, he hates Archie and doesn&#x27;t want him to date Veronica. In the fourth season, he reveals he was born Jaime Luna but changed his name due to the bad reputation of the Luna family. In the fifth season episode &quot;Chapter Eighty-Eight: Citizen Lodge&quot;, he tells Reggie Mantle about his father Javier Luna, who moved to Riverdale to work in palladium mines but ended up shining shoes. Hiram got tired of living in poverty and went to work for the gangster Vittorio &quot;Vito&quot; Alto, eventually taking over Vito&#x27;s business when Vito disappeared.
* Consuelos reprises the role in the episode &quot;Chapter Thirteen: Come Together&quot; from the first season of &quot;Katy Keene&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

<text>Betty and Veronica (also known as Archie&#x27;s Girls Betty and Veronica) is an ongoing comic book series published by Archie Comics focusing on &quot;best frenemies&quot; Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge. Betty first appeared in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 while Veronica made her debut a few months later, in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #26, as an immediate rival to Betty for Archie&#x27;s affections. Together the pair form the female part of the classic love triangle which has become a staple of the comic series since 1942.

&quot;Archie&#x27;s Girls Betty and Veronica&quot; was first published in March 1950 and comprised 347 issues when it ended in April 1987. The run additionally included eight annuals published from 1953 to 1980. A new Betty and Veronica series launched with a #1 in June 1987. This volume ended in late 2015 with 278 issues (625 overall issues if you count volume one). Stories from previous issues of Betty and Veronica have been reprinted in Archie Comics Digest size digest series starring the two.

&quot;Betty and Veronica&quot;, a new series taking place in their rebooted New Riverdale (Archie comics) universe, debuted in September 2016. The series was written and drawn by Adam Hughes.

==Volume 1 (1950–1987)==

===Significant issues===
* In issue #4, artist Dan DeCarlo did his first work for Archie, beginning a fifty-year career with the publishing house.
* Issue #118 (October 1965) featured the first appearance of Betty&#x27;s superheroine alter ego, Superteen, a spoof on the popular superhero comics at the time.
* Issue #320 (October 1982) featured the first appearance of Cheryl Blossom, a redhead from Pembroke who competed with Betty and Veronica for Archie&#x27;s affection.

==Volume 2 (1987–2015)==

===Stories===
Stories center around the daily life in Riverdale, which includes school, sports, part-time jobs, and romance. Most stories usually feature the two young women as they fight for Archie&#x27;s affections. On occasion, stories will delve into more serious subjects such as divorce or cheating.

In 2007, a new realistic look for the characters was experimented with but reverted to their traditional appearances in 2008.

At New York Comic Con in 2013, Archie Comics announced that Betty and Veronica would leave Riverdale in &quot;Farewell, Betty and Veronica&quot; written by Michael Uslan with art by Dan Parent, and that two new female characters would replace them. The six-issue arc, titled &quot;Farewell to Betty and Veronica&quot;, was published from November 2014 to August 2015 through issues #272-277.

==Volume 3 (2016–2017)==

===Story===
&quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; was relaunched in 2016 as one of the New Riverdale titles. The series focuses on Pops’ Chocklit Shoppe being taken over by a huge coffee company owned by Veronica&#x27;s father. Betty and Veronica take opposing viewpoints over the issue.

<doc id="188386" wikidata="Q210064" url="?curid=188386" title="Lighting">
<text>Lighting or illumination is the deliberate use of light to achieve practical or aesthetic effects. Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures, as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight. Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. This can save energy in place of using artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. Proper lighting can enhance task performance, improve the appearance of an area, or have positive psychological effects on occupants.

Indoor lighting is usually accomplished using light fixtures, and is a key part of interior design. Lighting can also be an intrinsic component of landscape projects.

==History==

With the discovery of fire, the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches. As early as 400,000 years ago, fire was kindled in the caves of Peking Man. Prehistoric people used primitive oil lamps to illuminate surroundings. These lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as rocks, shells, horns and stones, were filled with grease, and had a fiber wick. Lamps typically used animal or vegetable fats as fuel. Hundreds of these lamps (hollow worked stones) have been found in the Lascaux caves in modern-day France, dating to about 15,000 years ago. Oily animals (birds and fish) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick. Fireflies have been used as lighting sources. Candles and glass and pottery lamps were also invented. Chandeliers were an early form of &quot;light fixture&quot;.

A major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil. The use of whale oil declined after Abraham Gesner, a Canadian geologist, first refined kerosene in the 1840s, allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost. In the 1850s, the price of whale oil dramatically increased (more than doubling from 1848 to 1856) due to shortages of available whales, hastening whale oil&#x27;s decline. By 1860, there were 33 kerosene plants in the United States, and Americans spent more on gas and kerosene than on whale oil. The final death knell for whale oil was in 1859, when crude oil was discovered and the petroleum industry arose.
Gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s, and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people. The gas mantle boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lanterns. The next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electric lighting in the form of arc lights for large space and street lighting, followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting.

Over time, electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries. Segmented sleep patterns disappeared, improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night, and more street lights reduced urban crime.

==Fixtures==
Lighting fixtures come in a wide variety of styles for various functions. The most important functions are as a holder for the light source, to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare. Some are very plain and functional, while some are pieces of art in themselves. Nearly any material can be used, so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes.

An important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency, meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy, usually measured in lumen per watt. A fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the &quot;bulb&quot; to the surroundings. The more transparent the lighting fixtures are, the higher efficacy. Shading the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability.

Color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications. The color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics (spectral power distribution) of the lamp. An incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvins; daylight is around 6400 kelvins. Lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum, while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance. For critical inspection or color matching tasks, or for retail displays of food and clothing, the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect.

===Types===

Lighting is classified by intended use as general, accent, or task lighting, depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture.

* Task lighting is mainly functional and is usually the most concentrated, for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials. For example, reading poor-quality reproductions may require task lighting levels up to 1500 lux (140 footcandles), and some inspection tasks or surgical procedures require even higher levels.
* Accent lighting is mainly decorative, intended to highlight pictures, plants, or other elements of interior design or landscaping.
* General lighting (sometimes referred to as ambient light) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area. Indoors, this would be a basic lamp on a table or floor, or a fixture on the ceiling. Outdoors, general lighting for a parking lot may be as low as 10-20 lux (1-2 footcandles) since pedestrians and motorists already used to the dark will need little light for crossing the area.

===Methods===

* Downlighting is most common, with fixtures on or recessed in the ceiling casting light downward. This tends to be the most used method, used in both offices and homes. Although it is easy to design, it has dramatic problems with glare and excess energy consumption due to large number of fittings. The introduction of LED lighting has greatly improved this by approx. 90% when compared to a halogen downlight or spotlight. LED lamps or bulbs are now available to retro fit in place of high energy consumption lamps.
* Uplighting is less common, often used to bounce indirect light off the ceiling and back down. It is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels. Uplighting (indirect) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces. It gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation. However indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface. While indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free light effect it can be regarded as an uneconomical lighting principle.
* Front lighting is also quite common, but tends to make the subject look flat as its casts almost no visible shadows. Lighting from the side is the less common, as it tends to produce glare near eye level.
*Backlighting either around or through an object is mainly for accent. Backlighting is used to illuminate a background or backdrop. This adds depth to an image or scene. Others use it to achieve a more dramatic effect.

===Forms of lighting===

====Indoor lighting====

Forms of lighting include alcove lighting, which like most other uplighting is indirect. This is often done with fluorescent lighting (first available at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair) or rope light, occasionally with neon lighting, and recently with LED strip lighting. It is a form of backlighting.

Soffit or close to wall lighting can be general or a decorative wall-wash, sometimes used to bring out texture (like stucco or plaster) on a wall, though this may also show its as well. The effect depends heavily on the exact type of lighting source used.

Recessed lighting (often called &quot;pot lights&quot; in Canada, &quot;can lights&quot; or &#x27;high hats&quot; in the US) is popular, with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it. These downlights can use narrow beam spotlights, or wider-angle floodlights, both of which are bulbs having their own reflectors. There are also downlights with internal reflectors designed to accept common &#x27;A&#x27; lamps (light bulbs) which are generally less costly than reflector lamps. Downlights can be incandescent, fluorescent, HID (high intensity discharge) or LED.

Track lighting, invented by Lightolier, was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting, and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension.

A sconce is a wall-mounted fixture, particularly one that shines up and sometimes down as well. A torchère is an uplight intended for ambient lighting. It is typically a floor lamp but may be wall-mounted like a sconce. Further interior light fixtures include chandeliers, pendant lights, ceiling fans with lights, close-to-ceiling or flush lights, and various types of lamps

The portable or table lamp is probably the most common fixture, found in many homes and offices. The standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting, while the desk lamp is considered task lighting. Magnifier lamps are also task lighting.

The illuminated ceiling was once popular in the 1960s and 1970s but fell out of favor after the 1980s. This uses diffuser panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights, and is considered general lighting. Other forms include neon, which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else, but to actually be an artwork in itself. This would probably fall under accent lighting, though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting.

In a movie theater, steps in the aisles are usually marked with a row of small lights for convenience and safety, when the film has started and the other lights are off. Traditionally made up of small low wattage, low-voltage lamps in a track or translucent tube, these are rapidly being replaced with LED based versions.

====Outdoor lighting====

Street Lights are used to light roadways and walkways at night. Some manufacturers are designing LED and photovoltaic luminaires to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional street light fixtures.

Floodlights can be used to illuminate work zones or outdoor playing fields during nighttime hours. The most common type of floodlights are metal halide and high pressure sodium lights.

Beacon lights are positioned at the intersection of two roads to aid in navigation.

Sometimes security lighting can be used along roadways in urban areas, or behind homes or commercial facilities. These are extremely bright lights used to deter crime. Security lights may include floodlights and be activated with PIR switches that detect moving heat sources in darkness.

Entry lights can be used outside to illuminate and signal the entrance to a property. These lights are installed for safety, security, and for decoration.

Underwater accent lighting is also used for koi ponds, fountains, swimming pools and the like.

Neon signs are most often used to attract attention rather than to illuminate.

==Vehicle use==
Vehicles typically include headlamps and tail lights. Headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle&#x27;s direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle&#x27;s transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars&#x27; speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.

==Lamps==

Commonly called &#x27;light bulbs&#x27;, lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture, which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation. While lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption, expressed in watts, proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced. For example, a 60 W incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light. Visible light output is typically measured in lumens. This unit only quantifies the visible radiation, and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle produces on the close order of 13 lumens, a 60 watt incandescent lamp makes around 700 lumens, and a 15-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces about 800 lumens, but actual output varies by specific design. Rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output, to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp.

Lamp types include:
* Ballast: A ballast is an auxiliary piece of equipment designed to start and properly control the flow of power to discharge light sources such as fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps. Some lamps require the ballast to have thermal protection.
* fluorescent light: A tube coated with phosphor containing low pressure mercury vapor that produces white light.
* Halogen: Incandescent lamps containing halogen gases such as iodine or bromine, increasing the efficacy of the lamp versus a plain incandescent lamp.
* Neon: A low pressure gas contained within a glass tube; the color emitted depends on the gas.
* Light-emitting diodes: Light-emitting diodes (LED) are solid state devices that emit light by dint of the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material.
* Compact fluorescent lamps: CFLs are designed to replace incandescent lamps in existing and new installations.

==Design and architecture==

===Architectural lighting design===


Lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as &#x27;architectural lighting design&#x27;. Lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required, occupants of the structure, energy efficiency, and cost. Artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in a space by using daylight factor calculations. For simple installations, hand calculations based on tabular data are used to provide an acceptable lighting design. More critical or complex designs now routinely use computer software such as Radiance for mathematical modeling, which can allow an architect to quickly and accurately evaluate the benefit of a proposed design.

In some instances, the materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect. For example, dark paint tends to absorb light, making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is, whereas light paint does the opposite. Other reflective surfaces also have an effect on lighting design.

==On stage and set==


Lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre, dance, or musical performance, and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects. Stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics. The setup of stage lighting is tailored for each scene of each production. Dimmers, colored filters, reflectors, lenses, motorized or manually aimed lamps, and different kinds of flood and spot lights are among the tools used by a stage lighting designer to produce the desired effects. A set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments.

Motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting. Especially in the early days of these industries, very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges. Modern cameras require less light, and modern light sources emit less heat.

==Measurement==
Measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source, along with the colors that can be rendered by this light. The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light. The basic SI unit of measurement is the candela (cd), which describes the luminous intensity, all other photometric units are derived from the candela. Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2). The CGS unit of luminance is the stilb, which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2. The amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen (lm).

The SI unit of illuminance and luminous emittance, being the luminous power per area, is measured in Lux. It is used in photometry as a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function, a standardized model of human visual brightness perception. In English, &quot;lux&quot; is used in both singular and plural.

Visual comfort often entails the measurement of subjective evaluations. Several measurement methods have been developed to control glare resulting from indoor lighting design. The Unified Glare Rating (UGR), the Visual Comfort Probability, and the Daylight Glare Index are some of the most well-known methods of measurement. In addition to these new methods, four main factors influence the degree of discomfort glare; the luminance of the glare source, the solid angle of the glare source, the background luminance, and the position of the glare source in the field of view must all be taken into account.

===Color properties===

To define light source color properties, the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics, correlated color temperature (CCT), commonly used as an indication of the apparent &quot;warmth&quot; or &quot;coolness&quot; of the light emitted by a source, and color rendering index (CRI), an indication of the light source&#x27;s ability to make objects appear natural.

However, these two metrics, developed in the last century, are facing increased challenges and criticisms as new types of light sources, particularly light-emitting diodes (LEDs), become more prevalent in the market.

For example, in order to meet the expectations for good color rendering in retail applications, research suggests using the well-established CRI along with another metric called gamut area index (GAI). GAI represents the relative separation of object colors illuminated by a light source; the greater the GAI, the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors. As a result, light sources which balance both CRI and GAI are generally preferred over ones that have only high CRI or only high GAI.

===Light exposure===
Typical measurements of light have used a Dosimeter. Dosimeters measure an individual&#x27;s or an object&#x27;s exposure to something in the environment, such as light dosimeters and ultraviolet dosimeters.

In order to specifically measure the amount of light entering the eye, personal circadian light meter called the Daysimeter has been developed. This is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light (intensity, spectrum, timing, and duration) entering the eye that affects the human body&#x27;s clock.

The small, head-mounted device measures an individual&#x27;s daily rest and activity patterns, as well as exposure to short-wavelength light that stimulates the circadian system. The device measures activity and light together at regular time intervals and electronically stores and logs its operating temperature. The Daysimeter can gather data for up to 30 days for analysis.

==Energy consumption==
Several strategies are available to minimize energy requirements for lighting a building:

* Specification of illumination requirements for each given use area
* Analysis of lighting quality to ensure that adverse components of lighting (for example, glare or incorrect color spectrum) are not biasing the design
* Integration of space planning and interior architecture (including choice of interior surfaces and room geometries) to lighting design
* Design of time of day use that does not expend unnecessary energy
* Selection of fixtures and lamps that reflect best available technology for energy conservation
* Training of building occupants to use lighting equipment in most efficient manner
* Maintenance of lighting systems to minimize energy wastage
* Use of natural light
** Some big box stores were being built from 2006 on with numerous plastic bubble skylights, in many cases completely obviating the need for interior artificial lighting for many hours of the day.
** In countries where indoor lighting of simple dwellings is a significant cost, &quot;Moser lamps&quot;, plastic water-filled transparent drink bottles fitted through the roof, provide the equivalent of a 40- to 60-watt incandescent bulb each during daylight.
* Load shedding can help reduce the power requested by individuals to the main power supply. Load shedding can be done on an individual level, at a building level, or even at a regional level.

Specification of illumination requirements is the basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task. Clearly, much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a word processing work station. Generally speaking, the energy expended is proportional to the design illumination level. For example, a lighting level of 400 lux might be chosen for a work environment involving meeting rooms and conferences, whereas a level of 80 lux could be selected for building hallways. If the hallway standard simply emulates the conference room needs, then much more energy will be consumed than is needed.

===Lighting control systems===
Lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed. Lighting control systems typically incorporate the use of time schedules, occupancy control, and photocell control (i.e. daylight harvesting). Some systems also support demand response and will automatically dim or turn off lights to take advantage of utility incentives. Lighting control systems are sometimes incorporated into larger building automation systems.

Many newer control systems are using wireless mesh open standards (such as Zigbee), which provides benefits including easier installation (no need to run control wires) and interoperability with other standards-based building control systems (e.g. security).

In response to daylighting technology, daylight harvesting systems have been developed to further reduce energy consumption. These technologies are helpful, but they do have their downfalls. Many times, rapid and frequent switching of the lights on and off can occur, particularly during unstable weather conditions or when daylight levels are changing around the switching illuminance. Not only does this disturb occupants, it can also reduce lamp life. A variation of this technology is the &#x27;differential switching or dead-band&#x27; photoelectric control which has multiple illuminances it switches from so as not to disturb occupants as much.

Occupancy sensors to allow operation for whenever someone is within the area being scanned can control lighting. When motion can no longer be detected, the lights shut off. Passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat, such as the pattern created by a moving person. The control must have an unobstructed view of the building area being scanned. Doors, partitions, stairways, etc. will block motion detection and reduce its effectiveness. The best applications for passive infrared occupancy sensors are open spaces with a clear view of the area being scanned. Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return. A break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control. Ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving, restrooms, and open areas requiring 360-degree coverage. Some occupancy sensors utilize both passive infrared and ultrasonic technology, but are usually more expensive. They can be used to control one lamp, one fixture or many fixtures.

===Daylighting===

Daylighting is the oldest method of interior lighting. Daylighting is simply designing a space to use as much natural light as possible. This decreases energy consumption and costs, and requires less heating and cooling from the building. Daylighting has also been proven to have positive effects on patients in hospitals as well as work and school performance. Due to a lack of information that indicate the likely energy savings, daylighting schemes are not yet popular among most buildings. Unlike electric lighting, the distribution of daylight varies considerably throughout the entire year inside a building.

===Solid-state lighting===
In recent years light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are becoming increasingly efficient leading to an extraordinary increase in the use of solid state lighting. In many situations, controlling the light emission of LEDs may be done most effectively by using the principles of nonimaging optics.

==Health effects==

It is valuable to provide the correct light intensity and color spectrum for each task or environment. Otherwise, energy not only could be wasted but over-illumination can lead to adverse health and psychological effects.

Beyond the energy factors being considered, it is important not to over-design illumination, lest adverse health effects such as headache frequency, stress, and increased blood pressure be induced by the higher lighting levels. In addition, glare or excess light can decrease worker efficiency.

Analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting, but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used. Not only will greater reliance on natural light reduce energy consumption, but will favorably impact human health and performance. New studies have shown that the performance of students is influenced by the time and duration of daylight in their regular schedules. Designing school facilities to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being. Similarly, designing lighting systems that maximize the right amount of light at the appropriate time of day for the elderly may help relieve symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The human circadian system is entrained to a 24-hour light-dark pattern that mimics the earth&#x27;s natural light/dark pattern. When those patterns are disrupted, they disrupt the natural circadian cycle. Circadian disruption may lead to numerous health problems including breast cancer, seasonal affective disorder, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and other ailments.

A study conducted in 1972 and 1981, documented by Robert Ulrich, surveyed 23 surgical patients assigned to rooms looking out on a natural scene. The study concluded that patients assigned to rooms with windows allowing much natural light had shorter postoperative hospital stays, received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses&#x27; notes, and took fewer potent analgesics than 23 matched patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall. This study suggests that due to the nature of the scenery and daylight exposure was indeed healthier for patients as opposed to those exposed to little light from the brick wall. In addition to increased work performance, proper usage of windows and daylighting crosses the boundaries between pure aesthetics and overall health.

Alison Jing Xu, assistant professor of management at the University of Toronto Scarborough and Aparna Labroo of Northwestern University conducted a series of studies analyzing the correlation between lighting and human emotion. The researchers asked participants to rate a number of things such as: the spiciness of chicken-wing sauce, the aggressiveness of a fictional character, how attractive someone was, their feelings about specific words, and the taste of two juices–all under different lighting conditions. In their study, they found that both positive and negative human emotions are felt more intensely in bright light. Professor Xu stated, &quot;we found that on sunny days depression-prone people actually become more depressed.&quot; They also found that dim light makes people make more rational decisions and settle negotiations easier. In the dark, emotions are slightly suppressed. However, emotions are intensified in the bright light.

==Environmental issues==

===Compact fluorescent lamps===
Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) use less power than an incandescent lamp to supply the same amount of light, however they contain mercury which is a disposal hazard. Due to the ability to reduce electricity consumption, many organizations encouraged the adoption of CFLs. Some electric utilities and local governments subsidized CFLs or provided them free to customers as a means of reducing electricity demand. For a given light output, CFLs use between one fifth and one quarter the power of an equivalent incandescent lamp. Unlike incandescent lamps CFLs need a little time to warm up and reach full brightness. Not all CFLs are suitable for dimming. CFL&#x27;s have largely been replaced with LED technologies.

===LED lamps===
LED lamps provide significant energy savings over incandescent and fluorescent lamps. According to the Energy Saving Trust, LED lamps use only 10% power compared to a standard incandescent bulb, where compact fluorescent lamps use 20% and energy saving halogen lamps 70%. The lifetime is also much longer — up to 50,000 hours. The downside when they were first popularized was the initial cost. By 2018, production costs dropped, performance increased, and energy consumption was reduced. While the initially cost of LEDs is still higher than incandescent lamps, the savings are so dramatic that there are very few instances that LEDs are not the most economical choice.

Scattered light from outdoor illumination may have effects on the environment and human health. For instance, one study conducted by the American Medical Association warned on the use of high blue content white LEDs in street lighting, due to their higher impact on human health and environment, compared to low blue content light sources (e.g. High Pressure Sodium, phosphor-coated or PC amber LEDs, and low CCT LEDs).

===Light pollution===
Light pollution is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs, houses, and buildings. Polluting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Light pollution is described as artificial light that is excessive or intrudes where it is not wanted. Well-designed lighting sends light only where it is needed without scattering it elsewhere. Poorly designed lighting can also compromise safety. For example, glare creates safety issues around buildings by causing very sharp shadows, temporarily blinding passersby making them vulnerable to would-be assailants. The negative ecological effects of artificial light have been increasingly well documented. The World Health Organization in 2007 issued a report that noted the effects of bright light on flora and fauna, sea turtle hatchlings, frogs during mating season and the migratory patterns of birds. The American Medical Association in 2012 issued a warning that extended exposure to light at night increases the risk of some cancers. Two studies in Israel from 2008 have yielded some additional findings about a possible correlation between artificial light at night and certain cancers.

====Effects on animals====

Artificial light at night refers to any light source other than a natural light source. Sources of artificial light include LEDS and fluorescents. This particular light source has effect on the reproduction, immune function, metabolism, thermoregulation and body temperature of organisms that need light for their daily activity. 

Firstly, most organisms metabolism largely depends on light. In some instances the presence of intense light starts up or increases enzyme activity inside the body of an animal. For diurnal organisms, high rate of metabolism takes place during the day and reduces or comes to a stop during the night thus, artificial light at night has a negative impact of the metabolism of diurnal organisms. 
Moreover, the body temperature of diurnal animals fall during the night but the presence of artificial light at night, then causes an increase in body temperature which affects the melatonin levels of the animal. 

Furthermore, for organisms such as birds, their sex organs are activated in relation to light intensity in certain periods during the summer at day time to aid reproduction. These sex organs are deactivated during the night but the presence of artificial light during the night sometimes disrupts their reproduction process.

==Professional organizations==

===International===
The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) is an international authority and standard defining organization on color and lighting. Publishing widely used standard metrics such as various CIE color spaces and the color rendering index.

The Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), in conjunction with organizations like ANSI and ASHRAE, publishes guidelines, standards, and handbooks that allow categorization of the illumination needs of different built environments. Manufacturers of lighting equipment publish photometric data for their products, which defines the distribution of light released by a specific luminaire. This data is typically expressed in standardized form defined by the IESNA.

The International Association of Lighting Designers (IALD) is an organization which focuses on the advancement of lighting design education and the recognition of independent professional lighting designers. Those fully independent designers who meet the requirements for professional membership in the association typically append the abbreviation IALD to their name.

The Professional Lighting Designers Association (PLDA), formerly known as ELDA is an organisation focusing on the promotion of the profession of Architectural Lighting Design. They publish a monthly newsletter and organise different events throughout the world.

The National Council on Qualifications for the Lighting Professions (NCQLP) offers the Lighting Certification Examination which tests rudimentary lighting design principles. Individuals who pass this exam become &quot;Lighting Certified&quot; and may append the abbreviation LC to their name. This certification process is one of three national (U.S.) examinations (the others are CLEP and CLMC) in the lighting industry and is open not only to designers, but to lighting equipment manufacturers, electric utility employees, etc.

The Professional Lighting And Sound Association (PLASA) is a UK-based trade organisation representing the 500+ individual and corporate members drawn from the technical services sector. Its members include manufacturers and distributors of stage and entertainment lighting, sound, rigging and similar products and services, and affiliated professionals in the area. They lobby for and represent the interests of the industry at various levels, interacting with government and regulating bodies and presenting the case for the entertainment industry. Example subjects of this representation include the ongoing review of radio frequencies (which may or may not affect the radio bands in which wireless microphones and other devices use) and engaging with the issues surrounding the introduction of the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive) regulations.

<text>The Rheinisch-Bergische Kreis is a Kreis (district) in the Cologne Bonn Region of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Kreis Mettman, Oberbergischer Kreis and Rhein-Sieg, and the district-free cities Cologne, Leverkusen, Solingen and Remscheid.

==History==
The area of the &quot;Bergisches Land&quot; belonged to the earldom of Berg for most of medieval times, which gives the district its name.
In 1816, after the whole Rhineland area was given to Prussia, the districts of Wipperfürth, Mülheim, Lennep, Opladen and Solingen were created in the area now covered by the district. In 1819, Opladen and Solingen were merged into the new Solingen district. In 1929, a new Rhein-Wupper district was created, and several municipalities were incorporated into the cities of Wuppertal, Remscheid and Solingen. In 1932, the districts Mülheim and Wipperfürth were merged to form the old &quot;Rheinisch-Bergische Kreis&quot;. Finally, in 1975, most of the area of the districts if Rhein-Wupper and Rheinisch-Bergisch was merged to form the current district.

==Geography==
The district form the western part of the &quot;Bergisches Land&quot;, where the hills of the Sauerland descend into the Rhine valley.

==Coat of arms==
The top part of the coat of arms show the geographical location of the district near the rhine valley - the silver band symbolized the Rhine river. This symbol comes from the coat of arms of the former prussian province Rhineland. In the left side the double bars are thought to symbolize a castle, they were used by the earls of Berg around 1100. When in 1225 the dukes of Limburg did take over they introduce their sign, the red lion with a blue tongue, into the coat of arms of the earldom.

Jughead first appeared in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22 in 1941 (also Archie&#x27;s first appearance) and later grew into his own title &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pal Jughead Comics&quot; in 1949, which also guest-starred Archie and his friends. Common story themes included Jughead&#x27;s insatiable appetite for hamburgers, avoiding Big Ethel who has a crush on him and outsmarting his nemesis Reggie Mantle.

The cover title was shortened to &quot;Jughead&quot; with #122 in July 1965, though the indicia continued to list &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pal Jughead&quot; until also changing in November&#x27;s #126. In #325, Cheryl Blossom made her second appearance after debuting in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Girls Betty and Veronica&quot; that same month. The original Jughead series ended with #352 (June 1987).

&quot;Jughead&quot; returned with a relaunched #1 in August 1987. With #46 (June 1993), the series was renamed &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pal Jughead Comics&quot;, echoing the previous volume. In the same issue Jughead finds out that his mother is expecting a baby, and in #50, the baby girl, nicknamed &quot;Jellybean&quot; is born. The second volume ended in 2012 with issue #214.

A third series, titled &quot;Jughead&quot;, was released in October 2015 as part of Archie Comics&#x27; New Riverdale. It is written by Chip Zdarsky with artwork by Erica Henderson. Derek Charm took over as regular artist starting with issue #7.

<doc id="188389" wikidata="Q17015915" url="?curid=188389" title="Mr. Weatherbee">
<text>Waldo Weatherbee is a fictional character in the Archie Comics universe. Mr. Weatherbee is the principal of Riverdale High School, where Archie Andrews is a student. To Riverdale students and (most) staff, he is commonly called Mr. Weatherbee, due to his authority position. Sometimes Archie and his friends playfully call him &quot;The Bee&quot;. Mr. Weatherbee is a heavyset, no-nonsense man who dresses in fairly old-fashioned clothes, including wearing pince-nez eyeglasses perched on the tip of a vermiform nose and a tiny wisp of a toupee that perpetually flies off whenever he is upset or startled. Principal Weatherbee is portrayed by Peter James Bryant in &quot;Riverdale&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-New Riverdale===
Mr. Weatherbee&#x27;s first appearance may be in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #25 (March 1942), as a passenger of a taxi driven by Archie. The man grumbles about the poor driving and remarks to himself how his headmastership of the high school will prevent &quot;go-nowheres&quot; like him. When he begins school, he suddenly again runs into Archie, realizing that he is also a student at his high school, and that chance ride has caused Archie to start off on the wrong foot. However, this character is not named, and he is not overweight. The first unambiguous appearance of Mr. Weatherbee is in &quot;Jackpot Comics&quot; #5 (Spring 1942), where he is named, and has his customary girth.

Mr. Weatherbee is sometimes stated as having once been in the United States military, and saw conflict in war. Due to retconning and the &quot;floating timeline&quot; principle, the specific war has changed over time. Weatherbee&#x27;s stated specific branch of the military has also varied over the years. According to a story in one of the digest magazines, Weatherbee was a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War; however, a previous story had placed him as a veteran of World War II&#x27;s Battle of the Bulge. Another story states Mr. Weatherbee was a former member of the United States Marine Corps. In a later story Mr. Weatherbee jests that his claim towards being in the &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; refers to his own battle against weight gain, which he has lost.

Mr. Weatherbee is shown in &quot;Little Archie&quot; stories as having been the principal of Riverdale Elementary School during the gang&#x27;s grade school years. He eventually transferred to Riverdale High School at about the same time Archie started high school, as shown in a 2008 storyline.

In one story, Coach Kleats, explaining to Archie and his friends the value of not underestimating Weatherbee&#x27;s physical prowess, mentions that Weatherbee was a good athlete in high school, excelling in football and baseball.

In &quot;Archie at Riverdale High&quot; #6 (April 1973), Archie&#x27;s father accidentally reveals that Weatherbee was known as &quot;Wild Willie&quot; in high school. All subsequent reprints replaced &quot;William&quot; with &quot;Waldo&quot; and &quot;Wild Willie&quot; with &quot;Wild Wally&quot;. Wild Wally was a troublemaker, and, after the kids find out, contrary to what he expects, they learn to appreciate it. However, this conflicts with other stories suggesting Waldo was quite studious in his teen years. Many stories feature Archie and his friends discovering that Mr. Weatherbee in his younger days was thin with red hair and had many adventures similar to Archie&#x27;s. These stories often result in Archie worrying that as an adult, he will become more like Mr. Weatherbee.

He is a semi-active explorer and discovered some Malooka Indian relics on Mr. Lodge&#x27;s grounds.

Weatherbee is constantly annoyed by Archie, so he often tries to avoid him. However, he cannot escape from Archie even in the summer months, as seen in various stories. One such story featured Mr. Weatherbee as the head of the camp where the Riverdale teens serve as junior counselors. He constantly dreams of the day when (or if) Archie graduates from high school and keeps a special calendar that counts the day until that event, although there are numerous stories in which Archie and his friends save him from various crises. There are also times when Weatherbee takes an interest in teaching Archie valuable lessons about life, nature, or things he enjoys. At times he even tries to hang out with the gang to be, as he says, more &quot;in&quot;. Although Archie often annoys Weatherbee, Weatherbee has admitted on several occasions that he is &quot;really fond&quot; of Archie and that he is one of his &quot;favorite&quot; students.

Mr. Weatherbee was particularly prominent in the comic series &quot;Archie and Me.&quot; Running from 1964 to 1987, the series featured stories specifically starring Mr. Weatherbee and Archie.

===New Riverdale===
Waldo Weatherbee first appears in &quot;Archie&quot; #1 (July 2015) while Archie is setting up for the school dance. In &quot;Jughead&quot; #1 (October 2015), he is forced into an early retirement due to the school board&#x27;s decision to update to a modern curriculum meaning some of the teaching staff was replaced. But later, he is reinstated as principal. It is shown in Jughead #7 (vol.3) that he has a wife named Ramona.

==Relationships==
Despite Archie and Mr. Weatherbee&#x27;s conflicts, Weatherbee is friends with Archie&#x27;s father, Fred, even inviting him to lead the parents&#x27; association during one story. During that episode, Weatherbee also acknowledged that while Archie&#x27;s school work has been careless at times, his grades were quite adequate.

While Weatherbee appears to be unpartnered, there has been speculation about the nature of his relationship with fellow Riverdale High veteran teacher Geraldine Grundy. A flashback in &quot;Veronica&quot; #200 (July 2010) showed the two having dated in their teen years.

In one Archie story where Dilton builds a time-machine, Mr. Weatherbee is shown to have been in love with a fellow student named Gwendolyn in his youth. After hearing his regrets about not getting together with her, Archie and Dilton go back in time to help him. Initially successful in introducing Weatherbee to Gwen, the plan ultimately fails when she finds out his ambition to become a teacher, which she says has no money in it. She then dumps Waldo. This was her only appearance in the series.

Despite the students&#x27; fear of Weatherbee, they still recognize his affection for the school and appreciate his efforts. In a story titled &quot;Sheer Gratitude&quot; in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Double Digest&quot; #167 (March 2006), Weatherbee&#x27;s age is said to be 65, the required age of retirement according to the rules of the Board of Education. Archie produces a petition from the entire school, however, and the Board agrees to let Weatherbee continue working at the high school.

Mr. Weatherbee used to have a wife in the golden age era. However, she was retconned out from the series. She is later reintroduced in the New Riverdale era as Ramona Weatherbee.

==Relatives==
In one story, Mr. Weatherbee&#x27;s motorcycle-riding mother visits the school. During her visit, she refers to him as &quot;Willy&quot;.

Mr. Weatherbee&#x27;s niece Wendy Weatherbee first appeared in &quot;Tales From Riverdale Digest&quot; #10 (May 2006). She became a minor recurring character, noted for her quirky, eccentric interests, such as odd fashions and exotic pets. She is the daughter of Mr. Weatherbee&#x27;s twin brother, Tony, as revealed in &quot;Tales From Riverdale Digest&quot; #28 (May 2008). The Weatherbee twins were very different as teenagers: Waldo focused on his career and education, while Tony focused more on girls and motorcycles (he opened his own motorcycle shop). Tony dated Miss Grundy when they were teenagers, but they parted. His friend Hiram Lodge apparently wanted to follow Tony&#x27;s example, but instead settled down as a businessman and married Hermione.

==Friends==
The staff of Riverdale High School, Archie Andrews, Reggie Mantle, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Dilton Doiley, Moose Mason, Ethel Muggs, Chuck Clayton, Nancy Woods, Midge Klump, Kevin Keller, and other characters from Archie Comics.

==Alternate versions==
In the alternate futures shown in the series &quot;Life with Archie&quot;, Miss Grundy and Mr. Weatherbee realized they loved each other, and the couple finally married. However, in this series, the former Miss Grundy died from kidney disease soon afterwards, leaving the portly principal a broken-hearted widower.

In &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Mr. Weatherbee is chaperoning the school dance with Miss Grundy. While on break, he reminisces with her about the time they snuck into Cypress Cemetery on Halloween when they were younger and makes references to &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. He tells her there&#x27;s nothing to be afraid of but is then mauled by a zombified Jughead.

==In other media==
Mr. Weatherbee has appeared in most Archie media adaptions to date.

===Animation===
* In the Filmation animated series, Mr. Weatherbee has certain fears about his mental health, owing to the &quot;hallucinations&quot; that he sometimes experiences. However, his fears are wholly unfounded and stem entirely from his accidental witnessing of Sabrina Spellman&#x27;s (or sometimes her Aunt Hilda&#x27;s) witchcraft. Typically, upon seeing such things as an elephant and a giraffe poking their heads out of the windows at Sabrina&#x27;s house (as in the episode &quot;Hexter&#x27;s Day Out&quot;) or Pop, the local malt shop proprietor flying by an aircraft window on a broom followed by Sabrina (as in &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Racing Broom&quot;), he turns away and in a rather perturbed voice says &quot;I didn&#x27;t see that! I did &quot;not&quot; see that!&quot; and often shouting &quot;Nurse!&quot;
* Weatherbee appears in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;, voiced by Tony Wike.

===Live action===
* In &quot;&quot;, David Doyle portrayed him.
* In The CW TV series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, Mr. Weatherbee is portrayed by Peter James Bryant.

<doc id="188399" wikidata="Q750652" url="?curid=188399" title="Mourning">
<text>Mourning is the emotional expression in response to a major life event causing grief, especially loss. It typically occurs as a result of someone&#x27;s death, especially a loved one.

The word is used to describe a complex of behaviors in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate, the expression of which varies by culture. Wearing black clothes is one practice followed in many countries, though other forms of dress are seen. Those most affected by the loss of a loved one often observe a period of mourning, marked by withdrawal from social events and quiet, respectful behavior in some cultures, though in others mourning is a collective experience. People may follow religious traditions for such occasions.
Mourning may apply to the death of, or anniversary of the death of, an important individual such as a local leader, monarch, religious figure, or member of family. State mourning may occur on such an occasion. In recent years, some traditions have given way to less strict practices, though many customs and traditions continue to be followed.

Death can be a release for the mourner, in the case of the death of an abusive or tyrannical person, or when death terminates the long, painful illness of a loved one. However, this release may add remorse and guilt for the mourner.

==Stages of grief==
Mourning is a personal and collective response which can vary depending on feelings and contexts. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross&#x27;s theory of grief describes five separate periods of experience in the psychological and emotional processing of death. These stages do not necessarily follow each other, and each period is not inevitable. The theory was originally posited to describe the experiences of those confronted with their imminent deaths, but has since been adopted to understand the experiences of bereaved loved ones. The theory has faced criticism for being overly prescriptive and lacking evidence.

# : A phase characterized by the refusal of the griever to accept news of a loved one&#x27;s death or terminal illness. Typically a shorter period which exists as a defense mechanism in the case of a distressing situation. 
# : This phase is characterized by a sense of outrage due to the loss, accompanied by guilt in some cases. The anger response typically involves blaming others for the loss, potentially including higher powers.
# : This phase sees a person engage in internal or external bargaining and negotiation.
# : The depression phase can be the longest phase of the mourning process, characterized by great sadness, questioning, and distress. An allowance of the pain from which the first three stages may be defense mechanisms. Mourners in this phase sometimes feel that they will never complete their mourning. They have experienced a wide range of emotions and their sorrow is great. 
# : The last stage of mourning, where the bereaved gets better. The reality of the loss is much more understood and accepted. The denial of grief is no longer present. There is an increased focus on the celebration of life, fond memories and the development of plans moving forward.

The five stages can be understood in terms of both psychological and social responses.

* : When someone close to a person dies, the person enters a period of sorrow and questioning, or even nervous breakdown. There are three stages in the grieving process, encompassing the denial, depression and acceptance phases of Kübler-Ross&#x27; five step model.
* : The feelings and mental state of the mourner affect their ability to maintain or enter into relationships with others, including professional, personal and sexual relationships. After the customs of burying or cremating the deceased, many cultures follow a number of socially-prescribed traditions that may affect the clothing a person wears and what activities they can partake in. These traditions are generally determined by the degree of kinship to and the social importance of the deceased.
There are various other models for understanding grief. Examples of these include: the Bowlby and Parkes&#x27; Four Phases of Grief, Worden&#x27;s Four Basic Tasks In Adapting To Loss, Wolfelt&#x27;s Companioning Approach to Grieving, Neimeyer&#x27;s Narrative and Constructivist Model, the Stroebe and Schut model and the Okun and Nowinski model.

==Social customs and dress==

===Africa===

====Ethiopia====
In Ethiopia, an (variants and in the Oromo language) is a traditional community organization whose members assist each other during the mourning process. Members make monthly financial contributions forming the &#x27;s fund. They are entitled to receive a certain sum of money from this fund to help cover funeral and other expenses associated with deaths. Additionally, members comfort the mourners: female members take turns doing housework, such as preparing food for the mourning family, while male members usually take the responsibility to arrange the funeral and erect a temporary tent to shelter guests who come to visit the mourning family. members will stay with the mourning family and comfort them for a week or more, during which time the family is never alone.

==== Nigeria ====
In Nigeria, there is a cultural belief that a recent widow is impure. During the mourning period, which lasts from 3 months to a year, several traditions are enforced for the purpose of purification, including confinement, complete shaving of the widow and her children, and a ban on any hygiene practices- including hand-washing, wearing clean clothes or sitting off the floor when eating. The extended family of the husband also take all the widow&#x27;s property. These practices are criticized for the health risks and emotional damage to the widow.

===Asia===
====East Asia====

White is the traditional color of mourning in Chinese culture, with white clothes and hats formerly having been associated with death. In imperial China, Confucian mourning obligations required even the emperor to retire from public affairs upon the death of a parent. The traditional period of mourning was nominally 3 years, but usually 25–27 lunar months in practice, and even shorter in the case of necessary officers; the emperor, for example, typically remained in seclusion for just 27 days.

The Japanese term for mourning dress is , referring to either primarily black Western-style formal wear or to black kimono and traditional clothing worn at funerals and Buddhist memorial services. Other colors, particularly reds and bright shades, are considered inappropriate for mourning dress. If wearing Western clothes, women may wear a single strand of white pearls. Japanese-style mourning dress for women consists of a five-crested plain black silk kimono, a black and black accessories worn over white undergarments, black and white . Men&#x27;s mourning dress consists of clothing worn on extremely formal occasions: a plain black silk five-crested kimono and black and white, or gray and white, striped trousers over white undergarments, a black crested jacket with a white closure, white or black and white . It is customary for Japanese-style mourning dress to be worn only by the immediate family and very close friends of the deceased; other attendees wear Western-style mourning dress or subdued Western or Japanese formal clothes.

====Southeast Asia====

In Thailand, people wear black when attending a funeral. Black is considered the mourning color, although historically it was white. Widows may wear purple when mourning the death of their spouse.

In the Philippines, mourning customs vary and are influenced by Chinese and folk Catholic beliefs. The immediate family traditionally wear black, with white as a popular alternative. Others may wear subdued colors when paying respects, with red universally considered taboo and bad luck when worn within 9–40 days of a death as the color is reserved for happier occasions. Those who wear uniforms are allowed to wear a black armband above the left elbow, as do male mourners in . The bereaved, should they wear other clothes, attach a small scrap of black ribbon or a black plastic pin on the left breast, which is disposed of after mourning. Flowers are an important symbol in Filipino funerals. Consuming chicken during the wake and funeral is believed to bring more death to the bereaved, who are also forbidden from seeing visitors off. Counting nine days from moment of death, a novena of Masses or other prayers, known as the (from the word for &quot;nine&quot;), is performed; the actual funeral and burial may take place within this period or after. The spirit of the dead is believed to roam the earth until the 40th day after death, when it is said to cross into the afterlife, echoing the 40 days between Christ&#x27;s Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven. The immediate family on this day have another Mass said followed by a small feast, and do so again on the first death anniversary. This is the , which is the commonly accepted endpoint of official mourning.

====West Asia====
In the Assyrian tradition, just after a person passes away, the mourning family host guests in an open house style. Only bitter coffee and tea are served, showcasing the sorrowful state of the family. On the funeral day, a memorial mass is held in the church. At the graveyard, the people gather and burn incense around the grave as clergy chant hymns in the Syriac language. The closest female relatives traditionally bewail or lament in a public display of grief as the casket descends. A few others may sing a dirge or a sentimental threnody. During all these occasions, everyone is expected to dress completely in black. Following the burial, everyone returns to the church hall for afternoon lunch and eulogy. At the hall, the closest relatives sit on a long table facing the guests as many people walk by and offer their condolences. On the third day, mourners customarily visit the grave site with a pastor to burn incense, symbolizing Jesus&#x27; triumph over death on the third day. This is also done 40 days after the funeral (representing Jesus ascending to heaven), and one year later to conclude the mourning period. Mourners wear only black until the 40 day mark and typically do not dance or celebrate any major events for one year.

===Europe===

====Continental Europe====

The custom of wearing unadorned black clothing for mourning dates back at least to the Roman Empire, when the , made of dark-colored wool, was worn during mourning.

Through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, distinctive mourning was worn for general as well as personal loss; after the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre of Huguenots in France, Elizabeth I of England and her court are said to have dressed in full mourning to receive the French Ambassador. 

Widows and other women in mourning wore distinctive black caps and veils, generally in a conservative version of any current fashion.

In areas of Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Albania, Mexico, Portugal, and Spain, widows wear black for the rest of their lives. The immediate family members of the deceased wear black for an extended time. Since the 1870s, mourning practices for some cultures, even those who have emigrated to the United States, are to wear black for at least two years, though lifelong black for widows remains in some parts of Europe.

In Belgium, the Court went in public mourning after publication in the Moniteur Belge. In 1924, the court went in mourning after the death of Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, for 10 days, the duke of Montpensier for five days, and a full month for the death of Princess Louise of Belgium.

====White mourning====

The color of deepest mourning among medieval European queens was white. In 1393, Parisians were treated to the unusual spectacle of a royal funeral carried out in white, for Leo V, King of Armenia, who died in exile. This royal tradition survived in Spain until the end of the 15th century. In 1934, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands reintroduced white mourning after the death of her husband Prince Henry. It has since remained a tradition in the Dutch royal family.
In 2004, the four daughters of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands all wore white to their mother&#x27;s funeral. In 1993, the Spanish-born Queen Fabiola introduced it in Belgium for the funeral of her husband, King Baudouin. The custom for the queens of France to wear (&quot;white mourning&quot;) was the origin of the white wardrobe created in 1938 by Norman Hartnell for Queen Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother). She was required to join her husband King George VI on a state visit to France even while mourning her mother.

====United Kingdom====
In the present, no special dress or behavior is obligatory for those in mourning in the general population of the United Kingdom, although ethnic groups and religious faiths have specific rituals, and black is typically worn at funerals. Traditionally, however, strict social rules were observed.

==Georgian and Victorian eras==

By the 19th century, mourning behavior in England had developed into a complex set of rules, particularly among the upper classes. For women, the customs involved wearing heavy, concealing black clothing, and the use of heavy veils of black crêpe. The entire ensemble was colloquially known as &quot;widow&#x27;s weeds&quot; (from the Old English , meaning &quot;garment&quot;), and would comprise either newly-created clothing, or overdyed clothing which the mourner already owned. Up until the later 18th century, the clothes of the deceased, unless they were considerably poor, were still listed in the inventories of the dead, as clothing constituted a relatively high expense. Mourning attire could feature &quot;s&quot;—conventional markers of grief such as white cuffs or cuff adornments, black hat-bands, or long black crêpe veils.
Special caps and bonnets, usually in black or other dark colours, went with these ensembles; mourning jewellery, often made of jet, was also worn, and became highly popular in the Victorian era. Jewellery was also occasionally using the hair of the deceased. The wealthy would wear cameos or lockets designed to hold a lock of the deceased&#x27;s hair or some similar relic.

Social norms could prescribe that widows wore special clothes to indicate that they were in mourning for up to four years after the death, although a widow could choose to wear such attire for a longer period of time, even for the rest of her life. To change one&#x27;s clothing too early was considered disrespectful to the deceased, and, if the widow was still young and attractive, suggestive of potential sexual promiscuity. Those subject to the rules were slowly allowed to re-introduce conventional clothing at specific times; such stages were known by such terms as &quot;full mourning&quot;, &quot;half mourning&quot;, and similar descriptions. For half mourning, muted colours such as lilac, grey and lavender could be introduced.

Friends, acquaintances, and employees wore mourning to a greater or lesser degree depending on their relationship to the deceased. Mourning was worn for six months after the death of a sibling. Parents would wear mourning for a child for &quot;as long as they [felt] so disposed&quot;. A widow was supposed to wear mourning for two years, and was not supposed to &quot;enter society&quot; for 12 months. No lady or gentleman in mourning was supposed to attend social events while in deep mourning. In general, servants wore black armbands following a death in the household. However, amongst polite company, the wearing of a simple black armband was seen as appropriate only for military men, or for others compelled to wear uniform in the course of their duties—a black armband instead of proper mourning clothes was seen as a degradation of proper etiquette, and to be avoided. In general, men were expected to wear mourning suits (not to be confused with morning suits) of black frock coats with matching trousers and waistcoats. In the later interbellum period (between World War I and World War II), as the frock coat became increasingly rare, the mourning suit consisted of a black morning coat with black trousers and waistcoat, essentially a black version of the morning suit worn to weddings and other occasions, which would normally include coloured waistcoats and striped or checked trousers.

Formal mourning customs culminated during the reign of Queen Victoria (), whose long and conspicuous grief over the 1861 death of her husband, Prince Albert, heavily influenced society. Although clothing fashions began to be more functional and less restrictive in the succeeding Edwardian era (1901-1910), appropriate dress for men and women—including that for the period of mourning—was still strictly prescribed and rigidly adhered to. In 2014, The Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art mounted an exhibition of women&#x27;s mourning attire from the 19th century, entitled &quot;Death Becomes Her: A Century of Mourning Attire&quot;.

The customs were not universally supported, with Charles Voysey writing in 1873 &quot;that it adds needlessly to the gloom and dejection of really afflicted relatives must be apparent to all who have ever taken part in these miserable rites&quot;.

The rules gradually relaxed over time, and it became acceptable practice for both sexes to dress in dark colours for up to a year after a death in the family. By the late 20th century, this no longer applied, and women in cities had widely adopted black as a fashionable colour.

===North America===

====United States====
Mourning generally followed English forms into the 20th century. Black dress is still considered proper etiquette for attendance at funerals, but extended periods of wearing black dress are no longer expected. However, attendance at social functions such as weddings when a family is in deep mourning is frowned upon. Men who share their father&#x27;s given name and use a suffix such as &quot;Junior&quot; retain the suffix at least until the father&#x27;s funeral is complete.

In the antebellum South, with social mores that imitated those of England, mourning was just as strictly observed by the upper classes.

In the 19th century, mourning could be quite expensive, as it required a whole new set of clothes and accessories or, at the very least, overdyeing existing garments and taking them out of daily use. For a poorer family, this was a strain on resources.

At the end of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Dorothy explains to Glinda that she must return home because her aunt and uncle cannot afford to go into mourning for her because it was too expensive.

A late 20th and early 21st century North American mourning phenomenon is the rear window memorial decal. This is a large vinyl window-cling decal memorializing a deceased loved one, prominently displayed in the rear windows of cars and trucks belonging to close family members and sometimes friends. It often contains birth and death dates, although some contain sentimental phrases or designs as well.

===The Pacific===

====Tonga====

In Tonga, family members of deceased persons wear black for an extended time, with large plain Taʻovala. Often, black bunting is hung from homes and buildings. In the case of the death of royalty, the entire country adopts mourning dress and black and purple bunting is displayed from most buildings.

==State and official mourning==

States usually declare a period of &quot;official mourning&quot; after the death of a head of state. in the case of a monarchy, court mourning refers to mourning during a set period following the death of a public figure or member of a royal family. The protocols for mourning vary, but typically include the lowering or posting half-mast of flags on public buildings. In contrast, the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is not flown at half-mast upon the death of a head of state, as there is always a monarch on the throne.

The degree and duration of public mourning is generally decreed by a protocol officer. It was not unusual for the British court to declare that all citizens should wear full mourning for a specified period after the death of the monarch or that the members of the court should wear full- or half-mourning for an extended time. On the death of Queen Victoria (22 January 1901), the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot; published an &quot;extra&quot; edition announcing that court mourning would continue until 24 January 1902. It directed the public to wear deep mourning until 6 March 1901 and half-mourning until 17 April 1901. As they had done in earlier years for Queen Victoria, her son King Edward VII, his wife Queen Alexandra and the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the royal family went into mourning on the death of Prince Philip in April 2021. The black-and-white costumes designed by Cecil Beaton for the Royal Ascot sequence in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; were inspired by the &quot;Black Ascot&quot; of 1910, when the court was in mourning for Edward VII.

The principle of continuity of the State, however, is also respected in mourning, and is reflected in the French saying (&quot;The king is dead, long live the king!&quot;). Regardless of the formalities of mourning, the power of state is handed on, typically immediately if the succession is uncontested. A short interruption of work in the civil service, however, may result from one or more days of closing the offices, especially on the day of the state funeral.

In January 2006, on the death of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the emir of Kuwait, a mourning period of 40 days was declared. In Tonga, the official mourning lasts for a year; the heir is crowned after this period has passed.

==Religions and customs==

===Confucianism===

There are five grades of mourning obligations in the Confucian Code. A person is expected to honor most of those descended from their great-great-grandfather, and most of their wives. The death of a person&#x27;s father and mother would merit 27 months of mourning; the death of a person&#x27;s grandfather on the male side, as well as their grandfather&#x27;s wife, would be grade two, or necessitate 12 months of mourning. A paternal uncle is grade three, at nine months, with grade four is reserved for one&#x27;s father&#x27;s first cousin, maternal grandparents, siblings and sister&#x27;s children (five months). First cousins once removed, second cousins and the parents of a man&#x27;s wife&#x27;s are considered grade five (three months).

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism, mourning is an opportunity to practice the core principles of impermanence, non-attachment, and compassion. While Buddhists feel the pain of loss like anyone else, their practices encourage letting go, finding peace, and expressing compassion for both the deceased and themselves. The perspective of rebirth and samsara also brings comfort, as it views death as a transition rather than an end.

===Christianity===

====Eastern Christianity====

Orthodox Christians usually hold the funeral either the day after death or on the third day, and always during the daytime. In traditional Orthodox communities, the body of the departed would be washed and prepared for burial by family or friends, and then placed in the coffin in the home. A house in mourning would be recognizable by the lid of the coffin, with a cross on it, and often adorned with flowers, set on the porch by the front door.

Special prayers are held on the third, seventh or ninth (number varies in different national churches), and 40th days after death; the third, sixth and ninth or twelfth month; and annually thereafter in a memorial service, for up to three generations. Kolyva is ceremoniously used to honor the dead.

Sometimes men in mourning will not shave for the 40 days. In Greece and other Orthodox countries, it is not uncommon for widows to remain in mourning dress for the rest of their lives.

When an Orthodox bishop dies, a successor is not elected until after the 40 days of mourning are completed, during which period his diocese is said to be &quot;widowed&quot;.

The 40th day has great significance in Orthodox religion, considered the period during which soul of deceased wanders on earth. On the 40th day, the ascension of the deceased&#x27;s soul occurs, and is the most important day in mourning period, when special prayers are held on the grave site of deceased.

As in the Roman Catholic rites, there can be symbolic mourning. During Holy Week, some temples in the Church of Cyprus draw black curtains across the icons. The services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday morning are patterned in part on the Orthodox Christian burial service, and funeral lamentations.

====Western Christianity====

European social forms are, in general, forms of Christian religious expression transferred to the greater community.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the Mass of Paul VI adopted in 1969 allows several options for the liturgical color used in Masses for the Dead. Before this, black was the ordinary color for funeral Masses except for white in the case of small children; the revised use makes other options available, with black as the intended norm. According to the General Instruction of the Roman Missal (§346d-e), black vestments are to be used at Offices and Masses for the Dead; an indult was given for some countries to use violet or white vestments, and in places those colours have largely supplanted black.

Christian churches often go into symbolic mourning during the period of Lent to commemorate the sacrificial death of Jesus. Customs vary among denominations and include temporarily covering or removing statuary, icons and paintings, and use of special liturgical colours, such as violet/purple, during Lent and Holy Week.
In more formal congregations, parishioners also dress according to specific forms during Holy Week, particularly on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, when it is common to wear black or sombre dress or the liturgical colour of purple.

Special prayers are held on the third, seventh, and 30th days after death; Prayers are held on the third day, because Jesus rose again after three days in the sepulchre (1 Corinthians 15:4). Prayers are held on the seventh day, because Joseph mourned his father Jacob seven days (Genesis 50:10) and in Book of Sirach is written that &quot;seven days the dead are mourned&quot; (Ecclesiasticus 22:13). Prayers are held on the thirtieth day, because Aaron (Numbers 20:30) and Moses (Deuteronomy 34:8) were mourned thirty days.

===Hinduism===
Death is not seen as the final &quot;end&quot; in Hinduism, but is seen as a turning point in the seemingly endless journey of the indestructible &quot;atman&quot;, or soul, through innumerable bodies of animals and people. Hence, Hinduism prohibits excessive mourning or lamentation upon death, as this can hinder the passage of the departed soul towards its journey ahead: &quot;As mourners will not help the dead in this world, therefore (the relatives) should not weep, but perform the obsequies to the best of their power.&quot;

Hindu mourning is described in dharma shastras. It begins immediately after the cremation of the body and ends on the morning of the thirteenth day. Traditionally, the body is cremated within 24 hours after death; however, cremations are not held after sunset or before sunrise. Immediately after the death, an oil lamp is lit near the deceased, and this lamp is kept burning for three days.

Hinduism associates death with ritual impurity for the immediate blood family of the deceased, hence during these mourning days, the immediate family must not perform any religious ceremonies (except funerals), must not visit temples or other sacred places, must not serve the sages (holy men), must not give alms, must not read or recite from the sacred scriptures, nor can they attend social functions such as marriages and parties. The family of the deceased is not expected to serve any visiting guests food or drink. It is customary that the visiting guests do not eat or drink in the house where the death has occurred. The family in mourning are required to bathe twice a day, eat a single simple vegetarian meal, and try to cope with their loss.

On the day on which the death has occurred, the family do not cook; hence usually close family and friends will provide food for the mourning family. White clothing (the color of purity) is the color of mourning, and many will wear white during the mourning period.

The male members of the family do not cut their hair or shave, and the female members of the family do not wash their hair until the 10th day after the death. If the deceased was young and unmarried, the &quot;Narayan Bali&quot; is performed by the Pandits. The Mantras of &quot;Bhairon Paath&quot; are recited. This ritual is performed through the person who has given the Mukhagni (Ritual of giving fire to the dead body).

On the morning of the 13th day, a Śrāddha ceremony is performed. The main ceremony involves a fire sacrifice, in which offerings are given to the ancestors and to gods, to ensure the deceased has a peaceful afterlife. Pind Sammelan is performed to ensure the involvement of the departed soul with that of God. Typically after the ceremony, the family cleans and washes all the idols in the family shrine; and flowers, fruits, water and purified food are offered to the gods. Then, the family is ready to break the period of mourning and return to daily life.

===Islam===
In Shi&#x27;a Islam, examples of mourning practices are held annually in the month of Muharram, the first month of Islamic Lunar calendar. This mourning is held in the commemoration of Imam Al Husayn ibn Ali, who was killed along with his 72 companions by Yazid bin Muawiyah. Shi&#x27;a Muslims wear black clothes and take out processions on road to mourn on the tragedy at Karbala. Shi&#x27;a Muslims also mourn the death of Fatima (one of Muhammad&#x27;s daughters) and the Shi&#x27;a Imams.

Mourning is observed in Islam by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry. Loved ones and relatives are to observe a three-day mourning period. Widows observe an extended mourning period (Iddah), four months and ten days long, in accordance with the Qur&#x27;an 2:234. During this time, she is not to remarry, move from her home, or wear decorative clothing or jewelry.

Grief at the death of a beloved person is normal, and weeping for the dead is allowed in Islam. What is prohibited is to express grief by wailing (&quot;bewailing&quot; refers to mourning in a loud voice), shrieking, tearing hair or clothes, breaking things, scratching faces, or uttering phrases that make a Muslim lose faith.

====Directives for widows====
The Qur&#x27;an prohibits widows from engaging themselves for four lunar months and ten days after the death of their husbands. According to Qur&#x27;an:
Islamic scholars consider this directive a balance between mourning a husband&#x27;s death and protection of the widow from censure that she became interested in remarrying too soon after her husband&#x27;s death. This is also to ascertain whether or not she is pregnant.

===Judaism===
Judaism looks upon mourning as a process by which the stricken can re-enter into society, and so provides a series of customs that make this process gradual. The first stage, observed as all the stages are by immediate relatives (parents, spouse, siblings and children) is the (literally meaning &quot;seven&quot;), which consists of the first seven days after the funeral. The second stage is the (thirty), referring to the thirty days following the death. The period of mourning after the death of a parent lasts one year. Each stage places lighter demands and restrictions than the previous one in order to reintegrate the bereaved into normal life.

The most known and central stage is , which is a Jewish mourning practice in which people adjust their behavior as an expression of their bereavement for the week immediately after the burial. In the West, typically, mirrors are covered and a small tear is made in an item of clothing to indicate a lack of interest in personal vanity. The bereaved dress simply and sit on the floor, short stools or boxes rather than chairs when receiving the condolences of visitors. In some cases relatives or friends take care of the bereaved&#x27;s house chores, as cooking and cleaning. English speakers use the expression &quot;to sit shiva&quot;.

During the , the mourners are no longer expected to sit on the floor or be taken care of (cooking/cleaning). However, some customs still apply. There is a prohibition on getting married or attending any sort of celebrations and men refrain from shaving or cutting their hair.

Restrictions during the year of mourning include not wearing new clothes, not listening to music and not attending celebrations. In addition, the sons of the deceased recite the Kaddish prayer for the first eleven months of the year during prayer services where there is a quorum of 10 men. The Kaddish prayer is then recited annually on the date of death, usually called the yahrzeit. The date is according to the Hebrew calendar. In addition to saying the Kaddish in the synagogue, a 24-hour memorial candle is lit in the home of the person saying the Kaddish.

<text>In mathematics and logic, an axiomatic system is any set of primitive notions and axioms to logically derive theorems. A theory is a consistent, relatively-self-contained body of knowledge which usually contains an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of formal system. A formal theory is an axiomatic system (usually formulated within model theory) that describes a set of sentences that is closed under logical implication. A formal proof is a complete rendition of a mathematical proof within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be &quot;consistent&quot; if it lacks contradiction. That is, it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the system&#x27;s axioms. Consistency is a key requirement for most axiomatic systems, as the presence of contradiction would allow any statement to be proven (principle of explosion).

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called &quot;independent&quot; if it cannot be proven or disproven from other axioms in the system. A system is called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Unlike consistency, independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system.

An axiomatic system is called &quot;complete&quot; if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable from the system&#x27;s axioms (equivalently, every statement is capable of being proven true or false).

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system. This describes the scenario where the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system. Lines and points are undefined terms (also called primitive notions) in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set, which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a proves the consistency of a system. A model is called concrete if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world, as opposed to an which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be isomorphic if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called (sometimes ). The property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system, however the converse is not true: Completeness does not ensure the categoriality (categoricity) of a system, since two models can differ in properties that cannot be expressed by the semantics of the system.

=== Example ===

As an example, observe the following axiomatic system, based on first-order logic with additional semantics of the following countably infinitely many axioms added (these can be easily formalized as an axiom schema):

:formula_1 (informally, there exist two different items).

:formula_2 (informally, there exist three different items).

:formula_3

Informally, this infinite set of axioms states that there are infinitely many different items. However, the concept of an infinite set cannot be defined within the system — let alone the cardinality of such a set.

The system has at least two different models – one is the natural numbers (isomorphic to any other countably infinite set), and another is the real numbers (isomorphic to any other set with the cardinality of the continuum). In fact, it has an infinite number of models, one for each cardinality of an infinite set. However, the property distinguishing these models is their cardinality — a property which cannot be defined within the system. Thus the system is not categorial. However it can be shown to be complete, for example by using the Łoś–Vaught test.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid infinite regress. This way of doing mathematics is called the axiomatic method.

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is logicism. In their book &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician&#x27;s research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around homological algebra.

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that rings need not be commutative, which differed from Emmy Noether&#x27;s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider topological spaces more generally without the separation axiom which Felix Hausdorff originally formulated.

The Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, a result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the &quot;proper&quot; formulation of set-theory problems and helped avoid the paradoxes of naïve set theory. One such problem was the continuum hypothesis. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with the historically controversial axiom of choice included, is commonly abbreviated ZFC, where &quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;choice&quot;. Many authors use ZF to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics.

=== History ===
Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

Euclid of Alexandria authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of Euclidean geometry and number theory. His idea begins with five undeniable geometric assumptions called axioms. Then, using these axioms, he established the truth of other propositions by proofs, hence the axiomatic method.

Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including non-Euclidean geometry, the foundations of real analysis, Cantor&#x27;s set theory, Frege&#x27;s work on foundations, and Hilbert&#x27;s &#x27;new&#x27; use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, group theory was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that inverse elements should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the transformation group origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms of the system it belongs. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to topology or complex analysis. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms &quot;arbitrarily&quot;, but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

=== Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers ===

The mathematical system of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first devised by the mathematician Giuseppe Peano in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol &quot;S&quot; (short for &quot;successor&quot;), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.
* Every natural number &quot;a&quot; has a successor, denoted by &quot;Sa&quot;.
* There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
* Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;Sa&quot; ≠ &quot;Sb&quot;.
* If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers (&quot;Induction axiom&quot;).

=== Axiomatization ===

In mathematics, axiomatization is the process of taking a body of knowledge and working backwards towards its axioms. It is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. axioms) that relate a number of primitive terms — in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements. Thereafter, the proof of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

<text>The USAF Art Program of the United States Air Force was begun in 1950, with the transfer of ~800 works of art from the United States Army. Today the program maintains its headquarters and museum in the NCR.

== History ==
The USAF Art Program and the beginning of its extensive collection of aviation art began in 1950 with the transfer from the U.S. Army of some 800 works of art documenting the early days of the Army Air Corps. In addition, under General Curtis LeMay, a &quot;portrait&quot; program was initiated. These portraits of senior officers, along with the donated art from the Army Air Corps, the works of noted artists Henri Farre (a French air combat pilot-artist in World War I) and Frank E. Beresford (a British artist and war correspondent in World War II), and captured German art from the Second World War, constituted the nucleus of a collection that serves as a valuable historical record of military aviation through the first half of the twentieth century.

In 1951, the Air Force sponsored a tour of USAF installations for 30 cartoonists, and in 1952 the Air Force sponsored 30 artists from the Society of Illustrators (New York). The concept of an official program, designed to record the Air Force story through the medium of art was born. Responsibility for the growing collection of donated art that would document the history of military aviation and the U.S. Air Force was given to the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information Services. It was a natural home at the time because much of the combat art produced in World War I and World War II by the U.S. and allies was done in support of domestic and foreign propaganda and public information programs. 

Historians belonged to the Information Services career field at that time as well. More importantly, the central purpose behind the program was to document the &quot;Air Force story&quot;--a job that belonged to Information Services. Telling the story through art--with sponsorship of artists trips to Air Force installations to cover activities and events--was a natural extension of the Air Force public relations program&#x27;s effort to tell the young Service&#x27;s story through news media representatives, books, magazines, special public exhibits, trips and briefings for important community/opinion leaders. The Art Program became a part of the Civil Liaison Division of the Office of information Services to document the Air Force History. 

In a major milestone that was to shape the direction and content of the program for the next fifty years, the Air Force met with the prestigious Society of Illustrators of New York, inviting them formally to participate in the USAF Art Program. They enthusiastically accepted the Air Force&#x27;s invitation, and the mechanism was established whereby civilian artists, members of the Society of Illustrators, were sent on officially sponsored trips to Air Force installations all over the world. Later, the Societies of Illustrators of Los Angeles, San Francisco, the Midwest Air Force Artists, the Southwest Society of Air Force Artists, and numerous independent artists joined the program.

Artworks produced from officially sponsored trips are &quot;donated&quot; to the U.S. Air Force--usually as outright &quot;gifts to the Government&quot;--accepted on behalf of a grateful nation and Air Force by the Secretary of the Air Force. Societies review works of their members before offering them as gifts. The &quot;formal&quot; presentation of artwork took on all the glamour of a New York society art show, as the Societies (then later the Air Force) hosted a formal &quot;Art Presentation&quot; every even year to unveil and exhibit their works to be donated to the service.

While there have been programmatic changes in the Air Force&#x27;s Art Program, it has retained the essential characteristics it started with--art in support of Service public relations and Service support of the documentation of art.

== Headquarters ==
The Air Force Art Program has its headquarters located in the Pentagon. Today, there are nearly 9,000 works in the Air Force Art Program and the Society of Illustrators has been joined by other organizations and independent artists to continue documenting Air Force personnel, equipment, locations and activities. While they accord the artist all courtesies and privileges as an equivalent grade of GS15/rank or Colonel, the artist&#x27;s income and opportunities are suspended during the assignment and creation of the work. Additionally, all work is donated to the Air Force without any permissible tax deductions.

Artists of the Air Force Art Program were actually caught in the fighting of Hue, Vietnam, during the Tet Offensive.

Every eighteen months, a tuxedo banquet was held in Washington DC, for the participating artists of that period. The event was hosted by the Secretary of the Air Force.

<doc id="188405" wikidata="Q316367" url="?curid=188405" title="Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)">
<text>Francis Hutcheson (; 8 August 1694 – 8 August 1746) was an Irish philosopher known as one of the founding fathers of the Scottish Enlightenment. Born in Ulster to a family of Scottish Presbyterians, he was Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University and is remembered as author of &quot;A System of Moral Philosophy&quot;.

Hutcheson was an important influence on the works of several significant Enlightenment thinkers, including David Hume and Adam Smith.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hutcheson is thought to have been born at Drumalig in the parish of Saintfield, County Down, in modern-day Northern Ireland. He was the &quot;son of a Presbyterian minister of Ulster-Scottish stock, who was born in Ireland&quot; but whose roots were in Ayrshire in Scotland. Hutcheson was educated at Killyleagh, and went on to Scotland to study at the University of Glasgow, where he spent 1710 to 1718 in the study of philosophy, classics and general literature, and afterwards in the study of theology, receiving his degree in 1712. While a student, he worked as tutor to the Earl of Kilmarnock.

===Return to Ireland===
Facing suspicions about his &quot;Irish&quot; roots and his association with New Licht theologian John Simson (then under investigation by Scottish ecclesiastical courts), a ministry for him in Scotland was unlikely to be a success, so he returned to Ireland and received a licence to preach. When, however, he was about to enter upon the pastorate of a small dissenting congregation he changed his plans in order to pursue a career in academia. He was induced to start a private academy in Dublin, where, assisted by Thomas Drennan, he taught for 10 years.

In Dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants. Among these was The Rt. Hon. and Most Rev. Dr William King, the Church of Ireland Lord Archbishop of Dublin, who refused to prosecute Hutcheson in the Archbishop&#x27;s Court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence. Hutcheson&#x27;s relations with the clergy of the established church, especially with Archbishop King and with The Rt. Hon. and Most Rev. Dr Hugh Boulter, Lord Archbishop of Armagh, seem to have been cordial, and his biographer, speaking of &quot;the inclination of his friends to serve him, the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotion&quot;, etc., probably refers to some offers of preferment, on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination.

In 1725 Hutcheson married his cousin Mary, daughter of Francis Wilson of Longford. Her dowry included extensive property holdings including the townlands of Drumnacross, Garrinch, and Knockeagh, in County Longford. They had seven children of whom only one survived, also called Francis.

While living in Dublin, Hutcheson published anonymously the four essays for which he is best known: in 1725 &quot;Inquiry concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony and Design&quot;, and &quot;Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil&quot;, which together comprise his &quot;Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue&quot;; and in 1728, the &quot;Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections&quot; and &quot;Illustrations upon the Moral Sense&quot;. The alterations and additions made in the second edition of these essays were published in a separate form in 1726. To the period of his Dublin residence are also to be referred the &quot;Thoughts on Laughter&quot; (1725) (a criticism of Thomas Hobbes) and the &quot;Observations on the Fable of the Bees&quot;, being in all six letters contributed to &quot;Hibernicus&#x27; Letters&quot;, a periodical that appeared in Dublin (1725–1727, 2nd ed. 1734). At the end of the same period occurred the controversy in the &quot;London Journal&quot; with Gilbert Burnet (probably the second son of The Rt. Rev. Dr Gilbert Burnet, Lord Bishop of Salisbury) on the &quot;True Foundation of Virtue or Moral Goodness&quot;. All these letters were collected in one volume (Glasgow, 1772).

===Chair of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow===
In 1729, Hutcheson succeeded his old master, Gershom Carmichael, in the Chair of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow, being the first professor there to lecture in English instead of Latin. It is curious that up to this time all his essays and letters had been published anonymously, but their authorship appears to have been well known. In 1730, he entered on the duties of his office, delivering an inaugural lecture (afterwards published), &quot;De naturali hominum socialitate&quot; (About the natural fellowship of mankind). He appreciated having leisure for his favourite studies; &quot;&quot;non-levi igitur laetitia commovebar cum almam matrem Academiam me, suum olim alumnum, in libertatem asseruisse audiveram&quot;.&quot; (I was, therefore, moved by no mean frivolous pleasure when I had heard that my alma mater had delivered me, its one time alumnus, into freedom.) Yet the works on which Hutcheson&#x27;s reputation rests had already been published. During his time as a lecturer in Glasgow College he taught and influenced Adam Smith, the economist and philosopher. &quot;[T]he order of topics discussed in the economic portion of Hutcheson’s System [of Moral Philosophy, 1755] is repeated by Smith in his Glasgow Lectures and again in the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;.&quot;

However, it was likely something other than Hutcheson&#x27;s written work that had such a great influence on Smith. Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents of Glasgow with the fervour and earnestness of his orations. His roots as a minister indeed shone through in his lectures, which endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives (appropriately acquiring the epithet, preacher of philosophy). Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as &quot;the never to be forgotten Hutcheson&quot;, a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor, Hutcheson.

===Death===
Francis Hutcheson spent time in Dublin, and died while on a visit to that city in 1746. He is buried in the churchyard of Saint Mary&#x27;s, which is also the final resting place of his cousin, the architect Sir William Bruce. Today Saint Mary&#x27;s is a public park located in what is now Wolfe Tone Street. Many United Irishmen would have revered the memory of Francis Hutcheson. Some of the leaders of the Dublin United Irishmen are remembered in the street and place-names of the city. Most Dubliners can direct a visitor to Wolfe Tone Street, Oliver Bond Street, Russell Street, Lord Edward Street and Emmet Road. &quot;Never to be forgotten Hutcheson&quot; lies in what is now an unmarked grave in the Dublin he loved and &quot;where his best work was done&quot;.

==Ethics==
According to Hutcheson, man has a variety of senses, internal as well as external, reflex as well as direct, the general definition of a sense being &quot;any determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will, and to have perceptions of pleasure and pain&quot; (Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions, sect. 1). He does not attempt to give an exhaustive enumeration of these &quot;senses&quot;, but, in various parts of his works, he specifies, besides the five external senses commonly recognized (which he hints might be added to):
# consciousness, by which each man has a perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind (&quot;Metaph. Syn. pars&quot; i. cap. 2)
# the sense of beauty (sometimes called specifically &quot;an internal sense&quot;)
# a public sense, or &quot;sensus communis&quot;, &quot;a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others and to be uneasy at their misery&quot;
# the moral sense, or &quot;moral sense of beauty in actions and affections, by which we perceive virtue or vice, in ourselves or others&quot;
# a sense of honour, or praise and blame, &quot;which makes the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure, and their dislike, condemnation or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion of that uneasy sensation called shame&quot;
# a sense of the ridiculous. It is plain, as the author confesses, that there may be &quot;other perceptions, distinct from all these classes,&quot; and, in fact, there seems to be no limit to the number of &quot;senses&quot; in which a psychological division of this kind might result.

Of these &quot;senses,&quot; the &quot;moral sense&quot; plays the most important part in Hutcheson&#x27;s ethical system. It pronounces immediately on the character of actions and affections, approving those that are virtuous, and disapproving those that are vicious. &quot;His principal design,&quot; he says in the preface to the two first treatises, &quot;is to show that human nature was not left quite indifferent in the affair of virtue, to form to itself observations concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions, and accordingly to regulate its conduct. The weakness of our reason, and the avocations arising from the infirmity and necessities of our nature, are so great that very few men could ever have formed those long deductions of reasons that show some actions to be in the whole advantageous to the agent, and their contraries pernicious. The Author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our moralists seem to imagine, by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we have for the preservation of our bodies. He has made virtue a lovely form, to excite our pursuit of it, and has given us strong affections to be the springs of each virtuous action.&quot;

Passing over the appeal to final causes involved in this passage, as well as the assumption that the &quot;moral sense&quot; has had no growth or history, but was &quot;implanted&quot; in man exactly as found among the more civilized races (an assumption common to both Hutcheson and Butler), his use of the term &quot;sense&quot; tends to obscure the real nature of the process of moral judgement. For, as established by Hume, this act consists of two parts: an act of deliberation leading to an intellectual judgement; and a reflex feeling of satisfaction at actions we consider good, and of dissatisfaction at those we consider bad. By the intellectual part of this process, we refer the action or habit to a certain class; but no sooner is the intellectual process complete than there is excited in us a feeling similar to what myriads of actions and habits of (apparently) the same class excited in us on former occasions.

Even if the latter part of this process is instantaneous, uniform and exempt from error, the former is not. All mankind may approve of that which is virtuous or makes for the general good, but they entertain the most widely divergent opinions and frequently arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to particular actions and habits. Hutcheson recognizes this obvious distinction in his analysis of the mental process preceding moral action, and does not ignore it, even when writing on the moral approbation or disapprobation that follows action. Nonetheless, Hutcheson, both by his phraseology and the language he uses to describe the process of moral approbation, has done much to favour that loose, popular view of morality which, ignoring the necessity of deliberation and reflection, encourages hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgements.

The term &quot;moral sense&quot; (which, it may be noticed, had already been employed by Shaftesbury, not only, as William Whewell suggests, in the margin, but also in the text of his &quot;Inquiry&quot;), if invariably coupled with the term &quot;moral judgement,&quot; would be open to little objection; but, taken alone, as designating the complex process of moral approbation, it is liable to lead not only to serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors. For, if each person&#x27;s decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense, why be at any pains to test, correct or review them? Or why educate a faculty whose decisions are infallible? And how do we account for differences in the moral decisions of different societies, and the observable changes in a person&#x27;s own views? The expression has, in fact, the fault of most metaphorical terms: it leads to an exaggeration of the truth it is intended to suggest.

But though Hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively and immediately, he does not, like Butler, conflate the moral faculty with the moral standard. The test or criterion of right action is with Hutcheson, as with Shaftesbury, its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind. He thus anticipates the utilitarianism of Bentham—and not only in principle, but even in the use of the phrase &quot;the greatest happiness for the greatest number&quot; (&quot;Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil&quot;, sect. 3). Hutcheson does not seem to have seen an inconsistency between this external criterion with his fundamental ethical principle. Intuition has no possible connection with an empirical calculation of results, and Hutcheson in adopting such a criterion practically denies his fundamental assumption. Connected with Hutcheson&#x27;s virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard is a kind of moral algebra, proposed for the purpose of &quot;computing the morality of actions.&quot; This calculus occurs in the &quot;Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil&quot;, sect. 3.

Hutcheson&#x27;s other distinctive ethical doctrine is what has been called the &quot;benevolent theory&quot; of morals. Hobbes had maintained that all other actions, however disguised under apparent sympathy, have their roots in self-love. Hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the sole and direct source of many of our actions, but, by a not unnatural recoil from the repellent doctrine of Hobbes, that it is the only source of those actions of which, on reflection, we approve. Consistently with this position, actions that flow from self-love only are morally indifferent. But surely, by the common consent of civilized men, prudence, temperance, cleanliness, industry, self-respect and, in general, the &quot;personal virtues&quot;, are regarded, and rightly regarded, as fitting objects of moral approbation.

This consideration could hardly escape any author, however wedded to his own system, and Hutcheson attempts to extricate himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly regard himself as a part of the rational system, and may thus &quot;be, in part, an object of his own benevolence&quot; (Ibid.), a curious abuse of terms, which really concedes the question at issue. Moreover, he acknowledges that, though self-love does not merit approbation, neither, except in its extreme forms, did it merit condemnation, indeed the satisfaction of the dictates of self-love is one of the very conditions of the preservation of society. To press home the inconsistencies involved in these various statement would be a superfluous task.

The vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in Hutcheson&#x27;s professedly ethical works. But, in the &quot;Synopsis metaphysicae&quot;, he touches on it in three places, briefly stating both sides of the question, but evidently inclining to what he designates as the opinion of the Stoics, in opposition to what he designates as the opinion of the Peripatetics. This is substantially the same as the doctrine propounded by Hobbes and Locke (to the latter of whom Hutcheson refers in a note), namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind, and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will, not the liberty of willing as we will. Though, however, his leaning is clear, he carefully avoids dogmatising, and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise.

It is easy to trace the influence of Hutcheson&#x27;s ethical theories on the systems of Hume and Adam Smith. The prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral approbation with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the reason and the emotions in these processes, is undoubtedly due to the influence of Hutcheson. To a study of the writings of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson we might, probably, in large measure, attribute the unequivocal adoption of the utilitarian standard by Hume, and, if this be the case, the name of Hutcheson connects itself, through Hume, with the names of Priestley, Paley and Bentham. Butler&#x27;s &quot;Sermons&quot; appeared in 1726, the year after the publication of Hutcheson&#x27;s two first essays, and there are parallels between the &quot;conscience&quot; of the one writer and the &quot;moral sense&quot; of the other.

==Mental philosophy==
In the sphere of mental philosophy and logic, Hutcheson&#x27;s contributions are by no means so important or original as in that of moral philosophy. They are interesting mainly as a link between Locke and the Scottish school. In the former subject the influence of Locke is apparent throughout. All the main outlines of Locke&#x27;s philosophy seem, at first sight, to be accepted as a matter of course. Thus, in stating his theory of the moral sense, Hutcheson is peculiarly careful to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas (see, for instance, &quot;Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil&quot;, sect. I ad fin., and sect. 4; and compare &quot;Synopsis Metaphysicae&quot;, pars i. cap. 2). At the same time he shows more discrimination than does Locke in distinguishing between the two uses of this expression, and between the legitimate and illegitimate form of the doctrine (&quot;Syn. Metaph.&quot; pars i. cap. 2).

All our ideas are, as by Locke, referred to external or internal sense, or, in other words, to sensation and reflection. It is, however, a most important modification of Locke&#x27;s doctrine, and connects Hutcheson&#x27;s mental philosophy with that of Reid, when he states that the ideas of extension, figure, motion and rest &quot;are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses&quot;; that the idea of self accompanies every thought, and that the ideas of number, duration and existence accompany every other idea whatsoever (see &quot;Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions&quot;, sect. i. art. I; &quot;Syn. Metaph&quot;. pars i. cap. 1, pars ii. cap. I; Hamilton on Reid, p. 124, note). Other important points in which Hutcheson follows the lead of Locke are his depreciation of the importance of the so-called laws of thought, his distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of bodies, the position that we cannot know the inmost essences of things (&quot;&quot;intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae&quot;), though they excite various ideas in us, and the assumption that external things are known only through the medium of ideas (&quot;Syn. Metaph&quot;. pars i. cap. I), though, at the same time, we are assured of the existence of an external world corresponding to these ideas.

Hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct (&quot;Syn. Metaph&quot;. pars i. cap. 1). Of the correspondence or similitude between our ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves God alone can be assigned as the cause. This similitude has been effected by Him through a law of nature. &quot;Haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio, sive mentis actio quaedam sive passio dicatur, non-alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur, quam ipse Deus, qui certa naturae lege hoc efilcit, Ut notiones, quae rebus praesentibus excitantur, sint ipsis similes, aut saltem earum habitudines, si non-veras quantitates, depingant&quot;&quot; (pars ii. cap. I). Locke does speak of God &quot;annexing&quot; certain ideas to certain motions of bodies; but nowhere does he propound a theory so definite as that here propounded by Hutcheson, which reminds us at least as much of the speculations of Nicolas Malebranche as of those of Locke.

Amongst the more important points in which Hutcheson diverges from Locke is his account of the idea of personal identity, which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by consciousness. The distinction between body and mind, &quot;corpus&quot; or &quot;materia&quot; and &quot;res cogitans&quot;, is more emphatically accentuated by Hutcheson than by Locke. Generally, he speaks as if we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body, though, in the posthumous work on &quot;Moral Philosophy&quot;, he expressly states that we know mind as we know body&quot; by qualities immediately perceived though the substance of both be unknown (bk. i. ch. 1). The distinction between perception proper and sensation proper, which occurs by implication though it is not explicitly worked out (see Hamilton&#x27;s Lectures on Metaphysics, – Lect. 24).

Hamilton&#x27;s edition of Dugald Stewart&#x27;s Works, v. 420 (the imperfection of the ordinary division of the external senses into two classes, the limitation of consciousness to a special mental faculty) (severely criticized in Sir W Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Metaphysics&quot; Lect. xii.) and the disposition to refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts are also amongst the points in which Hutcheson supplemented or departed from the philosophy of Locke. The last point can hardly fail to suggest the &quot;common-sense philosophy&quot; of Reid.

Thus, in estimating Hutcheson&#x27;s position, we find that in particular questions he stands nearer to Locke, but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more closely to his Scottish successors.

The short &quot;Compendium of Logic&quot;, which is more original than such works usually are, is remarkable chiefly for the large proportion of psychological matter that it contains. In these parts of the book Hutcheson mainly follows Locke. The technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over, and the book is readable. It may be specially noticed that he distinguishes between the mental result and its verbal expression judgment-proposition, that he constantly employs the word &quot;idea,&quot; and that he defines logical truth as &quot;&quot;convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis&quot; (or &quot;propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis&quot;,&quot; &quot;Syn. Metaph.&quot; pars i. cap. 3), thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view of logic.

==Aesthetics==
Hutcheson may further be regarded as one of the earliest modern writers on aesthetics. His speculations on this subject are contained in the &quot;Inquiry concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony and Design&quot;, the first of the two treatises published in 1725. He maintains that we are endowed with a special sense by which we perceive beauty, harmony and proportion. This is a reflex sense, because it presupposes the action of the external senses of sight and hearing. It may be called an internal sense, both to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight and hearing, and because &quot;in some other affairs, where our external senses are not much concerned, we discern a sort of beauty, very like in many respects to that observed in sensible objects, and accompanied with like pleasure&quot; (&quot;Inquiry&quot;, etc., sect. 1, XI). The latter reason leads him to call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths, in the operations of general causes and in moral principles and actions. Thus, the analogy between beauty and virtue, which was so favourite a topic with Shaftesbury, is prominent in the writings of Hutcheson also. Scattered up and down the treatise there are many important and interesting observations that our limits prevent us from noticing. But to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially interesting to remark that Hutcheson both applies the principle of association to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application, insisting on there being &quot;a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in objects, antecedent to all custom, education or example&quot; (see Inquiry, etc., sects. 6, 7; Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Metaphysics&quot;, Lect. 44 .).

Hutcheson&#x27;s writings gave rise to much controversy. To say nothing of minor opponents, such as &quot;Philaretus&quot; (Gilbert Burnet, already alluded to), Dr John Balguy (1686–1748), prebendary of Salisbury, the author of two tracts on &quot;The Foundation of Moral Goodness&quot;, and Dr John Taylor (1694–1761) of Norwich, a minister of considerable reputation in his time (author of &quot;An Examination of the Scheme of Amorality advanced by Dr Hutcheson&quot;), the essays appear to have suggested, by antagonism, at least two works that hold a permanent place in the literature of English ethics—Butler&#x27;s &quot;Dissertation on the Nature of Virtue&quot;, and Richard Price&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of Moral Good and Evil&quot; (1757). In this latter work the author maintains, in opposition to Hutcheson, that actions are – in themselves right or wrong, that right and wrong are simple ideas incapable of analysis, and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the understanding. We thus see that, not only directly but also through the replies that it called forth, the system of Hutcheson, or at least the system of Hutcheson combined with that of Shaftesbury, contributed, in large measure, to the formation and development of some of the most important of the later schools of ethics.

==Other works==
In addition to the works named, the following were published during Hutcheson&#x27;s lifetime: a pamphlet entitled &quot;Considerations on Patronage&quot; (1735); &quot;Philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria, ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis elementa continens&quot;, lib. iii. (Glasgow, 1742); &quot;Metaphysicae synopsis ontologiam et pneumatologiam campleciens&quot; (Glasgow, 1742). The last work was published anonymously. After his death, his son, Francis Hutcheson published much the longest of his works, &quot;A System of Moral Philosophy, in Three Books&quot; (2 vols. London, 1755). To this is prefixed a life of the author, by Dr William Leechman, professor of divinity in the University of Glasgow. His &quot;Reflections Upon Laughter: And Remarks Upon the Fable of the Bees&quot; was published in 1750. The only remaining work assigned to Hutcheson is a small treatise on Logic (Glasgow, 1764). This compendium, together with the &quot;Compendium of Metaphysics&quot;, was republished at Strasbourg in 1722.

Thus Hutcheson dealt with metaphysics, logic and ethics. His importance is, however, due almost entirely to his ethical writings, and among these primarily to the four essays and the letters published during his time in Dublin. His standpoint has a negative and a positive aspect; he is in strong opposition to Thomas Hobbes and Mandeville, and in fundamental agreement with Shaftesbury, whose name he very properly coupled with his own on the title page of the first two essays. Obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two authors include the analogy drawn between beauty and virtue, the functions assigned to the moral sense, the position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of our nature, and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare.

==Later scholarly mention==
References to Hutcheson occur in histories, both of general philosophy and of moral philosophy, as, for instance, in pt. vii. of Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;; Mackintosh&#x27;s &quot;Progress of Ethical Philosophy&quot;; Cousin, &quot;Cours d&#x27;histoire de la philosophie morale du XVIII&#x27; siècle&quot;; Whewell&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy in England&quot;; A Bain&#x27;s &quot;Mental and Moral Science&quot;; Noah Porter&#x27;s Appendix to the English translation of Ueberweg&#x27;s &quot;History of Philosophy&quot;; Sir Leslie Stephen&#x27;s &quot;History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Gentury&quot;, etc. See also Martineau, &quot;Types of Ethical Theory&quot; (London, 1902); WR Scott, &quot;Francis Hutcheson&quot; (Cambridge, 1900); Albee, &quot;History of English Utilitarianism&quot; (London, 1902); T Fowler, &quot;Shaftesbury and Hutcheson&quot; (London, 1882); J McCosh, &quot;Scottish Philosophy&quot; (New York, 1874). Of Dr Leechman&#x27;s Biography of Hutcheson we have already spoken. J. Veitch gives an interesting account of his professorial work in Glasgow, &quot;Mind&quot;, ii. 209–12.

==Influence in Colonial America==

Norman Fiering, a specialist in the intellectual history of colonial New England, has described Francis Hutcheson as &quot;probably the most influential and respected moral philosopher in America in the eighteenth century&quot;. Hutcheson&#x27;s early &quot;Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue&quot;, introducing his perennial association of &quot;unalienable rights&quot; with the collective right to resist oppressive government, was used at Harvard College as a textbook as early as the 1730s. In 1761, Hutcheson was publicly endorsed in the annual semi-official Massachusetts Election Sermon as &quot;an approved writer on ethics.&quot; Hutcheson&#x27;s &quot;Short Introduction to Moral Philosophy&quot; was used as a textbook at the College of Philadelphia in the 1760s. Francis Alison, the professor of moral philosophy at the College of Philadelphia, was a former student of Hutcheson who closely followed Hutcheson&#x27;s thought. Alison&#x27;s students included &quot;a surprisingly large number of active, well-known patriots&quot;, including three signers of the Declaration of Independence, who &quot;learned their patriotic principles from Hutcheson and Alison&quot;. Another signer of the Declaration of Independence, John Witherspoon of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), relied heavily on Hutcheson&#x27;s views in his own lectures on moral philosophy.

John Adams read Hutcheson&#x27;s &quot;Short Introduction to Moral Philosophy&quot; shortly after graduating from Harvard. Garry Wills argued in 1978 that the phrasing of the Declaration of Independence was due largely to Hutcheson&#x27;s influence, but Wills&#x27;s work suffered a scathing rebuttal from Ronald Hamowy. Wills&#x27; view has been partially supported by Samuel Fleischacker, who agreed that it is &quot;perfectly reasonable to see Hutcheson’s influence behind the appeals to sentiment that Jefferson put into his draft of the Declaration...&quot;

<text>Disney comics are comic books and comic strips featuring characters created by the Walt Disney Company, including Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck.

The first Disney comics were newspaper strips appearing from 1930 on, starting with the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip. &quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot;, the first American newsstand publication with Disney comics, launched in 1935. In 1940, Western Publishing launched the long-running flagship comic book, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, which reached 750 issues in September 2019. &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, launched in 1952, reached issue #450 in June 2019. In recent decades, Disney comics have seen a decline of popularity in the United States. In the rest of the world Disney comics have remained very successful, especially in Europe, where weekly Disney comics magazines and monthly paperback digests are national best sellers.

Disney comics have been the basis for academic theory, cultural criticism, and fan-created databases.

==U.S. comic strips==
The first Disney comics appeared in daily newspapers, syndicated by King Features with production done in-house by a Disney comic strip department at the studio. Initially Floyd Gottfredson along with his responsibilities for the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip oversaw the Disney comic strip department from 1930 to 1945, then Frank Reilly was brought in to administer the burgeoning department from January 1946 to 1975. Greg Crosby headed the department from 1979 to 1989.

===Mickey Mouse===

The &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; daily comic strip began on January 13, 1930, featuring Mickey as an optimistic, adventure-seeking young mouse. It was initially written by Walt Disney with art by Ub Iwerks and Win Smith. Beginning with the May 5, 1930, installment the art chores were taken up by Floyd Gottfredson (often aided by various inkers), who also either wrote or supervised the story continuities (relying on various writers to flesh out his plots). Gottfredson continued with the strip until 1975. By 1931, the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strip was published in 60 newspapers in the United States, as well as papers in twenty other countries.

From the beginning, the strips were parts of long continuing stories. These introduced characters such as the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, and the Bat Bandit, which Gottfredson created; Disney created Eli Squinch, Mickey&#x27;s nephews, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, and Sylvester Shyster, which were also introduced in the comic.

Starting in the 1950s, Gottfredson and writer Bill Walsh were instructed to drop the storylines and do only daily gags. Gottfredson continued illustrating the daily strip until he retired on October 1, 1975.

After Gottfredson retired, the strip was written and drawn by many other creators. The Sunday page went into reprints in February 1992, and the daily strip ended on July 29, 1995.

In 2011, Fantagraphics Books began the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse&quot; series, a hardback collection of Gottfredson&#x27;s run on the strip. A total of 14 volumes were published between 2011 and 2018, collecting the entirety of Gottfredson&#x27;s Sunday color work (two volumes) and all of his serialized story-themed daily strips (12 volumes). The collection doesn&#x27;t include any of Gottfredson&#x27;s gag-oriented material from 1955 onwards.

===Silly Symphony===

The &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; Sunday strip started on January 10, 1932, with a topper &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strip.&quot;Silly Symphony&quot; initially related the adventures of Bucky Bug, the first Disney character to originate in the comics. It went on to print more adaptations of &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; shorts, often using the characters and setting of the original shorts, but adding new plotlines and incidents. It also went on to print adaptations of the feature films, as well as periods of gag strips featuring Donald Duck and Pluto. By late 1935 the strip was a standalone half-page, not strictly a topper for the &quot;Mickey&quot; Sunday.

The strip was initially titled &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;; after two years, the name was changed to &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;. The switch happened in the February 18, 1934, strip, just three weeks before Bucky Bug would be replaced with a new storyline, &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;.

The complete rundown of &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strips, from 1932 to 1945:

* Bucky Bug (January 10, 1932 – March 4, 1934)
* Birds of a Feather (March 11 – June 17, 1934)
* Penguin Isle (July 1 – September 9, 1934)
* The Wise Little Hen (September 16 – December 16, 1934)
* The Boarding-School Mystery (December 23, 1934 – Feb 17, 1935)
* The Robber Kitten (Feb 24 – April 21, 1935)
* Cookieland (April 28 – July 21, 1935)
* Three Little Kittens (July 28 – October 20, 1935)
* The Life and Adventures of Elmer the Elephant (October 27, 1935 – January 12, 1936)
* The Further Adventures of the Three Little Pigs (January 19 – August 23, 1936)
* Donald Duck (August 30, 1936 – December 5, 1937)
* Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (December 12, 1937 – April 24, 1938)
* The Practical Pig! (May 1 – August 7, 1938)
* Mother Pluto (August 14 – October 16, 1938)
* Farmyard Symphony (October 23 – November 27, 1938)
* Timid Elmer (December 4, 1938 – Feb 12, 1939)
* Pluto the Pup (Feb 19 – March 19, 1939)
* The Ugly Duckling (March 26 – April 16, 1939)
* Pluto the Pup (April 23 – December 17, 1939)
* Pinocchio (December 24, 1939 – April 7, 1940)
* Pluto the Pup (April 14 – November 3, 1940)
* Little Hiawatha (November 10, 1940 – July 12, 1942)
* Bambi (July 19 – October 4, 1942)
* José Carioca (October 11, 1942 – October 1, 1944)
* Panchito (October 8, 1944 – October 7, 1945)

The &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday strip ended on October 7, 1945, and was replaced by &quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot;.

Three of the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; stories inspired long-running features in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. Original Bucky Bug stories first appeared in issue #39 (Dec 1943) and appeared every month for seven years, wrapping up with issue #120 (Sept 1950). &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; feature inspired the creation of Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s errant son, who wants to be friends with the Pigs. Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf&#x27;s adventures began in issue #52 (Jan 1945), and he made regular appearances until almost the end of the comic&#x27;s original run, issue #259 (April 1962). Finally, Little Hiawatha had his own monthly story for two years, from issue #143 (Aug 1952) to #168 (September 1954).

The complete strip has been reprinted in four hardcover collections, &quot;Silly Symphonies: The Complete Disney Classics&quot;, published by IDW Publishing&#x27;s Library of American Comics imprint. The first volume, published in 2016, includes all of the strips from &quot;Bucky Bug&quot; (1932) to &quot;Cookieland&quot; (1935). Volume 2, published in 2017, includes &quot;Three Little Kittens&quot; (1935) to &quot;Timid Elmer&quot; (1939). Volume 3, published in 2018, includes &quot;Pluto the Pup&quot; (1939) to &quot;Little Hiawatha&quot; (1942). The fourth volume, published in 2019, concludes the series with &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) through Panchito&quot; (1945).

===Donald Duck===

Donald Duck made his first comics appearance in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; adaptation of the 1934 Disney short &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; (Sept. 16, 1934-Dec. 16, 1934). As Donald&#x27;s popularity grew, he became the star of the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strip for an extended run (August 1936 to December 1937), and then got his own daily strip starting on February 7, 1938. A Donald Sunday strip premiered December 10, 1939. Carl Barks, known to fans as &quot;The Duck Man,&quot; wrote at least 20 of the strips between 1938 and 1940. &quot;Donald Duck&quot; ran until May 2005, when it went into reprints.

Starting in 2015, IDW Publishing&#x27;s Library of American Comics imprint has been publishing hardcover collections of the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; strip. As of 2019, five volumes of &quot;Donald Duck: The Complete Daily Newspaper Comics&quot; and two volumes of &quot;Donald Duck: The Complete Sunday Comics&quot; have been released.

===Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit===

&quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; was launched as a Sunday strip on October 14, 1945, as a preview of the upcoming 1946 film &quot;Song of the South&quot;. The &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; strip began, like &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;, as a topper for the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strip, but after the first few years, almost always appeared on its own.

The previous comic strip adaptations of Disney films lasted for four or five months, but the &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; strip continued for almost thirty years, telling new stories of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and friends, until the strip was discontinued on December 31, 1972.

===Walt Disney&#x27;s Treasury of Classic Tales===

In 1950, Disney distributed a limited-time Sunday strip adaptations of their new animated feature &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and followed the next year with &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Judged a success, the experiment was turned into an ongoing feature in 1952—&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Treasury of Classic Tales&quot;—beginning with &quot;The Story of Robin Hood&quot;.

The Sunday strip ran for thirty-five years, from July 13, 1952, to February 15, 1987. The animated features adapted for the strip include &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1958), &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1968). &quot;Classic Tales&quot; also featured animated shorts, including &quot;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&quot; (1956) and &quot;Ben and Me&quot; (1953), and featurettes like &quot;Peter &amp; The Wolf&quot; (1954) and &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; (1966). The 1979-80 adaptation of &quot;The Black Hole&quot; was particularly notable for featuring pencil art by comics icon Jack Kirby, with Mike Royer inking.

&quot;Treasury of Classic Tales&quot; also adapted live-action films like &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957–58), &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1969). The strip transitioned from historical dramas like &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; (1953) and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1960) to comedies like &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961).

In 2016, IDW Publishing and their imprint &quot;The Library of American Comics (LoAC)&quot; began to collect all the &quot;Treasury of Classic Tales&quot; stories in a definitive hardcover reprint series. As of 2019, three volumes have been published, reprinting all the stories from &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1952) through &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; (1962). In April 2018, it was announced that, due to the sales goal of the series not being met, the third volume may be the last one to be published.

===Scamp===

In 1955, the animated film &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; inspired a new comic strip based on an adorable, unnamed puppy glimpsed at the end of the movie. &quot;Scamp&quot; debuted in newspapers on October 31, 1955, and ran for more than 30 years, ending on June 25, 1988. The strip was created by Ward Greene, a King Features Syndicate editor who wrote the original magazine story, &quot;Happy Dan, the Whistling Dog, and Miss Patsy, the Beautiful Spaniel&quot;, which inspired the film. Greene and artist Dick Moores produced the strip for eight months as a continuing story. Starting in May 1956, other creators took over, and the strip moved to a gag-a-day format.

===Disney Christmas Story===

Beginning in 1960, a special daily strip with a holiday theme utilizing the Disney characters was offered each year through 1987. It generally ran for three to four weeks with the concluding strip appearing a day or two before Christmas, often promoting the latest Disney release or re-release. These were unique in that in some cases, they showcased the crossover of Disney characters that otherwise rarely interacted.

The tradition was revived in 1992 as &quot;Disney Holiday Story&quot; to publicize contemporary Disney feature animated films.

In 2017, the Christmas stories were collected in a hardback volume, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Christmas Classics&quot;, published by IDW Publishing. The collection includes all of the Christmas stories except for 1986&#x27;s story based on &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

===Winnie the Pooh===
Disney created a &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; comic strip for King Features Syndicate starting June 19, 1978. Based on the Disney adaptations of the characters, the strip was written by Don Ferguson and drawn by Richard Moore. In addition to the regular cast of characters, Ferguson and Moore also added a knight named Sir Brian, and his worrywart dragon. The strip lasted for almost ten years, ending on April 2, 1988.

===Other comic strips===
Other Disney strips distributed over the years included (chronologically by start date):
* &quot;Merry Menagerie&quot; [humorous daily panel featuring anthropomorphic animals, but no Disney characters] (Jan. 13, 1947-March 17, 1962).
* &quot;True Life Adventures&quot; [daily panel] (March 14, 1955 – February 27, 1973)
* &quot;Mickey Mouse and His Friends&quot; [pantomime aimed at an international audience, gag strips featuring Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto] (September 1, 1958 – March 17, 1962).
* &quot;Gummi Bears&quot; (Sept. 1, 1986–April 1, 1989) 

A proposed Roger Rabbit strip underwent development but cancellation of the sequel led King Features to pass on it.

The Disney comic strip department closed in January 1990. The last two strips, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, continued to be supervised by King Features. The Donald strip was drawn by Larry Knighton with King Features staffers writing it. The Donald strip was discontinued in the mid-1990s. In this period the Mickey strip had Floyd Norman as the writer and art rotating between Rick Hoover and Alex Howell. Norman convinced the syndicate to allow him to drop the gag-a-day format in favor of adventure continuities of up to four weeks, much in the style of the classic Gottfredson era. By 1994 the strip was running in only 30 newspapers and by mutual agreement of Disney and King Features it ended. Both strips continued with reprints.

In recent years Creators Syndicate has offered reprints of the &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; strips as part of a &quot;classics&quot; package and posts the current strip on its site (without archiving). Domestically the strips have 20-30 clients at any one time; they also appear in many newspapers outside the United States (exact number unknown).

==U.S. comic books==
===&quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot;===

&quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot; (1933–1940) was the first Disney comics publication, and preceded the popular 1940 anthology comic book &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. The concept was created by Kay Kamen, a Disney merchandiser. There were three versions of the title: two promotional giveaway magazines published from 1933 to 1935, and a newsstand magazine published from 1935 to 1940. The publication gradually evolved from a 16-page booklet of illustrated text stories and single-page comic panels into a 64-page comic book featuring reprints of the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strips.

===&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;===

In October 1940, Western rebranded &quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot; as &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories,&quot; an anthology comic book series featuring an assortment of Disney characters, including Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Mickey Mouse, Chip &#x27;n Dale, Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf, Scamp, Bucky Bug, Grandma Duck, Brer Rabbit, Winnie the Pooh, and others. With more than 700 issues, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics &amp; Stories&quot; is the longest-running Disney comic book in the United States.

By the mid-1950s, &quot;WDC&amp;S&quot; was the best selling comic book in America, with a circulation hovering around three million a month (with the highest level reached being 3,038,000 for the Sept. 1953 issue). It is regarded as one of the best-selling comic books of all time.

The book was originally published by Dell Comics (1940–1962), and there have been many revivals over the years, continuing the same legacy numbering. The revivals have been published by Gold Key Comics (1962–1984), Gladstone Publishing (1986–1990), Disney Comics (1990–1993), back to Gladstone Publishing (1993–1999), Gemstone Publishing (2003–2008), Boom! Studios (2009–2011) and IDW Publishing (2015–2020). IDW relaunched the title as &quot;Disney Comics and Stories&quot;. IDW lost Disney comics rights in the 2020s and the comic book license for Disney properties passed to Marvel Comics.

===Four Color===

When &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; launched in 1940 as a partnership between Dell Comics and Western Publishing, the comic only reprinted existing &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&quot; and &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strips, rather than creating original stories specifically for the comic book form. This was common for comic books at the time.

Dell also had an anthology series, &quot;Four Color&quot;, which started in 1939 as a series of &quot;one-shot&quot; specials, each focused on a particular character. In the early days, &quot;Four Color&quot; mostly featured comic strip reprints of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; and others. The first series included two issues of Disney comic strips -- &quot;Donald Duck&quot; strips were reprinted in issue #4 (Feb 1940), and Gottfredson&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; serial &quot;Mickey Mouse Outwits the Phantom Blot&quot; was colored, reformatted into comic form and released as issue #16 (1941).

In 1941, &quot;Four Color&quot; published the two earliest Disney comic book stories, based on new Disney films. Issue #13 featured an adaptation of &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, and a &quot;Dumbo&quot; adaptation was the focus of issue #17. Both of these stories were assembled by using a film-editing machine called the Moviola, and having artist Irving Tripp trace the actual frames of the film to make up each panel. Each issue also had additional short back-up features—the &quot;Reluctant Dragon&quot; issue included comic adaptations of the 1941 shorts &quot;Old MacDonald Duck&quot; and Goofy&#x27;s &quot;How to Ride a Horse&quot;, and &quot;Dumbo of the Circus&quot; had an illustrated text adaptation of the Donald Duck short &quot;The Village Smithy&quot;, as well as some filler comic strips from &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;.

The next story specifically created for Disney comic books was &quot;Pluto Saves the Ship&quot;, published in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Large Feature Comics&quot; #7 in July 1942. The story was written by Disney animators Carl Barks, Jack Hannah and Nick George; it was Barks&#x27;s first comic book work.

&quot;Four Color&quot; relaunched with a new numbering system in 1942, and in October, Dell published &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot; as issue #9 of the second series. This 64-page story was the first Donald Duck story drawn (but not yet written) by Barks.

&quot;Four Color&quot; went on to produce more than 1,000 issues from 1942 to 1962, and the major ongoing Disney comics series were all launched as individual issues of the &quot;Four Color&quot; series. &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot; eventually became the first &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; began as issue #27 (1943), and the first &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; comic was issue #386 (March 1952). &quot;Scamp&quot; also began as a &quot;Four Color&quot; one-shot with issue #703 (May 1956), which turned into a series in 1958. When they each &quot;graduated&quot; to their own comic books, Dell continued their numbering as if they had been part of a series all along.

There were many other Disney characters featured in issues of &quot;Four Color&quot;. This list shows the first issue for each character:

===Donald Duck===

&quot;Donald Duck&quot; (1942–2017) first appeared as part of the &quot;Four Color&quot; one-shot series, beginning in issue #9 (Oct 1942). Carl Barks, the first great figure among Disney comic book creators, wrote all of his early long stories for the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; one-shots, including &quot;Donald Duck and the Mummy&#x27;s Ring&quot; (1943), &quot;The Terror of the River!&quot; (1946), &quot;Volcano Valley&quot; (1947), &quot;The Ghost of the Grotto&quot; (1947), &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot; (1947), &quot;The Old Castle&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1948), &quot;Sheriff of Bullet Valley&quot; (1948), &quot;Lost in the Andes!&quot; (1949), &quot;Voodoo Hoodoo&quot; (1949) and &quot;Luck of the North&quot; (1949).

The title received its own numbering system with issue #26 (1953) and ended with issue #388 (June 2017).

===Mickey Mouse===

&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (1943–2017) first appeared as part of the &quot;Four Color&quot; one-shot series, beginning in issue #27 (1943). It received its own numbering system with issue #28 (December 1952), and after many iterations with various publishers, ended with #330 (June 2017) from IDW Publishing.

===Dell Giants===
In 1949, Dell began a tradition of publishing occasional &quot;Disney Giants&quot;, plus-size comic books with more pages and a higher price. The first Giant was &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Christmas Parade&quot; #1 (Nov 1949). This was a 132-page square-bound comic that sold for 25 cents, considerably higher than the typical 10-cent comics. &quot;Christmas Parade&quot; had a cover by Walt Kelly, and began with a Carl Barks-penned Donald Duck story, &quot;Letter to Santa&quot;.

&quot;Christmas Parade&quot; was a success, and Dell followed up the next year with &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Vacation Parade&quot; #1 (July 1950) and &quot;Christmas Parade&quot; #2 (Nov 1950). Dell also introduced &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Christmas Funnies&quot; in 1950, and soon all of Dell&#x27;s top-selling characters had regular annuals and giant issues.

&quot;Christmas Parade&quot; ran for ten issues from 1949 to 1959, and was followed by &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Merry Christmas&quot; (Dec 1960) and &quot;Donald Duck Merry Christmas&quot; (Dec 1961).

&quot;Vacation Parade&quot; ran for five annual issues from 1950 to 1954, before being retitled &quot;Picnic Party&quot; from 1955 to 1957, &quot;Mickey Mouse Summer Fun&quot; (1958), &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Summer Fun&quot; (1959), &quot;Daisy Duck and Uncle Scrooge Picnic Time&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mickey and Donald in Vacationland&quot; (1961). There were also six annual issues of &quot;Donald Duck Beach Party&quot; from 1954 to 1959.

Dell also published nine annual issues of &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; (1952–1959).

When Disneyland, the first Disney theme park, opened in 1955, Dell celebrated with the Giant &quot;Donald Duck in Disneyland&quot; (Sept 1955), and made frequent returns to the park over the next few years, including &quot;Mickey Mouse in Frontierland&quot; (May 1956), &quot;Mickey Mouse in Fantasyland&quot; (May 1957), &quot;Uncle Scrooge Goes to Disneyland&quot; (Aug 1957), &quot;Christmas in Disneyland&quot; (a one-time retitle of &quot;Christmas Parade&quot;, Nov 1957) &quot;Donald and Mickey in Disneyland on Tom Sawyer Island&quot; (May 1958), &quot;Vacation in Disneyland&quot; (Aug 1958), &quot;Disneyland Birthday Party&quot; (Oct 1958) and &quot;Disneyland U.S.A.&quot; (June 1960).

There were also three annual issues of &quot;Huey, Dewey and Louie Back To School&quot; in October 1959, 1960 and 1961, and a number of one-shot Giants, including &quot;Peter Pan&#x27;s Treasure Chest&quot; (Jan 1953), &quot;Mickey Mouse Birthday Party&quot; (Sept 1953), &quot;Mickey Mouse Club Parade&quot; (Dec 1955), &quot;Mickey Mouse Almanac&quot; (Dec 1957) and &quot;Daisy Duck and Uncle Scrooge Showboat&quot; (Sept 1961).

===Uncle Scrooge===

Carl Barks introduced Donald&#x27;s Uncle Scrooge in the story &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot;, published in &quot;Four Color&quot; #178 (Dec 1947). Scrooge made regular returns to both the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic and Barks&#x27;s stories in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; over the next few years, and he finally received his own title in &quot;Four Color&quot; #386 (March 1952).

The spin-off title was very popular, and by issue #4 &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; shed its &quot;Four Color&quot; association and became its own independent book. &quot;Scrooge&quot; is one of the longest-running American Disney comics books, and is still presently ongoing, reaching issue #450 in June 2019.

The book has been produced under the aegis of several different publishers, including Western Publishing (initially in association with Dell Comics and later under its own subsidiary, Gold Key Comics and its Whitman imprint), Gladstone Publishing, Disney Comics, Gemstone Publishing, Boom! Studios, and IDW Publishing (until 2020), and has undergone several hiatuses of varying length. Despite this, it has maintained the same numbering scheme throughout its six decade history, with only IDW adding a secondary numbering that started at #1.

===Gold Key / Whitman era===
By the late 1950s, relations between Dell and Western had become strained. Former Western writer Mark Evanier states part of this was due to &quot;... a small battle going on between the two companies over the ownership of properties in non-licensed comics.&quot; In 1962 Western, ended the partnership and continued their comic book line under the Gold Key Comics label. Comic book historian Joe Torcivia has dubbed the mid-1960s &quot;... a period of creativity for Western Publishing&#x27;s Disney line not seen since its formation, and never seen again.&quot;

Western continued publishing Dell&#x27;s four main titles: &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; (starting with issue #264, Sept 1962), &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (issue #85, Nov 1962), &quot;Donald Duck&quot; (issue #85, Dec 1962) and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; (issue #40, Jan 1963). They also started (or restarted) several titles:

* &quot;The Beagle Boys&quot; (47 issues, 1964–1979)
* &quot;The Phantom Blot&quot; (7 issues, 1964–1966)
* &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale&quot; (83 issues, 1967–1984)
* &quot;Moby Duck&quot; (30 issues, 1967–1978)
* &quot;Scamp&quot; (45 issues, 1967–1979)
* &quot;O&#x27;Malley and the Alley Cats&quot; (9 issues, 1971–1974)
* &quot;Daisy and Donald&quot; (59 issues, 1973–1984)
* &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; (33 issues, 1977–1984)
* &quot;The Beagle Boys vs Uncle Scrooge&quot; (12 issues, 1979–1980)
* &quot;Huey, Dewey and Louie: Junior Woodchucks&quot; (81 issues, 1966–1984)
* &quot;Moby Duck&quot; (30 issues, 1967–1978)
* &quot;Ludwig Von Drake&quot; (4 issues, 1961–1962)
* &quot;Super Goof&quot; (74 issues, 1965–1984)
By the 1970s, Disney comics were undergoing a steep decline in circulation, with newsstand distribution discontinued in 1981. Western thereafter released its comics under the Whitman label, distributing them to candy stores and other outlets in bags containing three comics and also eventually distributed them to the emerging network of comic book stores. Western ceased publishing comics in 1984.

===Disney Studio Program===
From 1962 to 1990 the Walt Disney Studio had a unit producing comic book stories exclusively for foreign consumption, the Disney Studio Program, in response to complaints of foreign comic book licensees that Western Publishing was producing fewer stories that they could reprint.

Many European publishers saw a great demand for Disney comics, and it was a typical pattern for a company to publish a comic once a month, then add regular specials, then phase out the specials and publish the comic biweekly, and finally turn it into a weekly magazine. France&#x27;s &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; and the Netherlands&#x27; &quot;Donald Duck Weekblad&quot; started the trend, publishing weekly comics in 1952, and the others followed in the late 1950s. Germany&#x27;s &quot;Micky Maus&quot; turned weekly in 1957, Denmark&#x27;s &quot;Anders And &amp; Co.&quot; in 1958, Sweden&#x27;s &quot;Kalle Anka &amp; C:o&quot; in 1959, and Italy&#x27;s &quot;Topolino&quot; in 1960. By the early 1960s, the weeklies&#x27; voracious need for material was using up the available inventory of stories.

George Sherman, head of Disney&#x27;s Publications Department at the time, hired Tom Golberg to run the program. Sherman noted the purpose of the program was &quot;We [will] use new characters in our foreign comics, characters that we don&#x27;t have [in the United States]... to bring out facets of existing characters, [and to] give the stories more variety.&quot;

Tony Strobl, Cliff Voorhees, Al Hubbard, Paul Murry, Jack Bradbury, Carson Van Osten, Ellis Eringer and Romano Scarpa were among the artists during its early years; Carl Fallberg, Floyd Norman, Ed Nofziger, Cecil Beard, Jim Fanning, Dick Kinney, Diana Gabaldon and Mark Evanier were among those who at some point did scripts for it. From the late 1970s on, the Jaime Diaz Studios of Argentina drew most of the stories.

In a few instances, Studio Program stories were reprinted in the United States in promotional giveaways of Gulf Oil (&quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot;) in the late 1960s and Procter &amp; Gamble (&quot;Disney Magazine&quot;) in the mid-1970s. Mickey and the Sleuth stories were published by Gold Key in &quot;Walt Disney Showcase&quot; #38, 39 and 42 (1977–1978). Besides the Sleuth, other characters created for the program include Donald&#x27;s cousin Fethry Duck and the hillbilly hermit Hard Haid Moe. Also, while Carl Barks created John D. Rockerduck, he used the character only in a single story (&quot;Boat Buster&quot;, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #255, Dec. 1961) while the program subsequently created numerous stories with the Scrooge McDuck rival and helped refine him (along with stories by Brazilian and Italian Disney comic book licensees).

Domestic printing of Studio Program stories became common starting in the late 1980s as the Disney comics published by Gladstone and Gemstone have featured them on a regular basis, along with reprints from Gold Key/Dell and material produced by foreign licensees.

This program was merged into Disney Comics, and is the precursor of the comics that subsequently appeared in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;.

===Revivals===
Starting in 1986, Disney comics in the United States were published by Gladstone Publishing (a subsidiary of Another Rainbow Publishing dedicated solely to Carl Barks). Impressed by Gladstone&#x27;s unanticipated success, Disney revoked their license in 1990 to publish the comics themselves by the subsidiary W. D. Publications, Inc. under the name &quot;Disney Comics&quot;, and a large expansion was planned. However, following the Disney Implosion in 1991, Disney gradually returned licensing to Gladstone again (for the classic characters) and Marvel Comics (for the modern characters). Respectively, reprints of classic Barks stories were licensed to Gladstone again from 1991, while it took Gladstone until the demise of Disney Comics in 1993 to regain a license also for other stories containing the classic characters. Gladstone from then on remained publishing Disney comics until 1998.

In 2003, after a few years&#x27; hiatus, regular publication was restarted by Gemstone Publishing, a reformed version of Gladstone. Gemstone&#x27;s two monthly Disney titles were &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, but the license was not renewed with the last releases dated Nov. 2008.

More recently, Disney licensed some of their modern properties to Slave Labor Graphics (&quot;Gargoyles&quot;) and BOOM! Kids (&quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, and &quot;Cars&quot;). Boom eventually also got the license for the classic characters, and began publishing comic books with them in 2009. Although cancelling two titles previously published by Gladstone and Gemstone (&quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot; and &quot;Uncle $crooge Adventures&quot;), Boom! expanded their Disney portfolio in 2010-&#x27;11 by launching three new titles based upon the 1990s Disney Afternoon TV format (&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, and &quot;DuckTales&quot;). However, in August 2011, it was reported that Disney and Boom! were to end the licensing agreement, leaving the future of comics including their classic characters as well as those from the &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; format uncertain.

In October 2014, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; (CBR) reported that Joe Books, a small new Canadian publisher founded by former BOOM! vice president Adam Fortier, had acquired the rights to a &quot;remastered&quot; omnibus reprint of BOOM&#x27;s entire &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; comic series that would lead into an all-new on-going &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; series produced by Joe Comics, and in February 2015, CBR ran an interview with series artist James Silvani and series writer Aaron Sparrow on the new &quot;remastered&quot; omnibus collection published by Joe Books that month, as well as their plans for the announced new series. As the November 2014 edition of the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide also contained ads for Joe Books comic adaptations of two theatrical Disney features, observers have expressed rumors that Joe Books has acquired the full North-American comic license to all Disney animated and live-action properties.

In January 2015, IDW Publishing announced on their public Facebook account that they were to start publishing all the classic-characters Disney titles, starting with &quot;Uncle $crooge&quot; in April of that year and focussing on reprints of European Disney comics with these characters by artists such as Marco Rota and Romano Scarpa. The rights to North-American reprints of Carl Barks and Don Rosa comics are currently (2015) held by Fantagraphics Books.

Disney has also begun publishing a bimonthly magazine based on &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, featuring comic stories based on the show. Between 1999 and 2005, Dark Horse Comics published occasional adaptations of Disney&#x27;s new movies.

The Disney Studio launched Kingdom Comics division in May 2008 led by writer-actor Ahmet Zappa, TV executive Harris Katleman and writer-editor Christian Beranek. Kingdom was designed to create new properties for possible film development and reimagine and redevelop existing Disney library movies with Disney Publishing Worldwide getting a first look for publishing.

Peachtree Playthings in Marietta, Georgia, published several issues of &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Disney Princess&quot; in 2019–20. Dynamite Entertainment in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, began publishing a new monthly &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; series in January 2023. Dynamite also publishes comic books featuring Scar, Maleficent, Gargoyles, Cruella De Vil and Lilo &amp; Stitch.

==Europe==
===United Kingdom===
Disney comics first appeared in the United Kingdom in the &quot;Mickey Mouse Annual&quot;, which published 18 editions between 1930 and 1947. The books were published by Dean &amp; Son, and illustrated by Wilfred Haughton.

Inspired by the 1935 launch of the newsstand-version of &quot;Mickey Mouse Magazine&quot;, UK publisher Odhams Press established &quot;Mickey Mouse Weekly&quot;, a large-size 12-page comics magazine, with four pages in full-color photogravure. Wilfred Haughton contributed to this publication as well, which featured the full range of characters from the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons. The magazine included new material—both Disney and non-Disney—as well as reprints of the American comic strips. &quot;Mickey Mouse Weekly&quot; featured the first ever Donald Duck comic book serial, originally called &quot;Donald and Donna&quot;, which began in issue #67 (May 15, 1937), drawn by William A. Ward. There were 15 weekly parts of this first serial featuring Donald and his girlfriend Donna, an early version of Daisy Duck. Donna left the series after the first story, which was continued as &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Donald and Mac&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck with Mac&quot; for the next three years, ending in issue #222 (May 4, 1940). Goofy and Toby Tortoise also had their own strip, &quot;The Defective Agency&quot;, and so did Elmer Elephant, Pinocchio, Thumper and the mice from &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Jaq and Gus. The popular magazine ended in 1957, after 920 issues, because of a copyright dispute with Disney. Ronald Nielsen had been producing painted comic book pages in Floyd Gottfredson&#x27;s 1940s style, as well as of characters from Disney animated films, during the mid-1950s until the magazine lost its license.

Immediately after the close of &quot;Mickey Mouse Weekly&quot;, another Disney comics magazine was launched: &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse&quot;, which ran for 55 issues from 1958 to 1959, and then changed title to &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, publishing another 111 issues until 1961.

Other Disney comics published in the UK include:

* &quot;Disneyland Magazine&quot; (1971–1976)
* &quot;Donald and Mickey&quot; (1972–1975)
* &quot;Goofy (and also Pluto)&quot; (1973–1974); merged as &quot;Donald and Mickey (and also Goofy)&quot;
* &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (1975–1981)
* &quot;Donald Duck&quot; (IPC Magazines) (1975–1976)
* &quot;Donald Duck&quot; (London Editions) (1987–1990)

* &quot;Mickey and Friends&quot; (1992–1996) 

Of contributors to American Disney comics who were born in the UK, Ted Thwaites was an inker for Floyd Gottfredson in the early Disney comic strip department, and Frank McSavage from Scotland drew a number of Grandma Duck, Bongo and other stories for the American comic books.

British writers for Egmont include Paul Halas, Gail Renard and Jack Sutter.

British Webcomic creator Sarah Jolley has introduced a romance between Gladstone Gander and Magica De Spell. Her popular online comics, that she calls &#x27;duck doodles&#x27;, have won praise from Disney artists.

===Scandinavia===
====Denmark====
Danish publisher Egmont (previously Gutenberghus) has one of the largest productions of Disney comics in the world. This production is not only for Denmark proper, but nearly identical magazines are being published simultaneously every week for all the Nordic countries, Germany (see below), and since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Eastern Europe. The Danish company started publishing their own series in the early 1960s. Most of Egmont&#x27;s content has come from several outside sources: reprints of classic Carl Barks stories, reprinted Barks-style stories from the Netherlands, American artist/writers such as Don Rosa and William Van Horn, and the outsourced production of art for Egmont&#x27;s scripts from Barks-style artists&#x27; studios, such as Vicar in Chile, Daniel Branca in Argentina and several studios in Spain. Italian stories are often featured in digest-formatted pocket books.

Artists from Denmark include Freddy Milton (penname of Fredy Milton Larsen), who worked for the Dutch studio with Daan Jippes, and Flemming Andersen who draws in a personalized version of the Italian Disney style. In addition to &quot;Donald Duck&quot; stories, Freddy Milton has utilized his highly Barks-reminiscent style for other series that he has written and drawn, including &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;, his own series, &quot;Gnuff&quot;, and several titles involving a human character named Villiams Verden. The Scandinavian countries are among those in which Donald Duck is more popular than Mickey Mouse. Danish writers include Lars Jensen, Maya Åstrup, Tom Anderson and Gorm Transgaard (Jensen created Scrooge&#x27;s opponent Velma Vanderduck, amongst other characters).

Disney titles published in Denmark include: 
* &quot; (Donald Duck &amp; Co.) (1949–present): The flagship magazine launched in March 1949 as a monthly, which became bi-weekly in 1956, and weekly in 1958. The weekly publishes new Disney stories produced by Egmont.
* &quot; (One-Shots) (1953–1956): A series of &quot;one-shot&quot; comics similar to Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot;; reprinted much U.S. material of the 1940s and ’50s.
* &quot;&quot; (Walt Disney&#x27;s Monthly Issue) (1967–1970): Another series reprinting a range of American stories.
* &quot;Jumbobog&quot; (1968–present): The popular pocket book format was launched in Denmark in 1968, and translated/distributed in many other European countries. This is a 250-page monthly paperback that publishes mostly Italian stories, as well as new stories produced for Egmont. 
* &quot;Anders And Ekstra&quot; (1977–2014): A monthly magazine launched in 1977, which used to publish new extra-long stories, but then moved to mostly reprints.

====Sweden====

Sweden was the first Scandinavian country to publish a Disney comic book—the flagship comic &quot;Kalle Anka &amp; C:o&quot; (&quot;Donald Duck &amp; Co&quot;), which started in September 1948. The comic began as a monthly, became bimonthly in 1957, and then a weekly magazine in July 1959. The comic is now identical to &quot;Anders And &amp; C:o&quot; from Denmark and &quot;Donald Duck &amp; C:o&quot; from Norway. All are published by the Scandinavian corporate group founded in 1878 as Gutenberghus; the name changed to Egmont in 1992. The Finnish &quot;Aku Ankka&quot; is published separately, but is largely the same.

In the 1950s, Swedish Disney comics reprinted existing material from America, both in &quot;Kalle Anka &amp; C:o&quot; and a monthly series, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s serier&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics&quot;). When the supply of American comics started to dry up in the 1960s, Denmark&#x27;s publishing house Gutenberghus began producing original series, followed by Italy&#x27;s Mondadori and Disney&#x27;s own &quot;Disney Studio&quot; program. The pocket book &quot;Kalle Anka&#x27;s Pocket&quot; was introduced in 1968, and is still running today. A second pocket book, &quot;Farbror Joakim&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;) was added in 1976. In 1980, &quot;Musse Pigg &amp; C:o&quot; (&quot;Mickey Mouse &amp; Co&quot;) was added as a monthly comic, and it continues as a bimonthly. Other current titles are &quot;Kalle Anka Extra&quot; and &quot;Kalle Anka Junior&quot;.

Per Erik Hedman is a writer from Sweden, and artist Tony Cronstam draws in a Carl Barks style. Editor/writer Stefan Printz-Påhlson wrote a time machine series with fellow editor/writer Lars Bergström; the former also created the reoccurring Stone Age character, Princess Oona. Per Starbäck compiled Disney comic book indexes into the Disney Comics Mailing List, expanded by Dutch programmer Harry Fluks into the online database, Inducks.

====Finland====
Thanks to a multitalented editor, Markku Kivekäs, who was also a skilled translator, essayist and restorationist, comic book stories about Donald Duck, along with the work of Carl Barks, became extremely popular in Finland, more so than in any other country in the world (per capita), and are accepted as part of the mainstream culture. It was estimated in 2002, that a quarter of the population of Finland was reading the Donald Duck magazine, &quot;Aku Ankka&quot;. Like the Netherlands, Finland publishes their own Disney comics apart from Egmont. Cameos of local celebrities are common. Kari Korhonen has mostly drawn in a Barksian style and also writes some of the stories he illustrates. Songwriter Tuomas Holopainen has written and composed a Scrooge McDuck comic book soundtrack that went Gold, &quot;Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge&quot;.

====Norway====
Norway has the comic , which started back in 1948 and is still active. There are several pocket books, amongst them being &quot;Donald Pocket&quot; from 1968 to the present day. Mickey Mouse also had a comic, specifically Mikke Mus månedshefte (Mickey Mouse monthly booklet) which lasted from 1980 until 2009.

Arild Midthun is a Norwegian artist who works in a Barksian style. He has written some of the stories that he has drawn, as well as illustrating stories by other Norwegian writers. Midthun has created popular stories about Viking history, and about Scrooge&#x27;s days in the Klondike gold rush. Carl Barks books, clubs and fanzines first appeared in Norway, the home of Donaldism, a Disney comics fandom movement founded by analyst Jon Gisle (1st fanzine, 1973; 1st club, 1975).

===Italy===
Italy is a major source for original Disney comic stories. The first Italian Disney comics were published in the early 1930s, and Federico Pedrocchi wrote and illustrated the first Italian Donald Duck adventure comic as early as 1937—a story called &quot;Paolino Paperino e il mistero di Marte&quot; (&quot;Donald Duck and the Secret of Mars&quot;) in the weekly paper &quot;Donald Duck and Other Adventures&quot; (&quot;Paperino e altre avventure&quot;).

Italy has introduced several new characters to the Disney universe, including Donald&#x27;s superhero alter ego Duck Avenger (original name &quot;Paperinik&quot;), created in 1969. Production has been handled by Nerbini (1932–1937), Mondadori (1937–1988), Disney Italy (1988–2013) and Panini Comics (2013–present).

&quot;Topolino&quot; is the main Italian Disney publication, and its first incarnation was a weekly newspaper published from 1932 to 1949, for a total of 738 issues. In 1949, &quot;Topolino&quot; switched to a digest-sized format and its numbering restarted at #1: originally a monthly, it became a biweekly in 1952 and a weekly in 1960. The second incarnation of &quot;Topolino&quot; reached its 3500th issue in 2022. At first, &quot;Topolino&quot; alternated between translations of foreign stories and original stories produced by Italian authors, however since the early 1990s foreign stories have mostly disappeared from it.

Italy&#x27;s digest-sized format has been adopted by many other countries in the long running Donald Duck pocket book series.

In the late 1990s, Disney Italy launched several new lines, including &quot;PKNA: Paperinik New Adventures&quot; (a comic book version of Paperinik aimed at a slightly older audience), &quot;MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine&quot; (a noir series starring Mickey Mouse as detective), &quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot;, &quot;DoubleDuck&quot;, and &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot;, plus the comics published under the imprint Buena Vista Comics (including the original &quot;Monster Allergy&quot; comic series and a few other titles, such as &quot;Kylion&quot; and a comic inspired by the &quot;Alias&quot; TV show).

The Disney comics published in Italy include:

* &quot; (newspaper) (1932–1949)
* &quot; (The Three Little Pigs) (1935–1937)
* &quot;Paperino e altre avventure&quot; (&quot;Donald Duck and Other Adventures&quot;) (1937–1940)

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands (current publisher: DPG Media) has a significant school of Disney comics. The first Dutch Disney comics appeared in 1953. In 1975, Daan Jippes became the art director for production of these comics, and created a heavily Barks-inspired line that remains the best-known Dutch Disney style. Donald Duck is the most popular Disney character in the Netherlands, but Sanoma also produces comics starring lesser-known characters such as Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf. Other productive Dutch artists who have worked in a Barksian style include Mark De Jonge, Sander Gulien, brothers Bas and Mau Heymans and Ben Verhagen. Freddy Milton from Denmark also worked with Jippes as a team for both scripts and art. Wilma Van Den Bosch produced art for a Dutch Daisy Duck title. Frank Jonker and Jan Kruse, among others, have provided scripts.

The Disney comics published in the Netherlands include: 
* &quot;Donald Duck Weekblad&quot; (1952–present), the flagship weekly magazine, first published on October 25, 1952. The magazine was originally published by the staff of the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Margriet&quot;, and every &quot;Margriet&quot; subscriber received the first issue for free. The comic is mainly aimed at younger children, and includes a letters page from readers. In 2019, the magazine reached its 3,500th issue.
* &quot;Donald Duck Pocket&quot; (1970–present), a 250-page pocket book that prints mostly comics from Italy, featuring characters that don&#x27;t usually appear in Dutch comics, like Superdonald/Fantomerik, Otto von Drakenstein, John Rockerduck, Brigitta, Indiana Goofy and DD Dubbelduck. This became a monthly publication in 2006. These books are the same pocket books published by Egmont in the Netherlands.
* &quot;&quot; (1982–present), a monthly magazine featuring longer or more unusual stories. Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; stories ran in the &quot;Extra&quot;, as did William Van Horn and Marco Rota stories. The magazine started in February 1982 as &quot;Stripgoed&quot;, but changed to &quot;Donald Duck Extra&quot; with issue #37.
* &quot;&quot; (1996–present), a 500-page pocket book that&#x27;s twice as large as the regular &quot;Donald Duck Pocket&quot; book. Originally published twice a year, the book was increased to four times a year in 2006.
* &quot; (1999–present), a monthly magazine for girls aged 8–12, starring Katrien (Daisy Duck) and her three nieces Lizzy, Juultje and Babetje (April, May and June). The comic first appeared on July 19, 1999, as a bimonthly magazine, but became monthly in 2016.
* &quot; (2008–present), a biweekly version of &quot;Donald Duck&quot; for younger readers, with shorter stories and bigger print.
* &quot;&quot; (2016–present), a special pocket book published five times a year. Each issue prints (or reprints) stories featuring one of four series: &quot;Superdonald&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; and &quot;DubbleDuck&quot;. These are generally darker, action-oriented stories about Mickey and Donald as detectives, superheroes and secret agents.

While the Donald Duck comics thrive in the Netherlands, the audience for Mickey Mouse has been relatively weak. A monthly magazine, &quot;Mickey Maandblad&quot;, was published in several formats from 1976 to 1989, finally dropped for lack of sales.

Dutch programmer Harry Fluks created the online Disney Comics Database, Inducks (launched 1994), expanded from the Disney Comics Mailing List based in Sweden.

===Germany===
Mickey Mouse was a popular character in Germany since his first appearance in 1929, and a few comic strips were printed in some German newspapers (e.g. the &quot;Kölner Illustrierte Zeitung&quot;). In 1937, the Swiss &quot;Micky Maus Zeitung&quot; was published in German by Bollmann.

By 1948, the Danish magazine publisher Egmont (then called Gutenberghus) secured a license to print Disney comics in Scandinavia. In September 1951, Ehapa Verlag in Stuttgart, West Germany, a subsidiary of Egmont, started the monthly publication &quot;Micky Maus&quot;, a format similar to &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics &amp; Stories&quot;. From the start, it featured stories by Carl Barks, translated by chief editor Dr. Erika Fuchs. The comic book was published on a biweekly basis 1956/57, and from 1958 on it changed into a weekly. Renamed &quot;Micky Maus Magazin&quot;, it is still published today by the Egmont Ehapa publishing company (now in Berlin) and is the longest running comic book in Germany. In its heyday (early 1990s), its weekly circulation number rose to one million copies. In spite of the name, most stories of &quot;Micky Maus&quot; feature Donald Duck, as he is the most popular Disney character in Germany.

Many other titles have been published by the company, most notably &quot;Die tollsten Geschichten von Donald Duck&quot; (&#x27;The Best stories of Donald Duck&#x27;, 1965-today), the &quot;Lustige Taschenbuch&quot; (&#x27;Funny Paperback&#x27;, a digest title mostly reprinting Italian pocket books; 1967-today) and many other series.

Volker Reiche and Jan Gulbransson are local artist/writers who have worked in a Carl Barks style. Gulbransson drew an 8-part series wherein Scrooge and kin visit regional German cities and wrote/drew a 4-part series set in the Alps and a story where Scrooge finances a team in the German soccer league, and many others. Barks-fan Volker Reiche wrote and drew a batch of stories in his signature scruffy version of Barks&#x27;s 1940s style. A popular graphic novel adventure series, &quot;Tales From Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s Treasure Chest&quot; was conceptualized, plotted and produced by Ehapa editor Adolf Kabatek. Although the art was outsourced, it was made sure to be in a Barksian style. Ulrich Schröder relocated to Paris to become the art director of Disney Publishing Worldwide, the company&#x27;s European headquarters, and has produced comic covers, story and editorial art for Disney comics in Germany and France. Schröder has worked with Dutch artist Daan Jippes.

Austrian abstract artist Gottfried Helnwein held a Barks comic art touring exhibition in Germany, that along with a similar exhibit that was being shown at the time, was seen by over half a million people (over 400,000 and over 100,000, respectively). Erika Fuchs&#x27;s translation work was highly influential, and she incorporated many aspects of German culture into her translations. Many of her &#x27;Fuchisms&#x27; have become part of the German language. The Donaldist group, D.O.N.A.L.D. claims to be the preservers of the non-commercial original Donaldism and even hold congresses, knight contributors to children&#x27;s literature and infiltrate conservative newspaper columns (that members contribute) with Fuchisms.

Some of the Disney comics from Germany include:

* &quot;Micky Maus&quot; (main title, 1951–present)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Best Stories of Donald Duck&quot;, 1965–present)
* &quot;Lustiges Taschenbuch&quot; (&quot;Funny Paperback&quot; pocket book, 1967–present)
* &quot;Lustiges Tachenbuch Classic! Die Comics von Carl Barks&quot; (Funny Paparback Classic! The Comics of Carl Barks, 2019–present) 

===France===
French-produced stories started in 1952, as a one-pager comic published in each issue of &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot;, drawn by Louis Santel (&quot;Tenas&quot;) and written by Pierre Fallot. After a few issues, a new series started (Mickey à travers les siècles) and continued up to 1978, drawn almost entirely by Pierre Nicolas and written by Fallot and Jean-Michel le Corfec.

Later in the beginning of the 1980s, a new production started, led by Patrice Valli and Pierre Nicolas as editors with adventures of Mickey Mouse, Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck. Among the best artists, one recalls Claude Marin, or Claude Chebille (known as &quot;Gen-Clo&quot;), and Italian artists like Giorgio Cavazzano. Some of the best writers were Michel Motti and Pierre-Yves Gabrion. In the late 1980s up to now, an increasing number of Spanish artist from the Comicup studio provided the art, while the writing stayed to French authors.

Disney comics published in France include:

* &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; (1934–present): created in October 1934 (with a break in publication from 1945 to 1952), the weekly &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; is a cultural institution in France.
* &quot;&quot; (1966–1979, 1980–present): The first version of &quot;Mickey Parade&quot; was originally an extra supplement to &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot;, published irregularly by Edi-Monde. It became quarterly in 1968, and transitioned to a bimonthly comic. Edi-Monde ceased publication of &quot;Mickey Parade&quot; in 1979. In 1980, the magazine was reintroduced as a monthly by Hachette Media, who restarted the numbering. In January 2002, with issue #265, the comic became &quot;Mickey Parade Géant&quot;—a larger, thicker paperback, published bimonthly.
* &quot;Picsou Magazine&quot; (1972–present): A best-selling monthly children&#x27;s magazine that includes comics about Uncle Scrooge (Picsou in French) along with video game reviews and information on new movies. In 2018, the magazine went bimonthly.

===Spain===
The original flagship comic was &quot;Dumbo&quot; (aka &quot;Colleción Dumbo Historietas Comicas de Walt Disney&quot;), which was published by Ediciones Recreativas S.A. (ERSA) from 1947 to 1965. Initially bimonthly, &quot;Dumbo&quot; increased frequency to approximately 40 issues a year, and the comic ran for 527 issues. Starting October 1965, ERSA rebooted with a second version of &quot;Dumbo&quot;, published monthly. The second series ran for 144 issues, until December 1976. A third series of &quot;Dumbo&quot;, published in 46 issues by Montena from July 1978 to April 1982, was released as monthly hardbound books (originally 100 pages, then dropping to 68 pages).

ESRA also published a large-format 16-page bimonthly magazine, &quot;Pato Donald&quot;, which lasted from 1965 to April 1966. ESRA rebooted with a second version of &quot;Pato Donald&quot; in May 1966, now a 36-page weekly. The second &quot;Pato Donald&quot; ran for 231 issues, until December 1975. Montena also published the weekly &quot;Don Miki&quot; for 638 issues, from October 1976 to December 1988, and &quot;Don Donald&quot; for 136 issues, from 1979 to 1985.

In September 1989, Primavera began publishing &quot;Mickey&quot; and &quot;Pato Donald&quot;; &quot;Mickey&quot; lasted for 17 issues until January 1991, and &quot;Pato Donald&quot; for 46 issues until June 1992. RBA tried to revive the line in 2002, publishing 22 issues of &quot;Mickey&quot; and 4 issues of &quot;Pato Donald&quot;.

Several comic studios in Spain produced story art for Disney comic scripts. Some artists became independent, such as Paco Rodriguez, who utilizes Daniel Branca&#x27;s Barksian style.

===Greece (and Cyprus)===
The weekly &quot;Miky Maous&quot; (Μίκυ Μάους) comic was first published on July 1, 1966, and remained in print for more than 45 years, eventually being ended by struggling publisher Nea Aktina S.A. on September 6, 2013, with issue #2460-61.

Terzopoulos Publishing (renamed Nea Aktina after the death of founder Evagellos Terzopoulos) released 20 magazines, with Μικυ Μαους (Mickey Mouse) being the main, weekly magazine with stories from across the Mickey-Donald universe. Other publications were released from monthly to yearly basis, notably Ντοναλντ (Donald) and Κομιξ (Comics) featuring classic stories. Six of the publications went out of the Mickey-Donald bubble with franchises such as Winnie-the-Pooh, the Disney princesses, cars, and even Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Moreover two Disney magazines were released, &quot;Almanaco&quot;, focusing mainly on video games and a teen audience, including short Disney comics, also releasing Κοσμος Ντισνευ (Disney world) which included info and stories from recent Disney franchises such as &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;. Another 47 standalone publications were released in the time of the publisher. By the end of 2013, 11 series were being published.

In 2014, the title was relaunched by &quot;Kathimerini&quot;, with numbering starting at #1.

&quot;Kathimerini&quot; relaunched &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (weekly) and &quot;Donald&quot;, &quot;Comics&quot;, &quot;Super Mickey&quot; (monthly), along with some limited edition collections bundled with the &quot;Kathimerini&quot; newspaper. The magazines nowadays mainly draw from the Italian publications. &quot;Kathimerini&quot; discontinued direct supply to Cyprus, however many stores get their hands on the comics with a middleman or a subscription. 

===Belgium===
Louis Santel (Ténas) created new material in the 1950s.

===Yugoslavia===
Vlastimir Belkić produced original content in the 1930s.

==Latin America==
===Brazil===
The first Mickey Mouse stories were published in Brazil in 1930, in the comics anthology &quot;O Tico Tico&quot;, under the name &quot;Ratinho Curioso&quot; (the Curious Mouse). The magazine reprinted comic strips by Floyd Gottfredson.

In Brazil, through the publisher Abril, national stories have been published since the 1950s, with artists like Jorge Kato inspired by Carl Barks. In the 1960s and 1970s, Renato Canini drew a number of stories in a style inspired by the popular abstract design of the era. He also developed a universe around José Carioca, a very popular character in Brazil. Abril increased production in the 1970s and 1980s. Except for José Carioca, recurring characters included Daisy (turned feminist) and Fethry Duck. Among the most prolfic authors were the writer Arthur Faria Jr. and the artist Irineu Soares Rodriguez. Brazil is also known to have retained many &quot;obscure&quot; characters, largely forgotten elsewhere, besides Portugal. &quot;O Pato Donald&quot; (The Donald Duck) was initially published in comic book format, then from issue #22 began to be published in digest-sized format.

At the end of the 1990s, the Brazilian production ceased, and then restarted for a short while in the 2000s. After an absence of almost 10 years, with just a few special events stories, production again started up at the end of 2012. During the 2010s Abril was also responsible for publishing Disney&#x27;s manga in Brazil (some unpublished in other countries outside Japan), including titles like Kingdom Hearts, Big Hero 6, Kilala Princess, Stitch!, Miriya and Marie, Star Wars and others.

Disney comics were published by Editora Abril since 1950, but the company stopped publishing them in 2018, facing financial difficulties. The next year, however, the comics returned through the publisher Culturama. José Carioca&#x27;s title was not continued by Culturama, but new stories returned in September, 2020, in the comic book &quot;Aventuras Disney&quot;.

The best-known titles include:

* &quot;&quot; (1950–2018; 2019–present); 1st series, 2481 issues
* &quot;Mickey&quot; (1952–2018; 2019–present); 1st series, 911 issues
* &quot;Zé Carioca&quot; (1961–2018); 1st series, 2446 issues
* &quot;Tio Patinhas (Uncle Scrooge)&quot; (1963–2018; 2019–present); 1st series, 637 issues

===Argentina===
Luis Destuet was an early artist in the 1940s (Some stories were reprinted in Brazil and Italy). Around the turn of the decade, Destuet moved to Brazil and started production there by training new artists. In the 1980s, Daniel Branca set up a prolific and influential story art production studio, influenced by Daan Jippes to create expressive artwork in Carl Barks&#x27; 1950s style.

===Chile===
The pre-war &quot;Álbum Mickey&quot; series contained various short strips that were possibly locally produced, according to Inducks, as well as some Zorro stories in the 1970s. Vicar set up a prolific Carl Barks–style story art production studio in the 1970s.

==Australia, Africa and Asia==
===Australia===
The main Australian publisher was W.G. Publications (Wogan Publications from 1974). A number of series reflecting equivalents in the U.S. included &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck&quot;. The most significant series, however, are &quot;Walt Disney Comics&quot; (1946–1978); and the &quot;Giant&quot; (1951 to 1978).

&quot;Walt Disney Comics&quot; mixed and matched covers and stories from its sister U.S. publication, rather than just reprinting them. The &quot;Giant&quot; presented selections from various U.S. series, from film promotions such as &quot;Robin Hood&quot; to &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, &quot;Beagle Boys&quot; and &quot;Junior Woodchucks&quot;. In some cases these were mere reprints. In others, an extra story was added to increase the page count; for instance, W MM 97-04 &quot;Par for the Course&quot;, in No. 570 &quot;The Beagle Boys&quot;.

This practice of adding an extra story to an issue otherwise identical the U.S. one is common elsewhere; as an example, in the &quot;Film Preview Series&quot;, the first &quot;Robin Hood&quot; issue has W OS 1055-03 &quot;The Double Date&quot; added.

===Egypt===
Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through a comic book called &quot;Samir&quot;, which published &quot;Samir Presents Mickey&quot; #1 in April 1958. This series published 24 issues in 1958 and 1959. Mickey proved very popular in Egypt, and in 1959 he got a weekly comic book, ميكي (&quot;Mickey&quot;). After 44 years of publication, the publisher Dar-Al-Hilal stopped publication in 2003, after disputes with Disney (The last issue being #2188, published in March, 2003).

In 2004, publisher Nahdat Masr acquired the Disney license, and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours. The new version of &quot;Mickey&quot; published issue #0 in December, 2003, and issue #1 in December 2004. As of 2018, the magazine had reached more than 700 issues. Besides the publication of the weekly magazine, two monthly magazines are published: مجلد سوبر ميكى (&quot;SuperMickey&quot;) and Mickey Geib &quot;Pocket Mickey&quot; (a pocket sized magazine).

In the 60s and 70s, original material was created (in Egyptian Arabic), most notably by Ahmed Hijazi, a folk-style artist.

===Japan===
Many Disney comics originally by American or European authors have been entirely re-drawn by Japanese artists for local publication. The Italian manga-inspired series, W.I.T.C.H., was submitted to the same kind of treatment, giving birth to a Japanese-exclusive adaptation with art by Haruko Iida and published by Kadokawa Shoten.

Japan also produced completely original Disney material, such as the manga adaptation of the videogame Kingdom Hearts by Shiro Amano, published by Bros Comics EX (and later translated in English by Tokyopop) and Jun Asaga&#x27;s adaptation of Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas (originally published by Kodansha, English version by Disney Press).

===Vietnam===
Donald và bạn hữu (Vietnamese for &quot;Donald and friends&quot;) is a bilingual weekly Disney comics magazine in Vietnamese and English published by Tre Publishing House in co-operation with The Saigon Times under license from the Walt Disney Company since 1998.

===India===
On December 8, 2010, DPW&#x27;s India unit signed a multi-year contract with India Today Group to print and distribute Disney comics in India.

==Cataloguing==

===Story codes===
Starting in the 1970s, as production of new Disney comics stories moved from a mostly-American, centralized publishing model to a group of international publishers sharing work, it became a practice to give each Disney comics story a unique letter-number code that would help identify a single story across languages. (Disney requires all licensees to facilitating international reprinting by providing the reproducible materials at cost.) The code is usually printed at the bottom of the story&#x27;s first panel, and it consists of one or more letters, representing the publisher or country of origin, followed by a multi-digit number. In some cases, the code ends with another letter.

The main publishers are:
===Fan databases===
Multiple fan databases exist. Notable examples are I.N.D.U.C.K.S. and Don Markstein&#x27;s Toonopedia.

<text>The schilling (German: &quot;Schilling&quot;; ) is a former currency of Austria from 1925 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1999, and the circulating currency until 2002. The euro was introduced at a fixed parity of €1 = 13.7603 schilling to replace it. The schilling was divided into 100 groschen.

==History==
Following the Carolingian coin reform in 794 AD, new units of account were introduced, including the &quot;schilling,&quot; which consisted of 12 silver &quot;pfennigs&quot;. It was initially only a coin of account but later became an actual coin produced in many European countries.

===Before the modern Austrian schilling===
The currencies preceding the schilling include:
* The florin, in existence as a currency of the Holy Roman Empire since the 16th century, divided into 8 &quot;Schillings&quot; = 60 &quot;Kreuzer&quot; = 240 &quot;Pfennigs&quot;
* The Austro-Hungarian gulden after 1857, divided into 100 &quot;Neukreuzer&quot;
* The Austro-Hungarian krone, introduced in 1892 upon adoption of the gold standard; and
* The Austrian crown, introduced for Austria in 1919 upon the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

In mediaeval Austria, there were short and long &quot;schilling&quot; coins, valued at 12 and 30 &quot;pfennigs&quot; respectively. Until 1857, the &quot;schilling&quot; was a currency unit for 30 &quot;pfennigs&quot; or &quot;kreuzers&quot;. The Austrian &quot;groschen&quot; (also known as the &quot;Kaisergroschen&quot;, lit. “emperor&#x27;s &quot;groschen&quot;/groat”) was a silver coin worth 12 &quot;pfennigs&quot; = 3 &quot;kreuzers&quot; = &quot;schillings&quot;.

===First Austrian schilling===
The schilling was established by the Schilling Act (&quot;Schillingrechnungsgesetz&quot;) of 20 December 1924, at a rate of one schilling to 10,000 kronen and issued on 1 March 1925. The schilling was abolished in the wake of Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria in 1938, when it was exchanged at a rate of 1.50 schilling for one Reichsmark.

===Second Austrian schilling===
The schilling was reintroduced after World War II on 30 November 1945 by the Allied Military, who issued paper money (dated 1944) in denominations of 50 groschen, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, and 1000 schilling. The exchange rate to the reichsmark was 1:1, limited to 150 schilling per person. The Nationalbank also began issuing schilling notes in 1945 and the first coins were issued in 1946.

With a second &quot;schilling&quot; law on 21 November 1947, new banknotes were introduced. The earlier notes could be exchanged for new notes at par for the first 150 schilling and at a rate of 1 new schilling for 3 old schillings thereafter. This reform did not affect coins. The currency stabilised in the 1950s, with the schilling being tied to the U.S. dollar at a rate of $1 = 26 schilling. Following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the schilling was initially tied to a basket of currencies until July 1976, when it was coupled to the German mark.

Although the euro became the official currency of Austria in 1999, euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002. Old schilling denominated coins and notes were phased out from circulation because of the introduction of the euro by 28 February of that year. Schilling banknotes and coins which were valid at the time of the introduction of the euro will indefinitely remain exchangeable for euros at any branch of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank.

==Coins==

===First schilling===
In 1925, bronze 1 and 2 groschen, cupro-nickel 10 groschen, and silver and 1 schilling coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 5 groschen issues in 1931. In 1934, cupro-nickel 50 groschen and 1 schilling were introduced, together with silver 5 schilling. Coins were issued until 1938.

Also issued gold and silver coins: 2 schillings (1937) – 64% silver, 5 schillings (1934) – 83% silver, 25 schillings (1926) – 90% gold, 100 schillings (1924) – 90% gold.

===Second schilling===
Between 1947 and 1952, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 groschen; and 1, 2, and 5 schilling were introduced. The 1, 5, 10, and 50 groschen were initially made from leftover blanks from the wartime pfennig issues. The 2 and 50 groschen; 1, 2, and 5 schilling were struck in aluminium, as was the second type of 10 groschen coin. The 1 and 5 groschen and the first type of 10 groschen were in zinc, with the 20 groschen struck in aluminium-bronze. The 1 groschen was only struck in 1947, while the 20 groschen and 2 schilling coins were suspended from production in 1954 and 1952, respectively. In 1957, silver 10 schilling coins were introduced, followed in 1959 by aluminium-bronze 50 groschen and 1 schilling, and in 1960 by silver 5 schilling coins. As a result, the composition of the 5 Schilling coins changed from aluminum to silver in the 1950s, which was a highly unusual event. Cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 5 and 10 schilling coins in 1969 and 1974, respectively. An aluminium-bronze 20 schilling coin was introduced in 1980.

Silver coins were in the value of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 schilling, but gold coins also existed for 500 and 1,000 schilling. They were considered legal currency, but were rarely found in actual transactions. Coins under 10 groschen were rarely seen in circulation during their final years.

At the time of the changeover to the euro, the coins in circulation were the following:

# 10 Schilling has pure nickel core
# Smoothly with 19 pits until 1992. In 1993, all previous 20 Schilling coins were reissued with smooth edges.

==Banknotes==

===First schilling===

In 1925, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank issued notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 &quot;Schillinge&quot; (note the different spelling of the plural on this first 1925-series of notes).

In 1927–1929 a second series was added with 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 schilling notes. The one schilling was substituted by a coin.

===Second schilling===
In 1945, the Allies introduced notes (dated 1944) in denominations of 50 groschen, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 1,000 schilling. The Oesterreichische Nationalbank also introduced notes in 1945, in denominations of 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 schilling and the allied currency with small values up to 5 schilling remained valid until 1947. With the banknote reform of 1947, new notes were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1,000 schilling. 
Until 1957, the first 500 schilling banknote was issued and the 5 and 10 schilling notes were replaced by coins. However, although 20 schilling coins were issued from 1980, the 20 schilling note continued to be produced, with 5,000 schilling notes added in 1988.

<doc id="188410" wikidata="Q553626" url="?curid=188410" title="Dennis Hastert">
<text>John Dennis Hastert ( ; born January 2, 1942) is an American former politician, teacher, and wrestling coach who represented from 1987 to 2007 and served as the 51st Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007. Hastert was the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history. After Democrats gained a majority in the House in 2007, Hastert resigned and began work as a lobbyist. In 2016, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison for financial offenses related to the sexual abuse of teenage boys.

From 1965 to 1981, Hastert was a high school teacher and coach at Yorkville High School in Yorkville, Illinois. He lost a 1980 bid for the Illinois House of Representatives but ran again and won a seat in 1981. He was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1986 and was re-elected every two years until he retired in 2007. Hastert rose through the Republican ranks in the House, becoming chief deputy whip in 1995 and speaker in 1999. As Speaker of the House, Hastert supported the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s foreign and domestic policies. After Democrats took control of the House in 2007 following the 2006 elections, Hastert declined to seek the position of minority leader, resigned his House seat, and became a lobbyist at the firm of Dickstein Shapiro.

In May 2015, Hastert was indicted on federal charges of structuring bank withdrawals to evade bank reporting requirements and making false statements to federal investigators. Federal prosecutors said that the funds withdrawn by Hastert were used as hush money to conceal his past sexual misconduct. In October 2015, Hastert entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors. Under the agreement, Hastert pleaded guilty to the structuring charge (a felony); the charge of making false statements was dropped. In court submissions filed in April 2016, federal prosecutors alleged that Hastert had molested at least four boys as young as 14 years of age during his time as a high school wrestling coach. At a sentencing hearing, Hastert admitted that he had sexually abused boys whom he had coached. Referring to Hastert as a &quot;serial child molester&quot;, a federal judge imposed a sentence of 15 months in prison, two years&#x27; supervised release, and a $250,000 fine. Hastert was imprisoned in 2016 and was released 13 months later; he became the highest-ranking elected official in U.S. history to serve a prison sentence.

==Early life and early career==
Hastert was born on January 2, 1942, in Aurora, Illinois, the eldest of two sons of Naomi (née Nussle) and Jack Hastert. Hastert is of Luxembourgish and Norwegian descent on his father&#x27;s side, and of German descent on his mother&#x27;s.

Hastert grew up in a rural Illinois farming community. His middle-class family owned a farm supply business and a family farm; Hastert bagged and hauled feed and performed farm chores. As a young man, Hastert also worked shifts in the family&#x27;s Plainfield restaurant, The Clock Tower, where he was a fry cook. Hastert became a born-again Christian as a teenager, during his sophomore year of high school. Hastert attended Oswego High School, where he was a star wrestler and football player.

Hastert briefly attended North Central College, but later transferred to Wheaton College, a Christian liberal arts college. Jim Parnalee, Hastert&#x27;s roommate at North Central who transferred with him to Wheaton, was a Marine Corps Reserve member who in 1965 became the school&#x27;s first student to be killed in Vietnam. Hastert continued to visit Parnalee&#x27;s family each year in Michigan. Because of a wrestling injury, Hastert never served in the military. In 1964, Hastert graduated from Wheaton with a B.A. in economics. In 1967, he received his M.S. in philosophy of education from Northern Illinois University (NIU). In his first year of graduate school, Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program. One of Hastert&#x27;s fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).
Hastert was employed by Yorkville Community Unit School District 115 for 16 years, from 1965 to 1981. Hastert began working there, at age 23, while still attending NIU. Throughout that time, Hastert worked as a teacher at Yorkville High School (teaching government, history, economics, and sociology), where he also served as a football and wrestling coach. Hastert led the school&#x27;s wrestling team to the 1976 state title and was later named Illinois Coach of the Year. According to federal prosecutors, during the time that he coached wrestling, Hastert sexually abused at least four of his students.

Hastert was a Boy Scout volunteer with Explorer Post 540 of Yorkville for 17 years, during his time as a schoolteacher and coach. Hastert reportedly traveled with the Explorers on trips to the Grand Canyon, the Bahamas, Minnesota, and the Green River in Utah.

In 1973, Hastert married a fellow teacher at the high school, Jean Kahl, with whom he had two sons.

==Illinois House of Representatives==
Hastert considered applying to become an assistant principal at the school, but then decided to enter politics, although at the time &quot;he knew nothing about politics.&quot; Hastert approached Phyllis Oldenburg, a Republican operative in Kendall County, seeking advice on running for a seat in the Illinois Legislature.

Hastert lost a 1980 Republican primary for the Illinois House of Representatives, but showed a talent for campaigning, and after the election, volunteered for an influential state senator, John E. Grotberg. In the summer of 1980, however, State Representative Al Schoeberiein had become terminally ill, and local Republican party officials selected Hastert as the successor over two major rivals, lawyer Tom Johnson of West Chicago and Mayor Richard Verbic of Elgin. The first round of balloting resulted in a tie, but Hastert was chosen after Grotberg interceded on Hastert&#x27;s behalf. Hastert, fellow Republican Suzanne Deuchler and Democratic incumbent Lawrence Murphy were elected that year.

Hastert served three terms in the state House from the 82nd district, where he served on the Appropriations Committee. According to a 1999 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; profile, in the state House &quot;Hastert quickly staked out a place on the far right of the political spectrum, once earning a place on the &#x27;Moral Majority Honor Roll.&#x27; Yet, he also displayed yeoman-like work habits and an ability to put aside partisanship.&quot; He gained a reputation as a dealmaker and party leader known for &quot;asking his colleagues to write their spending requests on a notepad so he could carry them into negotiating sessions&quot; and holding early-morning pre-meetings to organize talking points. One of his first moves in the House was to help block passage of the Equal Rights Amendment; the state House Speaker George Ryan appointed Hastert to a committee that worked to prevent the ERA from coming to the House floor. In the state House, Hastert opposed bills barring discrimination against gays; supported (unsuccessfully) proposals to raise the driving age to 18; and voted for a mandatory seat belt law, although he later voted to repeal it.

In 1986, at the urging of Governor James R. Thompson, Hastert developed a plan to deregulate Illinois utility companies. Under the plan developed by Hastert and Republican staffers, property and gross-receipts taxes that utilities paid would be eliminated and replaced with a &quot;state service tax&quot; that service-industry businesses (ranging from insurers to funeral homes) would pay. Critics of the plan said that it was too favorable to utility companies, and the proposal was not adopted.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Meanwhile, Hastert&#x27;s political mentor Grotberg had been elected to Congress as the representative from Illinois&#x27;s 14th district, which covered a swath of exurban territory west of Chicago. Grotberg was diagnosed with cancer in 1986, and was unable to run for a second term. Hastert was nominated to replace him; in the general election in November 1986, he defeated Democratic candidate Mary Lou Kearns, the Kane County coroner, in a relatively close race.

Hastert was then reelected in his Fox Valley-centered district several times, by wider margins, aided by his role in redistricting following the 1990 Census.

Following the House banking scandal, which broke in 1992, it was revealed that Hastert had bounced 44 checks during the period under investigation. A Justice Department special counsel said there was no reason to believe Hastert had committed any crime in overdrawing his accounts.

As a protégé of House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, Hastert rose through the Republican ranks in the House, and in 1995 (after the Republicans gained control of the House and Newt Gingrich became Speaker), Hastert became chief deputy whip. Michel appointed Hastert to the Republicans&#x27; health care task force, where Hastert became a &quot;prominent voice&quot; in helping defeat the Clinton health care plan of 1993.

Hastert developed a close relationship with Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, and was widely seen as DeLay&#x27;s deputy. Hastert and DeLay first worked together in 1989, on Edward Madigan&#x27;s unsuccessful race against Gingrich for minority whip. Hastert later managed DeLay&#x27;s successful campaign to become whip. In September 1998, the two added an extra $250,000 to the Defense Department appropriations bill for &quot;pharmacokinetics research&quot; which paid for an Army experiment with nicotine chewing gum manufactured by the Amurol Confections Company in Yorkville, in Hastert&#x27;s district. On the House floor, Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio criticized the insertion of the provision; Hastert defended it. Hastert played &quot;good cop&quot; to DeLay&#x27;s &quot;bad cop.&quot;

On the eve of his elevation to Speaker, Hastert was described as &quot;deeply conservative at heart&quot; by the Associated Press. The AP reported: &quot;He is an evangelical Christian who opposes abortion and advocates lower taxes, a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution and the death penalty. He spearheaded the GOP&#x27;s fight against using sampling techniques to take the next census. Such groups as the National Right to Life Committee, the Christian Coalition, the Chamber of Commerce and the NRA Political Victory Fund all gave his voting record perfect scores of 100. The American Conservative Union gave him an 88. Meanwhile, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union and labor organizations such as the AFL–CIO and the Teamsters each gave Hastert zero points. The League of Conservation Voters rated him a 13.&quot;

Hastert criticized the Clinton administration&#x27;s plans to conduct the 2000 Census using sampling techniques. Hastert was a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and in 1993 voted to approve the trade pact. He was a gun rights supporter who voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

Hastert was the &quot;House Republicans&#x27; leader on anti-narcotics efforts&quot; and was a strong supporter of the War on Drugs. In this role, he campaigned to bar needle-exchange programs from receiving federal funds, and criticized the Clinton administration for what he believed was insufficient funding for drug interdiction efforts.

In redistricting following the 2000 census, Hastert brokered a deal with Democratic Representative William Lipinski, also from Illinois, that &quot;protected the reelection prospects of almost every Illinois incumbent.&quot; The deal easily passed the divided Illinois Legislature.

===Committee assignments and House positions===
Hastert served on the following House committees and in the following House positions. (This list does not include subcommittee assignments or positions within the Republican Conference).

*100th Congress (1987–1989) – Government Operations; Public Works and Transportation
*101st Congress (1989–1991) – Government Operations; Public Works and Transportation; Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families

*109th Congress (2005–2007) – The Speaker; Intelligence (&quot;ex officio&quot;)

===Speaker of the House===
In the aftermath of the 1998 midterm elections, where the GOP lost five House seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the Senate, House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia stepped down from the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term. In mid-December, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana—the former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Speaker-designate—stated in a dramatic surprise announcement on the House floor that he would not become Speaker, following widely publicized revelations of his extramarital affairs.

Although he reportedly had no warning of Livingston&#x27;s decision to step aside, Hastert &quot;began lobbying on the House floor within moments&quot; of Livingston&#x27;s announcement, and by the afternoon of that day had secured the public backing of the House Republican leadership, including Gingrich, DeLay (who was &quot;viewed as too partisan to step into the role of Speaker&quot;) and Dick Armey (who was &quot;viewed as too weak&quot; and was damaged by party infighting). On that day, Hastert was endorsed by about 100 Republican representatives, ranging from conservatives such as Steve Largent to moderates such as Mike Castle, for the speakership. Representative Christopher Cox of California, viewed as a potential rival, decided by evening not to challenge Hastert for the speakership. Hastert became known as &quot;the Accidental Speaker.&quot;

In accepting the position, Hastert broke the tradition that the new speaker deliver his first address from the speaker&#x27;s chair, instead delivering his 17-minute acceptance speech from the floor. Hastert adopted a conciliatory tone and pledged to work for bipartisanship, saying that: &quot;Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness.&quot;

Nevertheless, in November 2004, Hastert instituted what became known as the Hastert Rule (or &quot;majority of the majority&quot; rule), which was an informal, self-imposed political practice of allowing the House to vote on only those bills that were supported by the majority of its Republican members. The practice received criticism as an unduly partisan measure both at the time it was adopted and in the subsequent years. The same year, the Hastert aide who coined the phrase also stated that the structure was not workable. In any case, a number of bills subsequently passed the House without the support of a majority of the majority party in the House, as shown by a list compiled by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2013, after leaving office, Hastert disowned the policy, saying that &quot;there is no Hastert Rule&quot; and that the &quot;rule&quot; was more of a principle that the majority party should follow its own policies.

Congressional expert Norm Ornstein writes that Hastert &quot;blew up&quot; the House&#x27;s &quot;regular order,&quot; which is &quot;a mix of rules and norms that allows debate, deliberation, and amendments in committees and on the House floor, that incorporates and does not shut out the minority (even if it still loses most of the time), that takes bills that pass both houses to a conference committee to reconcile differences, [and] that allows time for members and staff to read, digest, and analyze bills.&quot; Ornstein commented that &quot;no speaker did more to relegate the regular order to the sidelines than Hastert. ... The House is a very partisan institution, with rules structured to give even tiny majorities enormous leverage. But Hastert took those realities to a new and more tribalized, partisan plane.&quot; Despite this shift, Hastert was widely seen as &quot;affable&quot; and low-key; he did not seek the limelight, &quot;become a regular on Sunday talk shows or anything close to a household word or figure,&quot; or &quot;openly exhibit the kind of snarling or mean partisan demeanor that made Tom DeLay such a mark of hatred for Democrats.&quot;

Hastert adopted a much lower profile in the media than conventional wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.

Throughout his term, Hastert was a strong supporter of President George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign and domestic policies. Hastert was described as a Bush loyalist who worked closely with the White House to shepherd Bush&#x27;s agenda through Congress, The two frequently praised each other, expressed mutual respect, and had a close working relationship, even during the controversy over Representative Mark Foley sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage male pages. Hastert even provided Vice President Dick Cheney office space inside the House in the United States Capitol. In 2003, Hastert and Bush met privately at the White House about twice a month to discuss congressional developments.

Earmarks—line-item projects inserted into appropriations bills at the request of individual members, and often referred to as &quot;pork-barrel&quot; spending—&quot;exploded under [Hastert&#x27;s] leadership,&quot; growing from $12 billion in 1999 (at the beginning of Hastert&#x27;s term) to an all-time high of $29 billion in 2006 (Hastert&#x27;s last year as speaker). Hastert himself made earmarks a personal trademark; from 1999 to May 2005, Hastert obtained $24 million in federal earmarked grant funds to groups and institutions in Aurora, Illinois, Hastert&#x27;s birthplace and his district&#x27;s largest city.

====106th Congress====
In March 1999, soon after Hastert&#x27;s elevation to the speakership, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, in a front-page story, reported that Hastert &quot;has begun offering industry lobbyists the kind of deal they like: private audiences where, for a price, they can voice their views on what kind of agenda the 106th Congress should pursue.&quot; Hastert&#x27;s style and extensive fundraising led Common Cause to critique the &quot;pay-to-play system&quot; in Congress.

Hastert was known as a frequent critic of Bill Clinton, and immediately upon assuming the speakership, he &quot;played a lead role&quot; in the impeachment of the president. Nevertheless, Hastert and the Clinton administration did work together on several initiatives, including the New Markets Tax Credit Program and Plan Colombia.

In 2000, Hastert announced he would support an Armenian genocide resolution. Analysts noted that at the time there was a tight congressional race in California, in which might be important to have the large Armenian community in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee, but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution on the eve of the full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Clinton asking him to withdraw it because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in a recording that was translated by Sibel Edmonds that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.

====107th Congress====

&quot;Hastert and the senior Republican leadership in the House were able to maintain party discipline to a great degree&quot;, which allowed them to regularly enact legislation, despite a narrow majority (less than 12 seats) in the 106th and 107th Congresses. Hastert was a strong supporter of the Iraq War Resolution and the ensuing 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War. Hastert stated in the House in October 2002 that he believed there was &quot;a direct connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda&quot; and that the U.S. should &quot;do all that we can to disarm Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime before they provide al-Qaeda with weapons of mass destruction.&quot; In a February 2003 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Hastert &quot;launched into a lengthy and passionate denunciation&quot; of France&#x27;s resistance to the Iraq war and stated that he wanted to go &quot;nose-to-nose&quot; with the country. In 2006, Hastert visited Iraq at Bush&#x27;s request and supported a supplemental Iraq War spending bill.

As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 to passage in the House on a 357–66 vote. In a 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members. Fourteen years later, federal prosecutors used the Patriot Act&#x27;s expansion of currency transaction reporting requirements to indict Hastert on federal charges.

As speaker, Hastert also oversaw the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, a major education bill; the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 legislation; and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which reorganized the government and created the Department of Homeland Security. Although Hastert was successful in implementing Bush policy priorities, during his tenure the House also &quot;regularly passed conservative bills only to have them blocked in the more moderate Senate.&quot; One such bill was an energy bill, backed by the Bush administration, which would have authorized drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; this provision was killed in the Senate.

Hastert opposed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the landmark campaign finance reform law. In 2001, during the debate on the bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain, the bill&#x27;s cosponsor, saying that McCain had &quot;bullied&quot; House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation &quot;the worst thing that ever happened to Congress&quot; and expressed the view that there were &quot;constitutional flaws&quot; in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.

====108th Congress====
In 2004, Hastert again feuded with McCain amid conflict between the House and the Senate over the 2005 budget. After &quot;McCain gave a speech excoriating both political parties for refusing to sacrifice their tax cutting and spending agendas in wartime,&quot; Hastert publicly questioned McCain&#x27;s &quot;credentials as a Republican and suggested that the decorated Vietnam War veteran did not understand the meaning of sacrifice.&quot;

Hastert was key to the passage in November 2003 of key Medicare legislation which created Medicare Part D, a prescription drug benefit. Hastert&#x27;s push to pass the legislation—culminating in a three-hour House vote in which the Speaker, &quot;an imposing former wrestling coach, was literally leaning on recalcitrant lawmakers to win their support&quot;—raised the Speaker&#x27;s profile and contributed to a shift of his image from amiable and low-key to more forceful. The extension of the vote for hours and the arm-twisting of members brought condemnation of Hastert from Democrats, with House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer saying: &quot;They are corrupting the practices of the House.&quot; The bill passed on a narrow vote of 220 to 215.

In 2004, Hoyer called upon Hastert to initiate a House Ethics Committee investigation into statements by Representative Nick Smith, a Republican of Michigan, who stated that groups and lawmakers had offered support for his son&#x27;s campaign for Congress in exchange for Smith&#x27;s support of the Medicare bill. In October 2004, the House Ethics Committee admonished DeLay for pressuring Smith on the Medicare prescription-drug bill, but stated that DeLay did not break the law or House ethics rules. Hastert issued a statement supporting DeLay, but the admonishment was viewed as harming DeLay&#x27;s chances of succeeding Hastert as Speaker.

====109th Congress====
On October 27, 2005, Hastert became the first Speaker to author a blog. On &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Journal&quot; on his official U.S. House website, Hastert wrote in his first post: &quot;This is Denny Hastert and welcome to my blog. This is new to me. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m much of a techie. I guess you could say my office is teaching the old guy new tricks. But I&#x27;m excited. This is the future. And it is a new way for us to get our message out.&quot;

On June 1, 2006, Hastert became the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, surpassing the record previously held by fellow Illinoisan Joseph Gurney Cannon, who held the post from November 1903 to March 1911.

In 2005, following Hurricane Katrina, Hastert told an Illinois newspaper that &quot;It looks like a lot of that place [referring to New Orleans] could be bulldozed&quot; and stated that spending billions of dollars to rebuild the devastated city &quot;doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.&quot; The remarks enraged Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana, who stated that Hastert&#x27;s comments were &quot;absolutely unthinkable for a leader in his position&quot; and demanded an immediate apology. Former President Bill Clinton, responding to the remarks, stated that had they been in the same place when the remarks were made, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I would have assaulted him.&quot; After the remarks caused a furor, Hastert issued a statement saying he was not &quot;advocating that the city be abandoned or relocated&quot; and later issued another statement saying that &quot;Our prayers and sympathies continue to be with the victims of Hurricane Katrina.&quot; Hastert was also criticized for being absent from the Capitol during the approval of a $10.5 billion Katrina relief plan; Hastert was in Indiana attending a colleague&#x27;s fundraiser and an antique car auction. Hastert later said that he donated the proceeds from one of the antique cars he sold at the auction to hurricane relief efforts.

====Ethics====
When the United States House Committee on Ethics recommended a series of reprimands against Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Hastert fired committee Chairman Joel Hefley, (R-CO), as well as committee members Kenny Hulshof, (R-MO) and Steve LaTourette, (R-OH). After DeLay&#x27;s associates were indicted, Hastert enacted a new rule allowing DeLay to keep the majority leadership even if DeLay himself was indicted.

A September 2005 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; revealed that during her work, former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds had heard Turkish wiretap targets boast of covert relations with Hastert. The article states, &quot;the targets reportedly discussed giving Hastert tens of thousands of dollars in surreptitious payments in exchange for political favors and information.&quot; A spokesman for Hastert later denied the claims, relating them to the Jennifer Aniston–Brad Pitt breakup. Following his congressional career, Hastert received a $35,000 per month contract lobbying on behalf of Turkey.

In December 2006, the House Ethics Committee determined that Hastert and other congressional leaders were &quot;willfully ignorant&quot; in responding to early warnings of the Mark Foley congressional page scandal, but did not violate any House rules. In a committee statement, Kirk Fordham, who was Foley&#x27;s chief of staff until 2005, said that he had alerted Scott B. Palmer, Hastert&#x27;s chief of staff, to Foley&#x27;s inappropriate advances toward congressional pages in 2002 or 2003, asking congressional leadership to intervene. Then-House Majority Leader John Boehner and National Republican Congressional Committee chair Thomas M. Reynolds stated that they told Hastert about Foley&#x27;s conduct in spring 2005. A Hastert spokesman stated that &quot;what Kirk Fordham said did not happen.&quot; Hastert also stated that he could not recall conversations with Boehner and Reynolds, and that he did not learn of Foley&#x27;s conduct until late September 2006, when the affair became public.

In 2006, Hastert became embroiled in controversy over his championing of a $207 million earmark (inserted in the 2005 omnibus highway bill) for the Prairie Parkway, a proposed expressway running through his district. The Sunlight Foundation accused Hastert of failing to disclose that the construction of the highway would benefit a land investment that Hastert and his wife made in nearby land in 2004 and 2005. Hastert took an unusually active role advancing the bill, even though it was opposed by a majority of area residents and by the Illinois Department of Transportation. When he became frustrated by negotiations with White House staff, Hastert began working on the bill directly with President Bush. After passage, Bush traveled to Hastert&#x27;s district for the law&#x27;s signing ceremony.

Four months later Hastert sold the land for a 500% profit. Hastert&#x27;s net worth went from $300,000 to at least $6.2 million. Hastert received five-eighths of the proceeds of the sale of the land, turning a $1.8 million profit in under two years. Hastert&#x27;s ownership interest in the tract was not a public record because the land was held by a blind land trust, Little Rock Trust No. 225. There were three partners in the trust: Hastert, Thomas Klatt, and Dallas Ingemunson. However, public documents only named Ingemunson, who was the Kendall County Republican Party chairman and Hastert&#x27;s personal attorney and longtime friend. Hastert denied any wrongdoing. In October 2006, Norman Ornstein and Scott Lilly wrote that the Prairie Parkway affair was &quot;worse than FoleyGate&quot; and called for Hastert&#x27;s resignation.

In 2012, after Hastert had departed from Congress, the highway project was killed after federal regulators retracted the 2008 approval of an environmental impact statement for the project and agreed to an Illinois Department of Transportation request to redirect the funds for other projects. Environmentalists, who opposed the project, celebrated its cancellation.

In 2006, Hastert (along with then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi) criticized an FBI search of Representative William J. Jefferson&#x27;s Capitol Hill office in connection with a corruption investigation. Hastert issued a lengthy statement saying that the raid violated the separation of powers, and later complained directly to President Bush about the matter.

===Departure from Congress===

Before the 2006 elections, Hastert expressed his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained control of the House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, and a series of scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168–27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.

In October 2007, following months of rumors that Hastert would not serve out his term, the Capitol Hill newspaper &quot;Roll Call&quot; reported that Hastert had decided to resign from the House before the end of the year, triggering a special election.

On November 15, 2007, Hastert delivered a farewell speech on the House floor, emphasizing the need for civility in politics; Hastert&#x27;s speech was followed by remarks from Pelosi praising Hastert&#x27;s service. On November 26, 2007, Hastert submitted his resignation.

Financial disclosure documents indicate that Hastert made a fortune from land deals during his time in Congress. Hastert entered Congress in 1987 with a net worth of no more than $270,000. At the time, his most valuable asset was a 104-acre farm in southern Illinois (which his wife had inherited), worth between $50,000 and $100,000. When Hastert left Congress twenty years later, he reported a significantly increased net worth, variously reported as between $4 million and $17 million and between $3.1 million and $11.3 million. Much of this increase in net worth was the result of various real-estate investments during Hastert&#x27;s time in Congress (including the controversial land deal several miles from the proposed Prairie Parkway site). At the time Hastert left Congress, much of his net worth remained tied up in real-estate holdings.

State Senator Chris Lauzen, Geneva Mayor Kevin Burns, and wealthy dairy businessman Jim Oberweis all entered the campaign for the Republican nomination to succeed Hastert. In December 2007, Hastert endorsed Oberweis in the primary, and Burns withdrew from the race. In the contentious February 2008 primary election, Oberweis was chosen as the Republican nominee, and Fermilab scientist Bill Foster was selected as the Democratic nominee. In the special election in March 2008 to fill the rest of Hastert&#x27;s unexpired term, Foster won a surprise victory over Oberweis. In a rematch in the November 2008 elections for a full two-year term, Foster again defeated Oberweis.

==Post-congressional career==

===Lobbyist and consultant===
In May 2008, six months after resigning from Congress, the Washington, D.C.-based law firm and lobbying firm Dickstein Shapiro announced that Hastert was joining the firm as a senior adviser. Hastert waited until the legally required &quot;cooling-off period&quot; had passed in order to register as a lobbyist. Over the next several years, Hastert earned millions of dollars lobbying his former congressional colleagues on a range of issues, mostly involving congressional appropriations.

According to Foreign Agents Registration Act filings, Hastert represented foreign governments, including the government of Luxembourg and government of Turkey. During parts of 2009, Hastert also lobbied on behalf of Oak Brook, Illinois-based real estate developer CenterPoint Properties, lobbying for the placement of a major Army Reserve transportation facility. Hastert also represented Lorillard Tobacco Co., which paid Dickstein Shapiro almost $8 million from 2011 to 2014 to lobby on behalf of candy-flavored tobacco and electronic cigarettes; Hastert &quot;was the most prominent member of the lobbying team&quot; on these efforts. In 2013 and 2014, Hastert lobbied on climate change issues on behalf of Peabody Energy, the world&#x27;s largest private-sector coal company; in 2015, Hastert &quot;switched sides&quot; and lobbied for Fuels America, the ethanol industry group. In the second half of 2011, Hastert monitored legislation on GPS on behalf of LightSquared, which paid Dickstein Shapiro $200,000 for lobbying services.

Hastert also lobbied on behalf of FirstLine Transportation Security, Inc. (which sought congressional review of Transportation Security Administration procurement); Naperville, Illinois-based lighting technology company PolyBrite International; the American College of Rheumatology (on annual labor and health spending bill); the San Diego, California-based for-profit education company Bridgepoint Education; REX American Resources Corp.; The ServiceMaster Co.; and the Secure ID Coalition.

In 2014, Hastert&#x27;s firm Dickstein Shapiro and the lobbying firm of former House majority leader-turned lobbyist Dick Gephardt split a $1.4 million annual lobbying contract with the government of Turkey. In April 2013, Hastert and Gephardt traveled with eight members of Congress to Turkey, with all expenses paid by the Turkish government. While members of Congress are generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Jack Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had &quot;meticulously&quot; followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and Gephardt &quot;allowed those members of Congress who were there to have a fuller experience.&quot; A &quot;National Journal&quot; investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which &quot;lobbyists who can&#x27;t legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world.&quot;

In March 2015, Hastert along with his associate (accompanied by several lobbyist associates, including former Representative William D. Delahunt of Massachusetts) took advantage of his privilege as a former lawmaker to be present in the Senate Reception Room near the Senate chamber, &quot;lingering&quot; and &quot;bantering with senators and other passersby&quot; during a vote on whether to retain the fuel standard mandating the blending of ethanol and other alternative fuels with gasoline, as advocated by Hastert&#x27;s client Fuels America (the ethanol industry trade group). Hastert and Delahunt were criticized by watchdog groups who &quot;questioned whether Hastert was violating&quot; these rules, but &quot;allies of Hastert and Delahunt said they made a point of not lobbying lawmakers in the Senate Reception Room, but that they and members of their team used the lobby area as a temporary base, where they could greet lawmakers while they were holding meetings in private rooms.&quot;

The day the 2015 indictment was unsealed, Hastert resigned his lobbyist position at Dickstein Shapiro, and his biography was removed from the firm&#x27;s website.

In addition to his lobbyist job, Hastert established his own consultancy, Hastert &amp; Associates. In 2008, Hastert also joined the board of directors of Chicago-based futures exchange company CME Group (which had been formed from the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade), where he earned more than 205,000 in total compensation in 2014. On May 29, 2015, following his indictment, Hastert resigned from the board, effective immediately.

===Publicly funded post-speakership office===
A controversy arose in 2009 regarding Hastert&#x27;s receipt of federal funds while a lobbyist. Under a 1975 federal law, Hastert, as a former House Speaker, was entitled to a public allowance (about $40,000 a month) for a five-year period to allow him to maintain an office. Hastert accepted the funds, which went toward office space in far-west suburban 
Yorkville, Illinois; salaries for three staffers (secretary Lisa Post and administrative assistants Bryan Harbin and Tom Jarman, each paid an annual salary of more than $100,000 over 2½ years); lease payments on a 2008 GMC Yukon sport utility vehicle; a satellite TV subscription; office equipment; and legal fees. Jarman later left the office, and Harbin&#x27;s salary was cut substantially. Hastert&#x27;s government-funded office closed in late 2012, at the end of the maximum five years for which public funds were provided. The total amount of public funds spent on Hastert&#x27;s post-speakership office was nearly $1.9 million (not including federal benefits such as health care to which the employees were entitled), of which the majority (about $1.45 million) went toward staff salaries.

The federally funded benefits were legally required to be completely separate from Hastert&#x27;s simultaneous lobbying activities for Dickstein Shapiro. The arrangement was criticized as &quot;really concerning&quot; by Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, because the exact nature of the two roles was not transparent. A Hastert spokesman stated that the two offices were completely separate. In 2012, however, a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; investigation found that &quot;a secretary in the ex-speaker&#x27;s government office used email to coordinate some of his private business meetings and travel, and conducted research on one proposed venture&quot; and that &quot;a suburban Chicago businessman who was involved in the business ventures with Hastert said he met with Hastert at least three times in the government office to discuss the projects.&quot; Hastert denied that he had engaged in any improper conduct.

====Civil lawsuit alleging personal use of publicly funded office====
In 2013, Hastert&#x27;s former business partner J. David John filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Hastert misappropriated federal funds for his post-speakership office in Yorkville for personal use, including private lobbying and business projects. This suit was filed under the &quot;qui tam&quot; provision of the False Claims Act (FCA), an anti-fraud statute that allows a private party to pursue a case on behalf of the federal government. In the suit, John asserts that he told the FBI in 2011 that &quot;he had knowledge that Hastert was using federally funded offices, staff, office supplies and vehicles for personal business ventures.&quot; John, a businessman from the Chicago suburb of Burr Ridge, Illinois, also said that he traveled with Hastert and collaborated with him on &quot;a planned Grand Prix racetrack in Southern California and sports events to be organized in the Middle East&quot; as well as other projects. Hastert denies any wrongdoing. The allegations about the use of the former speakers&#x27; officer first drew the attention of federal investigators in 2013, leading to the federal indictment in 2015.

In April 2017, Kocoras dismissed the suit, finding that John did not qualify as a &quot;whistleblower&quot; under the FCA. John&#x27;s attorney said that an appeal was possible. The dismissal &quot;did not turn on whether Hastert actually misused the speaker&#x27;s office, but rather whether John met a prerequisite for [a False Claims Act] suit: that he brought the allegations to the government&#x27;s attention before anyone else and before they were made public.&quot; Kocoras held that John had falsely claimed that he had told the FBI about possible misuse of federal resources by Hastert.

===Other activities===
After retiring from Congress, Hastert made occasional public appearances on political programs. He also made some endorsements of political candidates; in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, he endorsed Mitt Romney instead of his predecessor as Speaker, Newt Gingrich.

==Sex abuse scandal and federal prosecution==

===Investigation into hush-money scheme===
According to a 2017 interview with the two special agents leading the investigations—one each from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division—&quot;Hastert had been on the FBI&#x27;s radar as early as November 2012—even before the FBI and IRS began investigating the suspicious cash withdrawals that were Hastert&#x27;s downfall.&quot; The inquiry was first prompted by allegations that Hastert had used his taxpayer-funded Office of the Former Speaker to further his private business ventures, something that Hastert was never charged with. In 2013, the FBI and IRS began investigating Hastert&#x27;s cash withdrawals, and in early 2015 they had learned about the &quot;hush money&quot; agreement between &quot;Individual A&quot; and Hastert. In a December 8, 2014, interview, Hastert lied to the federal agents about the purpose of the withdrawals, leading to his federal prosecution.

===Indictment===
On May 28, 2015, a seven-page indictment of Hastert by a federal grand jury was unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago.

The indictment charged Hastert with unlawfully structuring the withdrawal of $952,000 in cash in order to evade the requirement that banks report cash transactions over 10,000 (Title 31, United States Code, Section 5324(a)(3)), and making false statements to the FBI about the purpose of his withdrawals (Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001(a)(2)). The indictment alleges that Hastert agreed to make payments of $3.5 million to an unnamed subject (identified in the indictment only as an &quot;Individual A&quot; from Yorkville, Illinois, who was known to Hastert for &quot;most of Individual A&#x27;s life&quot;). The indictment stated that the payments were to &quot;compensate for and conceal [Hastert&#x27;s] prior misconduct.&quot; Federal authorities began investigating his withdrawals in 2013. In late 2014, after being questioned about the withdrawals, Hastert said that he did not trust banks; shortly afterward, Hastert changed his story, saying that he &quot;was the victim of extortion by Individual A for false molestation accusations.&quot;

The indictment itself did not specify the exact nature of the &quot;past misconduct&quot; referred to. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office limited details in the indictment of Hastert, in part because of a request from Hastert&#x27;s attorneys.

On May 29, Hastert was released on his own recognizance on a preliminary bail of $4,500 set by a magistrate judge.

In June &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Hastert had approached a business associate, J. David John, in 2010, to look for a financial adviser to come up with an annuity plan that would &quot;generate a substantial cash payout each year.&quot; This request was the same year that prosecutors say he agreed to start paying hush money to the person he allegedly committed misconduct against. John told the &quot;Times&quot; that &quot;I did not think much about it at the time, but looking back at it, it does seem strange. He just said he needed to generate some cash.&quot;

===Sex abuse allegations emerge===
On May 29, 2015, after Hastert had been indicted for illicitly structuring financial transactions, two people briefed on the evidence from the case stated that &quot;Individual A&quot;—the man to whom Hastert was making payments—had been sexually abused by Hastert during Hastert&#x27;s time as a teacher and coach at Yorkville High School and that Hastert had paid $1.7 million out of a total $3.5 million in promised payment. On the same day, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that investigators had spoken with another former student who made similar allegations that corroborated what the first student said. Hastert admitted to committing sexual abuse during sentencing on the structuring charge.

On June 5, 2015, ABC News&#x27; &quot;Good Morning America&quot; aired an interview with Jolene Reinboldt Burdge, the sister of Steve Reinboldt, who was the student equipment manager of the wrestling team at Yorkville High School when Hastert was the wrestling coach. Hastert also ran an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member and led the group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979, eight years after Reinboldt&#x27;s high school graduation in 1971, her brother had told her that he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was &quot;stunned&quot; by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt&#x27;s 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. Jolene said that Hastert &quot;damaged Steve I think more than any of us will ever know&quot;.

Reinboldt died of an AIDS-related illness in 1995. Hastert attended his viewing, which angered Burdge. She said:

Hastert then got in his car and left. Burdge said Hastert&#x27;s lack of a response &quot;said everything&quot;.

Following Reinboldt&#x27;s death, around the time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully attempted to bring the allegations against Hastert to light. She contacted ABC News and the Associated Press (AP) on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Burdge&#x27;s allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC News at the time, so the claim was not published.

ABC News reported that &quot;for years, Jolene watched helplessly as Hastert basked in fame and power, seated to the left of the president for years in the early 2000s, during the nationally televised State of the Union address&quot;. Several days before the indictment was unsealed, Burdge was interviewed by FBI agents who asked her about her brother and informed her Hastert was about to be indicted on federal charges. Neither Reinboldt nor Burdge are &quot;Individual A&quot; named in the indictment, but Burdge believes that &quot;Individual A&quot; is familiar with what happened with her brother. The statements by Burdge &quot;marked the first time that a person [had] been publicly identified as a possible victim of Mr. Hastert&quot;.

==== Reactions ====
The emergence of the sexual abuse allegations against Hastert brought renewed attention to the 2006 Mark Foley scandal, and the criticism of Hastert that he failed to take appropriate action in that case.

In the wake of the sexual abuse allegations, journalists noted that Hastert was a supporter of measures which sought to enhance punishments for child sexual abuse, such as the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act and the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2000. In 2003, Hastert publicly called for legislation to &quot;put repeat child molesters into jail for the rest of their lives&quot;.

Hastert resigned his lobbyist position at the law and lobbying firm Dickstein Shapiro the day the indictment was unsealed. His biography was quickly removed from the firm&#x27;s website and the firm purged all mentions of him from its previously posted press releases. According to a report in &quot;Politico&quot;, Hastert&#x27;s resignation left the firm &quot;reeling&quot;. Following the Hastert indictment, Dickstein Shapiro&#x27;s biggest domestic client, Fuels America, terminated its lobbying contract with the firm.

On May 29, 2015, Yorkville Community Unit School District 115 released a statement reading: James Harnett, who was superintendent of the school district for five of the years that Hastert taught there, told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that he was not aware of any complaints of misconduct brought against Hastert at the time.

On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, who served in the House throughout Hastert&#x27;s tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: &quot;Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news. The former speaker should be afforded, like any other American, his day in court to address these very serious accusations. This is a very troubling development that we must learn more about, but I am thinking of his family during this difficult time.&quot; On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk&#x27;s 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert&#x27;s Keep Our Mission PAC. Kirk&#x27;s announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)&#x27;s call upon the senator to &quot;return or donate Denny Hastert&#x27;s money immediately&quot;. The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert&#x27;s PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.

On May 29, 2015, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated in response to a reporter&#x27;s question that &quot;there is nobody here&quot; at the White House &quot;who derives any pleasure from reading about the former Speaker&#x27;s legal troubles at this point&quot;. On the same day, House Speaker John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, issued a statement saying: &quot;The Denny I served with worked hard on behalf of his constituents and the country. I&#x27;m shocked and saddened to learn of these reports.&quot;

On May 30, 2015, Illinois&#x27;s other senator, Dick Durbin, a Democrat, stated: 

On June 2, 2015, former Federal Housing Finance Agency director and former U.S. Representative Mel Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, released a statement saying: 

The Hastert scandal was named by MSNBC as among the &quot;top political sex scandals of 2015,&quot; by the Associated Press as one of the &quot;top 10 Illinois stories of 2015,&quot; and by ABC News as one of the &quot;biggest moments on Capitol Hill in 2015.&quot; Hastert&#x27;s sentencing was also named by the Associated Press as one of &quot;top 10 Illinois stories of 2016&quot;.

===Arraignment and pretrial proceedings===
The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Thomas M. Durkin. In between the unsealing of the indictment and the arraignment, Hastert made no public appearances and did not release any public statement. However, on May 29, 2015, CBS Chicago reported that Hastert had privately told close friends that &quot;I am a victim, too&quot; and that he was sorry they had to go through the ordeal.

Hastert hired attorney Thomas C. Green, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer and senior counsel at the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Sidley Austin, to defend him. The prosecutors assigned to the case were originally Assistant United States Attorneys Steven Block and Carrie Hamilton. Hamilton left the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in July 2015 after being appointed as a judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County; Diane MacArthur replaced Hamilton on the Hastert prosecution team.

The June 9, 2015, arraignment generated a degree of media interest at the Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse not seen since the proceedings against Illinois governors Rod Blagojevich and George Ryan on corruption charges. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported: &quot;Hastert&#x27;s entrance and exit from the courthouse touched off a wild scene as federal Homeland Security agents escorted Hastert and his attorneys to and from a waiting vehicle amid a crush of television news crews and photographers.&quot; At the hearing, Hastert entered a plea of not guilty. Durkin set a $4,500 unsecured bond as well as various other conditions of pretrial release, and Hastert surrendered his passport.

At the arraignment, Durkin disclosed that he had contributed $500 in 2002 and $1000 in 2004 to the Hastert for Congress campaign; the contributions were made while Durkin was a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown, before he was appointed to the federal bench in 2012. Hastert&#x27;s son, Ethan, was a partner at Mayer Brown. At the arraignment, Durkin stated that he had never met Hastert and that he believed he could be impartial, but gave the parties time to decide whether to object to his involvement in the case. On June 11, federal prosecutors and Hastert&#x27;s lawyers filed notices waiving any objection to Durkin presiding over the case.

On June 12, federal prosecutors, with the agreement of Hastert&#x27;s attorneys, filed a motion for a protective order seeking to bar the public disclosure of the identity of &quot;Individual A&quot; and other sensitive information. The motion states that &quot;the discovery to be provided by the government in this case includes sensitive information, the unrestricted dissemination of which could adversely affect law enforcement interests and the privacy interests of third parties.&quot; The draft order contained language directing the parties to file any such sensitive information under seal. On June 16, Durkin granted the motion for a protective order but did not sign such an order.

At a status hearing on July 14 (which Hastert again did not attend), the parties updated the court on preparations for trial. At the hearing, Green said: &quot;The indictment has effectively been amended by leaks from the government. It is now an 800-pound gorilla in this case. It has been injected in this case I think impermissibly. (The question is) whether I wrestle with that gorilla or I don&#x27;t wrestle with that gorilla.&quot; Green also said that the defense would file a motion to dismiss the indictment, possibly under seal. Durkin &quot;cautioned that even if he allows part or all of the motion to be hidden from the public, his ruling would be public and likely would disclose sealed portions of the motion.&quot; At the same hearing, the prosecution said that they expected a trial to last about two weeks.

Hastert shut down his &quot;Keep Our Mission&quot; leadership PAC at the end of June 2015 and transferred $10,000 (the vast majority of the PAC&#x27;s remaining funds) to a new legal defense fund, the J. Dennis Hastert Defense Trust. A Federal Election Commission report lists the defense fund&#x27;s address as a Sunapee, New Hampshire property owned by Republican donor and ex-Gerald Ford White House staffer James Rooney.

===Guilty plea===
On September 11, 2015, Durkin granted a joint motion by the government and by Hastert to extend the deadline for filing pretrial motions for two weeks, &quot;giving the two sides more time for discussions they have been engaged in.&quot; On September 22, the parties filed another joint motion requesting another two-week extension (from September 28 to October 13); the motion said that the parties were discussing issues that Hastert &quot;may raise in pretrial motions&quot; but provided no details. At a hearing on September 28, Hastert&#x27;s attorneys and the government confirmed that they were discussing a possible plea agreement. Judge Durkin said that if no plea agreement was reached, he wanted the case to go to trial in March or April 2016. Pretrial motions were due on October 13, but none were filed, indicating that Hastert and the government &quot;were nearing a plea deal.&quot;

On October 15, 2015, it was announced at a court hearing that Hastert and federal prosecutors had reached a plea agreement. On October 28, 2015, under the plea agreement, Hastert appeared in court (the only time Hastert appeared personally in court after the arraignment) and pleaded guilty to the felony structuring charge. The charge of &quot;making false statements&quot; (lying to the FBI) was dismissed.

Hastert said in court: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want them [bank officials] to know how I intended to spend the money. I withdrew the money in less than $10,000 increments.&quot; Possible sentences within a preliminary Federal Sentencing Guidelines calculation ranged from probation to six months in prison.

The plea agreement allowed Hastert &quot;to avoid a potentially long and embarrassing trial&quot; and was thought to enable him to &quot;keep secret information that he has hidden for years.&quot;

===Sentencing and admission of past sex abuse===
Soon after pleading guilty, Hastert suffered a stroke, and was hospitalized from November 2015 to January 15, 2016. Hastert remained free on bail pending sentencing.

Sentencing was originally set for February 29, 2016. However, in late January 2016, Hastert&#x27;s attorneys asked the court to delay sentencing due to Hastert&#x27;s ongoing health problems, and Judge Durkin postponed sentencing until April 8, 2016. In March, Durkin ordered the appointment of a medical expert to review Hastert&#x27;s health in preparation for sentencing. Later in March, Durkin postponed the sentencing hearing (over the objection of Hastert&#x27;s attorneys) to April 27 so that a man who alleged sexual abuse by Hastert (identified as &quot;Individual D&quot; in court) could testify at the sentencing.

In early April, the parties filed submissions in court ahead of sentencing. The maximum sentence for the offense was five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, although the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range was from probation to six months. Hastert asked for probation. A statement released by Hastert&#x27;s counsel said: &quot;Mr. Hastert acknowledges that as a young man, he committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry. He earnestly apologizes to his former students, family, friends, previous constituents and all others affected by the harm his actions have caused.&quot; Hastert did not provide details.

Hastert also filed under seal a response to the government&#x27;s presentence investigation report. In the prosecution&#x27;s filing ahead of sentencing, federal prosecutors made allegations of sexual misconduct against Hastert (the first time they had done so publicly), saying that he had molested at least four boys as young as 14 (including Steve Reinboldt and others) while he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades earlier. In a 26-page filing, prosecutors detailed &quot;specific, graphic incidents&quot; of sexual acts. Prosecutors asked for a six-month sentence, as called for under federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors also requested the court to order Hastert to undergo a sex offender evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment. While Hastert&#x27;s health problems had the possibility to help him avoid prison, prosecutors noted in their court filing that he could receive medical treatment while incarcerated, if necessary.

Sixty letters asking for leniency for Hastert were submitted to the court ahead of sentencing, but 19 of these letters were withdrawn after Judge Durkin said that he would not consider any letters that were not made public. Of the 41 letters that were made public, several were from current or former members of Congress: Tom DeLay, John T. Doolittle, David Dreier, Thomas W. Ewing, and Porter Goss (who also is a former CIA director). &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; noted that DeLay and Doolittle &quot;have had legal troubles of their own&quot; stemming from the Abramoff scandal, although DeLay&#x27;s conviction in that scandal was later overturned and Doolittle was never charged. Other supporters of Hastert who wrote letters on his behalf included his family members; former Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C. Fahner; &quot;local leaders, board members, police officers and others from his home base in rural Kendall County&quot;; and &quot;several members of Illinois&#x27; wrestling community.&quot;

At the sentencing hearing on April 27, 2016, the government presented two witnesses. Jolene Burdge, the sister of Steve Reinboldt, read a letter that her brother had written shortly before his death in 1995. Addressing Hastert, Burdge stated that she wanted to &quot;hold you accountable for sexually abusing my brother. I knew your secret, and you couldn&#x27;t bribe or intimidate your way out. ... You think you can deny your abuse of Steve because he can no longer speak for himself – that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here.&quot;

The second witness was Scott Cross (&quot;Individual D&quot;) who publicly identified himself for the first time. Cross gave emotional testimony, telling the court that Hastert, whom he had trusted, had abused him and caused him to experience &quot;intense pain, shame and guilt.&quot; Cross&#x27; oldest brother is longtime Illinois House of Representatives Republican leader Tom Cross, a political protégé of Hastert&#x27;s.

Addressing the court, Hastert—who had arrived at court in a wheelchair—read from a written statement, apologizing for having &quot;mistreated athletes.&quot; After being pressed by the judge, Hastert admitted to sexually abusing boys whom he coached, saying that he had molested &quot;Individual B&quot; and did not remember some of the others. Hastert said he did not remember abusing Cross, &quot;but I accept his statement.&quot; Hastert stated &quot;what I did was wrong and I regret it ... I took advantage of them.&quot; Hastert also acknowledged that he had misled the FBI. Durkin referred to Hastert as a &quot;serial child molester&quot; and imposed a sentence of 15 months in prison, two years&#x27; supervised release, including sex-offender treatment, and a $250,000 fine. Hastert is &quot;one of the highest-ranking American politicians ever sentenced to prison.&quot;

Hastert could not be prosecuted for any of the acts of sexual abuse of which he had been accused because the applicable statute of limitations had expired decades earlier.

====Reactions====
Following the sentence, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorial board praised &quot;the bravery of the victims and their families who confronted the man who was once second in line to be president&quot; and wrote of the sentence: &quot;The enduring impact is that the truth has been revealed. And for as long as the name Dennis Hastert is recalled, the man once respected as a leader will be known as a criminal, a scoundrel, a child molester.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial board hailed the sentence, writing that Hastert&#x27;s victims &quot;should not have had to struggle with what Mr. Hastert did to them all the while they watched him rise in stature and power.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; called for extending statutes of limitations in sex abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Frank Bruni wrote that Hastert&#x27;s case underscored the danger that comes with the &quot;quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude,&quot; noting that Hastert&#x27;s public displays of Christian faith during his time in office were &quot;a factor in his colleagues&#x27; assessments of him as safe, uncontroversial.&quot; Bruni also critiqued the testimonials that prominent Republicans submitted on Hastert&#x27;s behalf before sentencing, saying that these &quot;affirm the degree to which pacts rather than principle govern partisan politics today.&quot;

Jacob Sullum of &quot;Reason&quot; opined that the financial structuring offense to which Hastert pleaded guilty &quot;should not be a crime ... even if it occasionally provides the means for punishing actual criminals who would otherwise escape justice.&quot; Conor Friedersdorf of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; expressed similar views, writing: &quot;The alarming aspect of this case is the fact that an American is ultimately being prosecuted for the crime of evading federal government surveillance.&quot;

The Hastert scandal was one motivation for the advance of legislation in the Illinois General Assembly to eliminate the statute of limitations for all felony child abuse and sexual assault offenses. The measure unanimously passed the state Senate in March 2017.

===Incarceration===
Hastert did not appeal his sentence. Shortly after being sentenced, Hastert paid the $250,000 fine and was ordered to report to prison on June 22, 2016. On that date, Hastert reported to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota to begin his prison term.

In July 2017, after serving about 13 months of a 15-month sentence, Hastert was released from federal prison and returned to Chicago under &quot;residential re-entry management&quot; supervision.

===Abuse-related civil lawsuits===

====&quot;James Doe&quot; lawsuit====
In April 2016, &quot;Individual A&quot; sued Hastert for breach of contract in Illinois state court, in Kendall County. &quot;Individual A&quot; (suing under pseudonym &quot;James Doe&quot;) sought to collect the remaining $1.8 million in &quot;hush money&quot; allegedly promised to him by Hastert. In the complaint, &quot;Individual A&quot; alleged that he was molested at age 14 by Hastert and that he confronted Hastert after speaking with another of Hastert&#x27;s alleged victims in 2008. Individual A alleged that he suffered panic attacks and other problems for years as a result of the abuse. Hastert counterclaimed for return of the hush money, alleging that &quot;Individual A&quot; violated a verbal agreement with him by disclosing the sexual abuse to federal authorities.

In November 2016, the court denied Hastert&#x27;s motion to dismiss. In September 2019, the court denied motions for summary judgment by each side. In September 2021, days before trial was set to begin, Hastert reached a settlement with the plaintiff for an undisclosed amount.

==== &quot;Richard Doe&quot; lawsuit ====
In May 2016, a second man filed a lawsuit against Hastert. The man alleged that Hastert sexually assaulted him in the bathroom of a community building in Yorkville in the summer of either 1973 or 1974, when the man was nine or ten years old and in the fourth grade. The complaint detailed the alleged violent assault as well as threats allegedly made by Hastert. The man only recognized Hastert as the assailant after Hastert appeared at Yorkville Grade School in gym class. A Kendall County judge granted the man&#x27;s motion to proceed anonymously under the &quot;Richard Doe&quot; pseudonym. In the complaint, the man stated that when he was 20 or 21 years old, he comprehended what had occurred and reported the crime to the Kendall County State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s Office, but that then-state&#x27;s attorney Dallas C. Ingemunson &quot;threatened to charge him with a crime and accused him of slandering Hastert&#x27;s name.&quot; Ingemunson denied this allegation, calling it &quot;bogus.&quot; In May 2016, &quot;Richard Doe&quot; filed a report with the Kendall County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, but the state&#x27;s attorney&#x27;s office determined that the statute of limitations barred a complaint against anyone.&quot; NBC Chicago obtained a redacted version of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office police report.

In November 2017, this lawsuit was dismissed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations years earlier.

===Impact upon pensions===
Soon after sentencing, the Illinois Teachers&#x27; Retirement System announced that Hastert would forfeit future teachers&#x27; pension benefits, effective immediately. Hastert challenged this decision on the ground that the specific federal crime to which he pleaded guilty was not directly related to his time as a teacher.

Hastert&#x27;s pension for his service in the Illinois General Assembly—about $28,000 a year—was originally unaffected. However, in October 2016, the General Assembly Retirement System board of trustees unanimously voted to suspend Hastert&#x27;s pension and in April 2017 the board voted, 5–2, to terminate the pension.

As of 2015, Hastert continued to receive his congressional pension, which amounts to approximately $73,000 a year.

==Honors==

In December 1999, Northern Illinois University conferred an honorary LL.D. degree upon Hastert. In May 2016, NIU&#x27;s board of trustees unanimously voted to revoke Hastert&#x27;s honorary degree.

In 2002, Lewis University conferred an honorary degree upon Hastert. In 2015, following his guilty plea, the university said that it was &quot;reviewing the status of the honorary degree.&quot; Lewis University no longer shows Hastert as having earned an honorary degree.

The National Wrestling Hall of Fame awarded Hastert its Order of Merit in 1995 and named Hastert to its &quot;Hall of Outstanding Americans&quot; in 2000. In May 2016, a few days after Hastert was sentenced to prison, the Hall of Fame (following a review) revoked all of Hastert&#x27;s honors, the first time the organization had ever taken such an action.

The Three Fires Council of the Boy Scouts of America has honored Hastert with its distinguished service award.

In March 2001, President Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania presented Hastert with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. In 2004, Hastert was presented the Order of the Oak Crown, Grand Cross by the grand duke of Luxembourg.

In 2007, the J. Dennis Hastert Center for Economics, Government and Public Policy was founded at Wheaton College, the former Speaker&#x27;s alma mater. Hastert resigned from the board of advisers of the center on May 29, 2015, after the indictment against him was released. On May 31, 2015, the college announced that it was removing his name from the center, renaming it the Wheaton College Center for Economics, Government, and Public Policy.

In 2009, Hastert&#x27;s official portrait was unveiled and placed in the Speaker&#x27;s Lobby adjacent to the House chamber, alongside portraits of other past House speakers. The 5&#x27; by 3½&#x27; portrait, executed by Westchester County, New York artist Laurel Stern Boeck, cost $35,000 in taxpayer funds. In November 2015, the week after Hastert&#x27;s guilty plea in his criminal case, the portrait was removed from the Speaker&#x27;s Lobby on orders of Speaker Paul Ryan.

In May 2009, Hastert accepted the Grand Cross of the Order of San Carlos from Álvaro Uribe, the president of Colombia.

In May 2010, Hastert accepted the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from Akihito, emperor of Japan.

In 2012, a plaque funded by private donors, &quot;bearing Hastert&#x27;s likeness and a list of his accomplishments,&quot; was placed in the historic Kendall County Courthouse in downtown Yorkville. The plaque was taken down in 2015, following Hastert&#x27;s guilty plea.

In early May 2015 (before the indictment was released), a proposal in the Illinois Legislature to spend $500,000 to commission and install a statue of Hastert in the Illinois State Capitol was withdrawn at Hastert&#x27;s request. Hastert called the measure&#x27;s sponsor (Michael Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives) and stated that &quot;he appreciated the recognition and honor&quot; but asked that it be deferred given the &quot;fiscal condition&quot; of the state.

In 2015, following the unsealing of the indictment against Hastert the previous month, the Denny Hastert Yorkville Invitational, a popular wrestling tournament in Illinois, was renamed the Fighting Foxes Invitational.

==Personal life==

===Marriage and family===
Hastert has been married to Jean Hastert (née Kahl) since 1973. They have two children, Ethan and Joshua. Hastert&#x27;s older son, Joshua, was a lobbyist for the firm PodestaMattoon, representing clients ranging from Amgen, a biotech company, to Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor. This provoked criticism from Congress Watch: &quot;There definitely should be restrictions [on family members registering as lobbyists] ... This is family members cashing in on connections ... [and it] is an ideal opportunity for special interest groups to exploit family relationships for personal gain.&quot; Joshua Hastert responded to the allegation by saying that he did not lobby House Republican leaders.

Hastert&#x27;s son Ethan ran in 2010 as a Republican for his father&#x27;s old congressional seat (Illinois&#x27; 14th congressional district), but was defeated in the primary by Illinois State Senator Randy Hultgren. Hultgren received 55 percent of the vote, while Hastert received 45 percent. In 2011, Ethan won a seat on the village board of Elburn, Illinois. Ethan left the Elburn village board in 2014 because he and his family moved to nearby Campton Hills. As of 2015, Ethan was a partner at the Chicago office of the law firm Mayer Brown.

===Health===
Hastert suffers from type 2 diabetes and requires daily insulin injections. Because of his condition, he sometimes walked with protective coverings on his feet to avoid foot problems.

Hastert has received treatment for kidney stones at least three times. In 2005, he underwent minor surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove kidney stones. In 2006, Hastert was hospitalized for cellulitis (a type of bacterial skin infection).

In November 2015, the week after entering a guilty plea in federal court, Hastert suffered a stroke and was hospitalized until January 15, 2016. According to his attorney, Hastert was additionally treated for sepsis and a blood infection, and underwent two back operations. At a court hearing in February 2016, Hastert&#x27;s attorney said that Hastert &quot;nearly died&quot; from the blood infection.

<text>Xenophobe is a video game developed by Bally Midway and released in arcades in 1987. Starbases, moons, ships, and space cities are infested with aliens, and the players have to kill the aliens before each is completely overrun. The screen is split into three horizontally-scrolling windows, one for each of up to three players, yet all players are in the same game world.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Xenophobe&quot; is an action platformer game. The goal of each level is to defeat all the aliens before a countdown timer runs out. Some rooms routinely display the percentage of alien infection and time remaining until self-destruct when the level ends (but a nearby button can temporarily deactivate the count-down). Levels may contain more than one floor, and players use elevators to move between floors. Players can also pick up more powerful weapons to help in their eradication of the aliens.

The hostile Xenos are encounted in a range of forms, beginning with Pods. If Pods hatch, they create a Critter which can attach itself to the player and drain health. If a Critter is not killed, it eventually matures into a Rollerbaby, which roll around to attack the player character. These in turn can grow into the Snotterpillar form, which attacks by leaping or spitting.

In the arcade and Lynx versions, an extra enemy called the Festor can appear in doorways, which can hypnotize and trap players, as well as throw eggs. If the egg lands on a screen with a player, it grows into another Pod.

As players go through the various maps, they encounter various items to be picked up. Some only award bonus points at the end of the level, while others are immediately useful to the players, by restoring health. There are three ways a player can conclude a mission. If the player runs out of time, they are evacuated and the station is overrun. Alternatively, the player can kill a number of Xenos, then self-destruct the space station, gaining bonus points for each enemy defeated. Finally, the player can successfully defeat all the alien invaders, and recover the space station safely, to earn a larger point and health bonus.

In some ports of the game, a player can play as a Snotterpillar and try to stop other players clearing the space station.

==Characters==
There are nine characters to choose from in &quot;Xenophobe&quot;, three for each joystick. The leftmost controller (red) features Mr. M.Brace, Dr. Kwack, and Col. Poupon. The middle controller (yellow) features Mr. Fogg, Col F. Truth, and Dr. Udderbay. The right controller (blue) features Mr. Eeez, Dr. Zordirz, and Col. Schickn. Humans and aliens alike make up the playable characters—for instance, Dr. Kwack has a duck&#x27;s head. Players are also color-coded; for instance, the left player&#x27;s choices wear red shirts, middle player&#x27;s yellow, right player&#x27;s blue.

==Ports==
Atari Corporation published &quot;Xenophobe&quot; for the Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari ST, and the Lynx. The 7800 port was by BlueSky Software, and the Lynx version by Epyx. A port to Atari 8-bit computers was worked on, but not published.

Sunsoft ported &quot;Xenophobe&quot; to the NES. The Commodore 64 port was done by Microplay. The game was also released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum.

==Reception==
===Atari Lynx===
In a capsule review of the Lynx version for &quot;STart&quot;, Clayton Walnum commented, &quot;The graphics in some rooms are more detailed than in others, and in general, aren&#x27;t as impressive as those in &quot;ElectroCop&quot;, a similar game. Also, the complicated controls take some getting used to.&quot; Julian Rignall reviewed the game in the January 1991 issue of CVG Magazine. He went on to say &quot;the graphics and sound are both excellent&quot; with &quot;the gameplay is challenging and addictive&quot;. &quot;A fun game which offers plenty of entertainment,&quot; giving a final rating of 79 out of 100.

Les Ellis of Raze Magazine also reviewed the game for the Atari Lynx calling it an addictive game with excellent graphics, giving a score of 94%. Robert A. Jung review was published to IGN, in it he wrote that Xenophobe was &quot;arguably more fun than its arcade inspiration.&quot; Giving a final score of 8 out of 10.

==Legacy==
In 2004 &quot;Xenophobe&quot; was included in Midway&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Treasures 2&quot; for the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube. In 2005, &quot;Xenophobe&quot; was included in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; on the PSP. In 2012, it was included in &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

<doc id="188418" wikidata="Q3174091" url="?curid=188418" title="Overconsumption (economics)">
<text>Overconsumption describes a situation where consumers overuse their available goods and services to where they can&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t want to, replenish or reuse them. In microeconomics, this is the point where the marginal cost of a consumer is greater than their marginal utility. The term overconsumption is quite controversial and does not necessarily have a single unifying definition. When used to refer to natural resources to the point where the environment is negatively affected, it is synonymous with the term overexploitation. However, when used in the broader economic sense, overconsumption can refer to all types of goods and services, including artificial ones, e.g., &quot;the overconsumption of alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning.&quot; Overconsumption is driven by several factors of the current global economy, including forces like consumerism, planned obsolescence, economic materialism, and other unsustainable business models, and can be contrasted with sustainable consumption.

Defining the amount of a natural resource required to be consumed for it to count as &quot;overconsumption&quot; is challenging because defining a sustainable capacity of the system requires accounting for many variables. A system&#x27;s total capacity occurs at regional and worldwide levels, which means that specific regions may have higher consumption levels of certain resources than others due to greater resources without overconsuming a resource. A long-term pattern of overconsumption in any region or ecological system can cause a reduction in natural resources, often resulting in environmental degradation. However, this is only when applying the word to environmental impacts. When used in an economic sense, this point is defined as when the marginal cost of a consumer is equal to their marginal utility. Gossen&#x27;s law of diminishing utility states that at this point, the consumer realizes the cost of consuming/purchasing another item/good is not worth the amount of utility (also known as happiness or satisfaction from the good) they&#x27;d receive, and therefore is not conducive to the consumer&#x27;s wellbeing.

When used in the environmental sense, the discussion of overconsumption often parallels population size, growth, and human development: more people demanding a higher quality of living requires greater extraction of resources, which causes subsequent environmental degradation, such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Currently, the inhabitants of high-wealth, &quot;developed&quot; nations consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, making up most of the human population (7.9 billion people). However, the developing world is a growing consumer market. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power. The Global South, which includes cities in Asia, America, and Africa, is expected to account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030, meaning that if current trends continue, relative consumption rates will shift more into these developing countries, whereas developed countries would start to plateau. Sustainable Development Goal 12, &quot;responsible consumption and production,&quot; is the main international policy tool with goals to abate the impact of overconsumption.

==Causes==
===Economic growth===
Economic growth is sometimes seen as a driver for overconsumption due to a growing economy requiring compounding amounts of resource input to sustain the growth. China is an example where this phenomenon has been observed readily. China’s GDP increased massively from 1978, and energy consumption has increased by 6-fold. By 1983, China’s consumption surpassed the biocapacity of their natural resources, leading to overconsumption. In the last 30–40 years, China has seen significant increases in its pollution, land degradation, and non-renewable resource depletion, which aligns with its considerable economic growth. It is unknown if other rapidly developing nations will see similar trends in resource overconsumption.

The Worldwatch Institute said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global biosphere. The State of the World 2005 report said the two countries&#x27; high economic growth exposed the reality of severe pollution. The report states that
The world&#x27;s ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe, and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.

In 2019, a warning on the climate crisis signed by 11,000 scientists from over 150 nations said economic growth is the driving force behind the &quot;excessive extraction of materials and overexploitation of ecosystems&quot; and that this &quot;must be quickly curtailed to maintain long-term sustainability of the biosphere.&quot; Also in 2019, the &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot; published by the United Nations&#x27; Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which found that up to one million species of plants and animals are at risk of extinction from human activity, asserted that

A key element of more sustainable future policies is the evolution of global financial and economic systems to build a global sustainable economy, steering away from the current limited paradigm of economic growth.In addition, globalization has amplified resource overuse as developing economies serve as manufacturing hubs for wealthier nations. This results in an &quot;outsourcing&quot; of pollution and resource depletion, with developed countries benefiting from consumption while production-related ecological damage accumulates elsewhere.

Philip Cafaro, professor of philosophy at the School of Global Environmental Sustainability at Colorado State University, wrote in 2022 that a scientific consensus has emerged which demonstrates that humanity is on the precipice of unleashing a major extinction event, and that a major driver of this is a &quot;rapidly growing human economy.&quot;

While often seen as a solution, technology can paradoxically contribute to increased resource use. The Jevons Paradox suggests that improvements in energy efficiency lead to greater overall consumption rather than reduced demand. For example, while China has invested heavily in renewable energy, overall energy demand continues to rise due to economic expansion, offsetting sustainability gains. Furthermore, culturally, economic growth has fostered materialism and consumerism as indicators of success, further exacerbating overconsumption. Advertising, planned obsolescence, and fast economic cycles create a continuous push for higher consumption, making it challenging to curb unsustainable resource use.

Thus, while economic growth is often seen as a marker of progress, it comes at a significant environmental cost. Without structural changes in global monetary policies, consumer behavior, and production models, overconsumption will likely continue accelerating alongside economic expansion.

===Consumerism===
Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consumes. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology, transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services, and other utilities. When the resources required to produce these goods and services are depleted beyond a reasonable level, it can be considered to be overconsumption.

Because developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, the trends happening in these nations are of special interest. One prominent example is China&#x27;s economic reforms in the late 1970s, in which the previously economically isolated state opened to foreign investment. Some argue that this economic revolution&#x27;s outcome was most significantly influenced by foreign consumer economies, while others focus on China&#x27;s internal market developments. Regardless, there as been much interest placed upon China&#x27;s economic, political, and social shift towards consumerism.

According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption, regardless of income lie in food, beverage, clothing, and footwear. As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world were the United States, Japan, Germany, China, and France.

Planned and perceived obsolescence is an important factor that explains why some overconsumption of consumer products exists. This factor of the production revolves around designing products with the intent to be discarded after a short period of time. Perceived obsolescence is prevalent within the fashion and technology industries. Through this technique, products are made obsolete and replaced on a semi-regular basis. Frequent new launches of technology or fashion lines can be seen as a form of marketing-induced perceived obsolescence. Products designed to break after a certain period of time or use would be considered to be planned obsolescence.

===Affluence===

According to a 2020 paper written by a team of scientists titled &quot;Scientists&#x27; warning on affluence&quot;, the entrenchment of &quot;capitalist, growth-driven economic systems&quot; since World War II gave rise to increasing affluence along with &quot;enormous increases in inequality, financial instability, resource consumption and environmental pressures on vital earth support systems.&quot; And the world&#x27;s wealthiest citizens, referred to as &quot;super-affluent consumers . . . which overlap with powerful fractions of the capitalist class,&quot; are the most responsible for environmental impacts through their consumption patterns worldwide.

Any sustainable social and environmental pathways must include transcending paradigms fixated on economic growth and also reducing, not simply &quot;greening&quot;, the overconsumption of the super-affluent, the authors contend, and propose adopting either reformist policies which can be implemented within a capitalist framework such as wealth redistribution through taxation (in particular eco-taxes), green investments, basic income guarantees and reduced work hours to accomplish this, or looking to more radical approaches associated with degrowth, eco-socialism and eco-anarchism, which would &quot;entail a shift beyond capitalism and/or current centralised states.&quot;

In other words, the concentration of wealth allows the affluent to shape policies that maintain consumption-driven economies, limiting systemic change. A 2020 Oxfam-SEI report found that the top 10% of earners contribute over half of global carbon emissions, while the wealthiest 1% emit more than double the poorest 50% combined. While green technologies offer solutions, the Jevons Paradox suggests efficiency gains often lead to increased overall consumption rather than reductions. Thus, tackling affluence-driven overconsumption requires progressive taxation on high-carbon activities, curbing luxury emissions, and shifting economic priorities from GDP growth to sustainability. Without intervention, extreme resource use by the wealthiest will continue to undermine global sustainability efforts.

==Effects==
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet&#x27;s carrying capacity. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long-term carrying capacity of its environment (ecological overshoot) and subsequent resource depletion, environmental degradation and reduced ecosystem health. In 2020 multinational team of scientists published a study, saying that overconsumption is the biggest threat to sustainability. According to the study, a drastic lifestyle change is necessary for solving the ecological crisis. According to one of the authors Julia Steinberger: “To protect ourselves from the worsening climate crisis, we must reduce inequality and challenge the notion that riches, and those who possess them, are inherently good.” The research was published on the site of the World Economic Forum. The leader of the forum professor Klaus Schwab, calls to a &quot;great reset of capitalism&quot;.

A 2020 study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot;, in which both population growth and deforestation were used as proxies for total resource consumption, warns that if consumption continues at the current rate for the next several decades, it can trigger a full or almost full extinction of humanity. The study says that &quot;while violent events, such as global war or natural catastrophic events, are of immediate concern to everyone, a relatively slow consumption of the planetary resources may be not perceived as strongly as a mortal danger for the human civilization.&quot; To avoid it humanity should pass from a civilization dominated by the economy to a &quot;cultural society&quot; that &quot;privileges the interest of the ecosystem above the individual interest of its components, but eventually in accordance with the overall communal interest.&quot;
The scale of modern life&#x27;s overconsumption can lead to a decline in economy and an increase in financial instability. Some argue that overconsumption enables the existence of an &quot;overclass&quot;, while others disagree with the role of overconsumption in class inequality. Population, Development, and Poverty all coincide with overconsumption; how they interplay with each other is complex. Because of this complexity it is difficult to determine the role of consumption in terms of economic inequality.
In the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources and in the worst case a Malthusian catastrophe. Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute, has said: &quot;It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption. Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode.&quot;

As of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world&#x27;s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percentage of the world&#x27;s population, this number can only rise. According to Sierra Club’s Dave Tilford, &quot;With less than 5 percent of world population, the U.S. uses one-third of the world’s paper, a quarter of the world’s oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper.&quot; According to BBC, a World Bank study has found that &quot;Americans produce 16.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita every year. By comparison, only 0.1 tonnes of the greenhouse gas is generated in Ethiopia per inhabitant.&quot;

A 2021 study published in &quot;Frontiers in Conservation Science&quot; posits that aggregate consumption growth will continue into the near future and perhaps beyond, largely due to increasing affluence and population growth. The authors argue that &quot;there is no way—ethically or otherwise (barring extreme and unprecedented increases in human mortality)—to avoid rising human numbers and the accompanying overconsumption&quot;, although they do say that the negative impacts of overconsumption can perhaps be diminished by implementing human rights policies to lower fertility rates and decelerate current consumption patterns.

=== Effects on health ===
A report from the Lancet Commission says the same. The experts write: &quot;Until now, undernutrition and obesity have been seen as polar opposites of either too few or too many calories,&quot; &quot;In reality, they are both driven by the same unhealthy, inequitable food systems, underpinned by the same political economy that is single-focused on economic growth, and ignores the negative health and equity outcomes. Climate change has the same story of profits and power,&quot;. Obesity was a medical problem for people who overconsumed food and worked too little already in ancient Rome, and its impact slowly grew through history. As to 2012, mortality from obesity was 3 times larger than from hunger, reaching 2.8 million people per year by 2017

Just as overconsumption of food has led to widespread health crises such as obesity and metabolic diseases, the overconsumption of fossil fuels has created an equally dire threat to both human health and the environment. Both forms of overconsumption stem from economic models that prioritize growth and short-term gains over long-term sustainability. While industrialized food systems have fueled rising obesity rates, the relentless burning of fossil fuels—especially coal—has exacerbated air pollution, climate change, and public health risks on a global scale.

The overconsumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal, has profound implications for both environmental and human health. Burning fossil fuels releases a variety of harmful pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), particulate matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). These emissions contribute to environmental issues such as acid rain, smog, and climate change, while also posing significant health risks. In addition, exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from fossil fuel combustion is associated with respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and premature mortality. A 2021 study estimated that fossil fuel-related air pollution is responsible for over 10 million premature deaths annually worldwide. Coal-fired power plants are particularly detrimental, emitting toxic substances that adversely affect human health. Communities near these plants experience higher rates of asthma, lung disease, and other health issues.

In China, the extensive use of coal has led to severe air pollution, resulting in significant public health challenges. The country&#x27;s reliance on coal-fired power plants has been linked to increased respiratory illnesses and premature deaths.

Thus, addressing the health impacts of fossil fuel overconsumption necessitates a transition to cleaner energy sources, implementation of stricter emission regulations, and promotion of sustainable practices to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

=== Global estimates ===
In 2010, the International Resource Panel published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health, human health and resource depletion. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food, and energy-using products causes the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.

According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, human consumption, with current policy, by the year 2100 will be seven times bigger than in the year 2010.

==Footprint==


The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint. The term &quot;ecological footprint&quot; refers to the &quot;resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.&quot; Currently, China, for instance, has a per person ecological footprint roughly half the size of the US, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the US. It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double. Other metrics have been formed to reflect different factors in calculating a country&#x27;s carbon footprint. These include carbon intensity, which tracks carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, of which China had 0.37 kilograms and the US had 0.25 kilograms in 2018, as well as consumption-based emissions, which attribute carbon emissions to the country in which a product is consumed, rather than the country in which it is produced. Accounting for such also has China at a higher emissions percentage, 25%, compared to the US&#x27;s 16%.

Humans, their prevailing growth of demands for livestock and other domestic animals, has added overshoot through domestic animal breeding, keeping, and consumption, especially with the environmentally destructive industrial livestock production. 
Globalization and modernization have brought Western consumer cultures to countries like China and India, including meat-intensive diets which are supplanting traditional plant-based diets. Between 166 to more than 200 billion land and aquatic animals are consumed by a global population of over 7 billion annually. A 2018 study published in &quot;Science&quot; postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity. Meat consumption needs to be reduced in order to make agriculture sustainable by up to 90% according to a 2018 study published in &quot;Nature&quot;.

With the developments in consumerism and growing demands for consumption otherwise, the concept of the climate debt has arisen. The term refers to the idea that larger countries have, in broad terms, caused more damage to the environment than their share of the world. These larger countries are often centered around consumer societies and, as a result, are the biggest producers and consumers, meaning that they contribute to pollution from the beginning (production) of a products life, all the way to the end (consumption and disposal). Additionally, such societies are built upon economic growth, which begets more pollution from consumerism. The term also encapsulates the related idea that developing countries are the places that are the most affected by climate change, both in their effects and their ability to respond to and recover from those effects. In total, some argue that there is a severely one sided disparity between nations that create many forms of pollution and those who create very little pollution, which aligns opposite to the disparity between nations who are affected by the pollution and those who are more well-supplied to handle it.

Action upon repaying climate debt are proposed to be through reduction of emissions from the more developed, consumerist countries that are the biggest carbon emitters, which includes efforts to understand and heavily limit the extent to which they should reasonably emit greenhouse gasses in relation to their geographical and political boundaries. Additionally, action is proposed to be taken by supporting the affected underdeveloped countries by financial, industrial, and environmentally cleansing means.

56% of respondents to a 2022 climate survey support a carbon budget system to limit the most climate-damaging consumption (62% of those under 30).

==Counteractions==
The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming depleted. From a capitalistic point of view, less consumption has negative effects on economies and so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates but also allow for new industries, such as renewable energy and recycling technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burdens. Some movements think that a reduction in consumption in some cases can benefit the economy and society. They think that a fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: anti-consumerism, freeganism, green economics, ecological economics, degrowth, frugality, downshifting, simple living, minimalism, the slow movement, and thrifting.

Many consider the final target of the movements as arriving to a steady-state economy in which the rate of consumption is optimal for health and environment.

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the number of goods we consume. The Freecycle Network is a network of people in one&#x27;s community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.

Other researchers and movements such as the Zeitgeist Movement suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of efficiency, collaboration and locality in production as well as effective sharing, increased modularity, sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.
Solutions offered include consumers using market forces to influence businesses towards more sustainable manufacturing and products.

Another way to reduce consumption is to slow population growth by improving family planning services worldwide. In developing countries, more than 200 million women do not have adequate access. Women&#x27;s empowerment in these countries will also result in smaller families.

<text>John Douglas (14 July 1721 – 18 May 1807) was a Scottish scholar and Anglican bishop.

==Early life and education==

Douglas was born at Pittenweem, Fife, the second son of shopkeeper Archibald Douglas, and Isabel, daughter of Robert Melvill of Carsendor. His father was later Wagon-Master-General to the British Forces and died at the Battle of Dettingen in Frankfurt in 1743. Douglas was educated at Dunbar, East Lothian, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained his M.A. degree in 1743.

==Career==

As chaplain to the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards, he was at the Battle of Fontenoy, 1745. He then returned to Balliol as a Snell Exhibitioner; became Vicar of High Ercall, Shropshire in 1750; a Canon of Windsor, namely Canon of the Eleventh Stall at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor (1762–1776); a member of the chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1777; Bishop of Carlisle in 1787; Dean of Windsor in 1788; and Bishop of Salisbury in 1791. As Bishop of Salisbury he was also &quot;ex officio&quot; Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. Other honours were the degree of DD (1758), and those of Fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.

Douglas was not an outstanding churchman. He preferred to stay in London in winter and at fashionable watering places in summer. Under the patronage of the Earl of Bath he entered into several literary controversies. He defended John Milton against William Lauder&#x27;s charge of plagiarism (1750), and attacked David Hume&#x27;s rationalism in his &quot;Letter on the Criterion of Miracles&quot; (1754); he went on to criticise the followers of John Hutchinson in his &quot;Apology for the Clergy&quot; (1755). He also edited Captain Cook&#x27;s &quot;Journals&quot;, and Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; and &quot;Letters&quot; (1763). A volume of &quot;Miscellaneous Works&quot;; prefaced by a short biography, was published posthumously in 1820.

==Family==

In 1752, Douglas married Dorothea Pershouse, daughter of William Pershouse (or Persehouse) of Reynolds Hall, Stafford, but she died within three months. In 1765, he married secondly Elizabeth Rooke, daughter of Henry Brudenell Rooke. They had one son, Rev. William Douglas (1768–1819), Archdeacon of Wilts from 1799–1804.

A sister of his kept the British Coffee House, one of London&#x27;s significant meeting places, especially for Scotsmen.

<text>Nathaniel Lardner (6 June 1684 – 24 July 1768) was an English Presbyterian minister and theologian.

== Life ==
Lardner was born in Hawkhurst, Kent in 1684. He was the elder son of Richard Lardner (1653–1740), an independent minister, and of a daughter of Nathaniel Collyer or Collier, a Southwark tradesman. His sister Elizabeth married Daniel Neal, who studied with Lardner in Utrecht.

After studying for the Presbyterian ministry in London, and also at Utrecht and Leiden, he took license as a preacher in 1709, but was not successful. In 1713, he entered the family of Lady Treby, widow of Sir George Treby, as tutor and domestic chaplain, where he remained until 1721. In 1724 he was appointed to deliver the Tuesday evening lecture in the Presbyterian chapel, Old Jewry, London, and in 1729 he became assistant minister to the Presbyterian congregation in Crutched Friars. He geraduated with a degree of DD from Marischal College in Aberdeen in 1743. He died in Hawkhurst on 24 July 1768.

== Works ==
An anonymous volume of &quot;Memoirs&quot; appeared in 1769; and a life by Andrew Kippis is prefixed to the edition of the &quot;Works of Lardner&quot;, first published in 1788. The full title of his principal work—a work which, although now out of date, entitles its author to be regarded as the founder of modern critical research in the field of early Christian literature—is &quot;The Credibility of the Gospel History; or the Principal Facts of the New Testament confirmed by Passages of Ancient Authors, who were contemporary with our Saviour or his Apostles, or lived near their time&quot;. Part 1, in 2 octavo volumes, appeared in 1727; the publication of part 2, in 12 octavo volumes, began in 1733 and ended in 1755. In 1730 there was a second edition of part 1, and the Additions and Alterations were also published separately. A Supplement, otherwise entitled &quot;A History of the Apostles and Evangelists, Writers of the New Testament&quot;, was added in 3 volumes (1756–1757), and reprinted in 1760.

Other works by Lardner are &quot;A Large Collection of Ancient Jewish and Heathen Testimonies to the Truth of the Christian Revelation, with Notes and Observations&quot; (4 volumes, quarto, 1764–1767); &quot;The History of the Heretics of the two first Centuries after Christ&quot;, published posthumously in 1780; and a considerable number of occasional sermons.

== Theology ==
Lardner made a case against the subordinationism of Samuel Clarke in which the eternal Logos unites with a human body in the man Jesus, opposed to the Trinitarian view. Lardner went further to argue that the New Testament does not teach that Jesus or any element within him pre-existed Mary&#x27;s pregnancy. According to Lardner the Logos of John 1:1, was to be understood as a divine attribute, which metaphorically “became flesh” in the man Jesus, and other traditional pre-existence proof texts are interpreted in ways consistent with Christ&#x27;s not existing before his conception. Lardner analyzes the use of “spirit” in the Bible and concludes that it refers to God, or to various of God&#x27;s properties, actions, or gifts. This view was essentially Socinian.

==Networking==
He was in close relations with Thomas Secker, exchanged letters with Edward Waddington, and had a large literary correspondence with continental scholars, and with the ministers of New England. Among his English dissenting correspondents were John Brekell, Samuel Chandler, Philip Doddridge, and Henry Miles. He corresponded also with Thomas Morgan the Welsh deist and moral philosopher, of very different views but who found Lardner impartial.

<doc id="188426" wikidata="Q1229640" url="?curid=188426" title="Survivalism">
<text>Survivalism is a social movement of individuals or groups (called survivalists, doomsday preppers or preppers) who proactively prepare for emergencies, such as natural disasters, and other disasters causing disruption to social order (that is, civil disorder) caused by political or economic crises. Preparations may anticipate short-term scenarios or long-term, on scales ranging from personal adversity, to local disruption of services, to international or global catastrophe. There is no bright line dividing general emergency preparedness from in the form of survivalism (these concepts are a spectrum), but a qualitative distinction is often recognized whereby preppers/survivalists prepare especially extensively because they have higher estimations of the risk of catastrophes happening. Nonetheless, prepping can be as limited as preparing for a personal emergency (such as losing one&#x27;s job, storm damage to one&#x27;s home, or getting lost in wooded terrain), or it can be as extensive as a personal identity or collective identity with a devoted lifestyle. 

Survivalism emphasises self-reliance, stockpiling supplies, and gaining survival knowledge and skills. The stockpiling of supplies is itself a wide spectrum, from survival kits (ready bags, bug-out bags) to entire bunkers in extreme cases. 

Survivalists often acquire first aid and emergency medical/paramedic/field medicine training, self-defense training (martial arts, ad hoc weaponry, firearm safety), and improvisation/self-sufficiency training, and they often build structures (survival retreats, underground shelters, etc.) or modify/fortify existing structures etc. that may help them survive a catastrophic failure of society.

Use of the term &quot;survivalist&quot; dates from the early 1980s.

==History==
===1930s to 1950s===
The origins of the modern survivalist movement in the United Kingdom and the United States include government policies, threats of nuclear warfare, religious beliefs, and writers who warned of social or economic collapse in both non-fiction and apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction.

The Cold War era civil defense programs promoted public atomic bomb shelters, personal fallout shelters, and training for children, such as the Duck and Cover films. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has long directed its members to store a year&#x27;s worth of food for themselves and their families in preparation for such possibilities, and the current teaching advises beginning with at least a three-month supply.

The Great Depression that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929 is cited by survivalists as an example of the need to be prepared.

===1960s===
The increased inflation rate in the 1960s, the US monetary devaluation, the continued concern over a possible nuclear exchange between the US and the Soviet Union, and perceived increasing vulnerability of urban centers to supply shortages and other systems failures caused a number of primarily conservative and libertarian thinkers to promote individual preparations. Harry Browne began offering seminars on how to survive a monetary collapse in 1967, with Don Stephens (an architect) providing input on how to build and equip a remote survival retreat. He gave a copy of his original &quot;Retreater&#x27;s Bibliography&quot; to each seminar participant.

Articles on the subject appeared in small-distribution libertarian publications such as &quot;The Innovator&quot; and &quot;Atlantis Quarterly&quot;. It was during this period that Robert D. Kephart began publishing &quot;Inflation Survival Letter&quot; (later renamed &quot;Personal Finance&quot;). For several years the newsletter included a continuing section on personal preparedness written by Stephens. It promoted expensive seminars around the US on similar cautionary topics. Stephens participated, along with James McKeever and other defensive investing, &quot;hard money&quot; advocates.

===1970s===
In the next decade Howard Ruff warned about socio-economic collapse in his 1974 book &quot;Famine and Survival in America&quot;. Ruff&#x27;s book was published during a period of rampant inflation in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. Most of the elements of survivalism can be found there, including advice on food storage. The book championed the claim that precious metals, such as gold and silver, have an intrinsic worth that makes them more usable in the event of a socioeconomic collapse than fiat currency. Ruff later published milder variations of the same themes, such as &quot;How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years&quot;, a best-seller in 1979.

Firearms instructor and survivalist Colonel Jeff Cooper wrote on hardening retreats against small arms fire. In an article titled &quot;Notes on Tactical Residential Architecture&quot; in Issue #30 of P.S. Letter (April 1982), Cooper suggested using the &quot;Vauban Principle&quot;, whereby projecting bastion corners would prevent miscreants from being able to approach a retreat&#x27;s exterior walls in any blind spots. Depending on the size of the group needing shelter, design elements of traditional European castle architecture, and Chinese Fujian Tulou and Mexican walled courtyard houses, have been suggested for survival retreats.
Bruce D. Clayton and Joel Skousen have both written extensively on integrating fallout shelters into retreat homes, but they put less emphasis on ballistic protection and exterior perimeter security than Cooper and Rawles.

Other newsletters and books followed in the wake of Ruff&#x27;s first publication. In 1975, Kurt Saxon began publishing a monthly tabloid-size newsletter called &quot;The Survivor&quot;, which combined Saxon&#x27;s editorials with reprints of 19th century and early 20th century writings on various pioneer skills and old technologies. Kurt Saxon used the term &quot;survivalist&quot; to describe the movement, and he claims to have coined the term.

In the previous decade, preparedness consultant, survival bookseller, and California-based author Don Stephens popularized the term &quot;retreater&quot; to describe those in the movement, referring to preparations to leave cities for remote havens or survival retreats should society break down. In 1976, before moving to the Inland Northwest, he and his wife authored and published &quot;The Survivor&#x27;s Primer &amp; Up-dated Retreater&#x27;s Bibliography&quot;.

For a time in the 1970s, the terms &quot;survivalist&quot; and &quot;retreater&quot; were used interchangeably. While the term &quot;retreater&quot; eventually fell into disuse, many who subscribed to it saw retreating as the more rational approach to conflict-avoidance and remote &quot;invisibility&quot;. &quot;Survivalism&quot;, on the other hand, tended to take on a more media-sensationalized, combative, &quot;shoot-it-out-with-the-looters&quot; image.

One newsletter deemed by some to be one of the most important on survivalism and survivalist retreats in the 1970s was the &quot;Personal Survival (&quot;P.S.&quot;) Letter&quot; (circa 1977–1982). Published by Mel Tappan, who also authored the books &quot;Survival Guns&quot; and &quot;Tappan on Survival&quot;. The newsletter included columns from Tappan himself and notable survivalists such as Jeff Cooper, Al J Venter, Bruce D. Clayton, Nancy Mack Tappan, J.B. Wood (author of several gunsmithing books), Karl Hess, Janet Groene (travel author), Dean Ing, Reginald Bretnor, and C.G. Cobb (author of &quot;Bad Times Primer&quot;). The majority of the newsletter revolved around selecting, constructing, and logistically equipping survival retreats. Following Tappan&#x27;s death in 1980, Karl Hess took over publishing the newsletter, eventually renaming it &quot;Survival Tomorrow&quot;.

In 1980, John Pugsley published the book &quot;The Alpha Strategy&quot;. It was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for nine weeks in 1981. After 28 years in circulation, &quot;The Alpha Strategy&quot; remains popular with survivalists, and is considered a standard reference on stocking food and household supplies as a hedge against inflation and future shortages.

In addition to hardcopy newsletters, in the 1970s survivalists established their first online presence with BBS and Usenet forums dedicated to survivalism and survival retreats.

===1980s===
Further interest in the survivalist movement peaked in the early 1980s, with Howard Ruff&#x27;s book &quot;How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years&quot; and the publication in 1980 of &quot;Life After Doomsday&quot; by Bruce D. Clayton. Clayton&#x27;s book, coinciding with a renewed arms race between the United States and Soviet Union, marked a shift in emphasis in preparations made by survivalists away from economic collapse, famine, and energy shortages—which were concerns in the 1970s—to nuclear war. In the early 1980s, science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle was an editor and columnist for &quot;Survive&quot;, a survivalist magazine, and was influential in the survivalist movement. Ragnar Benson&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;Live Off The Land In The City And Country&quot; suggested rural survival retreats as both a preparedness measure and conscious lifestyle change.

===1990s===
Interest in the movement picked up during the Clinton administration due in part to the debate surrounding the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and the ban&#x27;s subsequent passage in 1994. The interest peaked again in 1999 triggered by fears of the Y2K computer bug. Before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming code to mitigate the effects, some writers such as Gary North, Ed Yourdon, James Howard Kunstler, and investments&#x27; advisor Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were &quot;Boston on Y2K&quot; (1998) by Kenneth W. Royce, and Mike Oehler&#x27;s &quot;The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K&quot;. Oehler is an underground living advocate, who also authored &quot;The $50 and Up Underground House Book&quot;, which has long been popular in survivalist circles.

===2000s===
Another wave of survivalism began after the September 11, 2001, attacks and subsequent bombings in Bali, Madrid, and London. This resurgence of interest in survivalism appears to be as strong as the 1970s era focus on the topic. The fear of war, avian influenza, energy shortages, environmental disasters, and global climate change, coupled with economic uncertainty and the apparent vulnerability of humanity after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, have increased interest in survivalism topics.

Many books were published in the wake of the Great Recession from 2008 and later offering survival advice for various potential disasters, ranging from an energy shortage and crash to nuclear or biological terrorism. In addition to the 1970s-era books, blogs and Internet forums are popular ways of disseminating survivalism information. Online survival websites and blogs discuss survival vehicles, survival retreats, emerging threats, and list survivalist groups.

In both his book &quot;Rawles on Retreats and Relocation&quot; and in his survivalist novel, &quot;&quot;, James Wesley Rawles describes in great detail retreat groups &quot;upgrading&quot; brick or other masonry houses to that of a security compound with steel reinforced window shutters and doors, excavating anti-vehicular ditches, installing gate locks, constructing concertina wire obstacles and fougasses, and setting up listening post/observation posts (LP/OPs.) Rawles is a proponent of including a mantrap foyer at survival retreats, an architectural element that he calls a &quot;crushroom&quot;.

Economic troubles emerging from the credit collapse triggered by the 2007 US subprime mortgage lending crisis and global grain shortages prompted a wider cross-section of the populace to prepare.

The advent of H1N1 Swine Flu in 2009 piqued interest in survivalism, significantly boosting sales of preparedness books and making survivalism more mainstream.
===2010s===
Television shows such as the National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;Doomsday Preppers&quot; emerged to capitalize on what &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; entertainment contributor Mary McNamara dubbed &quot;today&#x27;s zeitgeist of fear of a world-changing event&quot;. 

After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the &quot;prepper&quot; community worried they would face public scrutiny after it was revealed the perpetrator&#x27;s mother was a survivalist. Earlier that year, a double homicide was committed by survivalist Peter Keller, who admitted to killing his wife and daughter in a video diary. He killed himself while evading capture in a bunker he built in Rattlesnake Ridge in King County, Washington. Both were cited by &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; as examples of survivalism being tied to violence.

===2020s===
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization in early 2020 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present), survivalism has received renewed interest, even by those who are not traditionally considered preppers.

==Outline of scenarios and outlooks==
Survivalism is approached by its adherents in different ways, depending on their circumstances, mindsets, and particular concerns for the future. The following are characterizations, although most (if not all) survivalists fit into more than one category:

;Safety-preparedness-oriented
While some survivalists believe in long-term viability of Western civilization, they learn principles and techniques needed for surviving life-threatening situations that can occur at any time and place. They prepare for such calamities that could result in physical harm or requiring immediate attention or defense from threats. These disasters could be biotic or abiotic. Survivalists combat disasters by attempting to prevent and mitigate damage caused by these factors.

;Wilderness survival emphasis

This group stresses being able to stay alive for indefinite periods in life-threatening wilderness scenarios, including plane crashes, shipwrecks, and being lost in the woods. Concerns are: thirst, hunger, climate, terrain, health, stress, and fear. The rule of 3 is often emphasized as common practice for wilderness survival. The rule states that a human can survive:
3 minutes without air,
3 hours without shelter,
3 days without water,
3 weeks without food.

;Self-defense-driven
This group focuses on surviving brief encounters of violent activity, including personal protection and its legal ramifications, danger awareness, John Boyd&#x27;s cycle (also known as the OODA loop—observe, orient, decide and act), Combatives, martial arts, unarmed combat, Melee weapons, self-defense tactics and tools (both lethal and non-lethal). These survivalist tactics are often firearm-oriented, in order to ensure a method of defense against attackers or home invasion.

;Natural disaster, brief
This group consists of people who live in tornado, hurricane, flood, wildfire, earthquake or heavy snowfall-prone areas and want to be prepared for possible emergencies. They invest in material for fortifying structures and tools for rebuilding and constructing temporary shelters. While assuming the long-term continuity of society, some may have invested in a custom-built shelter, food, water, medicine, and enough supplies to get by until contact with the rest of the world resumes following a natural emergency.

;Natural disaster, prolonged
This group is concerned with weather cycles of 2–10 years, which have happened historically and can cause crop failures. They might stock several tons of food per family member and have a heavy-duty greenhouse with canned non-hybrid seeds.

;Natural disaster, indefinite/multi-generational

This group considers an end to society as it exists today under possible scenarios including global warming, global cooling, environmental degradation, warming or cooling of gulf stream waters, or a period of severely cold winters caused by a supervolcano, an asteroid strike, or nuclear warfare.

;Bio-chem scenario
This group is concerned with the spread of fatal diseases, biological agents, and nerve gases, including COVID-19, swine flu, &quot;E. coli&quot;, botulism, dengue fever, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, SARS, rabies, Hantavirus, anthrax, plague, cholera, HIV, ebola, Marburg virus, Lassa virus, sarin, and VX. In response, they might own NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) full-face respirators, polyethylene coveralls, PVC boots, nitrile gloves, plastic sheeting and duct tape.

;Monetary disaster investors

Monetary disaster investors believe the Federal Reserve system is fundamentally flawed. Newsletters suggest hard assets of gold and silver bullion, coins, and other precious-metal-oriented investments such as mining shares. Survivalists prepare for paper money to become worthless through hyperinflation. As of late 2009 this is a popular scenario. Many will stockpile bullion in preparation for a market crash that would destroy the value of global currencies.

;Biblical eschatologist
These individuals study End Times prophecy and believe that one of various scenarios might occur in their lifetime. While some Christians (and even people of other religions) believe that the Rapture will follow a period of Tribulation, others believe that the Rapture is imminent and will precede the Tribulation (&quot;Pre-Trib Rapture&quot;). There is a wide range of beliefs and attitudes in this group. They run the gamut from pacifist to armed camp, and from having no food stockpiles (leaving their sustenance up to God&#x27;s providence) to storing decades&#x27; worth of food. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are counseled to store up to two years&#x27; worth of food and supplies to aid in the event of a natural disaster or long-term economic hardship, such as unemployment.

;Peak-oil doomers
This group believes that peak oil is a near term threat to Western civilization, and take appropriate measures, usually involving relocation to an agriculturally self-sufficient survival retreat.

;Legal-continuity-oriented
This group has a primary concern with maintaining some form of legal system and social cohesion after a breakdown in the technical infrastructure of society. They are interested in works like &quot;The Postman&quot; by David Brin, Lewis Dartnell&#x27;s &quot;The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch&quot;, or Marcus B. Hatfield&#x27;s &quot;The American Common Law: The Customary Law of the American Nation&quot;.

==Common preparations==
Common preparations include the creation of a clandestine or defensible retreat, haven, or bug out location (BOL) in addition to the stockpiling of non-perishable food, water (i.e. using water canisters), water-purification equipment, clothing, seed, firewood, defensive or hunting weapons, ammunition, agricultural equipment, and medical supplies. Some survivalists do not make such extensive preparations, and simply incorporate a &quot;Be Prepared&quot; outlook into their everyday life.

A bag of gear, often referred to as a &quot;bug out bag&quot; (BOB) or &quot;get out of dodge&quot; (G.O.O.D.) kit, can be created which contains basic necessities and useful items. It can be of any size, weighing as much as the user is able to carry.

===Changing concerns and preparations===
Survivalists&#x27; concerns and preparations have changed over the years. During the 1970s, fears were economic collapse, hyperinflation, and famine. Preparations included food storage and survival retreats in the country which could be farmed. Some survivalists stockpiled precious metals and barterable goods (such as common-caliber ammunition) because they assumed that paper currency would become worthless. During the early 1980s, nuclear war became a common fear, and some survivalists constructed fallout shelters.

In 1999, many people purchased electric generators, water purifiers, and several months or even years worth of food in anticipation of widespread power outages because of the Y2K computer-bug. Between 2013 and 2019, many people purchased those same items in anticipation of widespread chaos following the 2016 election and the events leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instead of moving or making such preparations at home, many people also make plans to remain in their current locations until an actual breakdown occurs, when they will—in survivalist parlance—&quot;bug out&quot; or &quot;get out of Dodge&quot; to a safer location.

===Religious beliefs===
Other survivalists have more specialized concerns, often related to an adherence to apocalyptic religious beliefs.

Some evangelical Christians hold to an interpretation of Bible prophecy known as the posttribulation rapture, in which the world will have to go through a seven-year period of war and global dictatorship known as the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot;. Jim McKeever helped popularize survival preparations among this branch of evangelical Christians with his 1978 book &quot;Christians Will Go Through the Tribulation, and How To Prepare For It&quot;.

Similarly, some Catholics are preppers, based on Marian apparitions which speak of a great chastisement of humanity by God, particularly those associated with Our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of Akita (which states &quot;fire will fall from the sky and will wipe out a great part of humanity&quot;).

===Mainstream emergency preparations===
People who are not part of survivalist groups or apolitically oriented religious groups also make preparations for emergencies. This can include (depending on the location) preparing for earthquakes, floods, power outages, blizzards, avalanches, wildfires, terrorist attacks, nuclear power plant accidents, hazardous material spills, tornadoes, and hurricanes. These preparations can be as simple as following Red Cross and U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommendations by keeping a first aid kit, shovel, and extra clothes in the car, or by maintaining a small kit of emergency supplies, containing emergency food, water, a space blanket, and other essentials.

Mainstream economist and financial adviser Barton Biggs is a proponent of preparedness. In his 2008 book &quot;Wealth, War and Wisdom&quot;, Biggs has a gloomy outlook for the economic future, and suggests that investors take survivalist measures. In the book, Biggs recommends that his readers should &quot;assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure.&quot; He goes so far as to recommend setting up survival retreats: &quot;Your safe haven must be self-sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food,&quot; Mr. Biggs writes. &quot;It should be well-stocked with seed, fertilizer, canned food, medicine, clothes, etc. Think &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. Even in America and Europe, there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down.&quot;

For global catastrophic risks the costs of food storage become impractical for most of the population and for some such catastrophes conventional agriculture would not function due to the loss of a large fraction of sunlight (e.g. during nuclear winter or a supervolcano). In such situations, alternative food is necessary, which is converting natural gas and wood fiber to human edible food.

==Survivalist terminology==

Survivalists maintain their group identity and subculture by using specialized terminology/slang etc not generally understood outside their circles. They often use government/military/paramilitary acronyms such as OPSEC and SOP, and terminology common among adherents to civilian gun culture or the peak oil scenario. They also use terms that are unique to their own survivalist cells/factions etc or even use street slang etc.

==Media portrayal==
Despite a lull following the end of the Cold War, survivalism has gained greater attention in recent years, resulting in increased popularity of the survivalist lifestyle, and increased scrutiny. A National Geographic show interviewing survivalists, &quot;Doomsday Preppers&quot; (2011–2014), was a &quot;ratings bonanza&quot; and &quot;the network&#x27;s most-watched series&quot;, yet Neil Genzlinger in &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it an &quot;absurd excess on display and at what an easy target the prepper worldview is for ridicule,&quot; noting, &quot;how offensively anti-life these shows are, full of contempt for humankind.&quot; Nevertheless, this show occupies a key position in the discourse on preppers.

===Perceived extremism===
In popular culture, survivalism has been associated with activities of the self-proclaimed &quot;militias&quot; in the United States and elsewhere. Some survivalists do take active defensive preparations that have roots and that involve small arms, and this aspect is sometimes emphasized by the mass media. Kurt Saxon is one proponent of this approach to armed survivalism.

The potential for social collapse is often cited as motivation for being well-armed. Thus, some non-militaristic survivalists have developed an unintended quasi-militaristic image.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in their &quot;If You See Something, Say Something&quot; campaign says that &quot;the public should report only suspicious behavior and situations...rather than beliefs, thoughts, ideas, expressions, associations, or speech...&quot;. However, it is alleged that a DHS list of the characteristics of potential domestic terrorists used in law enforcement training includes &quot;Survivalist literature (fictional books such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;One Second After&quot; are mentioned by name)&quot;, &quot;Self-sufficiency (stockpiling food, ammo, hand tools, medical supplies)&quot;, and &quot;Fear of economic collapse (buying gold and barter items)&quot;.

==Worldwide groups and organizations==
Individual survivalist preparedness and survivalist groups and forums—both formal and informal—are popular worldwide, most visibly in Australia, Austria (ÖWSGV), Belgium, Canada,
Spain, France, Germany (often organized under the guise of &quot;adventuresport&quot; clubs), Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, South Africa and the United States.

===Other related groups===
Adherents of the back-to-the-land movement inspired by Helen and Scott Nearing, sporadically popular in the United States in the 1930s and 1970s (exemplified by &quot;The Mother Earth News&quot; magazine), share many of the same interests in self-sufficiency and preparedness. Back-to-the-landers differ from most survivalists in that they have a greater interest in ecology and counterculture. Despite these differences, &quot;The Mother Earth News&quot; was widely read by survivalists and back-to-the-landers during that magazine&#x27;s early years, and there was some overlap between the two movements.

Anarcho-primitivists (often shortened to &quot;Anprim&quot;, &quot;An-Prim&quot;, or &quot;AnPrim&quot;) share many characteristics with survivalists, most notably predictions of a pending ecological disaster; one of the most famous An-Prims being Theodore Kaczynski. Writers such as Derrick Jensen argue that industrial civilization is not sustainable, and will therefore inevitably bring about its own collapse. Non-anarchist writers such as Daniel Quinn, Joseph Tainter, and Richard Manning also hold this view. Some members of the Men Going Their Own Way subculture also promote off-grid living and believe that modern society is no longer liveable.

==In popular culture==

Survivalism and survivalist themes have been fictionalized in print, film, and electronic media.

The movie and series &quot;Tremors&quot; show a prepper who actually killed a &quot;worm&quot; invading his emergency shelter with heavy small arms fire, and killing other worms with homemade grenades.

The 1983 film &quot;The Survivors&quot; starring Walter Matthau, Robin Williams and Jerry Reed, used survivalism as part of its plot. Michael Gross and Reba McEntire played a survivalist married couple in the 1990 film &quot;Tremors&quot; and its sequels. Both of these films were comedies. The 1988 film &quot;Distant Thunder&quot;, starring John Lithgow, concerned Vietnam War veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who, similarly to some survivalists, withdrew to the wilderness.

Several television shows such as &quot;Doomsday Castle&quot;, &quot;Doomsday Preppers&quot;, &quot;Survivorman&quot;, &quot;Man vs Wild&quot; &quot;Man, Woman, Wild&quot;,&quot; Alone&quot; and &quot;Naked and Afraid&quot; are based on the concept of survivalism.

<text>The Midland Railway (MR) was a railway company in the United Kingdom from 1844. The Midland was one of the largest railway companies in Britain in the early 20th century, and the largest employer in Derby, where it had its headquarters. It amalgamated with several other railways to create the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at grouping in 1923.

The Midland had a large network of lines emanating from Derby, stretching to London St Pancras, Manchester, Carlisle, Birmingham, and Bristol. It expanded as much through acquisitions as by building its own lines. It also operated ships from Heysham in Lancashire to Douglas and Belfast. A large amount of the Midland&#x27;s infrastructure remains in use and visible, such as the Midland Main Line and the Settle–Carlisle line, and some of its railway hotels still bear the name &quot;Midland Hotel&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
The Midland Railway originated from 1832 in Leicestershire / Nottinghamshire, with the purpose of serving the needs of local coal owners.
The company was formed on 10 May 1844 by the (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. xviii) which merged the Midland Counties Railway, the North Midland Railway, and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway joined two years later. These met at the Tri-Junct station at Derby, where the MR established its locomotive and later its carriage and wagon works.

Leading it were George Hudson from the North Midland, and John Ellis from the Midland Counties. James Allport from the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway found a place elsewhere in Hudson&#x27;s empire with the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, though he later returned.

The MR was in a commanding position having its Derby headquarters at the junctions of the two main routes from London to Scotland, by its connections to the London and Birmingham Railway in the south, and from York via the York and North Midland Railway in the north.

===Consolidation===
Almost immediately it took over the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway and the Erewash Valley Line in 1845, the latter giving access to the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire coalfields. It absorbed the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway in 1847, extending the Erewash Valley Line from the latter between Chesterfield and Trent Junction at Long Eaton, completed to Chesterfield in 1862, giving access to the coalfields that became its major source of income. Passengers from Sheffield continued to use Rotherham Masborough until a direct route was completed in 1870.

Meanwhile, it extended its influence into the Leicestershire coalfields, by buying the Leicester and Swannington Railway in 1846, and extending it to Burton in 1849.

===The South-West===

After the merger, London trains were carried on the shorter Midland Counties route. The former Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway was left with the traffic to Birmingham and Bristol, an important seaport. The original 1839 line from Derby had run to Hampton-in-Arden: the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway had built a terminus at Lawley Street in 1842, and on 1 May 1851 the MR started to run into Curzon Street.

The line south was the Birmingham and Bristol Railway, which reached Curzon Street via Camp Hill. These two lines had been formed by the merger of the standard gauge Birmingham and Gloucester Railway and the broad gauge Bristol and Gloucester Railway.

They met at Gloucester via a short loop of the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway. The change of gauge at Gloucester meant that everything had to be transferred between trains, creating chaos, and the C&amp;GWU was owned by the Great Western Railway, which wished to extend its network by taking over the Bristol to Birmingham route. While the two parties were bickering over the price, the MR&#x27;s John Ellis overheard two directors of the Birmingham and Bristol Railway on a London train discussing the business, and pledged that the MR would match anything the Great Western would offer.

Since it would have brought broad gauge into Curzon Street with the possibility of extending it to the Mersey, it was something that the other standard gauge lines wished to avoid, and they pledged to assist the MR with any losses it might incur. In the event all that was necessary was for the later LNWR to share Birmingham New Street with the Midland when it was opened in 1854, and Lawley Street became a goods depot.

===Eastern competition===
The MR controlled all the traffic to the North East and Scotland from London. The LNWR was progressing slowly through the Lake District, and there was pressure for a direct line from London to York. Permission had been gained for the Northern and Eastern Railway to run through Peterborough and Lincoln but it had barely reached Cambridge.

Two obvious extensions of the Midland Counties line were from Nottingham to Lincoln and from Leicester to Peterborough. They had not been proceeded with, but Hudson saw that they would make ideal &quot;stoppers&quot;: if the cities concerned were provided with a rail service, it would make it more difficult to justify another line. They were approved while the bill for the direct line was still before Parliament, forming the present day Lincoln Branch and the Syston to Peterborough Line.

The Leeds and Bradford Railway had been approved in 1844. By 1850 it was losing money but a number of railways offered to buy it. Hudson made an offer more or less on his own account and the line gave the MR an exit to the north, which became the start of the Settle and Carlisle line, and it gave the MR a much more convenient station at Leeds Wellington.

In spite of the objections of Hudson, for the MR and others, the &quot;London and York Railway&quot; (later the Great Northern Railway) led by Edmund Denison persisted, and the bill passed through Parliament in 1846.

===The Battle of Nottingham===
In 1851 the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway completed its line from Grantham as far as Colwick, from where a branch led to the MR Nottingham station. The Great Northern Railway by then passed through Grantham and both railway companies paid court to the fledgling line. Meanwhile, Nottingham had woken up to its branch line status and was keen to expand. The MR made a takeover offer only to discover that a shareholder of the GN had already gathered a quantity of Ambergate shares. An attempt to amalgamate the line with the GN was foiled by Ellis, who managed to obtain an Order in Chancery preventing the GN from running into Nottingham. However, in 1851 it opened a new service to the north that included Nottingham.

In 1852 an ANB&amp;EJR train arrived in Nottingham with a GN locomotive at its head. When it uncoupled and went to run round the train, it found its way blocked by a MR engine while another blocked its retreat. The engine was shepherded to a nearby shed and the tracks were lifted. This episode became known as the &quot;Battle of Nottingham&quot; and, with the action moved to the courtroom, it was seven months before the locomotive was released.

===The Euston Square Confederacy===
The London and Birmingham Railway and its successor the London and North Western Railway had been under pressure from two directions. Firstly the Great Western Railway had been foiled in its attempt to enter Birmingham by the Midland, but it still had designs on Manchester. At the same time the LNWR was under threat from the GN&#x27;s attempts to enter Manchester by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.

===To London===

====King&#x27;s Cross 1857–1868====

In 1850 the MR, though much more secure, was still a provincial line. Ellis realised that if it were to fend off its competitors it must expand outwards. The first step, in 1853, was to appoint James Allport as general manager, and the next was to shake off the dependence on the LNWR to London.

Although a bill for a line from Hitchin into King&#x27;s Cross jointly with the GN, was passed in 1847 it had not been proceeded with.

The bill was resubmitted in 1853 with the support of the people of Bedford, whose branch to the LNWR was slow and unreliable, and with the knowledge of the Northamptonshire iron deposits.

The Leicester and Hitchin Railway ran from Wigston to Market Harborough, through Desborough, Kettering, Wellingborough and Bedford, then on the Bedford to Hitchin Line, joining the GN at Hitchin for King&#x27;s Cross. The line began its life in a proposition presented for the shareholders by George Hudson on 2 May 1842 as: &quot;To vest £600,000 in the South Midland Railway Company in their line from Wigston to Hitchin.&quot; a full decade before realisation. The delay was partly due to the withdrawal of GN&#x27;s interest in the competing scheme, the Bedford and Leicester Railway, after Midland purchased the Leicester and Swannington Railway and the Ashby Canal and Tramway, which were to have been the feeder lines. With the competition thwarted there was less rush to have this line as well as its branch lines to Huntingdon (from Kettering) and Northampton (from Bedford) finished. Both these branches were subsequently built by independent companies.

While this took some of the pressure off the route through Rugby, the GNR insisted that passengers for London alight at Hitchin, buying tickets in the short time available, to catch a GNR train to finish their journey. James Allport arranged a seven-year deal with the GN to run into King&#x27;s Cross for a guaranteed £20,000 a year (). Through services to London were introduced in February 1858. The construction of the Leicester and Hitchin railway cost £1,750,000 ().

====St Pancras 1868====

By 1860 the MR was in a much better position and was able to approach new ventures aggressively. Its carriage of coal and iron – and beer from Burton-on-Trent – had increased by three times and passenger numbers were rising, as they were on the GN. Since GN trains took precedence on its own lines, MR passengers were becoming more and more delayed. Finally in 1862 the decision was taken for the MR to have its own terminus in the Capital, as befitted a national railway.

On 22 June 1863, the Midland Railway (Extension to London) Bill was passed:
:&quot;An Act for the Construction by the Midland Railway Company of a new Line of Railway between London and Bedford, with Branches therefrom; and for other Purpose&quot;.

The new line deviated at Bedford, through a gap in the Chiltern Hills at Luton, reaching London by curving around Hampstead Heath to a point between King&#x27;s Cross and Euston. The line from Bedford to Moorgate opened for passenger services on 13 July 1868 with services into St Pancras station starting on 1 October 1868.

St Pancras station is a marvel of Gothic Revival architecture, in the form of the Midland Grand Hotel by Gilbert Scott, which faces Euston Road, and the wrought-iron train shed designed by William Barlow. Its construction was not simple, since it had to approach through the ancient St Pancras Old Church graveyard. Below was the Fleet Sewer, while a branch from the main line ran underground with a steep gradient beneath the station to join the Metropolitan Railway, which ran parallel to what is now Euston Road.

The construction of the London Extension railway cost £9,000,000 ().

===To Manchester===
From the 1820s proposals for lines from London and the East Midlands had been proposed, and they had considered using the Cromford and High Peak Railway to reach Manchester (See Derby station). 

Finally the MR joined with the Manchester and Birmingham Railway (M&amp;BR), which was also looking for a route to London from Manchester, in a proposal for a line from Ambergate. The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, it received the Royal Assent in 1846, in spite of opposition from the Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. It was completed as far as Rowsley a few miles north of Matlock in 1849. However the M&amp;BR had become part of the LNWR in 1846, thus instead of being a partner it had an interest in thwarting the Midland.

In 1863 the MR reached Buxton, just as the LNWR arrived from the other direction by the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway. In 1867 the MR began an alternative line through Wirksworth (now the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway), to avoid the problem of the Ambergate line. The section from Wirksworth to Rowsley, which would have involved some tricky engineering, was not completed because the MR gained control of the original line in 1871, but access to Manchester was still blocked at Buxton. At length an agreement was made with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) to share lines from a branch at Millers Dale and running almost alongside the LNWR, in what became known as the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies&#x27; Committee.

Continuing friction with the LNWR caused the MR to join the MS&amp;LR and the GN in the Cheshire Lines Committee, which also gave scope for wider expansion into Lancashire and Cheshire, and finally a new station at Manchester Central.

In the meantime Sheffield had at last gained a main-line station. Following representations by the council in 1867 the MR promised to build a through line within two years. To the MR&#x27;s surprise, the Sheffield councillors then backed an improbable speculation called the Sheffield, Chesterfield, Bakewell, Ashbourne, Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway. This was unsurprisingly rejected by Parliament and the Midland built its &quot;New Road&quot; into a station at Pond Street. 

Among the last of the major lines built by the MR was a connection between Sheffield and Manchester, by a branch at Dore to Chinley, opened in 1894 through the Totley and Cowburn Tunnels, now the Hope Valley Line.

===To Scotland===

In the 1870s a dispute with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) over access rights to the LNWR line to Scotland caused the MR to construct the Settle and Carlisle line, the highest main line in England, to secure access to Scotland.

The dispute with the LNWR was settled before the Settle and Carlisle was built, but Parliament refused to allow the MR to withdraw from the project. The MR was also under pressure from Scottish railway companies, which were eagerly awaiting the Midland traffic reaching Carlisle as it would allow them to challenge the Caledonian Railway&#x27;s dominance on the West Coast traffic to Glasgow and Edinburgh. The Glasgow and South Western Railway had its own route from Carlisle to Glasgow via Dumfries and Kilmarnock, whilst the North British Railway had built the Waverley Line through the Scottish Borders from Carlisle to Edinburgh. The MR was obliged to go ahead and the Settle to Carlisle opened in 1876.

===Later history===

The Nottingham direct line of the Midland Railway opened for goods traffic on 1 December 1879 and for passenger traffic on 1 March 1880.

By the middle of the decade investment had been paid for; passenger travel was increasing, with new comfortable trains; and the mainstay of the line – goods, particularly minerals – was increasing dramatically.

Allport retired in 1880, to be succeeded by John Noble and then by George Turner. By the new century the quantity of goods, particularly coal, was clogging the network. The passenger service was acquiring a reputation for lateness. Lord Farrar reorganised the expresses, but by 1905 the whole system was so overloaded that no one was able to predict when many of the trains would reach their destinations. At this point Sir Guy Granet took over as general manager. He introduced a centralised traffic control system, and the locomotive power classifications that became the model for those used by British Railways.

The MR acquired other lines, including the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway in 1903 and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway in 1912. It had running rights on some lines, and it developed lines in partnership with other railways, being involved in more &#x27;Joint&#x27; lines than any other. In partnership with the GN it owned the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway to provide connections from the Midlands to East Anglia, the UK&#x27;s biggest joint railway. The MR provided motive power for the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway, and was a one-third partner in the Cheshire Lines Committee.

In 1913, the company achieved a total revenue of £15,129,136 () with working expenses of £9,416,981 ().

==First World War and the Grouping==

With the onset of the First World War in 1914, unified Government control of the Midland, and all the main line railways, was imposed through the medium of the Railway Executive Committee. The Midland retained its private sector independence, being given income to match 1913 levels, but was required to undertake huge volumes of military traffic, largely freight, with little opportunity to maintain the network and rolling stock.

At the end of the war, the railways were worn out and it was obvious that resumption of pre-war business was impossible. The Government passed the Railways Act 1921 by which all the main line railways were amalgamated into one or other of four new large concerns, in a process known as the &quot;Grouping&quot;. The Midland Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) from the beginning of 1923; it was the largest joint stock company in the world.

== Acquisitions ==

==Ships==

The MR operated ships from Heysham to Douglas and Belfast.

==Emblems==

The coat of arms combines the symbols of Birmingham, Derby, Bristol, Leicester, Lincoln and Leeds. The wyvern, a legendary bipedal dragon, was used extensively as an emblem by the Midland, having inherited it from the Leicester and Swannington Railway. The MR, which used a wyvern &quot;sans legs&quot; (legless) above its crest, asserted that the &quot;wyvern was the standard of the Kingdom of Mercia&quot;, and that it was &quot;a quartering in the town arms of Leicester&quot;. The symbol appeared on everything from station buildings and bridges down to china, cutlery and chamber pots in its hotels, and was worn as a silver badge by all uniformed employees. However, in 1897 the &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; noted that there appeared &quot;to be no foundation that the wyvern was associated with the Kingdom of Mercia&quot;. It has been associated with Leicester since the time of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster and Leicester (–1322), the most powerful lord in the Midlands, who used it as his personal crest, and was recorded in a heraldic visitation of the town in 1619.

==Accidents and incidents==

<doc id="188432" wikidata="Q190222" url="?curid=188432" title="Human capital flight">
<text>Human capital flight is the emigration or immigration of individuals who have received advanced training in their home country. The net benefits of human capital flight for the receiving country are sometimes referred to as a &quot;brain gain&quot; whereas the net costs for the sending country are sometimes referred to as a &quot;brain drain&quot;. In occupations with a surplus of graduates, immigration of foreign-trained professionals can aggravate the underemployment of domestic graduates, whereas emigration from an area with a surplus of trained people leads to better opportunities for those remaining. But emigration may cause problems for the home country if the trained people are in short supply there.

Research shows that there are significant economic benefits of human capital flight for the migrants themselves and for the receiving country. The consequences for the country of origin are less straightforward, with research suggesting they can be positive, negative or mixed. Research also suggests that emigration, remittances and return migration can have a positive effect on democratization and on the quality of political institutions in the country of origin.

== Types ==

There are several types of human capital flight:
* Organizational: The flight of talented, creative and highly qualified employees from large corporations that occurs when employees perceive the direction and leadership of the company to be regressive, unstable or stagnant, and thus unable to satisfy their personal and professional ambitions.
* Geographical: The flight of highly trained individuals and college graduates from their area of residence.
* Industrial: The movement of traditionally skilled workers from one sector of an industry to another.

As with other human migration, the social environment is often considered to be a key reason for this population shift. In &quot;source&quot; countries, lack of opportunities, political instability or oppression, economic depression, health risks and more (&quot;push&quot; factors) contribute to human capital flight, whereas &quot;host&quot; countries usually offer rich opportunities, political stability and freedom, a developed economy and better living conditions (&quot;pull&quot; factors) that attract talent. At the individual level, family influences (relatives living overseas, for example), as well as personal preferences, career ambitions and other motivating factors, can be considered.

== Origins and uses ==

The term &quot;brain drain&quot; was coined by the Royal Society to describe the emigration of &quot;scientists and technologists&quot; to North America from post–World War II Europe. Another source indicates that this term was first used in the United Kingdom to describe the influx of Indian scientists and engineers. Although the term originally referred to technology workers leaving a nation, the meaning has broadened into &quot;the departure of educated or professional people from one country, economic sector, or field for another, usually for better pay or living conditions&quot;.

Brain drain is a phenomenon where, relative to the remaining population, a substantial number of more educated (numerate, literate) persons emigrate.

Given that the term &quot;brain drain&quot;, as frequently used, implies that skilled emigration is bad for the country of origin, some scholars recommend against using the term in favor of more neutral and scientific alternative terms.

== Effects ==
The positive effects of human capital flight are sometimes referred to as &quot;brain gain&quot; whereas the negative effects are sometimes referred to as &quot;brain drain&quot;. According to economist Michael Clemens, it has not been shown that restrictions on high-skill emigration reduce shortages in the countries of origin. According to development economist Justin Sandefur, &quot;there is no study out there... showing any empirical evidence that migration restrictions have contributed to development.&quot; Hein de Haas, Professor of Sociology at the University of Amsterdam, describes the brain drain as a &quot;myth&quot;, whilst political philosopher Adam James Tebble argues that more open borders aid both the economic and institutional development of poorer migrant sending countries, contrary to proponents of &quot;brain-drain&quot; critiques of migration. However, according to University of Louvain (UCLouvain) economist Frederic Docquier, human capital flight has an adverse effect on most developing countries, even if it can be beneficial for some developing countries. Whether a country experiences a &quot;brain gain&quot; or &quot;brain drain&quot; depends on factors such as composition of migration, level of development, and demographic aspects including its population size, language and geographic location.

=== Economic effects ===
Some research suggests that migration (both low- and high-skilled) is beneficial both to the receiving and exporting countries, while other research suggests detrimental effect on the country of origin. According to one study, welfare increases in both types of countries: &quot;welfare impact of observed levels of migration is substantial, at about 5% to 10% for the main receiving countries and about 10% in countries with large incoming remittances&quot;. According to economists Michael Clemens and Lant Pratchett, &quot;permitting people to move from low-productivity places to high-productivity places appears to be by far the most efficient generalized policy tool, at the margin, for poverty reduction&quot;. A successful two-year in situ anti-poverty program, for instance, helps poor people make in a year what is the equivalent of working one day in the developed world. Research on a migration lottery that allowed Tongans to move to New Zealand found that the lottery winners saw a 263% increase in income from migrating (after only one year in New Zealand) relative to the unsuccessful lottery entrants. A 2017 study of Mexican immigrant households in the United States found that by virtue of moving to the United States, the households increase their incomes more than fivefold immediately. The study also found that the &quot;average gains accruing to migrants surpass those of even the most successful current programs of economic development.&quot; A 2024 study found that EU migration to the United States had adverse effects on EU productivity in the short-term but positive long-term effects through productivity spillover effects.

Remittances increase living standards in the country of origin. Remittances are a large share of GDP in many developing countries, and have been shown to increase the wellbeing of receiving families. In the case of Haiti, the 670,000 adult Haitians living in the OECD sent home about $1,700 per migrant per year, well over double Haiti&#x27;s $670 per capita GDP. A study on remittances to Mexico found that remittances lead to a substantial increase in the availability of public services in Mexico, surpassing government spending in some localities. A 2017 study found that remittances can significantly alleviate poverty after natural disasters. Research shows that more educated and higher earning emigrants remit more. Some research shows that the remittance effect is not strong enough to make the remaining natives in countries with high emigration flows better off. A 2016 NBER paper suggests that emigration from Italy due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis reduced political change in Italy.

Return migration can also be a boost to the economy of developing states, as the migrants bring back newly acquired skills, savings and assets. A study of Yugoslav refugees during the Yugoslav Wars of the early 1990s found that citizens of former Yugoslavia who were allowed temporary stays in Germany brought back skills, knowledge and technologies to their home countries when they returned home in 1995 (after the Dayton accords), leading to greater productivity and export performance.

Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147.3%. Research also finds that migration leads to greater trade in goods and services between the sending and receiving countries. Using 130 years of data on historical migrations to the United States, one study finds &quot;that a doubling of the number of residents with ancestry from a given foreign country relative to the mean increases by 4.2 percentage points the probability that at least one local firm invests in that country, and increases by 31% the number of employees at domestic recipients of FDI from that country. The size of these effects increases with the ethnic diversity of the local population, the geographic distance to the origin country, and the ethno-linguistic fractionalization of the origin country.&quot; Emigrants have been found to significantly boost Foreign direct investment (FDI) back to their country of origin. According to one review study, the overall evidence shows that emigration helps developing countries integrate into the global economy.

A 2016 study reviewing the literature on migration and economic growth shows that &quot;migrants contribute to the integration of their country into the world market, which can be particularly important for economic growth in developing countries.&quot; Some research suggests that emigration causes an increase in the wages of those who remain in the country of origin. A 2014 survey of the existing literature on emigration finds that a 10 percent emigrant supply shock would increase wages in the sending country by 2–5.5%. A study of emigration from Poland shows that it led to a slight increase in wages for high- and medium-skilled workers for remaining Poles. A 2013 study finds that emigration from Eastern Europe after the 2004 EU enlargement increased the wages of remaining young workers in the country of origin by 6%, while it had no effect on the wages of old workers. The wages of Lithuanian men increased as a result of post-EU enlargement emigration. Return migration is associated with greater household firm revenues. A study from the IMF concluded that emigration of high skilled labour from Eastern Europe has adversely affected economic and productivity growth in Eastern Europe and slowed down convergence in per capita income between high and low income EU countries.

A 2019 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; found that Swedish emigration to the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century strengthened the labour movement and increased left-wing politics and voting trends. The authors argue that the ability to emigrate strengthened the bargaining position of labour, as well as provided exit options for political dissidents who might have been oppressed.

=== Education and innovation ===
Research finds that emigration and low migration barriers has net positive effects on human capital formation and innovation in the sending countries. This means that there is a &quot;brain gain&quot; instead of a &quot;brain drain&quot; to emigration. One study finds that sending countries benefit indirectly in the long-run on the emigration of skilled workers because those skilled workers are able to innovate more in developed countries, which the sending countries are able to benefit on as a positive externality. Greater emigration of skilled workers consequently leads to greater economic growth and welfare improvements in the long-run. According to economist Michael Clemens, it has not been shown that restrictions on high-skill emigration reduce shortages in the countries of origin.

A 2021 study found that migration opportunities for Filipino nurses led to a net increase in human capital in the Philippines, thus contradicting the &quot;brain drain&quot; thesis. A 2017 paper found that the emigration opportunities to the United States for high-skilled Indians provided by the H-1B visa program surprisingly contributed to the growth of the Indian IT sector. A greater number of Indians were induced to enroll in computer science programs in order to move to the United States; however, a large number of these Indians never moved to the United States (due to caps in the H-1B program) or returned to India after the completion of their visas. One 2011 study finds that emigration has mixed effects on innovation in the sending country, boosting the number of important innovations but reducing the number of average inventions. A 2019 paper found that emigration from Fiji led to a net increase in skill stocks in Fiji, as citizens increased their education attainment. A 2019 analysis found that emigration of youths from Italy led to a reduction in innovation.

=== Democracy, human rights and liberal values ===
Research also suggests that emigration, remittances and return migration can have a positive effect on political institutions and democratization in the country of origin. Research shows that exposure to emigrants boosts turnout. Research also shows that remittances can lower the risk of civil war in the country of origin. Migration leads to lower levels of terrorism. Return migration from countries with liberal gender norms has been associated with the transfer of liberal gender norms to the home country. A 2009 study finds that foreigners educated in democracies foster democracy in their home countries. Studies find that leaders who were educated in the West are significantly more likely to improve their country&#x27;s prospects of implementing democracy. A 2016 study found that Chinese immigrants exposed to Western media censored in China became more critical of their home government&#x27;s performance on the issues covered in the media and less trusting in official discourse. A 2014 study found that remittances decreased corruption in democratic states.

A 2015 study finds that the emigration of women in rural China reduces son preference.

== Historical examples ==

===Flight of the Neoplatonic academy philosophers===
After Justinian closed the Platonic Academy in 529 AD, according to the historian Agathias, its remaining members sought protection from the Sassanid ruler, Khosrau I, carrying with them precious scrolls of literature, philosophy and, to a lesser degree, science. After the peace treaty between the Persian and the Byzantine empires in 532 guaranteed their personal security, some members of this group found sanctuary in the Pagan stronghold of Harran, near Edessa. One of the last leading figures of this group was Simplicius, a pupil of Damascius, the last head of the Athenian school. The students of an academy-in-exile may have survived into the ninth century, long enough to facilitate the medieval revival of the Neoplatonist commentary tradition in Baghdad.

===Spanish expulsion of Jews (15th century)===
After the end of the Catholic reconquest of Spain, the Catholic Monarchs pursued the goal of a religiously homogenous kingdom. Thus, Jews were expelled from the country in 1492. As they dominated Spain&#x27;s financial service industry, their expulsion was instrumental in causing future economic problems, for example the need for foreign bankers such as the Fugger family and others from Genova. On 7 January 1492, the King ordered the expulsion of all the Jews from Spain—from the kingdoms of Castile and León (Kingdoms of Galicia, Leon, Old Castile, New Castile or Toledo), Navarra and Aragon (Aragon, Principality of Catalonia, Kingdoms of Valencia, Mallorca and the Rousillon and the two Sicilies). Before that, the Queen had also expelled them from the four Kingdoms of Andalusia (Seville, Cordova, Jaén and Granada). Their departure contributed to economic decline in some regions of Spain. Thus, the conservative aristocracy consolidated its power over these newly acquired territories while contributing to their decline.

===Huguenot exodus from France (17th century)===
In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and declared Protestantism to be illegal in the Edict of Fontainebleau. After this, many Huguenots (estimates range from 200,000 to 1 million) fled to surrounding Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark and Prussia—whose Calvinist great elector, Frederick William, welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and under-populated country. Many went to the Dutch colony at the Cape (South Africa), where they were instrumental in establishing a wine industry. At least 10,000 went to Ireland, where they were assimilated into the Protestant minority during the plantations.

Many Huguenots and their descendants prospered. Henri Basnage de Beauval fled France and settled in the Netherlands, where he became an influential writer and historian. Abel Boyer, another noted writer, settled in London and became a tutor to the British royal family. Henry Fourdrinier, the descendant of Huguenot settlers in England, founded the modern paper industry. Augustin Courtauld fled to England, settling in Essex and established a dynasty that founded the British silk industry. Noted Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer was born in Geneva to Huguenot refugees. Sir John Houblon, the first Governor of the Bank of England, was born into a Huguenot family in London. Isaac Barré, the son of Huguenot settlers in Ireland, became an influential British soldier and politician. Gustav and Peter Carl Fabergé, the descendants of Huguenot refugees, founded the world-famous Fabergé company in Russia, maker of the famous Faberge eggs.

The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as Huguenots accounted for a disproportionate number of entrepreneurial, artisan and technical occupations in the country. The loss of this technical expertise was a blow from which the kingdom did not fully recover for many years.

===Expulsion of the Jesuits===
The suppression of the Society of Jesus in Spanish America in 1767 caused the Jesuit vineyards in Peru to be auctioned at high prices, but new owners did not have the same expertise as the Jesuits, contributing to a production decline.

Also, after the suppression, the production and importance of yerba mate-producing regions, which had been dominated by Jesuits, began to decline. Excessive exploitation of indigenous labour in the plantations led to decay in the industry and the scattering of Guaranís living in the missions. With the fall of the Jesuits, and the mismanagement of their former enterprises by the crown and the new entrepreneurs that had taken over, Paraguay gained an unrivalled position as the main producer of yerba mate. The plantation system of the Jesuits did prevail, however, and mate continued chiefly to be harvested from wild stand through the 18th century and most of the 19th century.

===19th century Eastern Europe migration===

Mid-19th century Eastern European migration was significantly shaped by religious factors. The Jewish minority experienced strong discrimination in the Russian Empire during this period, which reached its maximum in the pogrom waves of the 1880s. During the 1880s, the mass exodus of more than two million Russian Jews began. Already before, a migration stream of Jewish people started which was characterized by highly skilled individuals. This pronounced selectivity was not caused by economic incentives, but by political persecution.

===Antisemitism in pre-World War II Europe (1933–1943)===
Antisemitic sentiments and laws in Europe through the 1930s and 1940s, culminating in the Holocaust, caused an exodus of intelligentsia. Notable examples are:
* Albert Einstein (emigrated permanently to the United States in 1933)
* Sigmund Freud (finally decided to emigrate permanently with his wife and daughter to London, England, in 1938, two months after the Anschluss)
* Enrico Fermi (1938; though he was not Jewish himself, his wife, Laura, was)
* Niels Bohr (1943; his mother was Jewish)
* Theodore von Karman
* John von Neumann (Hungarian, Roman Catholic convert)
* Hans Bethe
* Leo Szilard
* Hannah Arendt (first fled to Paris from 1933, and eventually emigrated to the United States in 1940)

Besides Jews, Nazi persecution extended to liberals and socialists in Germany, further contributing to emigration. Refugees in New York City founded the University in Exile. The most prolific research center in maths and physics before the war was the German University of Göttingen, that became a focal point for the Nazi crackdown on &quot;Jewish physics&quot;, as represented by the work of Albert Einstein. In what was later called the &quot;great purge&quot; of 1933, academics were expelled or fled, ending up in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Following the great purge, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton took on the role of leading research institution in maths and physics.

The Bauhaus, perhaps the most important arts and design school of the 20th century, was forced to close down during the Nazi regime because of their liberal and socialist leanings, which the Nazis considered degenerate. The school had already been shut down in Weimar because of its political stance, but moved to Dessau prior to the closing. Following this abandonment, two of the three pioneers of modern architecture, Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, left Germany for America (while Le Corbusier stayed in France). They introduced the European Modern movement to the American public and fostered the International Style in architecture and design, helping to transform design education at American universities and influencing later architects. A 2014 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that German Jewish Émigrés in the US boosted innovation there.

The resulting wave of high-skilled immigration greatly bolstered up the scientific development of the United Kingdom and United States of America. As a result of Nazi intellectual purges, the Anglosphere replaced Germany as the world&#x27;s scientific leader. German historian stated that the &quot;German universities suffered a loss of 20.5% of their teaching staff&quot; after the Nazi seizure of power. He estimates that about 70% of fired scientists lost their position because of Jewish or &quot;non-Aryan&quot; ancestry, 10% lost their position because they were married to a Jew, and 20% were fired for political reasons. As over 60% of fired scientists emigrated, Grüttner argues that Germany lost even more than the sheer number of dismissed scientists would suggest as top scientists were disproportionately represented among the emigrees. When taking into consideration both those who won Nobel Prize either before or after emigration, a total of 24 Nobel laureates fled either Germany or Austria because of Nazi persecution.

Many Jews escaping from German-occupied Europe to the United Kingdom established successful careers in publishing, medicine, science, psychoanalysis and other occupations. Notable scientists include Max Perutz, Rudolf Peierls, Francis Simon, Ernst Boris Chain and Hans Adolf Krebs. Intellectuals include art historians Nikolaus Pevsner and Ernst Gombrich, sociologists Norbert Elias and Karl Mannheim, and philosophers Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

===Hungarian scientists in the early and mid 20th century===
Different waves of emigration occurred.

Before World War I: József Galamb, engineer and creator of T-Ford; Eugene Farkas, engineer and creator of Fordson tractor; Philipp Lenard (Nobel prize/physics)
* First and biggest wave was around World War I.
* Then after Trianon 1920 when Hungary lost two-thirds of its territory: Mária Telkes, István Szabó (engineer/physicist), Hans Selye
* World War II and the Third Reich
* Soviet occupation and communist occupation around 1948 and then revolution of 1956

During the 1930s and 1940s Hungarian was the third-most-often-used language in Hollywood.

&quot;The Martians&quot; were a group of prominent Hungarian scientists of Jewish descent (mostly, but not exclusively, physicists and mathematicians) who escaped to the United States during and after World War II due to Nazism or Communism. They included, among others, Theodore von Kármán, John von Neumann, Paul Halmos, Eugene Wigner, Edward Teller, George Pólya, John G. Kemeny and Paul Erdős. Several were from Budapest, and were instrumental in American scientific progress (e.g., developing the atomic bomb). Many more left because of communism: Hungarian Nobel-prize winners: György von Békésy, Szent-Györgyi, Harsányi and Hersko and others like Viktor Szebehely, Zoltán Bay, Alexandre Lamfalussy (economist), Mihaly Csikszentmihaly (Flow)
* After the revolution of 1956 many left: Ferenc Pavlics (engineer) creator of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, Imre Izsák, Oláh György (Nobel prize/chemistry), Csaba Horváth (chemical engineer) and parents of Nick Szabo (Bitcoin) 
The process didn&#x27;t stop, since the region that used to be the Western Block quickly recovered from the economic crisis caused by the World War and stabilized as reconstruction was completed so the bulk of businesses and capital flocked there, creating a systematic barrier.

===German scientist recruitment by the US and USSR post World War II===

In the last months of and post World War II, both the American and Soviet governments forcibly recruited and transported thousands of former Nazi scientists to the US and USSR respectively to continue their scientific work in those countries.

===Eastern Europe under the Eastern Bloc===

By 1922, the Soviet Union had issued restrictions making emigration of its citizens to other countries almost impossible. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later stated, &quot;We were scared, really scared. We were afraid the thaw might unleash a flood, which we wouldn&#x27;t be able to control and which could drown us. How could it drown us? It could have overflowed the banks of the Soviet riverbed and formed a tidal wave which would have washed away all the barriers and retaining walls of our society.&quot; After Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, the majority of those living in the countries of the Eastern Bloc aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave. By the early 1950s, the approach of the Soviet Union to restricting emigration was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany.

Even after the official closing of the Inner German border in 1952, the border between the sectors of East Berlin and West Berlin remained considerably more accessible than the rest of the border because it was administered by all four occupying powers. The Berlin sector border was essentially a &quot;loophole&quot; through which Eastern Bloc citizens could still emigrate. The 3.5 million East Germans, called &quot;Republikflüchtlinge&quot;, who had left by 1961 totalled approximately 20% of the entire East German population. The emigrants tended to be young and well educated, leading to the brain drain feared by officials in East Germany. Yuri Andropov, then the CPSU director of Relations with Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties of Socialist Countries, decided on 28 August 1958 to write an urgent letter to the Central Committee about the 50% increase in the number of East German intelligentsia among the refugees. Andropov reported that, while the East German leadership stated that they were leaving for economic reasons, testimony from refugees indicated that the reasons were more political than material. He stated, &quot;the flight of the intelligentsia has reached a particularly critical phase.&quot; The direct cost of labour force losses has been estimated at $7 billion to $9 billion, with East German party leader Walter Ulbricht later claiming that West Germany owed him $17 billion in compensation, including reparations as well as labour force losses. In addition, the drain of East Germany&#x27;s young population potentially cost it over 22.5 billion marks in lost educational investment. In August 1961, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded by construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole.

==By region==

===Europe===
Human capital flight in Europe fits into two distinct trends. The first is an outflow of highly qualified scientists from Western Europe mostly to the United States. The second is a migration of skilled workers from Central and Southeastern Europe into Western Europe, within the EU. While in some countries the trend may be slowing, certain South European countries such as Italy continue to experience extremely high rates of human capital flight. The European Union has noted a net loss of highly skilled workers and introduced a &quot;blue card&quot; policy—much like the American green card—which &quot;seeks to draw an additional 20 million workers from Asia, Africa and the Americas in the next two decades&quot;.

Although the EU recognizes a need for extensive immigration to mitigate the effects of an aging population, national populist political parties have gained support in many European countries by calling for stronger laws restricting immigration. Immigrants are perceived both as a burden on the state and the cause of social problems such as increased crime rates and the introduction of major cultural differences.

The EU lags significantly behind the US and China in venture capital investments, with the EU capturing only 5% of global venture capital compared to 52% in the US and 40% in China. A high percentage of EU scale-ups involve foreign lead investors, and many end up being acquired by foreign entities or listen on foreign stock exchanges. This trend contributes to a brain drain and the relocation of innovative firms outside the EU. Promising companies and talent to relocate overseas. This undermines the local business environment and hampers Europe&#x27;s capacity to retain industry leaders and foster new technological advancements.

====Western Europe====
In 2006, over 250,000 Europeans emigrated to the United States (164,285), Australia (40,455), Canada (37,946) and New Zealand (30,262). Germany alone saw 155,290 people leave the country (though mostly to destinations within Europe). This is the highest rate of worker emigration since reunification, and was equal to the rate in the aftermath of World War II. Portugal has experienced the largest human capital flight in Western Europe. The country has lost 19.5% of its qualified population and is struggling to absorb sufficient skilled immigrants to compensate for losses to Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom and Austria.

===== United Kingdom =====
Business industries expressed worries that Brexit poses significant risk of causing brain drain.

====Central and Eastern Europe====
Central and Eastern European countries have expressed concerns about extensive migration of skilled labourers to Ireland and the United Kingdom following the creation of the Schengen Agreement. Lithuania, for example, has lost about 100,000 citizens since 2003, many of them young and well-educated, to emigration to Ireland in particular. (Ireland itself previously experienced high rates of human capital flight to the United States, Great Britain and Canada before the Celtic Tiger economic programs.) A similar phenomenon occurred in Poland after its entry into the European Union. In the first year of its EU membership, 100,000 Poles registered to work in England, joining an estimated 750,000 residents of Polish descent. However, with the rapid growth of salaries in Poland, its booming economy, the strong value of the zloty, and decreasing unemployment (which fell from 14.2% in May 2006 to 8% in March 2008), the flight of Polish workers slowed. In 2008 and early 2009 people who came back outnumbered those leaving the country. The exodus is likely to continue, however. According to IMF, the emigration of high skilled labour has adversely affected growth in Eastern Europe and slowed down convergence in per capita income between high and low income EU countries.

===== Russia =====
After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, there was a major exodus of skilled workers and potential draftees. Most international companies operating in Russia departed, taking their skilled experts with them. Studies report that this would have a demographic effect especially in Russia lasting much longer than the conflict will take place, and much longer than Vladimir Putin will remain president.

According to BBC News:
They come from different walks of life. Some are journalists like us, but there are also IT experts, designers, artists, academics, lawyers, doctors, PR specialists, and linguists. Most are under 50. Many share western liberal values and hope Russia will be a democratic country one day. Some are LGBTQ+. Sociologists studying the current Russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger, better educated and wealthier than those staying. More often they are from bigger cities.

According to Johannes Wachs, &quot;The exodus of skilled human capital, sometimes called brain drain, out of Russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the Russian economy in the long run.&quot;

====Southeastern Europe====

The rapid but small-scale departure of highly skilled workers from Southeastern Europe has caused concern about those nations developing deeper integration in the European Union. This has given rise to programs to curb the outflow by encouraging skilled technicians and scientists to remain in the region to work on international projects.

Serbia is one of the top countries that has experienced human capital flight due to the fall of Yugoslavia and its successive civil wars. In 1991, people started emigrating to Italy and Greece, and then began going farther, to the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In the last ten years, educated people and professionals have been leaving the country and going to other countries where they feel they can have improved possibilities for better and secure lives. According to a report on &quot;migration and brain drain&quot; in the Western Balkans, published in 2024, &quot;young people leave these countries not only because of low salaries and economic issues but also because of corruption, crime, political instability and lack of security.&quot;

A major cause of human capital flight in countries like Moldova and Ukraine is lack of economic opportunities and corruption. The higher economic class in the country, filled with local and Russian oligarchs, has control over the whole economic system. Young, educated people have few economic opportunities unless they have connections to individuals from the higher class. This encourages them to emigrate and seek opportunities elsewhere.

====Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain====
Many citizens of the countries most stricken by the economic crisis in Europe have emigrated to countries such as Australia, Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Angola and Argentina.

===Africa===
Countries in Africa have lost a tremendous amount of their educated and skilled populations as a result of emigration to more developed countries, which has harmed the ability of such nations to climb out of poverty. Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia are believed to be the most affected. According to the United Nations Development Programme, Ethiopia lost 75% of its skilled workforce between 1980 and 1991.

Then South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in his 1998 &quot;African Renaissance&quot; speech:
&quot;In our world in which the generation of new knowledge and its application to change the human condition is the engine which moves human society further away from barbarism, do we not have need to recall Africa&#x27;s hundreds of thousands of intellectuals back from their places of emigration in Western Europe and North America, to rejoin those who remain still within our shores!

I dream of the day when these, the African mathematicians and computer specialists in Washington and New York, the African physicists, engineers, doctors, business managers and economists, will return from London and Manchester and Paris and Brussels to add to the African pool of brain power, to enquire into and find solutions to Africa&#x27;s problems and challenges, to open the African door to the world of knowledge, to elevate Africa&#x27;s place within the universe of research the information of new knowledge, education and information.&quot;
&quot;Africarecruit&quot; is a joint initiative by NEPAD and the Commonwealth Business Council to recruit professional expatriate Africans to take employment back in Africa after working overseas.

In response to growing debate over the human capital flight of healthcare professionals, especially from lower-income countries to some higher-income countries, in 2010 the World Health Organization adopted the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, a policy framework for all countries for the ethical international recruitment of doctors, nurses and other health professionals.

African human capital flight has begun to reverse itself due to rapid growth and development in many African nations, and the emergence of an African middle class. Between 2001 and 2010, six of the world&#x27;s ten fastest-growing economies were in Africa, and between 2011 and 2015, Africa&#x27;s economic growth was expected to outpace that of Asia. This, together with increased development, introduction of technologies such as faster internet access and mobile phones, a better-educated population, and the environment for business driven by new tech start-up companies, has resulted in many expatriates from Africa returning to their home countries, and more Africans staying at home to work.

====Ghana====
The trend for young doctors and nurses to seek higher salaries and better working conditions, mainly in higher-income countries of the West, is having serious effects on the health care sector in Ghana. Ghana currently has about 3,600 doctors—one for every 6,700 inhabitants. This compares with one doctor per 430 people in the United States. Many of the country&#x27;s trained doctors and nurses leave to work in countries such as Britain, the United States, Jamaica and Canada. It is estimated that up to 68% of the country&#x27;s trained medical staff left between 1993 and 2000, and according to Ghana&#x27;s official statistics institute, in the period 1999 to 2004, 448 doctors, or 54% of those trained in the period, left to work abroad.

====Nigeria====
====South Africa====

Along with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing human capital flight in the past 20 years, since the end of apartheid. This is believed to be potentially damaging for the regional economy, and is arguably detrimental to the wellbeing of the region&#x27;s impoverished majority, which is desperately reliant on the health care infrastructure because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The skills drain in South Africa tends to reflect racial contours exacerbated by Black Economic Empowerment policies, and has thus resulted in large White South African communities abroad. The problem is further highlighted by South Africa&#x27;s request in 2001 of Canada to stop recruiting its doctors and other highly skilled medical personnel.

For the medical sector, the loss of return from investment for all doctors emigrating from South Africa is $1.41 billion. The benefit to destination countries is huge: $2.7 billion for the United Kingdom alone, without compensation.

More recently, in a case of reverse brain drain a net 359,000 highly skilled South Africans returned to South Africa from foreign work assignments over a five-year period from 2008 to 2013. This was catalysed by the global financial crisis of 2007–08 and perceptions of a higher quality of life in South Africa relative to the countries to which they had first emigrated. It is estimated that around 37% of those who returned are professionals such as lawyers, doctors, engineers and accountants.

===Asia===
====Middle East====
===== Arab world =====
By 2010, the Arab countries were experiencing human capital flight, according to reports from the United Nations and Arab League. About one million Arab experts and specialists were living in developed countries, and the rate of return was extremely low. The reasons for this included attraction to opportunities in technical and scientific fields in the West and an absence of job opportunities in the Arab world, as well as wars and political turmoil that have plagued many Arab nations.

In 2012, human capital flight was showing signs of reversing, with many young students choosing to stay and more individuals from abroad returning. In particular, many young professionals are becoming entrepreneurs and starting their own businesses rather than going abroad to work for companies in Western countries. This was partially a result of the Arab Spring, after which many Arab countries began viewing science as the driving force for development, and as a result stepped up their science programs. Another reason may be the ongoing global recession.

======Iraq======
During the Iraq War, especially during the early years, the lack of basic services and security fed an outflow of professionals from Iraq that began under Saddam Hussein, under whose rule four million Iraqis are believed to have left the country. In particular, the exodus was fed by the violence that plagued Iraq, which by 2006 had seen 89 university professors and senior lecturers killed.

=====Iran=====
In 2006, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ranked Iran &quot;first in brain drain among 61 developing and less developed countries (LDCs)&quot;. In the early 1990s, more than 150,000 Iranians emigrated, and an estimated 25% of Iranians with post-secondary education were residing in developed countries of the OECD. In 2009, the IMF reported that 150,000–180,000 Iranians emigrate annually, with up to 62% of Iran&#x27;s academic elite having emigrated, and that the yearly exodus is equivalent to an annual capital loss of $50 billion. Better possibilities for job markets is thought to be the motivation for absolute majority of the human capital flight while a small few stated their reasons as in search of more social or political freedom.

===== Israel =====

Israel has experienced varying levels of emigration throughout its history, with the majority of Israeli expatriates moving to the United States. Currently, some 330,000 native-born Israelis (including 230,000 Israeli Jews) are estimated to be living abroad, while the number of immigrants to Israel who later left is unclear. According to public opinion polls, the main motives for leaving Israel have not been the political and security situation, but include desire for higher living standards, pursuit of work opportunities and/or professional advancement, and higher education. Many Israelis with degrees in scientific or engineering fields have emigrated abroad, largely due to lack of job opportunities. From Israel&#x27;s establishment in May 1948 to December 2006, about 400,000 doctors and academics left Israel. In 2009, Israel&#x27;s Council for Higher Education informed the Knesset&#x27;s Education Committee that 25% of Israel&#x27;s academics were living overseas, and that Israel had the highest human capital flight rate in the world. However, an OECD estimate put the highly educated Israeli emigrant rate at 5.3 per 1,000 highly educated Israelis, meaning that Israel actually retains more of its highly educated population than many other developed countries.

In addition, the majority of Israelis who emigrate eventually return after extended periods abroad. In 2007, the Israeli government began a program to encourage Israelis living abroad to return; since then, the number of returning Israelis has doubled, and in 2010, Israeli expatriates, including academics, researchers, technical professionals and business managers, began returning in record numbers. The country launched additional programs to open new opportunities in scientific fields to encourage Israeli scientists and researchers living abroad to return home. These initiatives have since succeeded in luring many Israeli scientists back home.

===== Turkey =====
In the 1960s, many skilled and educated people emigrated from Turkey, including many doctors and engineers. This emigration wave is believed to have been triggered by political instability, including the 1960 military coup. In later decades, into the 2000s, many Turkish professionals emigrated, and students studying overseas chose to remain abroad, mainly due to better economic opportunities. This human capital flight was given national media attention, and in 2000, the government formed a task force to investigate the &quot;brain drain&quot; problem.

====Southeast Asia====
=====Indonesia=====
While there is no empirical data about human capital flight from Indonesia, the brain drain phenomenon in Indonesia was estimated to reach 5%. After the May 1998 riots of Indonesia, many Chinese Indonesians decided to flee to other countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States which severely contributes to brain drain within the country. Indonesian Aerospace laid off some two thirds of its workforce after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, leading many workers to leave their country to find a better career overseas. As of 2018, there are at least 60 Indonesians graduated from local or overseas universities working at Boeing and Airbus, with half of them holding middle management positions.

In 2023, it was reported that over 4,000 Indonesians acquired Singaporean citizenship between 2019 and 2022. Most of these are young people, students in the ages 25 - 35 and degree holders. The main reasons given were better job prospects, scholarships, better healthcare, higher salaries and a good public transport.

In addition, 413 of the 35,536 recipients of the state and tax funded Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) did not return to Indonesia between 2013 and 2022. They were required to return and work in Indonesia for several years after they concluded their studies.

=====Malaysia=====
There have been high rates of human capital flight from Malaysia. Major pull factors have included better career opportunities abroad and compensation, while major push factors included corruption, social inequality, educational opportunities, racial inequality such as the government&#x27;s Bumiputera affirmative action policies. As of 2011, Bernama has reported that there are a million talented Malaysians working overseas. Recently human capital flight has increased in pace: 305,000 Malaysians migrated overseas between March 2008 and August 2009, compared to 140,000 in 2007.
Non-Bumiputeras, particularly Malaysian Indians and Malaysian Chinese, were over-represented in these statistics. Popular destinations included Singapore, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. This is reported to have caused Malaysia&#x27;s economic growth rate to fall to an average of 4.6% per annum in the 2000s compared to 7.2% in the 1990s.

===== Philippines =====
======Post-colonial Philippines======
In 1946, colonialism in the Philippines ended with the election of Manuel Roxas. The Philippines&#x27; infrastructure and economy had been devastated by World War II, contributing to serious national health problems and uneven distribution of wealth. As part of reconstruction efforts for the newly independent state, education of nurses was encouraged to combat the low ratio of 1 nurse per 12,000 Filipinos and to help raise national health care standards. However Roxas, having spent his last three years as the secretary of finance and chairman of the National Economic Council and a number of other Filipino companies, was particularly concerned with the country&#x27;s financial (rather than health) problems. The lack of government funding for rural community clinics and hospitals, as well as low wages, continued to perpetuate low retention rates for nurses in rural areas and slow economic recovery. When the United States relaxed their Immigration Act laws in 1965, labour export emerged as a possible solution for the Philippines.

====== Labour export from the 1960s onwards ======
Since the 1960s and 1970s, the Philippines has been the largest supplier of nurses to the United States, in addition to export labour supplied to the UK and Saudi Arabia. In 1965, with a recovering post-WWII economy and facing labour shortages, the United States introduced a new occupational clause to the Immigration Act. The clause encouraged migration of skilled labour into sectors experiencing a shortage, particularly nursing, as well relaxing restrictions on race and origin. This was seen as an opportunity for mass labour exportation by the Philippine government, and was followed by a boom in public and private nursing educational programs. Seeking access through the Exchange Visitors Program (EVP) sponsored by the US government, workers were encouraged to go abroad to learn more skills and earn higher pay, sending remittance payments back home. As nursing was a highly feminized profession, labour migrants through the beginning of the 1980s were predominantly female and young (25–30 years of age).

Pursuing economic gains through labour migration over infrastructural financing and improvement, the Philippines still faced slow economic growth during the 1970s and 1980s. With continuously rising demand for nurses in the international service sector and overseas, the Philippine government aggressively furthered their educational programs under Ferdinand Marcos, president at the time. Although complete statistical data are difficult to collect, studies done in the 1970s show 13,500 nurses (or 85% of all Filipino nurses) had left the country to pursue work elsewhere. Additionally, the number of existing public and private nursing school programs multiplied from a reported 17 nursing schools in 1950, to 140 nursing schools in 1970.

====== Remittances ======
Studies show stark wage discrepancies between the Philippines and developed countries such as the US and the UK. This has led Philippine government officials to note that remittances sent home may be seen as more economically valuable than pursuit of local work. Around the turn of the 20th century, the average monthly wage of Filipino nurses who remained in their home country was between 550–1,000 pesos per month (roughly US$70–140 at that time). In comparison, the average nurse working in the US was receiving US$800–400 per month.

However, scholars have noted that economic disparities in the Philippines have not been eased in the past decades. Although remittance payments account for a large portion of Filipino GDP (US$290.5 million in 1978, increased to US$10.7 billion in 2005), and are therefore regarded as a large economic boost to the state, Filipino unemployment has continued to rise (8.4% in 1990, increased to 12.7% in 2003). Here scholars have begun to look at the culture of nurse migration endorsed by the Philippine state as a contributing factor to the country&#x27;s economic and health problems.

====== Migration culture of nursing ======
The Philippines has a migration culture of nursing. A 2021 study found that migration opportunities for Filipino nurses led to a net increase in human capital in the Philippines, thus contradicting the &quot;brain drain&quot; thesis.

====== Education industry ======
In addition to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) run by the government that serves as both a source of overseas recruitment agreements and as a marketer of Philippine labour overseas, private nursing schools have acted as migration funnels, expanding enrolment, asserting control over the licensure process, and entering into business agreements with other overseas recruitment agencies. However, retaining qualified instructors and staff has been reported to be as problematic as retaining actual nurses, contributing to low exam pass rates (only 12 of 175 reporting schools had pass rates of 90% or higher in 2005, with an average pass rate of 42% across the country in 2006). Private schools have also begun to control licensure exam review centres, providing extra preparation for international qualification exams at extra cost and with no guarantee of success. It is estimated that between 1999 and 2006, US$700 million was spent on nursing education and licensure review courses by individuals who never took the licensing exams or completed the programming.

Discrepancies in wages between Philippine nurses working at home and those working abroad, as noted above, provide clear economic incentives for nurses to leave the country; however, physicians have also been lured into these promises of wealth through the creation of &quot;Second Course&quot; nursing programs. Studies comparing wages of Philippine nurses at home and abroad from 2005 to 2010, showed at-home nurses receiving US$170 per month, or $2,040 per annum, compared to US$3,000–4,000 per month in the US, or $36,000–48,000 per annum. Philippine physician salaries for those working at home are not much more competitive; they earn on average US$300–800 per month, or US$3,600–9,600 per annum. Although it is important to note along with such discrepancies that the costs of living are also higher in the US, and that remittance payment transfers back home are not free, there is still evidently a large economic pull to studying as a nurse and migrating overseas.

===== Vietnam =====
According to &quot;Viet Nam News&quot;, 70% of Vietnamese students abroad did not return to Vietnam. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Barack Obama&#x27;s remarks at the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative on conditions that cause brain drain as &quot;slyly&quot; describing Vietnam, with corruption, pollution and poor education.

More recent news suggests that a so-called brain gain may be occurring. A 2016 study found that 70% of overseas professionals were interested in returning to Vietnam, with many thousands already having done so.

====South Asia====
=====India=====

India has seen massive emigration since the 1980s, and most Indian scholars seek to settle abroad for better opportunities. Major push factors include a lack of research facilities, low ease of doing business, and fewer opportunities due to a lack of skills and innovation. 

Studies have found that, since 2014, 23,000 millionaires and, since 2019, nearly 7,000 millionaires (2% of India&#x27;s High-net-worth individuals at the time) have emigrated from India.

=====Nepal=====

Every year, 250,000 youths are reported to leave Nepal for various reasons. They seek opportunity in its various manifestations—higher living standards, employment, better income, education, an alluring western lifestyle, stability and security. This number is expected to rise as a result of a devastating earthquake on 25 April 2015.

Pakistan

According to the Pakistan Economic Survey for 2023-24, over 13.53 million Pakistanis have officially emigrated to over 50 countries for work by April 2024. 

=====Sri Lanka=====
Sri Lanka has lost a significant portion of its intellectuals, mainly due to civil war and the resulting uncertainty that prevailed in the country for the thirty-year period prior to the end of the conflict in 2009. Most of these sought refuge in countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada and Great Britain. In recent years, many expatriates have indicated interest in returning to Sri Lanka, but have been deterred by slow economic growth and political instability. Both the government and private organizations are making efforts to encourage professionals to return to Sri Lanka and to retain resident intellectuals and professionals.

==== China ====
With rapid GDP growth and a higher degree of openness towards the rest of the world, there has been an upsurge in Chinese emigration to Western countries—particularly the United States, Canada and Australia. As of 2013, 4% of the world&#x27;s migrants came from China. According to the official Chinese media, in 2009, 65,000 Chinese secured immigration or permanent resident status in the United States, 25,000 in Canada and 15,000 in Australia. The largest group of emigrants consists of professionals and experts with a middle-class background, raising concerns about a &quot;brain drain&quot; of the people who contribute most to the development of China. According to a 2007 study, seven out of every ten students from China who enroll in an overseas university never return to live in their homeland.

===Australasia===
====Pacific Islands====
The post-WWII migration trends in the Pacific Islands have essentially followed this pattern:
* Most Pacific island nations that were formerly under UK mandate have had migration outflows to Australia and New Zealand since the decolonisation of the region from the 1960s to the 1990s. There has only been a limited outflow from these islands to Canada and the UK since decolonisation. Fiji, Tonga and Samoa also have had large outflows to the United States.
* Most Pacific islands administered by France (like Tahiti) have had an outflow to France.
* Most Pacific islands under some kind of US administration have had outflows to the US and, to a lesser extent, Canada.

====New Zealand====
During the 1990s, 30,000 New Zealanders were emigrating each year. An OECD report released in 2005 revealed that 24.2% of New Zealanders with a tertiary education were living outside of New Zealand, predominantly in Australia. In 2007, around 24,000 New Zealanders settled in Australia.

During the 2008 election campaign, the National Party campaigned on the ruling Labour Party&#x27;s inability to keep New Zealanders at home, with a series of billboards announcing &quot;Wave goodbye to higher taxes, not your loved ones&quot;. However, four years after the National Party won that election, the exodus to Australia had intensified, surpassing 53,000 per annum in 2012. Prime Minister John Key blamed the 2007–2008 financial crisis for the continuing drain.

It was estimated in December 2012 that 170,000 New Zealanders had left for Australia since the Key government came to power in late 2008. However, this net migration was reversed soon after, with a net migration gain of 1,933 people achieved in 2016. Economist Paul Bloxham described New Zealand&#x27;s strong economy, with a housing and construction boom at the time. Australia&#x27;s weaker economy and reduced investment in mining industries during this time were also mentioned as key factors.

New Zealand enjoys immigration of qualified foreigners, potentially leaving a net gain of skills. Nevertheless, one reason for New Zealand&#x27;s attempt to target immigration at 1% of its population per year is because of its high rate of emigration, which leaves its migration balance either neutral or slightly positive.

===North America===
====Canada====
Colonial administrators in Canada observed the trend of human capital flight to the United States as early as the 1860s, when it was already clear that a majority of immigrants arriving at Quebec City were en route to destinations in the United States. Alexander C. Buchanan, government agent at Quebec, argued that prospective emigrants should be offered free land to remain in Canada. The issue of attracting and keeping the right immigrants has sometimes been central to Canada&#x27;s immigration history.

In the 1920s, over 20% of university graduating classes in engineering and science were emigrating to the United States. When governments displayed no interest, concerned industrialists formed the Technical Service Council in 1927 to combat the brain drain. As a practical means of doing so, the council operated a placement service that was free to graduates.

By 1976, the council had placed over 16,000 men and women. Between 1960 and 1979 over 17,000 engineers and scientists emigrated to the United States. However, the exodus of technically trained Canadians dropped from 27% of graduating classes in 1927 to under 10% in 1951 and 5% in 1967.

In Canada today, the idea of a brain drain to the United States is occasionally a domestic political issue. At times, brain drain is used as a justification for income tax cuts. During the 1990s, some alleged a brain drain from Canada to the United States, especially in the software, aerospace, health care and entertainment industries, due to the perception of higher wages and lower income taxes in the US. Some also suggest that engineers and scientists were also attracted by the greater diversity of jobs and a perceived lack of research funding in Canada.

The evidence suggests that, in the 1990s, Canada did lose some of its homegrown talent to the US. Nevertheless, Canada hedged against these losses by attracting more highly skilled workers from abroad. This allowed the country to realize a net brain gain as more professionals entered Canada than left. Sometimes, the qualifications of these migrants are given no recognition in Canada (see credentialism), resulting in some—though not all—highly skilled professionals being forced into lower paying service sector jobs.

In the mid-2000s, Canada&#x27;s resilient economy, strong domestic market, high standard of living, and considerable wage growth across a number of sectors, effectively ended the brain drain debate. Canada&#x27;s economic success even prompted some top US talent to migrate north. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that stringent US security measures put in place after the 9/11 attacks have helped to temper the brain drain debate in Canada.

====Caribbean====
Many of the Caribbean Islands endure a constant and substantial emigration of qualified workers. Approximately 30% of the labour forces of many islands have left, and more than 80% of college graduates from Suriname, Haiti, Grenada and Guyana have emigrated, mostly to the United States. Over 80% of Jamaicans with higher education live abroad. However, it is noted that these nationals pay valuable remittances. In Jamaica, the money sent back amounts to 18% of GNP.

====United States====
The 2000 United States Census led to a special report on domestic worker migration, with a focus on the movement of young, single, college-educated migrants. The data show a trend of such people moving away from the Rust Belt and northern Great Plains region towards the West Coast, Southwestern and Southeast United States. The largest net influx of young, single, college-educated persons was to the San Francisco Bay Area.

Many predominantly rural communities in the Appalachia region of the United States have experienced a &quot;brain drain&quot; of young college students migrating to urban areas in and outside of Appalachia for employment, political reasons and opportunities offered in urban areas that rural communities are currently unable to.

The country as a whole does not experience large-scale human capital flight as compared with other countries, with an emigration rate of only 0.7 per 1,000 educated people, but it is often the destination of skilled workers migrating from elsewhere in the world.

Regarding foreign scholars earning their degrees in the United States and returning to their home country, Danielle Guichard-Ashbrook of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been quoted as stating &quot;We educate them, but then we don&#x27;t make it easy for them to stay&quot;.

===South America===
====Colombia====
In recent years, many people from younger generations (people born from 1994 onwards) have migrated out of Colombia. Many of them are looking for better employment opportunities elsewhere due to the political turmoil that has been going on in the past decades. In many cases, the flight of educated people from Colombia does not occur, due to a lack of economic resources from the people and no governmental support in any extracurricular endeavors (sports or liberal arts). Even though, Colombia has recently implemented programs to benefit people that have higher scores in the ICFES (a national exam mandated for every high-schooler in the country before graduation), such as the ICETEX (Instituto Colombiano de Crédito Educativo y Estudios Técnicos en el Exterior) scholarships; many people who score highly on these mandate exams end up migrating to other countries for higher education. Some may argue, including those who have scored highly in the ICFES, that they are taking the place of someone less fortunate who deserves, wants and will use an ICETEX scholarship.

====Cuba====
In 1997, Cuban officials claimed that 31,000 Cuban doctors were deployed in 61 countries. A large number practice in South America. In 2007, it was reported that 20,000 were employed in Venezuela in exchange for nearly of oil per day.

However, in Venezuela and Bolivia, where another 1,700 doctors work, it is stated that as many as 500 doctors may have fled the missions in the years preceding 2007 into countries nearby. This number increased dramatically, with 1,289 visas being given to Cuban medical professionals in the United States alone in 2014, with the majority of Cuban medical personnel fleeing from Venezuela due to poor social conditions and not receiving adequate payment; the Cuban government allegedly receives the majority of payments while some doctors are left with about $100 per month in earnings.

====Venezuela====

Following the election of Hugo Chávez as president and his establishment of the Bolivarian Revolution, millions people emigrated from Venezuela. In 2009, it was estimated that more than 1 million Venezuelans emigrated since Hugo Chávez became president. It has been calculated that from 1998 to 2013, over 1.5 million Venezuelans, between 4% and 6% of the Venezuela&#x27;s total population, left the country following the Bolivarian Revolution. Academics and business leaders have stated that emigration from Venezuela increased significantly during the last years of Chávez&#x27;s presidency and especially during the presidency of Nicolás Maduro.

An analysis of a study by the Central University of Venezuela titled &quot;Venezuelan Community Abroad. A New Method of Exile&quot; states that the Venezuelan refugee crisis was caused by the &quot;deterioration of both the economy and the social fabric, rampant crime, uncertainty and lack of hope for a change in leadership in the near future&quot;. The study states that of the more than 1.5 million Venezuelans who had left the country following the Bolivarian Revolution, more than 90% of those who left were college graduates, with 40% holding a master&#x27;s degree and 12% having a doctorate or post doctorate. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that many &quot;white-collar Venezuelans have fled the country&#x27;s high crime rates, soaring inflation and expanding statist controls&quot;. Reasons for leaving cited by the former Venezuelan citizens studied included lack of freedom, high levels of insecurity and lack of opportunity in the country. Some Venezuelan parents have encouraged their children to leave the country.

2019 Venezuelan blackouts, which affected more than 30 million people nationwide and occurred intermittently over several months, sometimes lasting for days at a time, exacerbating the ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis, have been attributed by experts and the state-owned power company Corpoelec to a lack of maintenance and technical expertise in the country as a result of a brain drain.
